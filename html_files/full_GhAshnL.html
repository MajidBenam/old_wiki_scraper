</p><p><b> ♠ Peak Date  ♣ 1800-1824 CE ♥ </b> 'Between Osei Tutu and Osei Bonsu (1800-1824) the Asante conquered or otherwise brought into subjection to the Asantehene (King of Asante), nearly all the peoples now inhabiting all the regions of modern Ghana and also east-central and south-western Ivory Coast (Rattray, 1923: 287-293; Priestley and Wilks, 1960; Fynn, 1971: 105, 155; Meredith, 1812; Wilks, 1975; 43-79).' <sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> 'Looking back they recall how, until the last quarter of the nineteenth century, they controlled an ever-increasing area which at its peak stretched over 550 km into the interior and encompassed many distinctive groups and regions. Asante armies were powerful and well-organised, equipped with imported firearms scarcely available to poorer and more isolated northern groups.' <sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> Within this general trend of military conquest and domination, the peak period was likely the early 19th century, characterized by military successes against the British: 'One major reason for this increase in British influence came as a result of Asante expansion toward the coast. For the Asante this was vitally necessary to ensure a ready supply of European firearms to maintain their hold over their outlying provinces. [...] In 1806 the Asante, under their dynamic leader, Asantehene Osei Bonsu, defeated the Fante and besieged the British fort at Anomabu. In 1811, 1814, and 1816 the Asante again invaded the Fante area and finally established domination over the coast. [...] A dispute over jurisdiction eventually led to war, but Macarthy's forces proved no match for the Asantes. In 1824, at the battle of Nsamankow, they were ambushed and the governor and seven of his officers were killed. At this point the Asante empire was at the height of its power.' <sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

<p><b> ♠ Duration  ♣ 1701-1895 CE ♥ </b> This period begins in 1701 CE when 'the Asantemanso under the leadership of Osei Tutu (d. 1717) rebelled and defeated the Denkyira'<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>. This period ends in 1895 CE, 'the last year in which the Union was intact before defeat by the British, exile of the King, and conquest.'<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ confederated state ♥ </b> The Union founded after Osei Tutu's military victory against the Denkyira incorporated a set of allied sub-polities under the overall authority of the Asantehene based at Kumasi: 'In the aftermath of the Denkyira war the military coalition of states was transformed into a political union.' <sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> For Hayford, this union was essentially a confederation of several 'imperia in imperio' under the paramount authority of the Asantehene: 'The Native State, in its highest development, is to be found where a number of considerably important communities combine and own allegiance to one central paramount Authority. Such Authority is the King, properly so called. Thus in Ashanti, before the breaking up of the Court at Kumasi, there were the Manpons, the Juabins, the Kokofus, the Beckwas, the Adansis, and several other large and important communities, owning allegiance to the stool of Kumasi as the paramount stool of all Ashanti. Each of these important communities, when regarded with respect to the entire State, was a sort of imperium in imperio-in fact, several distinct native states federated together under the same laws, the same customs, the same faith and worship, the people speaking the same language, and all owning allegiance to a paramount king or president, who represented the sovereignty of the entire Union.' <sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> For Arhin, the 'official', confederated character of the Ashanti Union was being increasingly eroded during the time period in question, with the Asantehene seeking to concentrate power in Kumasi: 'Formally the Asante lived within a system of decentralized ‘patrimonialism’: that is to say, under the authority of hereditary rulers selected by the heads of the constituent units of the  oman, the localized matrilineages, the villages and the districts who were, in the main, a gerontocratic body. The members of the various units also enjoyed rights of use in land. But the political history of Asante, from the beginning of the eighteenth century to the eve of colonial rule, was the history of the erosion of these political and economic rights. It was a history of the increasing personalization of power at the expense of the holders of hereditary authority and also of commoners.' <sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> British colonial incursions subsequently upset the indigenous power structure and weakened Kumasi by imposing their own administration on the native system, including a court of 'appeals in the hands of a British administrative officer' <sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>, and by backing indigenous resistance against the King. Wilks describes a dynamic struggle between competing interests:  'The Kumaseman sought to build up its power to ensure not only its de jure but also its de facto preeminence within the Asanteman. It moved slowly but surely towards a form of absolutism. The  aman resisted the engrossment of power by Kumase and strove to maintain a “parcellization” of sovereignty of the sort also characteristic of feudalism.' <sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> This supports the characterization of Asanteman as a confederated state despite of this process of centralization: 'It is arguable that the union, the Asanteman, has survived precisely because different (and even conflicting) concepts of its nature have always been possible. Did member states, for example, have a right to secede, or was the union indissoluble? In the early nineteenth century the Dwabenhene clearly believed that he did have the right, the Asantehene that he did not.' <sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none ♥ </b> 'Although ethnically and culturally closely related, the Akan have never had a common polity, and they may be roughly divided into the Brong, Akyem, Akuapim, Kwawu, Assen-Twifo, Wasa, Fante-Agona, Nzima-Evalue, Ahanta and Ashanti, each group speaking a distinct dialect.' <sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> 'Greater Asante' was a conglomerate made up of sub-polities paying allegiance to Kumasi and tributary states: 'First, there was the Kumasi state, administered like any other Asante state by the Asantehene and his council members. Second, Kumasi, together with the neighbouring Asante-Twi-speaking states, formed the Asante Union, with a council consisting of the Asantehene, some members of the Kumasi state council, and the heads of the other Asante states. Third, there were the “provinces,” consisting of the other Twi-speaking peoples north and south of Asante. Fourth, there were the non-Twi-speaking protectorate and tributary states southeast and north of the Twi-speaking peoples.' <sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> This structure did not depend on alliances with external forces. SCCS variable 84 'Higher Political Organization' is coded 'Absent', not 'Peace group', 'Alliances', 'Confederation', or 'International organization'.

<dl><dd><b> ♠ preceding (quasi)polity  ♣ Akan - Pre-Ashanti ♥ </b> Asantemanso Kingdom 'The Portuguese first arrived in 1471 and later built a trading post at Elmina in 1486. Drawn by the trading activity on the coast, descendants of the defunct Bonda and Kumbu kingdoms settled along the north-south trade routes connecting the coast to the Niger bend region. The Queen mother of the Bonda founded the Akyerekyere kingdom along one trade route, which became a clearinghouse for goods from the coast. A prince of the former Kumbu royal house founded the Akumu-Akoto kingdom on another trade route. The Portuguese referred to this latter kingdom as the 'Acanes,' hence the name Akan. Emigrants from Akumu-Akoto founded a second city-state to the east, called Akwamu. Emigrants from Akwamu in turn founded the Asantemanso kingdom in the Kumasi region. Mande-speaking immigrants conquered the Akyerekyere kingdom and later the Asantemanso kingdom to become the dominant power in the region, the Denkyira. In 1701, the Asantemanso under the leadership of Osei Tutu (d. 1717) rebelled and defeated the Denkyira.'<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> 'He became the overall King (or Asantehene) of a group of allied towns or states centred around Kumase. According to Asante traditions he followed earlier rulers, the almost mythical twins Twum and Antwi, then Oti Akenten and Obiri Yeboa, his predecessor, slain in war. Traditions indicate that the kingdom's founders spread out from an early settlement in Adanse to settle at Kumase, near the earlier trading town of Tafo. They conquered groups already settled in the area and were joined by other bands of immigrants from earlier states to the south, attracted by the opportunities the new area offered. The new kingdom included the towns of Bekwae, Kokofu, Mampon, Nsuta, Dwaben and Edweso and was apparently organised on principles evolved in earlier, more southerly kingdoms like Denkyira and Akwamu. The founding  [...] states each had its ‘paramount chief’ or  Omanhene.' <sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b> ♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥ </b> 'The Asante wars had their origin in the seventeenth century in the course of attempts by Oti Akenten and Obiri Yeboah to establish the power of their segment of the Oyoko clan, based in Kokofu in Amansee, in the area now covered by Kumasi City. Obiri Yeboah died in war with the Dorma people, then located within four miles of Kumasi, and was succeeded by Osei Tutu (died 1717). Osei Tutu defeated the Dorma (Reindorf, 1895: 50; Fuller, 1968: 2) and led the Asante to conquer Denkyira (Bosman, 1705), their south-western neighbour and erstwhile overlords, in 1699-1708  [...] Between Osei Tutu and Osei Bonsu (1800-1824) the Asante conquered or otherwise brought into subjection to the Asantehene (King of Asante), nearly all the peoples now inhabiting all the regions of modern Ghana and also east-central and south-western Ivory Coast (Rattray, 1923: 287-293; Priestley and Wilks, 1960; Fynn, 1971: 105, 155; Meredith, 1812; Wilks, 1975; 43-79).' <sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b> ♠ succeeding (quasi)polity  ♣ British Empire Gold Coast Colony ♥ </b> 'By 1872 the British had complete control of the coast after taking over the Dutch and Danish forts. When they did not recognize Ashanti sovereignty in the area, the Ashanti invaded. In 1874, British forces launched a counteroffensive and sacked Kumasi. In 1883 a general uprising led to the overthrow of the Ashanti chi ef Mensu Bonsu and four years of civil war (1884-1888). A faction representing mercantile interests prevailed, although an Imperial faction regained power in the following decade. This led to another war with the British, who again attacked Kumasi in 1895 and captured the Ashanti king and chiefs. The king and chiefs were exiled and in 1901 the whole region was declared a British possession.' <sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b> ♠ Supracultural entity ♣ West Africa ♥ </b> 'The Asante, however, are only the most successful of a number of people in southern Ghana, with offshoots in the Ivory Coast, who are closely related and probably have a single origin. To the south are groups like the Fante, Akwamu and Akyem, speaking virtually identical tonal languages (sometimes called Twi, or Akan) of the Kwa family and with whom the Asante share many elements of culture. Among these groups, for example, there are traces of the great matrilineal clans [...] formerly recognised in Asante, the practice of naming children according to the day of birth (for example, Kofi, a Friday-born male; Abena, a Tuesday-born girl), and many closely similar religious ideas and rituals. Some of these groups also retain traditions of a move to the south from the open areas north of the forest.' <sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> Sarbah agrees with this view: 'The common origin of the inhabitants of the Fanti districts, Asanti, and wherever the Akan language is spoken, has been already shown. The Customary Laws of the inhabitants of these places are in the main identical, and the national constitutions resemble each other in many points, although Asanti military organization had been developed in a greater degree.' <sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> Hayford comments on cultural and linguistic similiarities between the Ashanti and Fante peoples: 'They speak the same language with only a difference of accent, such difference being a refinement upon whichever form of speech was the original type. It is probable the Ashanti type is the original, since it is reasonable to suppose that the coast tribes were detached from the Ashantis, and not  vice versa. There is no tradition showing that the Fantis were ever a distinct and separate people from the Ashantis. On the other hand, there is historical evidence that, at the dawn of European intercourse with the Gold Coast, the Ashanti Union fully recognised the existence and independence of the Fanti Union; and the current of immigration southwards from the north of tribes now dwelling between Ashanti proper and Fanti proper, all of whom have in common the same language with the Ashantis and Fantis, lends weight to this striking fact.' <sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> The scale of supracultural interaction was amplified with the intensification of colonial penetration: 'But in the mid-nineteenth century, and for the economic and political reasons outlined above, Asante society became much less confined, and much more permeable and accessible. I think that it would be missing the point to see this matter in the short term, and to interpret it from the viewpoint of - for example - formal conversion to Christianity or numbers of political or economic refugees. What, I think, is of paramount importance is that it was in this period that Asante became massively exposed to novel options, to different (and even contradictory) ways of looking at the world. These influences would take a long time to germinate and to bear fruit, but in retrospect we can see that this period represented a watershed in the understanding of values and beliefs. In cognitive terms - and we can see this prosopographically - the ‘generation’ of 1880 was further removed from that of 1830 than that ‘generation’ had been from any of its predecessors throughout Asante history (Wilks and McCaskie, 1973-79).' <sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> The Columbian Exchange and contact with European traders, missionaries, and colonizers had lasting effects on culture change in Southern Ghana and were probably more important than Asanteman's interactions with fellow Akan peoples.

<dl><dd>The gold-producing region between the Comoé and Volta rivers has been inhabited by Akan-speaking people since the 13th century CE. This region has seen the emergence of various autonomous states, including Bono, Djomo, Akwamu, Fante, and Asante. Later in its history, the founders of the Ga and Ewe states arrived from what is now Nigeria.<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup> In 1471, Portuguese sailors reached this stretch of coast and quickly established trade with the coastal Akan states, exchanging European goods for gold.<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup> Trade routes soon connected the coast to the Niger bend region, along which descendants of the former Bonda and Kumbu kingdoms founded the Akyerekyere and Akumu-Akoto kingdoms respectively. The Portuguese referred to this latter kingdom as the 'Acanes', which is the source of the name Akan.<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>In 1701, the Asante rebelled against the dominant Denkyira state and formed a confederacy of Akan states who accepted Asante rule. This confederacy began to conquer the surrounding polities, and by 1764 the Greater Asante controlled an area nearly the size of present-day Ghana.<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Europeans continued to be drawn to the Ghanaian coast in search of gold and, by the 19th century, the British were the strongest European power in the region. In 1827, British-led troops defeated an Asante army at Katammanso.<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup> In 1831, the British and Asante signed a peace treaty that allowed trade in all ports, and by 1844 the British gained control over criminal matters in the areas around trade forts. By 1872, the British had complete control of the coast, and when they did not recognize Asante sovereignty, the Asante attacked. The British were victorious, and after another war in 1895, the Asante king and chiefs were exiled. The entire region was declared a British territory in 1901.<sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p><i>Population and political organization</i>
</p>
<dl><dd>During the pre-Asante period, each Akan state consisted of a single kingdom ruled by an <i>omanhene</i>, which literally translates to 'state-chief'.<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup> This king came from a royal clan, and was elected by various officials, most notably the <i>ohemmaa</i> ('queen-mother'), who was a senior woman of the clan. The king was a sacred person who could not be observed eating or drinking; nor could he be heard to speak or be spoken to.<sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>After 1701, political organization within the region became far more bureaucratic and specialized. Kumasi became the capital of the union of Asante states and the seat of the empire. Appointed officials began to replace those wielding hereditary authority, and a treasury partly operated by literate Muslims was created.<sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup> However, while bureaucrats ran many of the day-to-day operations of the empire, the authority of the king was still absolute.<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Population estimates are not available for the pre-Asante period. The population of the entire Asante union in 1874 is estimated at three million people.<sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<p><b> ♠ Polity territory ♣ 259,000: 1874 CE ♥ </b> in squared kilometers Obeng claims this for the whole of the Ashanti Union at the time <sup id="cite_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup>, which covered most of present-day Ghana and some neighbouring regions: 'At the height of its power the Asanteman, the Asante nation, dominated an area much the size of present-day Ghana, and the frontiers of the old kingdom approximated those of the modern republic. This is the area that, following Kwame Arhin, we have come to know as “Greater Asante” rather than “the Asante Empire.” [...] The Asante lacked cartographic skills, and Greater Asante had, therefore, to be “mentally mapped.” In 1817, T. E. Bowdich was the first to make a serious attempt to represent the extent of Greater Asante on paper and to locate what he called the “boundary of Ashantee authority.” In doing so, he drew heavily upon Asante perceptions of space.' <sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup>  Wilks' informants measured distance in travel time rather than geographical figures: 'Kumase, the capital, was the central point from which the great roads of Asante, the  nkwantεmpon, radiated out. The day's journey, the  kwansin, was the basic unit in terms of which distance from the capital was measured.' <sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup> But McLeod provides an approximation: 'Looking back they recall how, until the last quarter of the nineteenth century, they controlled an ever-increasing area which at its peak stretched over 550 km into the interior and encompassed many distinctive groups and regions. Asante armies were powerful and well-organised, equipped with imported firearms scarcely available to poorer and more isolated northern groups.' <sup id="cite_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup> The Republic of Ghana today covers an area of almost 240,000 squared kilometers, the coastline being around 540km long. We can therefore accept Obeng's claim as a reasonable approximation.
</p><p><b> ♠ Polity Population ♣ 3,000,000: 1874 CE  ♥ </b> People. This number refers to the whole of the Ashanti Union and is also taken from Obeng's work <sup id="cite_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup>.

These formed a substantial clientele for the subsistence markets and sources of external cultural influences that, in addition to courtly traditions, patterned Kumasi culture differently from that of the rural areas.' <sup id="cite_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup> The 70,000-100,000 slot is a highly unlikely estimate for the time period covered here, given that numbers around 10,000 or 20,000 appear more frequently in the literature. We have therefore chosen to go with the above.
</p><p><b>♠ Largest communication distance ♣ 370 ♥</b> in kilometers. According to Wilks, Kong was the divisional capital furthest from Kumasi. While the estimates given by Bowdich's and Huydecoper's informants vary, given their calculation of distance in travel time, Wilks provides geographical measurements as well: 'The former Gonja divisional capital of Kong lay in the extreme north-west of Greater Asante. No great-road passed through it or led to it. It was in fact about 230 miles from Kumase, though the Asante would have thought of it as twenty days or so distant. They appear, compounding cultural and geographical distance, to have regarded it as  the back of beyond, the  ultima Thule  of their dominions. Asantehene Osei Tutu Kwame was well known for his courtesy, manifest in his command of flattery. At one of his meetings with Bowdich in 1817, he praised his guest's country. ‘I well see,’ he commented, ‘that you [the British] are much superior to the Asante in industry and the arts.’ Kong came immediately to the Asantehene's mind. ‘But there exists here, in the interior,’ he continued, ‘a people, those of Kong, who are as little civilized to us as we are relative to you.’ The previous year Huydecoper had made inquiries about the extent of Asante. Of all the distant frontier places to which reference might have been made, his informants seem naturally to have chosen Kong. Surprisingly, however, Huydecoper was told that it lay only sixty to eighty hours - or six to eight days - distant from Kumase. His informants thus reduced the distance of Kong from the capital by about two-thirds. On the face of it, this was to understate the extent of Greater Asante in a context in which it might well have been exaggerated, to emphasize the greatness of the nation. Conversely, however, it may also be seen as exaggerating the political reach of the central government by treating Kong - the paradigm of remoteness - as being as securely under Asante authority as places two-thirds less distant. To appreciate the paradox involved is to begin to understand the intricate relationship in Asante thought between distance and authority as measured by time.' <sup id="cite_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup>

<p><b> ♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣ 4 ♥ </b> levels. According to Ethnographic Atlas variable 31 'Mean Size of Local Communities', the Ashanti possess 'Towns of 5,000-50,000 (one or more)', meaning that they are likely to have a settlement hierarchy as follows: (1) Town (administrative buildings, storehouse)) (2) Village (shrine) (3) Hamlet (residential only). This remains to be confirmed. SCCS variable 157 'Scale 9-Political Integration' is coded as '3 levels above community'
</p><p>(1) the Capital with its central administrative and political functions;
(2) regional Towns housing the leaders of divisions of the Ashanti Union;
(3) Villages integrated into the recognized regional power hierarchies, comprising multiple family farms;
(4) residential Hamlets and other non-permanent micro-settlements
</p><p>A reviewer of Arhin's work comments on some general features of the territorial hierarchy: 'the Asante people formed a typical African kingdom, headed by a paramount ruler called “king” who, from his central village or town, administered the community in groups of villages with their own administrative and political organizations that owed absolute allegiance to the king, sometimes miles away. In every such African kingdom there was a princely city, special in every sense-the home of the paramount ruler of the state, the centre of government, and the residence of members of the royal family, religious leaders, courtiers, members of the extended-family system, servants, and slaves. Its economic, political, and cultural characteristics flowed down to the villages that made up the state [...] Every village consisted of free-born citizens, servants, and slaves. Individuals were like the fingers of a hand, all working together for the betterment of the village and, through the council of elders and the king's representative or chief, paying tribute to and serving their lord and master' <sup id="cite_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup> Arhin's own work confirms this: 'An Asante state consisted of divisions ( amansin), which in turn consisted of villages ( nkuro) and hamlets ( nkuraa). The hamlet was of no political significance, since, like the hunting lodge ( nnanso), it was a temporary settlement. The village, inhabited by members of localised matrilineages of three or more of the dispersed Akan matriclans ( mmusua) (Rattray 1929: 67), was headed by an individual called the owner of the village ( odekro).' <sup id="cite_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-57">[57]</a></sup> Villages can accordingly be differentiated from Hamlets by virtue of their integration into regional lineage structures: 'A village proper is distinguished from less permanent settlements as much by social complexity as by sheer size. Nearly all established villages are occupied by a number of distinct matrilineal groups, perhaps as many as five or six. [...] The establishment of a core of women in a village, who have children there, and whose daughters there give birth to other daughters who will continue the matrilineage, marks that settlement's existence as an independent and viable unit. Marriage, birth and death, as much as sheer numbers, mark the distinction between a well-established village and a settlement of less certain status.' <sup id="cite_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup> Hamlets could develop into more complex villages: 'an akuraa might, in favourable circumstances, develop into a village proper ( okrom), with its own name and chief or  odekuro and a clearly defined position in the kingdom's political and military framework. This change in status usually occurred gradually and only after the place became the primary residence of many of those using it.' <sup id="cite_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Administrative levels ♣ 6 ♥ </b> levels. According to the Ethnographic Atlas' variable 33 'Jurisdictional Hierarchy Beyond Local Community' there are 'Two levels (e.g., larger chiefdoms) (.2)' of administrative control-Chiefs and Elders.  SCCS variable 76 'Community Leadership' is coded as 'Single local leader and council' SCCS variable 237 'Jurisdictional Hierarchy Beyond Local Community' is coded as 'Two levels (e.g., larger chiefdoms)'
</p><p>Central authority rests with the King, but the role of sub-chiefs who complement the hierarchy have developed over time. <sup id="cite_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-60">[60]</a></sup>
</p><p>(1) King (Asantehene), the chief executive of the polity and occupant of the Golden Stool;
(2) Queen Mother (Asantehema), a mother's sister, grandmother, cousin or sister of the King and occupant of the Silver Stool, a Council of                     Elders from major lineages, and major officials of the capital, all of whom the Asantehene consulted with;
(3) chief executives of core provinces of the Ashanti Union (Omanhene);
(4) a corresponding structure of Ohema and a Council of Elders;
(5) Chiefs of lineages;
(6) councils of village leaders (mpanyinfo, odekro, obaapanyin)
</p><p>Arhin describes the power hierarchy from the village upwards: 'Female stools complemented the hierarchy of male stools. In the village the elders, mpanyinfo, heads of the matrilineages, who constituted with the odekro the village council, had their aberewa or obaapanyin, who looked after the women's affairs. The odekro had an obaapanyin who was responsible for the affairs of the women of the village and was a member of the village council; the ohene, head of a division, and the omanhene, head of the autonomous political community, had their female counterparts known as ohemma, female ruler, who sat on their councils. The ohene and the ohemma were all of the same mogya, blood, or clan. The Asantehemma, the occupant of the female stool of the Kumasi state, and therefore of united Asante, since her male counterpart was ex officio the Asantehene, king of Asante, was a member of the Kotoko council, the executive committee or cabinet of the Asanteman Nhyiamu, general assembly of Asante rulers.' <sup id="cite_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-61">[61]</a></sup> Major and minor chiefs were also summoned to council: 'Where the paramount King of a state summons the Head-Chiefs of provinces and chiefs of minor communities to attend a State Council, it is the privilege of the Councillors of the several communities composing the State, according to their rank and importance, to accompany their several Heads to the capital and to join in the “palaver,” or discussion, that will take place, the King in person presiding over the deliberations, supported by his own Councillors and principal Linguists. This is the full Parliament of the people, who are thus fully and duly represented in every way from the highest to the lowest. The commands which go forth from this assembly are binding upon every individual family of the entire State, from the most important province to the most insignificant hamlet, and the sanction operates equally upon all.' <sup id="cite_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-62">[62]</a></sup> The paramount executive authority was the Asantehene: 'The King is the Chief Executive Officer of the State, but not the Executive Council of the State. Such a council exists, and any acts done by the King without its concurrence are liable to be set aside.' <sup id="cite_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-63">[63]</a></sup> The attribution of concrete entities to a particular executive level is not always clear, though, especially in the early period: 'The state of the union that emerged after the War of Independence was obviously a very fluid one. The Asanteman is referred to as the  Asante Aman Nnum, the Five Asante States, but there is no clear consensus about which states comprised the original union. [...] The fact of the matter seems to have been that the coalition against the Denkyira included what were no more than “estates” on the one hand, like Bekwae, and what were established states on the other, like Mampon, Dwaben, and Kumase itself. Some were to decline and some were to prosper; some were to become powerful components of the Asanteman and some were to become little more than their clients.' <sup id="cite_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-64">[64]</a></sup> On the executive level it therefore seems best to go with the stool system: 'Every Asante village was a microcosm of the Asante economic, social, and political universe. Its population included both rulers and ruled, both “owners” of the land with the right of succession to the local, divisional, and state stools and free men grouped in other lineages with corporate interests in other political offices.' <sup id="cite_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup> Only a few leaders in executive positions achieved the additional special status of Abrempon or 'big man': 'However many sikafo aspired to the award of the elephant tail, relatively few seem to have achieved it. Three successful nineteenth century claimants are well documented, namely, Gyaasewahene Opoku Frefre (died 1826), Ankobeahene Kwaku Tawia (died ca. 1850), and Manwerehene Kwasi Brantuo (died 1865). [...] I know of no female recipient of the honor. I do not think that women were disbarred by reason of their sex, rather that few if any achieved the necessary level of accumulation. [...] Those chiefs who were allowed to use elephant tails were called Abrempons. A chief who lives on his own land with his own subjects is known by the King as Abrempon.' <sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup> The initiation required involved presentations of wealth as well as ritualized ceremonial. The Abrempon are excluded from the list above on the grounds of their precise position in the power hierarchy not being spelled out by the relevant sources.
</p><p><b> ♠ Religious levels ♣ 4 ♥ </b> levels.
</p><p>(1) head-priests involved in the organized ceremonial of the state and its ruler;
(2) priests serving major deities and chiefs;
(3) priests serving minor deities and chiefs;
(4) priests and healers associated with the commoner population and village shrines
</p><p>From the information gathered so far, we infer that organized religion shared some basic structural principles with the territorial and military organization. Some particularly powerful priests worked with the Asantehene himself, in organized ceremonial and military campaigns: 'Before a war senior servants of the Asantehene visited the shrines of major gods with gifts, to ask for guidance and support, and to promise rewards for success. They may also, of course, have received knowledge obtained by the webs of communication centred on the shrine. After successful campaigns, gods were rewarded with land and captives, large umbrellas and asipim chairs, and their priests given gold or silver crescent-shaped pendants to wear. Some priests and gods accompanied the armies, or missions, as in the case of the three priests in the retinue of General Akyeampon when he returned to the capital after negotiating in the south in the early 1870s.' <sup id="cite_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup> The practice was projected back to the times of Osei Tutu, but this may have had ideological reasons <sup id="cite_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-68">[68]</a></sup>. Major gods and their shrines produced offshoots in the form of minor deities and temples, both with their respective religious specialists: 'The god Tano has long enjoyed a particularly high place in the Asante pantheon. Thus in 1817 Bowdich remarked that “the present favourite fetish of Ashantee is that of the river Tando.” Such a god was divisible. Water and sediment might be transferred from the river to other locations and, provided this was done with all due ritual and honors, access to the god might be gained at them. Such local offshoots, the atano, were regarded as “children” of Tano and given a second name to distinguish each from the other, thus Taa (or Tano) Odomankoma, Taa Kora, Taa Bobodwo, Taa Kwadwo, Taa Yawo, Taa Mensa, and Taa Dwemo, to name but a few. An atano resided in a shrine, commonly a brass pan, which was housed in an abosomfie or temple protected and maintained by a custodian or bosomwura. Depending upon its prestige and wealth, the atano was served by a greater or lesser number of priests and priestesses - akomfo - who had been possessed by the god, and by such other attendants - atanokwaa - as cooks, musicians, umbrella carriers, and the like. Indeed, the temple of a powerful atano might, in terms of its personnel, closely resemble the court of a chief.' <sup id="cite_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-69">[69]</a></sup> Priests also participated in the organized ceremonial relevant to chiefs: 'Eto (mashed yams) are cooked once a year by the priests, and upon the day appointed (a Saturday) the chief will place a spoonful in the pan upon top of the forked branch, with the words: ‘Me Nyankopon me sere wo nkwa, na me sere wo ahooden’ (My God, I pray you for life and I pray you for strength). A sheep is also killed and the blood allowed to fall upon the ground [...].' <sup id="cite_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-70">[70]</a></sup> The smallest shrines were associated with the village-level: 'Temples of gods ( bosom'dan, bosom'fie) were also often situated towards the edges of the village, although some were built well away from human habitation, usually on the banks of rivers or streams (from which gods were thought to come). In their simplest form the temples were small rectangular buildings, entered by steps, the outer surfaces decorated with low reliefs and covered with red and white clay. More usually they consisted of a number of units around a court. Here male priests would periodically carry the god's shrine on their heads, becoming possessed and showing their powers to see, say and do things beyond the abilities of ordinary mortals.' <sup id="cite_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup>  Those priests 'combine with their office the cure of disease. Some of them are very good doctors and pull through cases where European skill has failed. They are skilled in the use of herbal remedies, and it might repay European medical men to study native therapeutics in its application to the treatment of diseases peculiar to the Gold Coast.' <sup id="cite_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-72">[72]</a></sup>

</p><p>'The King is the Chief Military Officer of his forces. In time of war, he directs the operations; and if he  is a man of capacity, he has the leading place in the councils of war.

The  Ntam dates from the time of Osei Tutu. When Osei Tutu returned from his travels to succeed to the stool, his uncle Obiri Yeboa had just died. He felt he had to offer a sacrifice to his dead uncle to show his affection. He therefore chose his trusted friend Baafour Amankwatia, Chief of Bantama. Amankwatia had already been besmeared with redclay ready to be executed. Okomfo Anokye would not allow him to be killed and ordered his release. This occasion on which he nearly lost his life became a very serious event for the  Bantamahene. It thus became his  Ntam. Amankwatia lived to become one of Osei Tutu's greatest generals and won many wars for Asante.' <sup id="cite_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-74">[74]</a></sup> The head executives were assisted by a cadre of commanders and generals, who carried ceremonial swords as a sign of their special status and commanded particular armies and campaigns: 'A second class of sword, domfena, was carried by generals: ‘… a general is appointed to the command of an army, by receiving a gold-handled sword of the King's from his hand [...] The captains used these to swear before the King' <sup id="cite_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-75">[75]</a></sup> There was a nucleus of armed professionals based in the capital: 'The local government of Kumasi was in the hands of the Kwaintsirs, a body of men who were the keepers of the golden stool. They formed the Department of War, and the great General Amankwatsia was formerly their Chief. The fact that the Department of War held in its keeping the royal stool illustrates vividly the origin of the kingly office in the Native State, which will be explained later on.' <sup id="cite_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-76">[76]</a></sup> Most of the time, political and military hierarchies coincided, with leaders fulfilling a dual role: 'It has already been noted that among the Akan the military organisation was given in the political organisation. Political status determined military status. The commanders of the Asante army and its subdivisions were first elected as heads of territorial divisions or appointed as heads of palace associations and then assumed corresponding military positions: European visitors to the Akan states in the nineteenth century referred to the heads of the subdivisions as ‘captains’.' <sup id="cite_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-77">[77]</a></sup> Finally, major and minor chiefs commanded their communities of citizen-soldiers in battle:'A chief is generally a captain of a company. In fact, every male member of the community is liable to military service in time of war, and during peace he has to drill every year with his company.  A fortiori, a chief is the natural leader of the men of his company. There are cases known, however, where civil chiefs hold no military command in their companies.' <sup id="cite_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-78">[78]</a></sup>

Among these were settlements in the Kumase district such as Bonwire (cloth weaving), Ntonso (cloth dyeing), Pankrono (pottery), Ahwia (woodworking), and Breman and Adum (metalworking). Blacksmithery and joinery which catered to the needs of cultivators were scattered throughout the kingdom (Bowdich 1819, Dupuis 1824, Freeman 1967 [1898]). The crafts concerned with the elaboration of regalia were located in the immediate neighbourhood of the state capitals and the imperial capital of Kumasi (Rattray 1927: 216-308; Arhin 1982). Craft practitioners owned their own tools, and the factors that conditioned production were agricultural demand and state requirements.' <sup id="cite_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-80">[80]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Professional military officers ♣ present ♥ </b> Full-time specialists While the Ashanti infantry mostly consisted of citizen-soldiers who were not specialists in their own right, there was also a nucleus of armed professionals not disbanded during times of peace: 'The local government of Kumasi was in the hands of the Kwaintsirs, a body of men who were the keepers of the golden stool. They formed the Department of War, and the great General Amankwatsia was formerly their Chief. The fact that the Department of War held in its keeping the royal stool illustrates vividly the origin of the kingly office in the Native State, which will be explained later on.' <sup id="cite_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-81">[81]</a></sup> The King was assisted in his military duties by secondary commanders and generals:'The King is the Chief Military Officer of his forces. In time of war, he directs the operations; and if he  is a man of capacity, he has the leading place in the councils of war. There is generally a Tufu Hin, or Captain-General, of the forces; but his authority is subordinate to that of the King, and he is, in every essential, an officer of the King.' <sup id="cite_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-82">[82]</a></sup> During annual military drills, armed commoners gathered in the capital, where they paraded through the streets with specialists: 'Meanwhile the different regiments, under their several Head-Captains, and all commanded by the Captain-General, are preparing to go through their manoeuvres. To avoid disputes, the several regiments parade through the town one after the other, pouring forth thunderous volleys from their long flint Dane guns. After the parade each regiment presents to the King its flags and emblems, new and old, as an act of homage, which the King returns with suitable words. The several Head-Chiefs next renew their allegiance to the King; and, after more dancing and popular rejoicing, thè King retires to his “compound,” where his vassals subsequently take leave of him, each vassal receiving a suitable present.' <sup id="cite_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-83">[83]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Professional soldiers ♣ absent ♥ </b> Full-time specialists The Ashanti infantry mostly consisted of citizen-soldiers who were not specialists in their own right. There was also a nucleus of armed professionals not disbanded during times of peace, such as the standing body of the Ashanti Adontenhene: 'Bantama was, I am informed, chosen as the site of the royal mausoleum, and also of ‘the royal treasure-house of the ghosts’, because this place was the head-quarters of the Ashanti general and a standing body of about one thousand fighting-men. These served as a bodyguard of the skeletons and the treasure.' <sup id="cite_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-84">[84]</a></sup> Given the general outlook of the Ashanti military, these should be classified as officers (above) rather than soldiers. According to Mensa-Bonsu, there were no professional soldiers: 'The army had four ‘wings’ - the Van, Rear, Left and Right wings ( Adonten, Kyidom, Benkum and  Nifa respectively). Every chief in Asante was a member of one of these ‘wings’. The ‘wing’ was under its own head who was in charge of maintaining discipline. The army had a commander-in-chief ( Krontihene). To date, when the chiefs sit in council, each chief joins the ‘wing’ to which he traditionally belonged. The fact of frequent wars notwithstanding, there were no professional fighters. Each man had his own occupation but could be called upon to fight any day.' <sup id="cite_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-85">[85]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Professional priesthood ♣ present ♥ </b> Full-time specialists Priests occasionally left their homes and travelled to visit patients in other places, and formed a guild: 'When a priest is called in from a distance to attend a case, he will generally tell the friends of the patient much about the family history, and indicate that a deceased relative is troubling the patient for some act of disobedience. The deceased relative must accordingly be propitiated. How does he come to know the history of the family to which he is a stranger? There is a Guild of Priests in the country to which all Priests belong, whose members are absolutely faithful to one another.' <sup id="cite_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-86">[86]</a></sup> They received specialist training: 'A Priest's training begins early in his life. He is generally sent away to another district to a seminary, where he serves out his apprenticeship, which may cover a period of three years. During that time he learns the use of herbs and their application to the cure of disease, at which he becomes very proficient in the course of after practice.' <sup id="cite_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-87">[87]</a></sup> The period of initiation was concluded by a possession ritual and examination of sorts: 'After training, [he] was tested at a ritual attended by his teacher and all local priests. At this he was expected to become possessed, with the god's help to answer riddles or questions set by the other priests, and to divine successfully' <sup id="cite_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-88">[88]</a></sup> The long duration of apprenticeship, the existence of professional bodies and the involvement of priests in organized ceremonial indicate a degree of specialization. While the full-time status of lower-ranking local priests may be questionable, the head-priests employed in the centres of executive power should be defined as such.

<p><b> ♠ Full-time bureaucrats ♣ present ♥ </b> Full-time specialists The time period in question was characterized by a trend towards greater bureaucratization and functional specialization: 'State organisation became extremely complex in the Kumasi state because at the close of the 17th century it became the capital of the union of Asante states and, in the course of the following century, the seat of an empire which was roughly coterminous with the boundaries of modern Ghana and southeastern Ivory Coast (Wilks 1975: 374-86). The expansion of the state made necessary administrative reforms within Kumasi itself and for the maintenance of effective relations between the Asantehene, the head of the Asante Union and, by consent, also the head of the Kumasi state, and the heads of the conquered territories. The palace administration ( gyase) was expanded with appointive headships of innumerable functional units or palace associations ( afekuo, sing. fekuo) (Rattray 1929: 81-92; Wilks 1967: 214-28; Hagan 1971). The memberships of the palace associations, each of which had either military or nonmilitary functions, cut across the divisions, so that they formed checks on, and counterpoises to, the traditional power units. The heads of the most important of the palace associations, including the units assigned to the offspring of former and reigning Asantehene (Busia 1951: 95), were included in the state council. Since appointments to the headships of the palace associations were in the gift of the Asantehene, the administrative reform represented an intrusion of patrimonialism (Weber 1947: 347) into the traditional political organisation.' <sup id="cite_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-89">[89]</a></sup> The purpose of this new administrative structure was to 'enforce subordination of the conquered rulers to the Asantehene. For this purpose the Asante kings used an administrative staff recruited from their gyase, household organization, consisting of units of functionaries with appointive headships [...] These palace associations, called afekuo (Reondorf, 1895: 119; Rattray, 1929: 91), were recruited from free attendants, warcaptives, purchased slaves (nnonkofo), and other bondsmen; in other words, persons connected by “ties of personal loyalty” (Weber, 1947: 342) to the various Asante Kings.' <sup id="cite_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-90">[90]</a></sup> Senior public functionaries had a stool system of their own: 'In Kumasi proper there were seventy-seven stools, representing seventy-seven public functionaries, as, for example, the Bantuma Chief, or the Chief of the Royal Burial Grove, the Ateni Chief, or the Chief of the Lamplighters.' <sup id="cite_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-91">[91]</a></sup> Some foreigners were employed in highly specialized roles: 'A form of treasury partly staffed by literate Muslims was created. Groups within the capital began to build up expertise in particular areas of administration and to concentrate on this as a way to power and wealth. Careers began to open for those with intelligence, negotiating skill and a steady nerve.' <sup id="cite_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-92">[92]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Source of support ♣ state salary ♥ </b> Appointed officials and other dependents increasingly displaced the hereditary authority of 'traditional' public functionaries: 'From Opoku Ware (1720-50) to Kwaku Duah (1834-67), these personal dependants competed with, and replaced the holders of hereditary authority, occupants of royal stools ( adehye nnwa), in Kumasi and in the component states of the Asante Union in the exercise of authority and the collection of tribute and other payments in the conquered territories. Wilks (1967: 211-214) has called this administrative organization the “Kwadwoan revolution” on the ground that it took firm root in the reign of Osei Kwadwo (1864-77) although it began in that of Opoku Ware, and has identified it as the emergence of Asante “bureaucracy”.' <sup id="cite_ref-93" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-93">[93]</a></sup> The source of income for higher-level native officials and personal dependents employed in 'appointative headships' is unclear, and the sources reviewed are silent on this topic. But some foreigners were employed in highly specialized roles: 'A form of treasury partly staffed by literate Muslims was created. Groups within the capital began to build up expertise in particular areas of administration and to concentrate on this as a way to power and wealth. Careers began to open for those with intelligence, negotiating skill and a steady nerve.' <sup id="cite_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-94">[94]</a></sup> These highly specialized officials in clerical roles were likely compensated in the form of a state salary.
</p><p><b> ♠ Examination system ♣ absent ♥ </b> The sources on the administrative structure of Kumasi and Greater Ashante are silent on formal examinations. Some foreigners were employed in highly specialized roles: 'A form of treasury partly staffed by literate Muslims was created. Groups within the capital began to build up expertise in particular areas of administration and to concentrate on this as a way to power and wealth. Careers began to open for those with intelligence, negotiating skill and a steady nerve.' <sup id="cite_ref-95" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-95">[95]</a></sup> Given that their most important qualification seems to have been the command of foreign writing systems, they were probably not examined in a standardized manner by Ashanti superiors. Arhin's more conservative view of the emerging Ashanti administration (as compared to Wilks') seems to confirm this: 'But the household ( gyase) organization was bureaucratic only in the sense that the component units were assigned definite tasks around the King's person and at court. It was not a bureaucratic organization of the type associated with modern states, but patrimonialistic, an instrument of the extension of the King's personal authority.' (Yarak, 1983, 1984).' <sup id="cite_ref-96" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-96">[96]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Merit promotion ♣ suspected unknown ♥ </b> 'The vast area brought under Asante control by force or threat of arms could not be governed unless new methods of controlling it were developed. From the 1760s, beginning under Asantehene Osei Kwadwo, various steps were taken to bring the control of outlying areas directly under Kumase [...] Senior officeholders in Kumase were placed in charge of particular areas of the administration, controlling considerable numbers of lesser officials. Some supervised the trade in ivory and kola, while others oversaw the gold-producing regions which now fell within the borders of Asante. A form of treasury partly staffed by literate Muslims was created. Groups within the capital began to build up expertise in particular areas of administration and to concentrate on this as a way to power and wealth. Careers began to open for those with intelligence, negotiating skill and a steady nerve.' <sup id="cite_ref-97" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-97">[97]</a></sup> 'Significant changes in Asante administrative practice, in the direction of increasing specialization of role, were attributed to Asantehene Osei Kwadwo (1764-1777). The class of administrators was a growing one, but I do not think we should yet speak of an administrative class emerging, one reproducing itself as a class.' <sup id="cite_ref-98" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-98">[98]</a></sup> This indicates that professional merit and expertise were important factors in the emerging bureucracy, but the sources make no mention of standardized procedures for promotion based on performance. The personal opinions of the Asantehene and other superior officials about the expertise of their inferiors seems paramount.
</p><p><b> ♠ Specialized government buildings ♣ unknown ♥ </b> Most government activities at Kumasi were associated with the ruler's palace and other royal structures.<sup id="cite_ref-99" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-99">[99]</a></sup> The above-mentioned treasury was located there as well.<sup id="cite_ref-100" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-100">[100]</a></sup>. Specialised buildings for administration of the state that are within the grounds of a palace do count as government buildings. A room within the main palace residence would not.

<p><b> ♠ Communal buildings ♣ present ♥ </b> While small villages were largely made up of residential units, they also featured burial sites, small shrines or 'fetish-houses' and huts for menstruating women. Chiefly estates housed ceremonial regalia. Larger towns had markets and symbolic buildings. The estates of men with executive roles, such as the Asantehene's residence, doubled as gathering-places for relevant council meetings.
</p><p><b> ♠ Special purpose house ♣ present ♥ </b> Chiefs' houses doubled as storage sites for regalia needed in organized ceremonial: 'The various stages in this development of complex dwelling-units from simple huts can still be seen in many Asante villages. Some basic units were walled only on three sides to create an open room or ‘verandah’ ( pato, adampan), as white visitors sometimes called it. These open rooms were employed for several purposes: sleeping, sitting and talking, or, in chiefs' houses and temples, for the storage of drums, regalia and other items. Visitors had experience of all types of rooms and houses. Writing of Agogo in the early 1870s, Ramseyer and Kuhne noted: ‘The house in this place mostly consisted of only one room open in front, the entrance being formed by a few steps, being polished daily with an oily red earth. We were taken into a small yard surrounded by four of these apartments, each of them about 5 feet by 6, so that we barely found space to lie down in the one allotted to us.’ Dupuis, about fifty years earlier lodged in ‘one of the best houses the place contained. This was a small enclosure, with four thatched rooms’. He noted the mixture of house types at Amoafo: ‘… some of the houses are tolerably well constructed; but still the clay and bamboo hovels predominate, perhaps, here, in the proportion of 12 to 1 in the main street.’' <sup id="cite_ref-106" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-106">[106]</a></sup>

<dd><b> ♠ food storage sites ♣ inferred present ♥ </b> According to SCCS variable 20 'Food Storage' 'Individual households', not 'Communal facilities', 'Political agent controlled repositories', or 'Economic agent controlled repositories' were present. Writing about the pre-Ashanti period, Sarbah mentions urban storage facilities: 'On the 21st of February he sent one of his men with attendants to King Abaan, whose town was about four leagues up-country, where was stored a large quantity of corn and millet. This town is described to be as large as the London of that period. It was guarded every night, and to warn the watchmen, cords were stretched across the roads and paths leading to it. Attached to the cords were bells, which give the alarm. In addition to these cords, nets were hung over the few entrances, and were so contrived as to fall on any person endeavouring to steal into the town. Four hours after their arrival in the morning, these men were sent for by the king at nine o'clock, “for there may no man come to him before he be sent for,” nor was it customary in that country to offer their presents to the ruler until they had visited him thrice. On the last visit, after the king had accepted their presents, he drank palm-wine with them. The king, we are informed, used a cup of gold, and when he drank, the people cried all with one voice, “Abaan, Abaan,” with certain other words. “The king drinks; and when he had drunk, then they gave drink to every one, and that done, the king licensed them to depart; and every one that departeth from him boweth three times towards him, and waveth with both hands together, as they bow and do depart. The king hath commonly sitting by him eight or ten ancient men with grey beards.”' <sup id="cite_ref-108" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-108">[108]</a></sup> Sarbah also speaks of quasi-feudal arragements in some Akan polities prior to Ashanti rule: 'In the Fanti system allegiance is personal, but in the Asanti it is personal and territorial combined. ‡ The head ruler is not necessarily the owner of any land in his jurisdiction; e.g., Ohene Tchibu, of Asin Yankumasi, owns no land, and is a tenant of Abesibro, his captain; so also is Ohene Aka Ayima, of Beyin in Appolonia, by the [Page 25] judgment of Mr. Justice Nicoll, declared to own no land in his district-at least he did not lead evidence to show the land in question was his. In the case of Ohene Tchibu, the explanation is, that his ancestors fled to Fantiland for protection from the north side of the Pra in the kingdom of Asanti. The greater part of the Asinfu settled on lands within the jurisdiction of the head ruler of Abura, who became their feudal superior. * Many of the Asinfu continued to work on their lands across the river Pra, and held them. Among such is Akessi of Fumsu, until, by an order of the Executive Council of Gold Coast, an arbitrary boundary was fixed, and the possessions of the Asinfu, Denkerafu, and others, trans-Pra and trans-Ofin, were declared Asanti territory in the district of Adansi, and this in spite of the fact that Yamsu village, the stool of which was the subject of the case, Ghambra v. Ewea, † is situate on the Adansi side of the Ofin.' <sup id="cite_ref-109" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-109">[109]</a></sup> We have assumed this to be true of the Ashanti period as well, given the cultivation of plantations around towns housing rulers and other elites.</dd></dl>
<p><b> ♠ Symbolic buildings ♣ present ♥ </b> 'Periodically the King would venture from the sprawl of buildings which constituted the palace, perhaps to be carried in his palanquin to the mausoleum of his ancestors at Bantama, a couple of miles or so away, or to sit in state on one of a number of special platforms positioned through the city. There, surrounded by chiefs and court officials, he would ritually drink palm wine, greet visitors to the capital and hand out doles of gold-dust.'<sup id="cite_ref-110" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-110">[110]</a></sup> Some buildings erected for the Asantehene combined functions associated with royal display, public ceremonial, storage of state wealth, and reception of high-status guests: 'The Aban does not seem to have been used regularly as a royal residence; possibly it was too small to hold the hordes of attendant minor officials. It does not seem to have influenced political life in any major way except in so far as it demonstrated the King's power and willingness to innovate and to impress European missions which were received there. Freeman visited it in 1841 and noted thirty-one gold-handled swords and several gold-decorated calabashes displayed in one room, while in another room the King and some of his senior councillors were sitting, surrounded by various items of glass and other exotic valuables. One function of the place was as a treasure storehouse, and especially for those exotic items which were not absorbed into the established system of regalia or used for display.' <sup id="cite_ref-111" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-111">[111]</a></sup>

<dl><dd><b> ♠ Roads ♣ present ♥ </b> According to SCCS variable 14 'Routes of Land Transport' only 'unimproved trails' were used for land transport, not roads. 'A full history of the great-roads ( nkwantεmpon) of Asante has yet to be written. Rather more is known about the southern routes than the northern, since European merchants on the Gold Coast were keenly interested in the matter and made many relevant entries in their journals. Yarak has suggested that the roads from Kumase to Axim via Denkyera, Wasa and Aowin, and from Kumase to Elmina via Denkyera and Twifo, were already in use in the first decade of the eighteenth century. Security was a constant problem on both. L. F. Rømer, a Danish factor on the eastern Gold Coast in the 1730s and 1740s, commented on the matter. In the mid-1740s he thought it likely that, because of marauding, the Asante ‘will create another road to the western forts on the seacoast’. He was later to report that this happened. ‘They have got a road open,’ he wrote, ‘from their country to Elmine [Elmina], Cap Cors [Cape Coast], and the forts which lie west of Elmine.’ It may be that this was the great-road via Asen and the Fante country to Anomabo, whence it was a short journey along the beach to the headquarters of the British at Cape Coast and of the Dutch at Elmina. If so, the Dutch could have regarded it as no more than a temporary solution to their problem of communications with Kumase. In the 1750s the Asante and Dutch authorities were involved in intensive negotiations to improve security on the old westerly routes.' <sup id="cite_ref-112" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-112">[112]</a></sup></dd>

This allows local intermarriage and permits the local burial of the dead, for in most areas the task of digging the grave and performing essential parts of the funeral is done by people from a different lineage.

In 1898 the importance of slaves in the kola industry was such that Richard Austin Freeman predicted that ‘On the abolition of domestic slavery the kola industry in Ashanti will tend to die out’. Regarding gold mining, Dumett has noted, for the Akan states generally, that the family labour unit included some slaves. Indeed, we may assume that any commoner wishing to increase output beyond the capacity of the conjugal family workforce needed to use slaves or pawns.

The former was fixed - [unavailable]hyε - at a notional twenty days from Kumase.

Geometric weights outnumber representational ones by perhaps ten or fifteen to one. A few weights were made by adapting an existing object of roughly the right mass: beads, bits of European brass, or brass castings from groups near Asante, or seeds, especially those of the Abrus pecatorius bush ( damma). [...] The basic equipment was simple. The dust was weighed in a simple set of beam scales ( nsania). A weight ( abramo[unknown]) was placed in one pan and the gold-dust in the other, usually with a sheet-brass spoon ( saawa). Impurities in the gold could be removed by placing it in a sort of scoop ( famfa) and blowing across it.

Adinkra are used extensively in fabrics, pottery, logos and advertising. They are incorporated into walls and other architectural features. Fabric adinkra are often made by woodcut sign writing as well as screen printing. Adinkra symbols appear on some traditional akan gold weights. The symbols are also carved on stools for domestic and ritual use. [...] Akan oral tradition dates the arrival of adinkra among the Akan to the end of the 1818 Asante-Gyaman War. However, the Englishman Thomas Edward Bowdich collected a piece of adinkra cloth in 1817, which demonstrates that adinkra art existed before the traditional starting date.[2] Bowdich obtained this cotton cloth in Kumasi, a city in south-central Ghana. The patterns were printed using carved calabash stamps and a vegetable-based dye. The cloth features fifteen stamped symbols, including nsroma (stars), dono ntoasuo (double Dono drums), and diamonds.

In the Asante kingdom in Ghana, an elaborate material culture was developed which filled the social space with verbal texts: the finials on chiefs' ceremonia lumbrellas embodied proverbs; gold-weights -small brass figurines used to weigh gold dust in the extensive trading networks centered on the Asanta kingdom- were often designed to represent sayings or epithets relating to the owner; adinkra symbols, also evoking proverbs and other verbal formulations, were carved into wooden prestige objects and metal jewellery, and stamped on cloth. Across West Africa, cloth carried woven, dyed or appliquéd symbols that alluded to oral texts.

Tramma was the name derived from that sum, additional to the selling price, which was set aside and given to the witnesses of the transaction. It was a fixed proportional amount, and, at least for certain specified articles, seemed uniform, e.g. the tramma on the purchase of a cat-the old Ashanti bought cats as repositories of their okra or breath-was always a pesewa, about 1 d.; for a female slave, ntaku-anan, about 2 s.; for a male slave, ntakumiensa, [Page 235] 1 s. 6 d. In the case of such purchases no part of the tramma could be used by vendor or purchaser, and it was said that if a purchaser used any of it to buy food with it for his purchase, the slave or cat would die. This tramma may perhaps be called ‘earnest money’, but it was not originally paid to the vendor. If the transaction was afterwards repudiated, the receivers of the tramma were the witnesses to vouch for the transaction.

This was their nkontaabuo.' <sup id="cite_ref-151" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-151">[151]</a></sup> '[The  afenasoafo] were expected to adhere to firm travelling schedules. Couriers to Elmina in 1816, for example, were sworn on oath to arrive there within nine or ten days. In 1817 it took almost two hours to brief couriers bound for Cape Coast. ‘Nine days’, reported Bowdich, who was present on the occasion, ‘are allowed for the journey to Cape Coast, and nine for the return.’ Half a century later little had changed. When a mission was despatched to Cape Coast in 1872, it was reported that the Asantehene ‘fixed the ambassadors 20 days to and fro’. It was, then, the regulated movement of couriers along the roads, rather than that of soldiers or traders, which provided the Asante with a notion of a standard speed. The business of a soldier was fighting, and of a trader, trading, but the business of a courier was, in a very real sense, travelling.' <sup id="cite_ref-152" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-152">[152]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b> ♠ Fastest individual communication ♣ 20 ♥ </b> The Gold Coast population made use of various types of drums in order to communicate in local, regional, ceremonial, and military settings, but couriers were sent to provincial towns. According to Wilks, Kong was the divisional capital furthest from Kumasi. The estimates given by Bowdich's and Huydecoper's informants vary, but Wilks provides geographical measurements as well: 'The former Gonja divisional capital of Kong lay in the extreme north-west of Greater Asante. No great-road passed through it or led to it. It was in fact about 230 miles from Kumase, though the Asante would have thought of it as twenty days or so distant. They appear, compounding cultural and geographical distance, to have regarded it as  the back of beyond, the  ultima Thule  of their dominions. Asantehene Osei Tutu Kwame was well known for his courtesy, manifest in his command of flattery. At one of his meetings with Bowdich in 1817, he praised his guest's country. ‘I well see,’ he commented, ‘that you [the British] are much superior to the Asante in industry and the arts.’ Kong came immediately to the Asantehene's mind. ‘But there exists here, in the interior,’ he continued, ‘a people, those of Kong, who are as little civilized to us as we are relative to you.’ The previous year Huydecoper had made inquiries about the extent of Asante. Of all the distant frontier places to which reference might have been made, his informants seem naturally to have chosen Kong. Surprisingly, however, Huydecoper was told that it lay only sixty to eighty hours - or six to eight days - distant from Kumase. His informants thus reduced the distance of Kong from the capital by about two-thirds. On the face of it, this was to understate the extent of Greater Asante in a context in which it might well have been exaggerated, to emphasize the greatness of the nation. Conversely, however, it may also be seen as exaggerating the political reach of the central government by treating Kong - the paradigm of remoteness - as being as securely under Asante authority as places two-thirds less distant. To appreciate the paradox involved is to begin to understand the intricate relationship in Asante thought between distance and authority as measured by time.' <sup id="cite_ref-155" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-155">[155]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<p><b> ♠ Standing armies ♣ present ♥ </b> The military organization coincided considerably with the political structure, with chiefs and other executives often fulfilling a dual role. 'Warfare has historically been a central institution, a means of extending territory and controlling external trade. The Akan state was typically divided into five or six military formations or "wings," each under the authority of a wing chief. Beneath the wing chiefs, who are chosen by the king, are the chiefs of the main towns of a kingdom. The latter are from the town's ruling line.' <sup id="cite_ref-190" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-190">[190]</a></sup> The military was composed of an elite of commanders and specialists as well as troops raised from the population of the core and tributary polities. Most fighters were accordingly citizen-soldiers and not specialists in their own right. 'The Ashanti army was not a regular army like the British expeditionary force it faced in 1873-4, although a small trained cadre stationed in the capital formed its nucleus. Beyond this, the Ashanti army most closely resembled the feudal levies of the European Middle Ages, in that most of its manpower was assembled at the outbreak of war from troops raised by provincial warlords. Finally, in cases of great urgency, the king was empowered to mobilize the entire able-bodied male population.' <sup id="cite_ref-191" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-191">[191]</a></sup> Mensa-Bonsu claims there were no professional soliders per se: 'The army had four ‘wings’ - the Van, Rear, Left and Right wings ( Adonten, Kyidom, Benkum and  Nifa respectively). Every chief in Asante was a member of one of these ‘wings’. The ‘wing’ was under its own head who was in charge of maintaining discipline. The army had a commander-in-chief ( Krontihene). To date, when the chiefs sit in council, each chief joins the ‘wing’ to which he traditionally belonged. The fact of frequent wars notwithstanding, there were no professional fighters. Each man had his own occupation but could be called upon to fight any day.' <sup id="cite_ref-192" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-192">[192]</a></sup> But the other sources agree that there was a small body of armed professionals not disbanded during times of peace, such as the standing body of the Ashanti Adontenhene: 'Bantama was, I am informed, chosen as the site of the royal mausoleum, and also of ‘the royal treasure-house of the ghosts’, because this place was the head-quarters of the Ashanti general and a standing body of about one thousand fighting-men. These served as a bodyguard of the skeletons and the treasure.' <sup id="cite_ref-193" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-193">[193]</a></sup> Hayford reports the same: 'The local government of Kumasi was in the hands of the Kwaintsirs, a body of men who were the keepers of the golden stool. They formed the Department of War, and the great General Amankwatsia was formerly their Chief. The fact that the Department of War held in its keeping the royal stool illustrates vividly the origin of the kingly office in the Native State, which will be explained later on.' <sup id="cite_ref-194" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-194">[194]</a></sup> We follow the majority of authors.
</p><p><b> ♠ Uniformity of equipment ♣ absent ♥ </b> According to some sources, the state provided some ammunition to fighters: 'In time of war the King and Head-Chiefs supplied the Companies with powder and shot. When they marched to battle the Tufu Hin led the van and the King the rear-guard. The King, Tufu Hin, Head-Captains, and principal Chiefs formed themselves into a council of war; and the King held supreme command throughout the struggle, though the Tufu Hin would practically be the Commanderin-Chief.' <sup id="cite_ref-195" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-195">[195]</a></sup> Offensive and defensive weapons, such as rifles and shields, were acquired by the fighters themselves. '[T]he annual military review was a means of familiarising the young men with the use of firearms and preparing them for national defence in time of war. It was, moreover, an important adjunct to an imposing ceremonial. It ought to be possible to allow the annual displays under suitable control and regulations. In former times every male adult of the community understood fully the use of a gun, and made a point of possessing one with the first money he earned, or could coax from his uncle or father. Such are present governmental restrictions that hardly ten per cent. of the young men of the country either possess, or can use, a gun; and as for powder and shot it is extremely difficult for the Natives to obtain any even for ordinary sport.' <sup id="cite_ref-196" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-196">[196]</a></sup> Commoners mostly used 'Long Danes': 'The Ashanti army was made up entirely of infantry. The threat of sleeping sickness, spread by the tsetse fly,  made it impossible to maintain cavalry in the forest zone. Most Ashanti infantrymen were equipped with standard European trade muskets, known on the West African coast as 'Long Danes'. This weapon, which measured six feet in length and weighed nearly 20lb, could hardly have been more unsuited for for warfare in the rain forests. 'Long Danes' were, however, almost the only shoulder arms available to African armies on the Gold Coast in the 1870s and, in any case, were good enough for fighting similarly armed African opponents.' <sup id="cite_ref-197" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-197">[197]</a></sup> Elaborate talismanic garb (see above) was worn by elites and commanders, but not commoners.
</p><p><b> ♠ Army size ♣ [40,000-100,000] ♥ </b> There were considerable discrepancies between the potential number of fighters at the Asantehene's disposal at any given time and the size of any of the armies fielded. The military was composed of an elite of commanders and specialists as well as troops raised from the population of the core and tributary polities. Most fighters were accordingly not specialists. 'At full strength, the Ashanti army was said to number around 100,000 men, which would have made it one of the largest armies in Africa, on a par with Ethiopia's. Most armies that took the field were not as large as this, however. The force that fought the British in 1873-4 was only around 40,000 strong.' <sup id="cite_ref-198" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-198">[198]</a></sup> As indicated above, there was also a small body of armed professionals not disbanded during times of peace, such as the standing body of the Ashanti Adontenhene: 'Bantama was, I am informed, chosen as the site of the royal mausoleum, and also of ‘the royal treasure-house of the ghosts’, because this place was the head-quarters of the Ashanti general and a standing body of about one thousand fighting-men.

</p><p><b> ♠ Maximum logistical lag ♣ 160 ♥ </b> 'Those using the roads of Asante travelled, quite obviously, at different speeds. In the early part of the nineteenth century, Dupuis maintained that an army ‘in proportion to the rank of its commander, and certainly if the king was at its head, could not march to Cape Coast or the sea-side in less than three or four months…’. This may have exaggerated the time taken, but there is no doubt that military forces advanced very slowly indeed and seldom progressed more than a mile or two a day. Traders travelled more rapidly but, encumbered by their loads and often transacting business on the way, still moved relatively slowly. Dupuis met five from Kumase who had taken 21 days to reach the coast.' <sup id="cite_ref-202" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-202">[202]</a></sup> 'Asante armies sometimes campaigned beyond the frontier. They did so, for example, in 1840-4. But the reach of government, its  ano, was recognized as less than that of the military. The former was fixed [...] at a notional twenty days from Kumase. The mental map of Greater Asante as a month reflected, it may be supposed, a rational recognition of reality: that without any major change in the speed of communications, no lands more distant than a month from Kumase, in and out, could effectively be administered even though they might be subdued for the duration of a campaign.' <sup id="cite_ref-203" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-203">[203]</a></sup> This information ties in with the logistical information provided above. If Kong, the provincial capital furthest from Kumasi, was 230 miles or 20 'walking days' removed, then an army moving at the speed indicated by Wilks should indeed need around 160 days when travelling to the interior through rainforest country. An army travelling to the coast would have been much faster, though, and the same is true for armies travelling to less distant divisional capitals that were incorporated into the road network.

In the aftermath of the coup the middle-class dissidents threw their weight behind the movement for the restoration of Kofi Kakari, whom they regarded as reasonably sympathetic to their aspirations. The regime which first came to power, however, was one headed by the powerful Akyempemhene of Kumase, Owusu Koko. A son of Asantehene Osei Tutu Kwame, he had been perhaps the most influential of all the councillors during the latter part of the reign of Kwaku Dua I. In mid-1883 he carried out a massacre of many of the leading supporters of Kofi Kakari, an event that led a number of Asante politicians to seek refuge in the Gold Coast Colony."<sup id="cite_ref-214" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-214">[214]</a></sup>
</p><p>"As the political price of building the coalition that enabled him to win the civil war, Agyeman Prempe I had to make fundamental concessions to provincial chiefs: the return of subjects and lands confiscated from them by his predecessors and, almost certainly, the renunciation of death duties. ... ‘No elders were present’ when the Manso Nkwanta miners were conspiring, but nevertheless they channelled their discontent through the elders and chief. The revolt of tax- and fine-payers affected certain chiefs, but apparently only those who, whether they were for or against Asantehene Mensa Bonsu, were seen to resemble him in the heaviness of their fines and taxes. ..

</p><p><b>♠ Deportation ♣ present ♥</b> Some sources describe the deliberate resettlement and coercion into labour of unfree or subject populations: "In some cases people of unfree status were deliberately settled in particular places for economic and strategic reasons. The claims of the Kings of Asante in this field were put most blantantly by one king who offered to relocate the whole Fante population of Cape Coast numbering several thousands to end a perennial source of trouble in Asante-British relations. Other groups were also resettled in central Asante: traditions relate how one group of Ewe went to Kumase to be rewarded for helping the Asante forces and were forced to settle near by to provide farm labour.

</p><p><b>♠ Imprisonment ♣ present ♥</b> Hostage-taking seems to have been a diplomatic tool applied by both Ashanti and the British: "Maclean was always the pragmatist. Although events [in 1831] had not turned out quite as he had anticipated, he took matters in his stride. Indeed, in one respect he had achieved rather more than expected. Once the Danish treaty had been signed, the Asante prisoners were immediately released. H. Richter and C. Bannerman had custody of the more important of the women.

</p><p>The Ashanti-Fante and Anglo-Ashanti wars were characterized by large-scale destruction of farmland: "The Fantes held the monopoly of trade with the Europeans (English) and it was partly to break this monopoly that the Ashantis clashed with the Fantes in several conflicts throughout the century.

Many of the battles and plundering raids took place in the transition area between the forst and coastal grassland, and on the latter itself. The state of agriculture in these parts was one of chaos. In the central province, where farming had developed to a level higher than in any other part of the country, incessant battles totally destroyed the agricultural system, and development was set back by many decades.

The parade is both poatwa, inexplicit statement of the king's incomparable status in the presence of the successors of the defeated enemies, and also a visual aid to the recall of the major events in the military and political history of Asante."<sup id="cite_ref-235" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-235">[235]</a></sup>
</p><p>On the other hand, Meyerowitz reports torture of enemy women and children at the hands of Ashanti fighters: "While their men fought on the Fante side against the Ashanti, their women and children were in conquered territory at the mercy of the Ashanti soldiery. They were not only maltreated but often cruelly tortured, so that many women, when the Ashanti came, killed their own children in terror. When, after the sixth Ashanti retreat, their chief Tsibu and chief Kofi Gyebi of the neighbouring Assin-Apimanim state whose people had suffered equally, decided that it was better to settle again in Ashanti - at least their women and children would be safe in war. But their people, who hated the Ashanti, thought differently. Accusing their chiefs of being bribed by the Ashanti, they handed them over to the Fante (actually the British governor at Cape Coast) to be tried. They were found guilty and executed in 1853."<sup id="cite_ref-236" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-236">[236]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Mutilation ♣ present ♥</b> "The heads of the enemy killed in battle were considered a portion of the trophies of war; but you may be sure that not all the heads that were brought to Kumasi were the heads of executed prisoners. The ghastly practice existed of cutting off the head of a fallen foe, which was brought up to the capital to swell the number of skulls in the public arenas of Kumasi, over which ill-informed writers have waxed eloquent."<sup id="cite_ref-237" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-237">[237]</a></sup>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Yam Festival ♥</b> Akan communities celebrated the annual yam harvest with a public festival. 'An annual custom is always held in connection with the first fruits of each staple crop such as yam. The general name for a festival is Afahyε (afa, “festival”; hyε, “fix a day”). The chief's and head priest's house and things are refurbished [Page 35] by singing old women, the blackened stools are taken to the stream and sprinkled with water; pieces of sacrificed and new food crops are put on each stool. The spirits are invoked to start the new year and make it a good one, the new year beginning at different times in different localities.' <sup id="cite_ref-239" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-239">[239]</a></sup>//'The Akan annual yam festival, a purificatory ceremony lasting one-two weeks usually in September or October, is called Odwira, meaning “to purify/cleanse”. (It is sometimes also called apafram). It is similar to the Apo in that all disputes are settled, bringing harmony back to the town. The central part of the festival is the re-purification of the stools and the abosom shrines. It is a festival involving remembrance of the dead, harvest, and thanksgiving.' <sup id="cite_ref-240" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-240">[240]</a></sup>//The Yam Festival is also known as Odwira Festival in the literature: 'The Odwira Festival is the most important yearly celebration among the Ashanti people. It is held in autumn, the time when new yams are ready. They cannot be eaten until the second day of the festival, when they are paraded through the streets. The whole festival lasts for five days is celebrated slightly differently in each community. Throughout the festival, music and drumming abound. On the first day the path leading towards the chief's burial is cleaned. On the second day priests make offerings at the burial chambers and a great yam parade takes place. On the third day people mourn and fast. On the fourth a splendid feast for everyone in the community is held at the local chief's house. That night, everyone stay indoors, to avoid catching sight of the chief's thrones, symbols of the dead men's spirits, which are carried to the river to be ceremonially washed. On the fifth and final day, chiefs and other important clan members dressed in their best, parade through the town in a  grand procession to pay homage to the senior local chief. Some are carried shoulder high on litters and shaded with brilliantly coloured umbrellas. Then people play music and dance late into the night.'<sup id="cite_ref-241" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-241">[241]</a></sup>//Warren provides a description of the relevant narratives and proceedings among the Techiman-Bono:'The other major annual Bono Festival is the Yam Festival ( henerεk dibayerefoforo: literally, the chief is going to eat new yams). The myth explaining the origin of the festival states that when the Techiman-Bono people came from the cavern at Amowi, Onyame pointed out forest yams (aha bayere). Seeing that bush pigs and elephants had eaten some of the yams, they cooked a few and saw that the yam was good food. They gave some to their chief, who also enjoyed it. After that, they began to celebrate on an annual basis the day on which they first found yams. After their chief died, they fed his soul (saman) yams on the same day. Later the Bono began to plant yams, and the yam became the most important staple in the Bono diet. Every farmer celebrates the festival to thank Onyame after the harvest. The living and the deceased are all invited to share in the abundance. Every Bono chief and priest celebrates a yam festival, but before the celebrations begin, a man from the village of Kenten whose title is Akokohwedeε (woodhen) first tastes the yam. When he sees that the yam is ripe, early in the morning on the traditional day called Fodwo he informs the god Taa Mεnsah that the yam is ready to be prepared for εto (mashed yams mixed with palmoil).' <sup id="cite_ref-242" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-242">[242]</a></sup>//'The Taa Mεnsah deity celebrates his yam festival on Fodwo, a Monday. The new yam is hung from rafters in the shrine room for some weeks before the Akokohwedeε comes to taste it. After the yam is hung, children may begin to eat new yam and the elders can [Page 57] [Page 58] begin to eat aso bayere (one species of yam). In the evening on Fodwo, the god Taa Mεnsah is prepared to eat yam after being carried on the main street from one end of the town to the other end three times and consulted. After this, the god informs the manhene that he is about to eat yam and the manhene gives the god permission to eat the yam. The manhene sends a yam to the god and it is always this yam which is cooked as εto and placed on the shrine. The next day, Tuesday, the manhene sends a sheep and wine to the god.' <sup id="cite_ref-243" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-243">[243]</a></sup>//'Two weeks after the Taa Mεnsah Yam Festival, the yam festivals for the Queenmother, the Adontenhene, and the Nifahene are celebrated on a Monofie, a Friday. Nwonakusie, a Thursday, is the yam festival day for the Twafohene, the Adaatihene, the Akyeamehene, the Konkontiwahene, and the Krontihene. Fofie, another Friday, is the yam festival day for the manhene, the Gyaasehene, the Ankbeahene, and the Barimhene. The manhene provides about six sheep and a cow for his own yam festival. These are sacrificed, the blood being spilled on the ancestral stools; the meat is cooked and distributed.' <sup id="cite_ref-244" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-244">[244]</a></sup>//The ethnographic material availabe refers mostly to the Ashanti and colonial periods.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Apo Festival ♥</b> The Apo Festival was celebrated annually and included carnivalesque elements: 'Many festivals exist among the Akan; their foundations and functions are found in the traditional religion. The Apo festival is celebrated yearly among the Brong; it is a feast of eight days duration in which complete lampooning liberty (in the form of song) of both superiors and inferiors (without punishment) is given. The people explain that if one's sunsum is hurt, the body becomes ill; often ill health is caused by evil and the hatred another person may have for you. In like manner, if you have a hatred for someone, it affects your own sunsum, so this time is set aside to allow any man to tell any other man what has offended him. This frees the spirit, and both sunsum become relaxed. During this festival there is theoretical sexual license; this isn't really taken [Page 33] Scene at a Festival [Page 34] advantage of since traditional court action can be initiated after the eight day festival. Punishment is therefore deferred until the rites are over. Should an aggrieved party take action he forfeits the right to investigation, to satisfaction, and he is also heavily fined. During this period all the priests and priestesses of the area are present with their shrines; they touch each shrine with every other one to re-establish communications which might have been lost. The major gods are taken to the river and cleansed of all evil. On the eighth day everyone makes a concerted effort to drive all evil from the area. Around twenty-five distinct Apo songs are sung, and there is a specific Apo dance for the festival.' <sup id="cite_ref-291" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-291">[291]</a></sup>//Purification is a major element in the rituals performed: 'The festival period is, in fact, a period of coming together in which the people from all over the Techiman traditional area, including well-wishers and invitees from other states, meet in the capital to display the traditional Bono culture through singing, dancing, and drumming. The manhene and his elders, through the Barimhene, purify the soul of King Ameyaw (the chief defeated by the Asante in 1723), adorn his grave with the royal regalia of the incumbent manhene, recall the deeds that Ameyaw performed for the State (man), and present drinks, sheep, and food to his soul and those of the other ancestral chiefs of the Techiman-Bono State. Finally, the Apo is a period during which the shrines of various gods and goddesses are purified. The shrine of the main deity in Techiman Township, Taa Kεse (Taa Mεnsah), is, at this time, purified at the River Agyentoamu during the last hour of the celebration; this serves as a sign of the completion of the Apo Festival.' <sup id="cite_ref-292" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-292">[292]</a></sup>//The festival also served as a check on authority and as a forum for the resolution of mutual resentment: 'The functions of the Apo festival seem to be four: (1) psychological release, (2) a forum for public opinion, (3) a means to periodically check those in authority, (4) a method of enforcing sanctions of behaviour.' <sup id="cite_ref-293" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-293">[293]</a></sup> According to Warren, the restoration of amicable relations is one of the major purposes of the festival: 'This festival allows every person resident in Techiman Traditional State, without regard to class, creed, ethnic group, or race, eleven days of liberty to lampoon, in the form of songs and proverbs, the faults and malpractices of any other person, including those in authority-especially the manhene and his divisional chiefs. In addition, the people may sing the praises of those in authority in appreciation of worthy achievements so as to encourage them to even greater deeds. During this period it is strictly forbidden to fight in any way. The emphasis of the festival is upon the removal of bitterness and misfortune in the State. After all personal grudges, faults, and hatreds are sung and spoken out amicably, the end result is renewed peace and harmony among the Techiman inhabitants; the spirit (sunsum) of the [Page 56] state is cleansed after all the unspoken interpersonal bitternesses are voiced.' <sup id="cite_ref-294" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-294">[294]</a></sup></dd>

The blood of sacrificed sheep is smeared by hand on the ancestral stools (human blood is never spilled on shrines); a libation is poured on each stool. The offering, excluding the omentum, is removed in the evening by the stool-carriers. Everyone entering the stool room removes his shoes, and bares his shoulders as a sign of humbleness before the superior spirits. Many ceremonies such as this Adae follow a forty-two day cycle. The details vary from area to area; the Brong propitiate both the Samanfo and the bosom at the Adae while the Ashanti only propitiate the Samanfo. The day proceding any Adae is called dapaa, “good/lucky day”; this is a day of preparation and work, everything being scrubbed.' <sup id="cite_ref-338" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-338">[338]</a></sup>//The ethnographic material available refers mostly to the Ashanti and colonial periods.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Healing ritual in ecstatic churches ♥</b> In healing services it always takes a long time to build up the necessary spiritual or suggestive atmosphere. Singing, long preaching and praying, and at some centres speaking in tongues precedes it. The congregation is made to participate in the proceedings. They may pray aloud each to his own words, the sound being like the roaring of surf. They are “welded” together into a sort of power-field by laying-on of hands by an officiating prophet who is in a trance under the influence of the Holy Spirit. Palm-branches may be given to the congregation. At another prophet's centre people queue up, sing and are sprinkled with holy water. This they carefully rub in, the women opening up their blouses so as to present their breasts to the precious liquid. Then they are given some of the holy water to drink. During this lengthy process the prophet moves around and inspires the singing and drumming of the band, until the whole congregation, gently swaying, has coalesced into one mystical body. This conveys to the devotee a feeling of security and importance. Only after these preparations does the actual direct treatment begin. This may consist of a symbolic rubbing in of holy oil on the front, the ears, the toes and the hands of the patient, thus symbolizing the healing power of Christ over the five senses and the whole of life. The prophet massages liniment and holy water on his patients<sup id="cite_ref-391" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-391">[391]</a></sup></dd>

After a long service (preaching, announcement, testimony of an old woman said to have been raised from the dead, ordination of ministers for his church) the prophet announced that the evil spirits would now be driven out. A group of church officers and priests busied themselves gathering particulars from about forty men, women and children all eager to confess and to have their supposed witch spirits evicted. They were all lined up in rows, facing “towards Sierra Leone”. Anyone who happened to be looking in the Sierra Leone direction was warned to keep out of the way for a while lest the fleeing spirits might possess one of them. The congregation struck a hand-clapping hymn, accompanied by a band, and in this way obviously built up the psychological pressure on the “witches”, who had already been instructed to kneel down. The prophet and one or two priests moved among them, here and there putting one hand on the head of a witch, and pointing with the other in the direction of “Sierra Leone”, commanding the witch spirit to go there. Some of the witches began to tremble under the psychic stress, and this was taken as a sign that the unclean spirits were beginning to feel uneasy in their bodies. Those spirits who persisted in resisting the prophet's influence shook their owners so severely that they fell writhing on the ground, and remained there quivering for some time. In such severe cases, the prophet or one of his assistants would sprinkle holy sand on them, particularly on their shaking limbs. By close observation, the prophet established the exact spot on limbs or head through which the witch spirit had departed. This danger point was anointed with holy oil and sacred sand to provide special protection against the counter attack. When the treatment was over, the patients lay supine like so many corpses. They were soaked by a rainstorm which had set in during the process of exorcism, and more sand was laid on to symbolize their “burial”, because they were considered as ritually “dead and buried with Christ”, so the prophet told me. Not all the witches, however, reacted so violently as this, more than half of them remained kneeling and shook only moderately or not at all. “Their witch spirits are not so bad and leave earlier” I was told. The ceremony eventually came to an end. Those “dead and buried” were “raised up to new life” by the prophet or one of the priests who pulled them to their feet. Some, however, were so far gone in their stupor that they could not be reawakened to consciousness so easily, and were carried off to the adjoining rooms.'<sup id="cite_ref-427" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-427">[427]</a></sup></dd>

</p><p>Note: Arhin describes the power hierarchy from the village upwards: 'Female stools complemented the hierarchy of male stools. In the village the elders, mpanyinfo, heads of the matrilineages, who constituted with the odekro the village council, had their aberewa or obaapanyin, who looked after the women's affairs. The odekro had an obaapanyin who was responsible for the affairs of the women of the village and was a member of the village council; the ohene, head of a division, and the omanhene, head of the autonomous political community, had their female counterparts known as ohemma, female ruler, who sat on their councils. The ohene and the ohemma were all of the same mogya, blood, or clan. The Asantehemma, the occupant of the female stool of the Kumasi state, and therefore of united Asante, since her male counterpart was ex officio the Asantehene, king of Asante, was a member of the Kotoko council, the executive committee or cabinet of the Asanteman Nhyiamu, general assembly of Asante rulers.' <sup id="cite_ref-466" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-466">[466]</a></sup> Major and minor chiefs were also summoned to council: 'Where the paramount King of a state summons the Head-Chiefs of provinces and chiefs of minor communities to attend a State Council, it is the privilege of the Councillors of the several communities composing the State, according to their rank and importance, to accompany their several Heads to the capital and to join in the “palaver,” or discussion, that will take place, the King in person presiding over the deliberations, supported by his own Councillors and principal Linguists. This is the full Parliament of the people, who are thus fully and duly represented in every way from the highest to the lowest. The commands which go forth from this assembly are binding upon every individual family of the entire State, from the most important province to the most insignificant hamlet, and the sanction operates equally upon all.' <sup id="cite_ref-467" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-467">[467]</a></sup> The paramount executive authority was the Asantehene: 'The King is the Chief Executive Officer of the State, but not the Executive Council of the State. Such a council exists, and any acts done by the King without its concurrence are liable to be set aside.' <sup id="cite_ref-468" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-468">[468]</a></sup> The attribution of concrete entities to a particular executive level is not always clear, though, especially in the early period: 'The state of the union that emerged after the War of Independence was obviously a very fluid one. The Asanteman is referred to as the  Asante Aman Nnum, the Five Asante States, but there is no clear consensus about which states comprised the original union. [...] The fact of the matter seems to have been that the coalition against the Denkyira included what were no more than “estates” on the one hand, like Bekwae, and what were established states on the other, like Mampon, Dwaben, and Kumase itself. Some were to decline and some were to prosper; some were to become powerful components of the Asanteman and some were to become little more than their clients.' <sup id="cite_ref-469" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-469">[469]</a></sup> On the executive level it therefore seems best to go with the stool system: 'Every Asante village was a microcosm of the Asante economic, social, and political universe. Its population included both rulers and ruled, both “owners” of the land with the right of succession to the local, divisional, and state stools and free men grouped in other lineages with corporate interests in other political offices.' <sup id="cite_ref-470" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-470">[470]</a></sup> Only a few leaders in executive positions achieved the additional special status of Abrempon or 'big man': 'However many sikafo aspired to the award of the elephant tail, relatively few seem to have achieved it. Three successful nineteenth century claimants are well documented, namely, Gyaasewahene Opoku Frefre (died 1826), Ankobeahene Kwaku Tawia (died ca. 1850), and Manwerehene Kwasi Brantuo (died 1865).

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from military ♣ absent ♥</b> While the Ashanti infantry mostly consisted of citizen-soldiers who were not specialists in their own right, there was also a nucleus of armed professionals not disbanded during times of peace: 'The local government of Kumasi was in the hands of the Kwaintsirs, a body of men who were the keepers of the golden stool. They formed the Department of War, and the great General Amankwatsia was formerly their Chief. The fact that the Department of War held in its keeping the royal stool illustrates vividly the origin of the kingly office in the Native State, which will be explained later on.' <sup id="cite_ref-472" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-472">[472]</a></sup> During annual military drills, armed commoners gathered in the capital, where they paraded through the streets with specialists: 'Meanwhile the different regiments, under their several Head-Captains, and all commanded by the Captain-General, are preparing to go through their manoeuvres. To avoid disputes, the several regiments parade through the town one after the other, pouring forth thunderous volleys from their long flint Dane guns. After the parade each regiment presents to the King its flags and emblems, new and old, as an act of homage, which the King returns with suitable words. The several Head-Chiefs next renew their allegiance to the King; and, after more dancing and popular rejoicing, thè King retires to his “compound,” where his vassals subsequently take leave of him, each vassal receiving a suitable present.' <sup id="cite_ref-473" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-473">[473]</a></sup> The King was assisted in his military duties by secondary commanders and generals:'The King is the Chief Military Officer of his forces. In time of war, he directs the operations; and if he  is a man of capacity, he has the leading place in the councils of war. There is generally a Tufu Hin, or Captain-General, of the forces; but his authority is subordinate to that of the King, and he is, in every essential, an officer of the King.' <sup id="cite_ref-474" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-474">[474]</a></sup> Accordingly, executive power was not separate from the military.</dd>

In Akim Abuakwa the tribunal sits for five days in the week, Wednesday being excluded by the “Awukudae” custom, and Sunday by the British connexion and other Christian influences. Sittings of Tribunal last for about 6 to 10 working hours each day, and the Omanhene, as responsible judge, is always expected to be present throughout the day's sitting. We have already described the constitution of the Tribunal as consisting of the Omanhene, his Linguists, his four principal Executive Chiefs, the Queen-Mother, the non-Stool owning Elders and Councillors (including in the latter term the Christian Elders and Presbyters).

The "country advocates," members of the Western-educated elite who lacked formal legal training but had represented clients in court cases and had existed in an uneasy relationship with judges prior to 1876, had their status regularized. How-ever, they were soon to be replaced by lawyers who had been trained in Great Britain. In theory the Supreme Court Ordinance gave preference to customary law unless it was specifically excluded by a contract. Never-theless, it seemed initially as if the changes privileged English common law since many of the British judges knew little about customary law, but over time there did develop a body of "case law based on native law."' <sup id="cite_ref-482" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-482">[482]</a></sup> Accordingly, there was no independent judiciary.</dd></dl>

Sometimes they initiated a destoolment themselves when, for example, a chief repeatedly rejected their advice, or when he broke a taboo, or committed a sacrilegious act. The kind of offences for which chiefs were destooled may be gathered from the following instances of destoolments recounted in the traditional histories of the Divisions.' <sup id="cite_ref-483" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-483">[483]</a></sup> 'Chiefs Kwabena Aboagye of Asumegya, Kwabena Bruku, and Kwasi Ten of Nsuta were destooled for drunkenness; Kwame Asonane of Bekwai for being a glutton ( adidifurum); Kwame Asona, also of Bekwai, for dealing in charms and noxious medicines; and Akuamoa Panyin of Juaben for his abusive tongue, and [Page 22] for not following the advice of his elders. In Kokofu, Osei Yaw was destooled for being fond of disclosing the origin of his subjects (i.e. reproaching them with their slave ancestry), and Mensa Bonsu for excessive cruelty.' <sup id="cite_ref-484" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-484">[484]</a></sup> 'A chief was also destooled if he became blind, or impotent, or suffered from leprosy, madness, or fits, or if his body was maimed in a way that disfigured him.' <sup id="cite_ref-485" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-485">[485]</a></sup> According to Danquah, destoolments became more common in the colonial period: 'THE terms “enstoolment” and “destoolment” are used in the Gold Coast to indicate, as to enstoolment (1) the customary procedure of electing and installing a member of the stool family as Chief or King of the tribe or nation over which that stool rules, and, as to destoolment, (2) the converse procedure of deposing a reigning Chief or King from his former position as ruler. Owing to the importance attached to the hereditary position of Chief either as Odikro (Chief of a town), or Ohene (Chief of a sub-divisional state), there has (Paramount Chief of an independent state), there has been much litigation in recent times in connexion with disputes on the legality or otherwise of particular Enstoolments or Destoolments, and instances are not wanting of such disputes passing through the African and British Courts in the Colony to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in England.' <sup id="cite_ref-486" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-486">[486]</a></sup> 'Many are the causes which have given rise to such frequent disputes, but to examine such causes is not the object of this article, our purpose in writing which is more theoretical than practical. Enstoolment used to be a peaceful and dignified procedure. But the frequency of modern disputed elections has changed the peace and dignity which used to attend the ancient mode of making the best men of the tribe King or ruler.' <sup id="cite_ref-487" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-487">[487]</a></sup> 'Many political theorists versed in the craft have traced the cause of this frequent deposition of Chiefs to the effects of the Native Jurisdiction Ordinances. We are not prepared to deny or accept this view, but we are inclined to think that the present discontent among the mass of the people against the ruling houses must have one cause in the general administration of affairs, and another in the irreconciled differences existing between the old system of government and the form of government which seems to be demanded by the present generation. However much we may admire the Akan institutions, we should not be doing our duty for the effective maintenance of the best that should be preserved in our institutions were we to suffer both Ormuzd and Ahriman [Page 110] to grow strong together. Where an existing order leads to creation of disorder nothing but a reform of the former would lead to a cessation of the latter.' <sup id="cite_ref-488" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-488">[488]</a></sup> 'We are not, however, concerned in this treatise with debatable political considerations, and having stated a sufficient preamble for the present subject, we proceed to discuss it so far as present limitations will permit.' <sup id="cite_ref-489" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-489">[489]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Customary mechanism ♣ ♥</b></dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Legal mechanism ♣ present ♥</b> The Ohemma played an important role in power transitions: 'As the abrewa, the ohemma was also custodian of ‘custom’. She was officially the foremost authority on the genealogy of the royal matrilineage, and hence the first and final arbiter on who was qualified by blood to be a male ruler; it was said of the ohemma's stool in relation to the male stool that it was the elder stool, akonnua panyin. It was the ohemma who played the leading role in the selection of a successor to a deceased or destooled (removed from office) ohene.' <sup id="cite_ref-490" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-490">[490]</a></sup> But popular consent was also required: 'If a Chief dies, or “goes to his village”, as the untoward incident is euphemistically described, it remains for the family, after the first funeral obsequies to name a successor to the stool. There are usually in every town, about two or three divisions, or “houses” in the ruling Royal family. It does not rest with any one of these “houses” to say whose turn it is to ascend the stool. It is the will of the people which determines what particular member of the Family taken as a whole is most fit to ascend the stool and to rule over them. The question of the choice of a stool candidate by the materfamilias, which will be explained later, is purely a formal ceremony chiefly dependent upon the people's will. For if the initial selection were the absolute privilege of any individual member of the family, no town or tribal stool would be worthy of the name. It is necessary to remember that the people's allegiance to stools are not as subjects of an absolute monarchy, but as citizens of a more or less democratic country, and were it that they had to accept any haphazard choice thrown upon them by the Head of the Royal Family, the popular veto would seem a shadowy thing. We do not say this to disparage the authority of the Heads of families, we say it to demonstrate the principle that the selection by the female head derives its source from the popular will, and this will is always easily known.' <sup id="cite_ref-491" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-491">[491]</a></sup> Male members of royal matrilineages were eligible for succession: 'In the case of succession to Stool, be it family, town, tribal, or divisional, either a brother (we speak solely of the female line) or a nephew, an uncle, or a grand-uncle, a cousin or an adult member of the Royal Family, can be selected to succeed a dead or destooled Chief; for, no matter how far removed in blood he may be from the out-going Chief, so long as he belongs to the same recognized Royal Family, any member of the Stool family stands the good fortune of being elected. The mere fact of one being in the second or third house places [Page 111] no bar on one's right to ascend the stool. The same blue blood runs in the veins of any member of the family who can be proved to be a direct descendant in the female line of the known materfamilias. Every member of the Royal Family is, as it were, an heir-presumptive. Character and influence, then, are the determining factors. That stool heir must be fortunate who is unsullied in character, influential withal, and respected by all.' <sup id="cite_ref-492" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-492">[492]</a></sup> 'However, if the heir-apparent—the eldest sister's eldest son—i.e. the nearest nephew—is of good age, of good repute or character as well as rich, there are but two things that stand between him and the stool. One is foul play. He must guard against being played out. The other danger is general or physical health and bodily accomplishments. He must be strong in body and have no personal and bodily defects. His weakness and bodily defects are enough grounds to destroy his candidature. In Akim Abuakwa, for instance, a circumcised person cannot ascend any stool, be it a cottage or town stool. The stools are considered sacred, and a stool aspirant who is circumcised has, by his own act, rendered himself ineligible to ascend a sacred Akan stool.' <sup id="cite_ref-493" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-493">[493]</a></sup> Danquah describes the process of selecting a successor: 'After the funeral obsequies of a Chief, or the final determination of the deposition of an unwanted Chief, all who must have a voice in the election of the new Chief assemble in the public place at the invitation of the Chief who is Regent ex-officio. Thereupon, the sub-Chiefs, Elders and Councillors of the town, together with the Captains of the Asafo companies, call upon the female head, or in her absence, the male head of the Royal Family, to name a person fit for the stool. The members of the Royal Family would then retire into council with a view to consult on the question of the proper person to be selected for the stool. The Head of the Family is, however, the moving spirit of the whole. On the return of the Head of the Royal Family with her people, she names a suitable candidate for the election. If the nominee is acceptable to the sub-Chiefs, Elders, and Councillors assembled, the name is submitted to the meeting, and the general approval of the Asafo or “Werempi” Company (of young men) obtained. If he is not acceptable, the Asafo or “Werempi” Company would signify their disapproval through their respective captains, and their opinion being in consonance with that of the sub-Chiefs, Elders, and Councillors, [Page 112] the Head of the Royal Family would have to make other suggestions until the proper candidate desired by the people would be nominated and accepted.' <sup id="cite_ref-494" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-494">[494]</a></sup> 'The accepted candidate is then taken hold of and beaten, as in a “rag”, he is powdered with white clay and carried on the shoulders by the Asafo or Werempi Company from one end of the town to the other, three times, amid an animated outburst of civic and war songs. After this impressive ceremony of public acclamation by the Asafo Company an “Aseda” money would be taken from the elected Chief when he had been made to sit on the election stool. The amount or value of “Aseda” taken on this occasion is calculated on the relative position of the Chief, and not on the Chief's wealth. Drinks are generally offered by the Chief to all the sub-Chiefs and people there and then assembled. Drumming goes on the whole time, and if there are any State paraphernalia they are brought out in the service of the new Chief.' <sup id="cite_ref-495" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-495">[495]</a></sup> 'But the elected is as yet little more than an ordinary member of the Royal Family. There remains the ceremony of swearing-in, and then the grander and more solemn ceremony of installation. The swearing-in may be done the same, or on the following day. All the minor Chiefs of the new Chief, the sub-Chiefs so-called, hasten to swear in a renewal of their allegiance to the stool, and then the new Chief would swear to them of his unswerving support and assistance to them in the administration of his dominion. The new Chief has also to swear allegiance to the representative of his superior Chief who must be present before any of the above ceremonies are gone through, and the representative would in turn swear on behalf of his over-lord, never to forsake him but to support and uphold him in the service of the country. This swearing to one's superior Chief's representative does not exonerate one from the obligation of swearing allegiance personally [Page 113] to the superior Chief. It is the very first thing to be observed on any proper occasion that such new Chief comes into the presence of his superior Chief. We may here state that in former times it was not the custom for a newly elected Opakani or Chief to make his appearance at the capital town until three years after his election and installation, when such principal Chief had to swear the Oath of Allegiance to the Paramount Stool. It is difficult to trace the reason for this custom, but its very impracticability in modern chieftaincy has gradually brought it into disuse. Probably it was to permit the newly elected chief to perform his own Odwiratuo, grand triennial festival, at the end of his third year, before coming to see his Paramount Chief.' <sup id="cite_ref-496" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-496">[496]</a></sup> 'In the Stool-house certain ceremonies are done. The new Chief is given his final initiation into the highest part of the great Order in the nation—the most solemn Order of the [Page 114] worship of ancient stools—and the highest honours that any member of the tribe can obtain are there and then poured on him. The impressive and recordable part of the initiation is that of holding the new Chief suspended three times over a black consecrated stool—the oldest and most famous of the collection—and declaring him lord and ruler of his dominions, by the direction and guidance of the spirits of his departed and august ancestors. The ceremony begins and ends with slaughter of sheep. Among other things the Chief who is being installed must observe that it is improper for him to bring his body in contact with the black consecration-stool on which he is thrice suspended, for it is regarded unlucky, and it is said that the unfortunate person who does so, stands the risk of weakening for ever his organs of reproduction. This assumption is based on the belief that the black consecration-stool is a living force, and that its spirit is so strong that actual contact with human beings is sure to produce disastrous results.' <sup id="cite_ref-497" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-497">[497]</a></sup> 'After this solemn ceremony the new Chief is worthy enough to regard himself as the most elevated person amongst his peers, and he is now endowed with the right and correlative duty to rule and govern his dominions with the advice and counsel of the members of the Administration.' <sup id="cite_ref-498" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-498">[498]</a></sup></dd>

<p><b>♠ State-level administrators ♣ present ♥</b> The time period in question was characterized by a trend towards greater bureaucratization and functional specialization: 'State organisation became extremely complex in the Kumasi state because at the close of the 17th century it became the capital of the union of Asante states and, in the course of the following century, the seat of an empire which was roughly coterminous with the boundaries of modern Ghana and southeastern Ivory Coast (Wilks 1975: 374-86). The expansion of the state made necessary administrative reforms within Kumasi itself and for the maintenance of effective relations between the Asantehene, the head of the Asante Union and, by consent, also the head of the Kumasi state, and the heads of the conquered territories. The palace administration ( gyase) was expanded with appointive headships of innumerable functional units or palace associations ( afekuo, sing. fekuo) (Rattray 1929: 81-92; Wilks 1967: 214-28; Hagan 1971). The memberships of the palace associations, each of which had either military or nonmilitary functions, cut across the divisions, so that they formed checks on, and counterpoises to, the traditional power units. The heads of the most important of the palace associations, including the units assigned to the offspring of former and reigning Asantehene (Busia 1951: 95), were included in the state council. Since appointments to the headships of the palace associations were in the gift of the Asantehene, the administrative reform represented an intrusion of patrimonialism (Weber 1947: 347) into the traditional political organisation.' <sup id="cite_ref-499" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-499">[499]</a></sup> 'The vast area brought under Asante control by force or threat of arms could not be governed unless new methods of controlling it were developed.

Some supervised the trade in ivory and kola, while others oversaw the gold-producing regions which now fell within the borders of Asante. A form of treasury partly staffed by literate Muslims was created. Groups within the capital began to build up expertise in particular areas of administration and to concentrate on this as a way to power and wealth.

<p><b>♠ Private property (land) ♣ absent ♥</b> Society was organized in matrilineal clans: 'All Akan groups recognize matrilineal descent. The basic group is the clan, of which there are eight; they are dispersed among the many kingdoms. Members of a subclan tend to occupy a single town or village. The clan is an exogamous group. It is comprised of constituent groups that may be referred to as lineages, but these do not form any kind of segmentary lineage system, lineages being attached to others by propinquity and the power and wealth of the host lineage. Although there has been much confusion in accounts of the Akan peoples between matriliny and matriarchy, authority within clans and lineages is held firmly by men, succession being from a man to his brother or to his closest sister's son.' <sup id="cite_ref-517" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-517">[517]</a></sup> 'A child inherits his or her blood from the mother, and character or temperament from the father. Maternal blood ensures the child's membership in the ABUSUA (clan or lineage); paternity bestows membership in one of nine other groups or categories. Although some accounts claim the Akan descent system is one of double descent, this view appears to be based on a misreading of the actual roles of the two lines of descent. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-518" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-518">[518]</a></sup> 'There are groups in which membership is transmitted patrilineally, but these are neither exogamous nor corporate groups; nor are jural or political rights or duties derived from paternal descent. What is involved is the concept of NTORO; the male transmitted NTORO (spirit) which forms a unique spiritual bond between father and son. Following this principle, every person belongs to one of a limited number of named quasi-ritual categories, the ntoro divisions. Members of the same ntoro division are required to observe certain taboos, perform certain rituals, and are believed to have some common personality characteristics. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-519" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-519">[519]</a></sup> 'Consistent with the emphasis on matrilineal descent is the fact that the system of kinship terminology is of the Crow type. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-520" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-520">[520]</a></sup> Clans held and transmitted land: 'The localized matrilineage tracing descent from a known common female ancestor for a period of 10 to 12 generations is the basic unit for political, legal, and ritual purposes. Succession and inheritance rules stress sex, generation, and age, with men having precedence over women, "brothers" over "sisters' sons," and senior over junior. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-521" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-521">[521]</a></sup> 'Land was the unalienable possession of the clan--actually the clan's ancestral spirits were considered the true owners of the land and the tribal land's living occupants only trustees or tenants. Security of tenure was based on working the land. Abandoned land reverted to the stool. Rights to land were inherited matrilineally. Today Akan have the right to sell land although leasing seems to be the preferred arrangement. [IS]' <sup id="cite_ref-522" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-522">[522]</a></sup>  But inheritance was divided between a man's matrilineage and his own offspring: 'Despite being jurally matrilineal, inheritance is to some extent divided between sister's children and a man's own children. The basic principle is that lineage-inherited property goes to sisters' children, and property acquired with the help of a man's wife and children is distributed among the latter at his death. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-523" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-523">[523]</a></sup> Households cultivated family farms: 'The farm, known in Asante as the afuo, was essentially a smallholding capable of supporting a single family. It consisted of two or sometimes three distinct parts, the afuwa, mfufuwa and mfufuwa-nini. The land currently under cultivation was the afuwa, “the little farm” or field, and the land under fallow was the mfufuwa, literally “the non- afuwa.” A farmer's rights of tenure over his fallow were as secure as those over his land under cultivation. In some cases a farm may have attached to it further land — fallow that has not been brought back into cultivation at the appropriate time because, for example, of unsatisfactory yields or of the inability of the tenants (through illnesses, deaths, or the like) to resume cropping it. Such land is the mfufuwa-nini, literally “barren fallow.” The original tenants and their heirs retain rights to the produce from it — to the fruits of palm and kola trees, for example, and to firewood and poles — but Asante law appears not to have defined with any precision the point in time at which others might acquire rights in it and recommence farming operations. Much litigation results.' <sup id="cite_ref-524" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-524">[524]</a></sup> Land became the property of clans through clearing of forests and cultivation. Wilks describes the process of establishing estates: 'Akan village histories make frequent reference to hunters ranging the forest in search of land suitable for agricultural exploitation—taking account, presumably, of surface relief, water resources, soil, and so forth. The role of the aberemp[unavailable]n in these explorations is often described in considerable detail. By way of illustration I shall cite the cases of two, Tabiri Heman and Akuamoa Panin.' <sup id="cite_ref-525" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-525">[525]</a></sup> 'The aberemp[unavailable]n were essentially developers. They created estates, founding villages and clearing the arable land necessary for subsistence. I refer to such estates as “ beremp[unavailable]n-doms” (by analogy with “kingdoms,” “chiefdoms,” etc.). Of the actual work of felling, clearing, and building, and of how the imported unfree labor was used, we know nothing. Such is not the stuff of tradition. Kea has drawn attention to a possible model, that of Aduafo of Afutu and “other great lords” who had contracted with the Danish African Company to clear a site and construct a trading post for them. They brought 300 of their slaves to the site and divided them [Page 98] into two teams. One carried out the clearing while the other assembled the building materials. This was, however, at a coastal location and is therefore of uncertain relevance.' <sup id="cite_ref-526" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-526">[526]</a></sup> 'If the creation of an estate was predicated on the procurement of unfree labor, its prosperity depended on free settlers being attracted to it. Such was the pressure on land, on arable land, that they came. Sometimes the original estate was subdivided by purchase. For example, Adu Gyamfi, by origin from Adansemanso, founded a settlement named Aboforumu. It lay about 12 miles northwest of what was to become Kumase. He subsequently sold (“as the explorers or the owners of the land”) part of the estate to new settlers, Amma Badu and Antwi, who paid him mperedwan aduosia, 60 peredwans or some 135 oz. of gold. The estate was soon to be divided yet again. We have met Akosua Yitua of Asantemanso and her son Danso Abeam, above. She had five daughters. The third of these settled at Amoaman, but her descendants “became hemmed in at this village.” They moved northward, and their leader, Adu Panin, purchased a block of land from Amma Badu and Antwi. He renamed it Ntonso. The price is not reported. The transaction is said to have occurred at the time of Oti Akenten of Kumase. Other cases did not involve purchase, but contract sometimes sealed by marriage. The case of Kyerewa Akenten and her brother, Kagya, is instructive. They left Asantemanso in search of land and, after rejecting several places as unsuitable, arrived at Oyoko, near Feyiase. They went from there 'to Odum-Anaafuo to ask Berefo Kese, the Chief of the place for some land to settle on. He showed them a site where they built their village which they named “Kagya-kurom” [Kagya's village]. Owing to the large number of the followers of Kagya and his sister, Berefo Kese presented them a large portion of his lands on which they farmed. From Kagya-kurom Berefo Kese married Kyerewa Akenten and after their marriage Berefo Kese added a much larger portion of his lands to that already in their hands and presented it to them.' <sup id="cite_ref-527" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-527">[527]</a></sup> 'Obtaining land involved negotiation with the [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n who had developed it, who had (as it were) staked out first claims to it. Matrifiliation as such conferred no rights of settlement. It will follow that the free settlers within a beremp[unavailable]n-dom belonged to different matriclans. In fact these are dispersed almost randomly throughout forest society. As Fortes has remarked, the matriclan “delimits a diffuse field of amity, wide in extent but of minimal structural specificity.” Within the beremp[unavailable]n-dom, of the rule of exogamy, and in that respect was a socially integrative factor. But claims to land were based upon the heritable rights that the [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n conferred upon the settlers, and the matrilineages that thus arose were tied to specific tracts of land within the estate.' <sup id="cite_ref-528" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-528">[528]</a></sup> 'From the fifteenth century onward numerous estates or beremp[unavailable]n-doms arose as the frontier of farming expanded outward from the Adanse and Amansie regions. Such has been the thrust of the argument. Some were in time to become the capitals of aman, of states; some were to be incorporated into such states; and some were to falter and vanish. The struggles that attended the process are exhaustively chronicled in Akan traditions; the nature of the process itself, whereby a class of entrepreneurs became transformed into a ruling class, is not. The key lies in an understanding of the peculiar features of Akan land proprietorship.' <sup id="cite_ref-529" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-529">[529]</a></sup> 'A cardinal feature of the system is expressed in the maxim, afuo mu yε me deε, asase yε [unavailable]hene deε, “the farm is my property, the land is the king's.” It is necessary to extrapolate from more recent practice, described by Rattray, Busia, and Fortes among others. If the proprietor of the land conferred heritable rights to the arable on those who were permitted to settle, he also reserved or established certain rights to himself and his heirs — to his “stool.” He took an almost token part of the harvest at the time of the annual harvest festival (the odwira), but required a more substantial share of the produce of the land as opposed to the arable: fish, snails, game, kola, minerals, and the like. He could levy a wide range of taxes, such as peato for military expenses, ayieto for funerals, and [unavailable]manto to defray the costs of making regalia and putting up buildings. Most importantly, he could require the provision of labor for military service or, for example, for work on the roads. Such, briefly, were what led Potekhin to refer to “the relatively easy feudal dues of the free members of the community.” Relatively easy” they may or may not have been; there was variation from place to place and time to time. “Feudal” they were not, for the free settlers acquired almost unassailable titles to the land they farmed, while the various taxes and services provided to the landholder were ad hoc and sporadic and did not approximate in character to a rent, whether economic or otherwise.' <sup id="cite_ref-530" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-530">[530]</a></sup> 'The descendants of free settlers became [unavailable]manmufo, citizens. Those of the proprietors became adehyeε, nobility. There remain the unfree laborers. They must surely be those who became the third major element in the composition of an [unavailable]man, namely the gyaasefo. Literally “the people of the hearth,” they were absorbed into Akan society as servants of the adehyeε. They became responsible not only for their own subsistence but for that of the nobles. They farmed for them, assumed responsibility for their debts, and provided them with a wide range of personal services as stool-carriers, drummers, hornblowers, umbrella-carriers, bathroom attendants, messengers, tradesmen, sextons, and so forth. Their masters (or mistresses) were heirs to their property. Their status, unlike that of nobles and citizens, was transmitted through the male line. Rattray commented on the matter: [Page 100] 'There is little doubt that the Gyasefo were in olden times recruited from the slave class. A “Stool” slave became one of the Gyasefo. The descendants of a Gyase woman were of course considered as Gyasefo, down the female line for all time; not only was this so, but the son of a Gyase man would ordinarily also enter the office to which his father belonged, irrespective of the position of his mother.' <sup id="cite_ref-531" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-531">[531]</a></sup> Accordingly, land was formally owned by matrilineages and stools rather than individuals. The latter held usufruct rights in lineage land rather than owning it 'privately'.

<dd><b>♠ Lease ♣ present ♥</b> Wealthy urban families bought land from indebted families and leased it to sharecroppers: 'It must be stressed again, however, that the model of the rural economy developed here is one specifically of relevance to the sector of nonintensive land use (Level III), and in that sense to “subsistence.” But by the late eighteenth century the capital, Kumase, and several other major centers of local administration — Bekwae, Dwaben, Kokofu, and Mampon, for example — had come to offer a wide range of employment opportunities other than farming: in court, in the civil and military administrations, in business, in crafts, and so forth. In the early nineteenth century Kumase was already a town of about 20,000 people, few of whom were directly engaged in food production. As the staple crops are not in general ones that can be transported over long periods of time (and a laden carrier would seldom travel more than ten miles a day in the forest) and as in any case portage added greatly to the sales price of the produce, areas of more intensive agricultural production (Level II) were created around Kumase and the other large towns. Follows were shortened to permit the more intensive exploitation of the land, albeit at the risk of a long-term degeneration in soil fertility, and new patterns in the organization of the social relations of production become discernible. Lineage land purchased by wealthy townsfolk from families that had fallen into debt was parcelled out among sharecroppers — often unfree — who retained [Page 56] a nominal third (abusa) of the produce for their own use and supplied the remainder to the entrepreneur. The sharecropper worked longer hours and suffered a lower standard of living than the free farmer on lineage land. A differential was thus created between dearer and cheaper labor that represented, in a sense, the social cost of feeding the urban population; urban growth depended upon agricultural growth, which in turn involved the appearance of a form of landlord tenure (though not, because of the operations of the system of death duties, of landed estates). The matter is, however, one beyond the scope of this essay.' <sup id="cite_ref-532" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-532">[532]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Other property ownership ♣ present ♥</b> Heirlooms were transmitted within families: 'According to Rattray, kuduo were classed as agyapadie, a term he translates as ‘heirloom’. Kuduo were clearly regarded as items of great importance, and many thousands survive. Earlier in this century it appears the Asante were reluctant to part with these vessels to outsiders and, although many have since been removed from Ghana, some are still to be found in stool rooms or in the private possession of old people. Many of the kuduo which exist today are heavily corroded, indicating that they have, at some time, been buried.' <sup id="cite_ref-534" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-534">[534]</a></sup> Husbands gifted clothing and other objects to their wives, which the latter had to repay in the case of divorce: 'The following is only a brief indication of what seems to me to be peculiar in an Akan marriage as compared to the institution in other countries.' <sup id="cite_ref-535" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-535">[535]</a></sup> 'Such is the state of a married couple that in many instances a wife may well guard against receiving any large presents in the form of clothing, etc., from her husband, or she might one day regret her action. This is so because, should there be a rupture, ending in divorce, all that the husband had since the payment of “Aseda” and during the time of their married life, given to the wife by way of presents, etc., must be returned to the husband. Even in cases where the wife is seeking for divorce without good cause shown or with a view to marrying another man in the immediate future, she has to pay for all the clothing which had become useless by wear and tear. Consequently, while husband and wife are living together, there may be constant dread on the part of the wife to make use of things given to her by her husband, else she may one day be divorced a bankrupt. If she is rich in her own right, the wife will prefer to dress in clothing bought with her own money, and she would not wait for her husband to provide her clothing.' <sup id="cite_ref-536" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-536">[536]</a></sup> Stools were associated with matriclans: 'Before proceeding further, it is necessary to explain the origin of stools, whether family or public. Where the head of a family has more than one stool, he may give one to a member of the family on appointing him the Penin of a junior branch of the large family. The person so appointed thereby acquires possession of all the goods, chattels, and lands appurtenant to that stool. His own property becomes stool property, and is merged in whatever is given him. The children of the last stoolholder call him father, and the widows become his wives; each woman can, however, obtain her freedom on repayment of the Consawment money, that is, dowry. But a new stool is created in this wise: when the family of a man of wealth or influence on his death so will, they create a family stool which is named after the deceased. For this purpose the favourite chair of the deceased, generally a small one, which was in constant use by him, is cleaned, then rubbed all over with the blood of sheep, and finally smeared with a mixture of soot and eggs. The stool is afterwards wrapped in some skin and safely kept. During this consecration, libation is made and prayers are freely offered for the prosperity of the family, and that its members may, in time to come, attain greater influence and prominence. These stools are added to from time to time, but count is made of only the prominent ones. Too often the name of the original founder of the family is dropped for that of one of his successors of greater eminence. When an old stool is so decayed that it ought to be destroyed, it is burnt, and the ashes thereof are made into a paste with oil, blood, eggs, and other substances. The paste is then daubed on a new stool, which is [Page 13] consecrated as a family stool and named after the old one. When an old stool is lost a new one is specially made and consecrated.' <sup id="cite_ref-537" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-537">[537]</a></sup> Chiefs owned ceremonial drums: 'Before we enter upon a detailed description of these drums, an account of how they are made, and the ceremonial inseparable from their manufacture, will be of interest. When an Ashanti chief wants a couple of ntumpane or talking drums he will summon the makers (who are not the drummers), and are variously known as 'kyerema nyano (the drummer's nyano) or atwenesenfo (i. e. carvers of the tweneboa tree). Only chiefs of the rank of omanhene, ohene, or safohene have the right to possess such drums. A Queen Mother or other women may not possess a drum.' <sup id="cite_ref-538" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-538">[538]</a></sup> Kronenfeld provides a general description of the property system: 'Thus, the actual social effects of Fanti inheritance rules depend on the durability of property, 1) The only properties (in Egyaa, at least) durable for a long time are positions: lineage leader ( ebusua panyin) and other chiefships or stools belonging to the ebusua. Informants talked about the inheritance of position in the same way that they talked about the inheritance of property, All stools or chiefships (except possibly for some asafo 2) House sites stay within an ebusua normally, but are common enough in Egyaa not to be worth fighting over. Houses themselves seem usually to last 20-30 years at most before needing rebuilding. (This refers to traditional wattle-and-daub or adobe houses. More recent concrete block houses will probably last longer.) Houses, then, may pass down one generation of inheritance, but not much further. 3) Personal property (clothes, utensils, etc.) also seem to have a short useful life, i.e., 10-20 years. 4) Fishing boats have an expected life span of 10 years, nets around 5 years, and motors around 3 years. 5) Women's fish-smoking ovens only seem to last a couple of years. 6) An active farm will be inherited when its owner dies; in fact, however, particular farms (in [Page 27] Egyaa ) only last for a couple of years, and thus are not too important as inherited property. 7) Finally, there does seem to have been a lot of cash in Egyaa which would represent a worthwhile inheritance. Supposedly, inherited money is kept separately from earned money. But money is constantly loaned out through a kinship-based credit network, and uncollectible debts are common. The net effect, I think, is that money deriving from some particular person only goes through a couple of inheritances at most before disappearing (or going into goods). However, this is only speculation, since money, being less visible and identifiable than goods, was harder for me to follow, and presumably for the same reasons is harder for the people involved to keep track of.' <sup id="cite_ref-539" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-539">[539]</a></sup> Slavery was also practiced: 'The Akan practiced slavery, obtaining slaves from northern slave dealers, usually Muslims.

Slaves were used for domestic and field labor, for sale to traders across the Sahara and Atlantic, and as sacrifices to royal and other ancestors. In the middle of the nineteenth century, slaves amounted to half of the population in many towns. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-540" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-540">[540]</a></sup>

But yet the basic siblingship and seniority information relevant to inheritance are expressed in Fanti outside of the basic kin terminology. In this paper I want first to show how these kinds of information are expressed and how the information specifically shapes inheritance rights and then to examine the effects of inheritance on lineage segmentation. I will conclude with a look at some linguistic consequences (in the kin terminology) of changes in cultural expectations regarding inheritance — changes which stem from effects of Ghanaian law on inheritance and from changes in the obligations involved in raising children.' <sup id="cite_ref-549" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-549">[549]</a></sup> 'Each of these issues — siblingship, seniority, inheritance rights, and change — will be examined separately for its interaction with the wider kinship system, and thus for what it contributes to the feedback relations among the kin terminology, the inheritance and socialization relations that shape the terminology, and the kin groups that have precipitated out around these inheritance relations. This discussion of the interrelationship among kin terminology, kin groups, and succession will necessarily raise the further analytic issue of what other linguistic information (beyond that minimally necessary to a formal analysis of the kinship terms themselves) belongs in a kinship terminological analysis — if that analysis is addressed to these kinds of functional questions.' <sup id="cite_ref-550" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-550">[550]</a></sup> 'Seniority, referring in its core sense to relative age, is important to Fanti kinship and social interaction in several ways. Computed on age and genealogical criteria within a lineage, and relative to the relevant property, seniority defines the ordering of potential heirs to property. The relative seniority of any ego and alter — where seniority can refer to the age and genealogical criteria of inheritance, but where it also can refer to a subtle interaction of power, respect, precedence, and putative authority — is treated as important by Fanti speakers, and importantly affects day-to-day interactions and kin term usage (see Kronenfeld 1973). However, seniority is not coded directly in the kin terminology proper. Instead, seniority is optionally marked via the use of general (i.e., non-kinship-specific) modifiers — usually panyin (senior) and kakraba (junior). These modifiers do not have a primary kinship reference; they can apply to any relationship between non-equals (in age, power, authority, and, even, by extension, size or assertiveness).' <sup id="cite_ref-551" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-551">[551]</a></sup> 'A woman has the potential of being inherited leviratically by her kun kakraba (who is her husband's “brother”), but not by her kun panyin, and reciprocally a man may inherit his yer panyin (“senior wife” = wife of senior “brother” or “uncle”), but not his yer kakraba (“junior wife” = wife of junior “brother”). As far as I know, there is no equivalent sororate on the woman's side.' <sup id="cite_ref-552" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-552">[552]</a></sup> 'A nua panyin is older than a nua kakraba and has authority over the kakraba. As children, the elder brother can discipline his junior, subject to control by the father. As adults, the elder is senior in the lineage to the junior and will inherit before the junior (the junior will inherit subsequently). Among brothers, the panyin kakraba distinction is commonly made and seems to be considered an important one. In certain lineage situations (see below) an extended younger nua can be senior ( panyin) to an elder because he has a senior mother.' <sup id="cite_ref-553" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-553">[553]</a></sup> 'I have explored the concepts of siblingship and seniority not only for the insight they give into the interrelationship among cultural action, terminology, and grammar, but also because of the role they play in the execution of the major corporate function of Fanti lineages: the assignment of inheritance rights. I want now to examine that inheritance role in more detail. Matrilineages (ebusua) are very salient social units to the Fanti. They figure heavily in conversations of various sorts, including discussions of political and economic maneuverings. The lineage represents the primary referent of the English word “family” as it is used by Fanti speakers. The word ebusua is the primary translation equivalent of “family” for Fanti speakers, while in anthropological terms ebusua refers to a matrilineage (the unmarked default sense) or matriclan (a denotatively correct extension).' <sup id="cite_ref-554" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-554">[554]</a></sup> 'Inheritance is traditionally within the ebusua (lineage). The elders of the ebusua determine who will succeed to the property and positions of a deceased person. The elders are free to pick any member of the lineage as successor, or they can select an outsider to act as custodian of the property and/or as temporary filler of the position. They are supposed to pick successors who are mature and who have the skills needed for effectively using the property or filling the position.' <sup id="cite_ref-555" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-555">[555]</a></sup> 'There are ideal norms which are followed, insofar as possible, concerning the genealogical relationship of heir to deceased: 1) Normally women inherit from women and men from men. 2) Qualified people of the deceased's own generation take precedence over those of subsequent generations, and seniors do not normally inherit from juniors (i.e., qualified people junior to the deceased come in order of seniority). 3) Genealogical qualification consists primarily in being descended from the [Page 26] mother of the person who first earned or created the property; other lineage members come afterward.' <sup id="cite_ref-556" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-556">[556]</a></sup> 'There is, therefore, a kind of inheritance seniority (mba mpanyin mu). According to this seniority pattern (see Fig. 2), if a man. A, creates some property, the property ideally should pass to his next younger matrilineally related brother, then to the next younger, etc. In Generation -1 the eldest son of his eldest sister would come first, followed by the eldest son of his next eldest sister and so on. In Generation -2 the eldest son of the eldest daughter of A's eldest sister would come first, etc. B. C, and D inherit only after all of A's younger brothers inherit and after all the descendants of his sisters inherit. This pattern seems also to work for positions, as well.' <sup id="cite_ref-557" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-557">[557]</a></sup> 'A woman's property descends in the same manner, I believe, from “mother” to “daughter” by seniority.' <sup id="cite_ref-558" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-558">[558]</a></sup> Inheritance from father to son was possible under certain conditions, but rarely practiced: 'Traditionally, there has also been some limited opportunity for father-son inheritance. A man has been able, by an oral will (or, more recently, a written one), to leave a part of the property that he has earned or created himself to his children and/or wife, subject to the agreement of his ebusua, Furthermore, modern Ghanaian law permits a Fanti man to leave up to a third of his acquired property to his children and up to a third to his wife. However, in spite of the potentiality, I recorded no cases in Egyaa of sons having inherited anything from their fathers: Egyaa men give their children anything they intend for them to receive during their lifetimes, leaving their whole estate to their ebusua heirs. My understanding was that this is a more traditional and common way of transferring property to men's children than oral wills, though I collected no hard evidence on the question.' <sup id="cite_ref-559" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-559">[559]</a></sup> 'To summarize, the only property a man can transfer to his sons is that which he has personally acquired. His ebusua controls the distribution (normally within the ebusua) of other property which he has held. The persons in the ebusua who are his most likely heirs can be different for different properties since the ordering of likely heirs depends on the genealogical “age” of the property in question.' <sup id="cite_ref-560" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-560">[560]</a></sup> Kronenfeld provides a general description of the property system: 'Thus, the actual social effects of Fanti inheritance rules depend on the durability of property, 1) The only properties (in Egyaa, at least) durable for a long time are positions: lineage leader ( ebusua panyin) and other chiefships or stools belonging to the ebusua. Informants talked about the inheritance of position in the same way that they talked about the inheritance of property, All stools or chiefships (except possibly for some asafo 2) House sites stay within an ebusua normally, but are common enough in Egyaa not to be worth fighting over. Houses themselves seem usually to last 20-30 years at most before needing rebuilding. (This refers to traditional wattle-and-daub or adobe houses. More recent concrete block houses will probably last longer.) Houses, then, may pass down one generation of inheritance, but not much further. 3) Personal property (clothes, utensils, etc.) also seem to have a short useful life, i.e., 10-20 years. 4) Fishing boats have an expected life span of 10 years, nets around 5 years, and motors around 3 years. 5) Women's fish-smoking ovens only seem to last a couple of years. 6) An active farm will be inherited when its owner dies; in fact, however, particular farms (in [Page 27] Egyaa ) only last for a couple of years, and thus are not too important as inherited property. 7) Finally, there does seem to have been a lot of cash in Egyaa which would represent a worthwhile inheritance.

The net effect, I think, is that money deriving from some particular person only goes through a couple of inheritances at most before disappearing (or going into goods).

Other property is very unlikely to last beyond its first owner's immediate heirs.' <sup id="cite_ref-562" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-562">[562]</a></sup> 'The social effects of inheritance are modified, also, by some frequency considerations. Most people do not have much property to leave anyone. Most inheritance that does occur  is brother to brother; only rarely does a nephew inherit from an uncle directly (only once in each generation for any particular property — see Table 2), though eventually the brothers of that nephew (i.e., the other nephews) will get their turn with the property, if they live long enough, and if it lasts.' <sup id="cite_ref-563" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-563">[563]</a></sup> 'There are some general social consequences of the Fanti inheritance pattern that seem worthy of consideration. One of these consequences concerns the effects of different kinds of property on the presence or absence of internal lineage segmentation.

<dd><b>♠ State expropriation ♣ present ♥</b> Stools were owed 'death duties' in gold, slaves and movables: '(a) Death Duties (Ayibuadie): Bowdich mentions that the King of Ashanti was ‘heir to the gold of every subject from the highest to the lowest’,  and thus, according to Ashanti custom, had to contribute to the funeral custom ‘to validate his claim’. This statement, however, requires considerable qualification. While it is correct to state that, theoretically, a Chief (or rather a Stool) would sooner or later become heir—within the strict limitation implied in the Ashanti meaning of the word—to all his subjects, the majority of such death duties were received by a Stool, indirectly. It has been observed that a Chief only has direct dealings with a minority of his subordinate Chiefs, e.g. with his own Mpanyimfo and with his own Birempon, and that these officials have numerous subjects of their own whom the Head-Chief only attempts to control through them. Let us suppose that a wealthy subject died, who happened to be under one of the Mpanyimfo of the Head-Chief's Birempon. The Opanyini would succeed to a specified amount of his subordinate's private personal [Page 108] movable assets, gold-dust, slaves, cloths, and such like. On the Opanyini's death, the Birempon would take a similar proportion of his estate. The Birempon's Head-Chief, i.e. the Head of the whole Territorial Division, would not get anything on these occasions. Later, however, when the Birempon himself died, the Head-Chief would benefit by receiving the death duties from his estate, which would thus include all that he, the Birempon, had collected and accumulated in death duties from his subjects. The potential wealth of Ashanti Chiefs might thus be very great, the amount of their immediately realizable securities very small. The late Mary Kingsley, whose writings on West Africa are remarkable for observation and intuition, wrote: ‘In the capacity (eventually) to command these things his wealth lies. So take the whole together and you will see how you can have a very rich African, who could not possibly pay down £20, but a real millionaire for all that.’ The unfairness of demanding great sums as war indemnities at very short notice, which had been the policy of some of our civil and military commanders in the wars against Ashanti, may thus be realized.' <sup id="cite_ref-565" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-565">[565]</a></sup> 'It is necessary to understand that when, in Ashanti, we speak of a Chief taking part of a man's property on death, only his personal self-acquired movable property is meant. Family property, in the possession of the deceased, which on his death reverted to the family, might not be touched. The proportion of the property of a dead man taken by a Chief varied in specified cases, and this will be noted when the Constitution of individual Stools comes under examination. In this chapter I am concerned with general principles rather than with the more minute details. Ayibuadie means literally ‘something to cover over or help the funeral rite’. There is a word in the vernacular, muhoma (lit. that with which to bind the breasts), which has a significance very similar to ayibuadie. Instead of a Chief coming down upon the estate of a dead subject, i.e. sending his Sana Hene (Treasurer) to lock up his rooms and boxes until the value of the estate had been assessed, he might leave the amount to be paid in death duties to the discretion of the relatives of the deceased. The levy then assumed more the appearance of a voluntary contribution on their part, ‘to bind the breast of the Chief’, ‘whose heart was sore’ owing to the loss of his subject and friend. This method of allowing the death duty to be paid was a more delicate and tactful way of going about the collection of this tax than the other more forcible method, but it practically amounted to [Page 109] the same thing in the end. It must not be overlooked that the claim to receive ayibuadie or muhoma involved some special obligations on the part of the recipient. Both these claims may be traced back to the original cell from which most of these more elaborate customs sprang. The house-father succeeded to the property of his dead kinsman, but he also had to see to it that he gave him a good and proper funeral. By a legal fiction, the Chief stood in a similar relationship to his subject, and by taking some of the latter's property on his death placed himself under the fictitious obligation of having to contribute to his funeral custom. By doing so he did not, however, become liable for the debts of the deceased. A Chief would also take care to see that the balance struck between what came in from ayibuadie or muhoma and what went out in funeral contributions ( nsa or nsawa) was in his favour. There is yet another expression which is sometimes confused with the above, i.e. awunyadie. This term, I think, means the inheritance of property by the legal heir.' <sup id="cite_ref-566" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-566">[566]</a></sup> 'Death duties ( Ayibuadie): The Chief claimed ayibuadie from those subjects who served him directly. He could claim all private property on death of any gyase who was descended down the female line from a gyase female slave. In the case of the descendant of a gyase man who had married a free woman (but a subject of the Chief), a male would enter that company to which his father had belonged, but at his death the Chief would claim only one half of his private belongings, the other half going to his own kindred. The Chief of Kumawu also claimed about two-thirds of the private property of the Heads of the following fekuo (the remaining third went to the Stool of the deceased), the Atum'tufo, Asoamfo, Asokwafo, Barimfo, Obofo, Samanfo, Sodofo. He received from his Mpanyimfo (on their death) a voluntary contribution made by the successor which was known as muhoma, and generally consisted of one of the deceased's wives, a male servant, a cloth, and some gold-dust. The taking of ayibuadie or muhoma implied an obligation to contribute towards the funeral expenses and to present gifts to the dead. In the case of a wealthy man, from whose estate a considerable amount had been received in death duties, this contribution might consist of a velvet pillow ( agopekyi), a silk danta (loin-cloth), in the folds of which was wrapped a suru of gold-dust (£1); 10 s. worth of gold-dust, to mix with the fat which was used to rub down the corpse; the coffin (which it has now become the custom for the children to buy); two or three [Page opp. p 230] [Page 230] cloths, which were buried with the body; a sheep and about 10 s. in gold-dust towards the funeral expenses. In the case of a poor man, the death duties from whose estate would be a small amount, the Chief would give a sheep and a cheap cloth, ‘lest if he did not give anything, the dead should report him to the ' Samanfo (spirits)’. [These obligations are still often observed, possibly from a superstitious dread of reprisals on the part of the dead; the corresponding right to demand ayibuadie, or to expect muhoma, has on the other hand almost entirely lapsed, and this state of affairs is often given as one of the reasons for the impoverished state of Stool finances.] The Chief also informed me of another interesting possible source of revenue in olden times of which I had not previously been aware, though it is possible the custom was not confined to one Division. When the Chief had a son or daughter ( by a wife who was at the same time his own subject), and that child died, the Chief succeeded to all his or her private property and not the child's abusua (kindred group) as would ordinarily be the case. Only a Head-Chief had this right, not the lesser Chiefs—the Mpanyimfo. This rule also applied to the children of the Kyidom Hene, because he was known as the ‘son’ of the Chief.' <sup id="cite_ref-567" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-567">[567]</a></sup> We have provisionally considered this to be a form of state expropriation.</dd>

[MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-573" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-573">[573]</a></sup> Multiple residence patterns were present: 'Domestic organization long remained one of the most ambiguous aspects of Akan social structure. It was Fortes who finally delineated the key structural principles and processes through his research in the 1940s in the communities of Asokore and Agogo. He distinguished three major household types each based on a different residence pattern. First are households grouped around a minimal matrilineage, such as a woman and her sister or daughters, or a man and his sister or sister's son. Such households are based on duolocal residence, with a husband and wife living apart in different domestic units; about 62 percent of the households in Agogo were of this type.' <sup id="cite_ref-574" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-574">[574]</a></sup> 'Second are households consisting of a man, his wife, and their children, sometimes including other kinsfolk; this type of patrilocal or virilocal unit constituted about 22 percent of the households in Agogo. Finally, there are households made up of combinations of the previous types (e.g. a man, his wife, and children) plus his sister's children. Often these reflect an avunculocal residence pattern. The matrilineal domestic group is usually preponderant in the larger communities, while virilocal or patrilocal households are the most common type in small farming villages or hamlets. But all three "types" should be viewed simply as phases in a domestic cycle. In the early years of marriage, residence is predominantly duolocal, but with the passage of time this could shift to avunculocal or patrilocal/virilocal. Thus the composition of a domestic group would evolve over time. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-575" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-575">[575]</a></sup> Fathers played a prominent role in the arrangement of marriages: 'THERE are two forms of marriage recognised in the Fanti districts of the Gold Coast Colony, ( a) Marriage by native custom, and ( b) Marriage under Ordinance No. 14 of 1884 of the Colony.' <sup id="cite_ref-576" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-576">[576]</a></sup> 'I intend to deal only with the native custom, and I may here state that I have always relied rather on illiterate natives and chiefs, for my information, than on educated native men, for the following reasons:—the illiterate native tells one all he knows, or all he dares, and, having no reason to lie when he is not in court, he generally relates facts. A chief is the judge of his people, and, with his councillors, is the repository and exponent of the law, and must necessarily be taken as an expert. The scholar studies anything but his own customs, while an educated native is too inclined to embellish those customs, and present them in a form that would do credit to Justinian.' <sup id="cite_ref-577" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-577">[577]</a></sup> 'According to the Family System of the Tˇw-speaking races of the Gold Coast, although the children belong to the family of the mother, and not of the father, yet the father seems always to have been the person responsible for the marriage of his children.' <sup id="cite_ref-578" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-578">[578]</a></sup> 'He was liable for their maintenance and up-bringing, and was responsible for their actions. Thus if any of his sons, living under his roof, seduced any woman, the father had to pay satisfaction. If any of his daughters were seduced, he claimed and obtained compensation. He supplied his children with means to trade, or to make a living, and in return was entitled to all their earnings. The liability for the sons ceased on their marriage, or when they became self-supporting, so that it was to the father's advantage to find them wives as soon as possible after they reached the age of puberty, and this became recognised as a duty.' <sup id="cite_ref-579" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-579">[579]</a></sup> 'Hence it is clear that primitive negro marriages were interparental contracts, in which the consent of the parties themselves was never considered. The father gave his son a peto and a half of gold dust, and the mother contributed half a peto, to start him in life (a peto being roughly an ounce), and he then worked for himself instead of for his father.' <sup id="cite_ref-580" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-580">[580]</a></sup> 'As time went on fathers came to look on their daughters as sources of income, and demanded sums of money when approached for their hands; this was only natural, as they had nothing to lose by keeping them unmarried, and lost at least their services when they parted with them; whereas unmarried sons were always a possible source of danger.' <sup id="cite_ref-581" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-581">[581]</a></sup> 'Thus it came about, within historical times, that when a man had a marriageable son he approached a man with a marriageable daughter, and having made a suitable present, which varied from one ackie (4 s. 6 d.) to four ackies (18 s.), the two were betrothed, and cohabitation completed the marriage. [Some reckon the ackie as worth 5 s.]' <sup id="cite_ref-582" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-582">[582]</a></sup> 'Sometimes it happened, for personal reasons, that children were betrothed before they were mature; in such cases the boy's parent maintained the girl in her father's house and watched her, and was entitled to satisfaction if she were tampered with. When both had reached puberty the marriage was completed by cohabitation. The betrothal could be broken off meanwhile by the boy's parent, on forfeiting the so-called ‘consawment’ money, or by the girl's parent, by returning the money that had been paid.' <sup id="cite_ref-583" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-583">[583]</a></sup> According to Ffoukes, marriage negotiations became more extensive in the colonial period. There was a lot of regional variation: 'This state continued so long as children quietly submitted to the dictates of their parents, but during the last five centuries the natives have been brought into touch with various European nations, and the much-despised civilisation [Page 33] has tended to modify all their customs and ideas. Sons gradually came to be consulted, and were later allowed to choose their own wives; while the consent of the women was never considered until very recently, and even now it is not usual, except in Coast towns, where girls are far more independent than in the bush.' <sup id="cite_ref-584" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-584">[584]</a></sup> 'The marriage custom, instead of being the simple process of parents pairing off their children, now entails considerable expense. For instance, the present procedure in Cape Coast is as follows:—The relatives of the man (or more often the man himself) approach the relatives of the girl with rum, and if they appear willing a further “dash” is taken, which varies from £1 to 30 s., according to the suitor's circumstances; this is called Abombo or the “knocking” fee, as the suitor knocks at the door to ask for the girl; the father fixes the amount. On the acceptance of the abombo the girl becomes the affianced bride of the man, and although this is only a moral obligation, it is very strictly adhered to, and breach of promise is unknown to native custom. Occasional presents may now be exchanged, and shortly afterwards her parents receive the Etsir-Nsã (Fantee, Etsir a head, Nsã rum), which consists of two flasks of gin and a sum varying from five dollars (£1) to half an ounce of gold (£2) which is distributed amongst her relatives.' <sup id="cite_ref-585" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-585">[585]</a></sup> 'Her parents then may or may not make a further claim for dowry or head money, etsirkyeradzi or etsiradzi (from etsir, “head,” kyere “to show” or “prove,” and adzi, “thing”), of one to two ounces of gold, or £6 to £9; and the man further sends a box to the girl containing cloths, handkerchiefs, a comb, lavender-water and pomade, with perhaps pipes and a supply of tobacco, and a day is fixed to hand the girl over.' <sup id="cite_ref-586" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-586">[586]</a></sup> 'Some time usually elapses between sending the etsir nsã and contributing the etsiradzi, and this, it is alleged, is to give the man and his parents time to watch the character of the girl, as well as to meet the increasing demands of the avaricious parents who fix the dowry; but there is nothing to prevent sending both at once and completing the nuptial ceremony forthwith. However, the negro never does anything in a hurry! No precautions are now taken with the girl other than to warn her not to visit her intended husband's house before she is handed over, and she is never confined before her marriage, but satisfaction must be paid for cohabitation before she is so handed over.' <sup id="cite_ref-587" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-587">[587]</a></sup> 'In Fanti Yankumase [Assin] the custom varies appreciably from Cape Coast, for here the suitor sends to ask the girl's family, without rum or abombo, and if they agree, both families meet to drink rum or palm wine; this ceremony, to show the couple is engaged, is called Wakagyir. Then the man seals his bond by sending three small bottles of gin to the girl's family, and this is termed etsir nsã. He also [Page 35] gives the town crier 1 s. 6 d. to publish his betrothal, and 4 s. to witnesses. He further sends 8 s. to the girl's mother to maintain her until marriage; this payment is called Ntamboba (= Tanbiba, see infra), which implies, “as the mother has looked after the child, now somebody takes her.”' <sup id="cite_ref-588" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-588">[588]</a></sup> 'The matter then waits until the man has sufficient money, and if the girl or her family has a debt he pays it; this they call the etsiradzi. At this stage the Assins make sure that the bride-elect is a virgin, and, if not, lay their claim against the seducer. If there are no debts, the bridegroom merely provides a box, with cloths, handkerchiefs, looking-glass, and perfumes, and takes the bride home.' <sup id="cite_ref-589" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-589">[589]</a></sup> 'In Denkera the matter is much simpler; the man asks the father for his daughter, and notifies the girl's family, if he gets the father's consent, by sending them rum; he then pays her family the abombo, which they fix, and which may vary from £1 to 30 s., and the man takes the girl home; although he may pay a further dowry of £4 or £5, but this is not essential.' <sup id="cite_ref-590" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-590">[590]</a></sup> Marriage and divorce became more regulated in the colonial period: 'The passing of the 1884 Marriage Ordinance Act attempted to set a standard for monogamous marriage and spousal inheritance of self-acquired property. Conflict over inheritance often ended up in court where officials tried to determine whether or not a spouse was a true and therefore legal wife. Women began to organize in the 1950's to change the distinction between ‘wife’ and ‘non-wife’ in order to protect the interests of women and children. The results were the passage of the Maintenance of Children Bill in 1965 and a new divorce law in 1971. [IS]' <sup id="cite_ref-591" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-591">[591]</a></sup> Concubinage was practiced, but the rights of concubines differed from those of wives: 'Concubinage is everywhere practised on the Coast, and is generally respected, although civilisation has made educated natives profess to disparage it; the sole difference amongst the Fantis is, that Mpata or satisfaction can be sued for by a married man if his wife commits adultery, whereas he can obtain no redress in the case of a concubine. Further, a native can hardly be said to buy his wife, as all moneys paid by him are received on trust for the good behaviour of the wife during the marriage, and are returnable to the husband if he divorces his wife for her misconduct, only vesting in her family on her death, or the death of her husband.' <sup id="cite_ref-592" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-592">[592]</a></sup> 'Concubinage is openly permitted, and although it is not encouraged on the Coast, it is widely practised elsewhere. It is really quite as honourable a connection as the native marriage, as couples frequently live through life with no other bond than mutual affection. The essential difference is that for lack of consideration the man cannot claim damages if the woman misconducts herself; and if the man misbehaves, the woman has only to leave him at will. In fact the difference is all in favour of the woman, as will be seen when dealing with divorce. Even a married man may keep a concubine openly if his wife has no objection, but she cooks only at the wife's request; it is when a man keeps concubines clandestinely or against his wife's will that the custom is deprecated, and he has to “pacify” her whenever she finds him out. Wives do not appear to discourage it so long as they themselves get their fair share of attention. Whatever is given to a concubine is given outright, and cannot be reclaimed if she chooses to leave him for someone else. Her children can hardly be called illegitimate, as they still belong to her family, and as in the case of a chieftainess the children succeed to the stool. If she has children, and then marries another man, the natural father usually takes and brings them up, so that they may bury him; but if he does not, the husband is obliged to look after them.' <sup id="cite_ref-593" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-593">[593]</a></sup> 'There is this great difference, however, that, whereas the father of legitimate children is bound to support them, and he is responsible for all their acts, the natural father is not so bound, the obligation and liability falling on the woman's family; he only does so to keep up his good name, and the children do not participate equally in the funeral expenses.' <sup id="cite_ref-594" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-594">[594]</a></sup> Levirate was also practiced: 'There is a peculiar exception to one of these prohibitions, for when a Fanti dies he is succeeded by his eldest surviving brother, and if he has no brothers, by his eldest sister's eldest son. If the brother succeeds, he is said to take his [Page 44] place, and part of his duty is to marry the widow; this is called Okuranba; if the nephew ( Awofasepenyin) inherits he has a wider choice, for if the man leaves a daughter the nephew can take his choice between the widow and her daughter, but he cannot marry both. ' <sup id="cite_ref-595" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-595">[595]</a></sup> Husbands were obliged to pay compensation to the wife in the case of divorce unless a legitimate reason for the dissolution of the marriage could be provided: 'The Fantis assert that a man may repudiate his wife at will, but, if no substantial reason is given, he forfeits the dowry and all payments made on her behalf, pays all her expenses, and in addition pays her heavy compensation, so that it is never done. Elsewhere repudiation at will is unknown.' <sup id="cite_ref-596" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-596">[596]</a></sup> 'The following are held to be good grounds on which a husband may divorce his wife:— (1) Adultery. (2) Repeatedly insulting the husband's parents. (3) Refusal on the part of the woman to cohabit, after the man has preferred his claim against an adulterer. (4) If she becomes a notorious thief or criminal. (5) If she persists in not consenting to his taking another wife. (6) If the wife practises witchcraft. (7) Desertion.' <sup id="cite_ref-597" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-597">[597]</a></sup> 'In all these cases it is usual for both families to meet, and appoint an arbitrator, who may be the chief or any other person to whose decision they agree to submit. The case is gone into in the presence of both families, and if the grounds are held to be sufficient, the man is ordered to “chop” ( i.e., pipe-clay) the neck and breast of the woman, and she has to parade the town to publish the fact, and to show that she is free to marry again. If she was in the wrong, the man could then claim from her family restitution of the dowry, and all the expenses he had incurred throughout the marriage on her behalf, except the actual expense of maintaining her, doctor's bills, and the cloths that she had worn out; all jewels and the cloths that he had given her and which were not worn out are also returned. In Assin she is chalked on the foot. In Denkera she is not chalked at all, and here, although actual current expenses are awarded, they are invariably remitted.' <sup id="cite_ref-598" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-598">[598]</a></sup> 'In the case of adultery, the husband can turn the woman [Page 47] out on the spot and refuse her all further support. Inquiry might show that she had committeed adultery after gross ill-treatment or desertion; in such cases a divorce would be decreed, but the man would forfeit his expenses. For adultery he also has an alternative, in that he could sue the adulterer for damages (Birebu), which might be more than the expenses that he could claim, and are never less; this depends on his position. In Cape Coast he has to elect, and cannot claim a divorce at the same time; he can only proceed to a divorce if the woman now refuses to pay some small satisfaction, and further refuses to live with him. In Assin he may divorce as well as claim. When a wife repeatedly inveighs against her husband's family, the family take the matter up, and the husband has to get a divorce or break with his family, but all endeavours are first made to persuade the woman to desist.' <sup id="cite_ref-599" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-599">[599]</a></sup> 'In the case of theft, unless the wife is notorious, she pacifies the husband with a sheep, and the marriage continues. If the husband refuses, he forfeits his moneys; if the woman refuses, he can claim all.' <sup id="cite_ref-600" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-600">[600]</a></sup> 'Where a woman refuses her consent to a new wife, she is invariably won over by a handsome dash.' <sup id="cite_ref-601" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-601">[601]</a></sup> Women could not divorce their husbands directly, but courts could order men to divorce their wives on their behalf: 'A wife cannot divorce her husband, and the husband may always claim the Ayifur if she marries any other man without being first chalked. She can, however, take him before a native court on the following grounds:—(1) Continuous illtreatment. (2) His repeated insults to her family. (3) Aggravated assault. (4) If he is a notorious thief. (5) Desertion.' <sup id="cite_ref-602" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-602">[602]</a></sup> 'If she gets judgment the court orders the husband to “chop” her to show she is free; he further forfeits all his expenses, and has to give up all her property that he has in his possession. Also, if there have been loans or money transactions between them, accounts are rendered and balances struck. In Fanti Yankumase the husband is entitled to recover his expenses in all cases of divorce.' <sup id="cite_ref-603" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-603">[603]</a></sup> Given how adultery was recognized as constituting legitimate grounds for divorce, we have decided to code 'present'.</dd>

The basic group is the clan, of which there are eight; they are dispersed among the many kingdoms. Members of a subclan tend to occupy a single town or village. The clan is an exogamous group. It is comprised of constituent groups that may be referred to as lineages, but these do not form any kind of segmentary lineage system, lineages being attached to others by propinquity and the power and wealth of the host lineage. Although there has been much confusion in accounts of the Akan peoples between matriliny and matriarchy, authority within clans and lineages is held firmly by men, succession being from a man to his brother or to his closest sister's son.' <sup id="cite_ref-604" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-604">[604]</a></sup> 'A child inherits his or her blood from the mother, and character or temperament from the father. Maternal blood ensures the child's membership in the ABUSUA (clan or lineage); paternity bestows membership in one of nine other groups or categories. Although some accounts claim the Akan descent system is one of double descent, this view appears to be based on a misreading of the actual roles of the two lines of descent. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-605" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-605">[605]</a></sup> 'There are groups in which membership is transmitted patrilineally, but these are neither exogamous nor corporate groups; nor are jural or political rights or duties derived from paternal descent. What is involved is the concept of NTORO; the male transmitted NTORO (spirit) which forms a unique spiritual bond between father and son. Following this principle, every person belongs to one of a limited number of named quasi-ritual categories, the ntoro divisions. Members of the same ntoro division are required to observe certain taboos, perform certain rituals, and are believed to have some common personality characteristics. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-606" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-606">[606]</a></sup> 'Consistent with the emphasis on matrilineal descent is the fact that the system of kinship terminology is of the Crow type. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-607" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-607">[607]</a></sup> Female stools and councils complemented male power hierarchies: 'Female stools complemented the hierarchy of male stools. In the village the elders, mpanyinfo, heads of the matrilineages, who constituted with the odekro the village council, had their aberewa or obaapanyin, who looked after the women's affairs. The odekro had an obaapanyin who was responsible for the affairs of the women of the village and was a member of the village council; the ohene, head of a division, and the omanhene, head of the autonomous political community, had their female counterparts known as ohemma, female ruler, who sat on their councils. The ohene and the ohemma were all of the same mogya, blood, or clan. The Asantehemma, the occupant of the female stool of the Kumasi state, and therefore of united Asante, since her male counterpart was ex officio the Asantehene, king of Asante, was a member of the Kotoko council, the executive committee or cabinet of the Asanteman Nhyiamu, general assembly of Asante rulers.' <sup id="cite_ref-608" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-608">[608]</a></sup> 'As members of their respective councils, female stool occupants participated in the legislative and judicial processes, in the making and the unmaking of war, and in the distribution of land, the basic resource of the economy. An ohemma of a state also had her own ntam, oath, a formula for starting the judicial process, and her own court, as well as her own okyeame (spokesman) who in the Akan courts acted as prosecutor and judge.'  <sup id="cite_ref-609" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-609">[609]</a></sup> 'An ohemma was a refuge for a fugitive from the ohene's court who often successfully sought her intervention in cases of the death penalty. Called the ‘mother’ of the ohene, she was the latter's most effective adviser and she had the right to administer to him even a public admonition. The ohemma was the aberewa, wisdom personified: an Akan court panel preceded their retirement to discuss a case before passing judgement by saying that they were going to consult aberewa,the old woman. As the aberewa of the town, the ohemma was the moral guardian of the females of the political community and a kind of moral censor: she examined adolescent girls before the main puberty rites which ushered them into adulthood and licensed their marriage, and was expected to say whether or not pregnancy had occurred before the rites. A girl who was found to have become pregnant before the rites was known as kyiribra, and was punished [Page 94] with ostracism together with her partner. The polity thrived on a sound moral order.' <sup id="cite_ref-610" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-610">[610]</a></sup> 'As the abrewa, the ohemma was also custodian of ‘custom’. She was officially the foremost authority on the genealogy of the royal matrilineage, and hence the first and final arbiter on who was qualified by blood to be a male ruler; it was said of the ohemma's stool in relation to the male stool that it was the elder stool, akonnua panyin. It was the ohemma who played the leading role in the selection of a successor to a deceased or destooled (removed from office) ohene.' <sup id="cite_ref-611" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-611">[611]</a></sup> 'The ohemma's role in the succession to a vacant stool can be understood in terms, first, of the composite nature of most of the Akan matrilineages and, secondly, of the Akan rules of succession. The composite nature of the Akan matrilineage lay not in its segmentation over time and space, but in the incorporation into it of ‘stranger’ segments which in time became concealed; even when it was known it was not permitted for outsiders to point it out. ‘Stranger’ segments could be descended from slave women or freeborn women of another clan who, therefore, were not of pure blood and whose descendants were not eligible for the stool. The ohemma was the one who could pronounce on the fitness of potential successors for the stool from the viewpoint of true descent from the founding ancestors/ancestresses.' <sup id="cite_ref-612" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-612">[612]</a></sup> 'Secondly, while the Akan vested the right of succession in the royal matrilineage, they left open the question of the actual successor among the eligible males, which was resolved by joint consultations between the ohemma, as leader of the royal matrilineage, and the members of the village, divisional, or national council. In the process of consultation the ohemma and the council were governed by the following rules: brothers should succeed each other before sisters' sons in the order of seniority in age; but age could be discounted in favour of superior wisdom and character in a junior person. Seniority in age could also be discounted in favour of a younger successor, if rotational succession among the segments of the royal lineage had been adopted as a ‘convention’ by the lineage and the community as a whole. Where rotation had been adopted as a working rule, both the male and female stools rotated among the segments, so that at any moment the occupants belonged to different competing segments.' <sup id="cite_ref-613" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-613">[613]</a></sup> 'It was the ohemma who operated these rules and ensured orderly succession to the stool. On the decease or de-stoolment of an ohene, the members of the council formally asked the ohemma to nominate a candidate for their approval, and gave her three succeeding options at the end of which the councillors could in turn present a candidate for her approval. It rarely, if ever, came to this. An ohemma consulted members of her matrilineage, her husband, if she had one, and the community at large through discreet inquiries by her nkotimsefo, [Page 95] household servants, who, like the palace functionaries, were so selected as to represent the various sections of the community. The candidate she turned up was thus more often than not the result of communal consensus. It was easy to arrive at this kind of consensus in the small-scale, face-to-face communities of the period before colonial rule.' <sup id="cite_ref-614" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-614">[614]</a></sup> However, female heads of household would delegate authority to eldest sons and other male relatives: 'I have mentioned that the eldest member of the family is recognised as the head, but where this member is a woman, and more particularly where the family is connected with a stool, the head delegates her authority to her eldest son, or the eldest male in the family. Women have, however, been [Page 400] known to occupy the stool as reigning chiefs. Adoption proper is unknown, but if a distressed native commends himself to a family, and they approve, he is received by them as a domestic slave, and, as such, becomes absorbed into it. Again, in Fanti Yankumase, for instance, if a member of another tribe settles with them, and his sept, the Kwonna (say) will not help him, he may choose one of the others, who will, and he henceforth is treated as a member of the latter.' <sup id="cite_ref-615" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-615">[615]</a></sup> According to Rattray, women were not oppressed by husbands and other men due to support from their matrilineage: 'In the chapter on ‘the Ashanti Classificatory System’ it was [Page 79] recorded that wives were inherited in exactly the same way as any other property; even in the case of a chief who is not dead but who has been deposed, or de-stooled as it is called in West Africa, his successor has a perfect right to have his predecessor's wives transferred to him equally with any other stool property. Again, on examination of the marriage laws, it will be found that, under certain circumstances, the native idiom for ‘to marry’ is to 'yere, lit. ‘buy a wife’.' <sup id="cite_ref-616" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-616">[616]</a></sup> 'These two isolated instances, removed from their proper context, might well lead the casual observer to suppose that an Ashanti wife was little better than a man's chattel and to point to the servile condition of women.' <sup id="cite_ref-617" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-617">[617]</a></sup> 'But in Ashanti no woman stands alone, for behind the woman stand a united family, bound by the tie of blood, which has here a power and a meaning we can hardly grasp. ‘If you see one parrot do not throw a stone at it, for there are many others,’ runs one of their sayings.' <sup id="cite_ref-618" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-618">[618]</a></sup> 'The whole conception of ‘mother-right’ affords the woman a protection and a status that is more than an adequate safeguard against the ill-treatment by any male or group of males.' <sup id="cite_ref-619" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-619">[619]</a></sup> 'Her children belong to her and her clan, not to that of her husband.' <sup id="cite_ref-620" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-620">[620]</a></sup> 'All her individually acquired and inherited property is hers and her clan's, and her husband cannot touch it.

Nowadays however, this has somewhat changed owing to the unequal spreading of education.' <sup id="cite_ref-626" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-626">[626]</a></sup> 'The status of women and especially old women has declined. Young school girls are often rated higher than their mothers and grandmothers by society who call them “awuraa”, madam. Secretly the old women resent it and the younger members feel guilty towards them and therefore try to ward off their guilt feeling by accusing the old women of witchery. A student writes: “Because witchery is mostly attributed to old women, any misfortune that occurs in the family of such a woman is accredited to her. If care is not taken, such women will be cast out from family matters entirely”.

With respect to crafts, only pottery making is a female activity; the others are restricted to male specialists. Even in the case of pottery making, only men are allowed to fashion pots or pipes representing anthropomorphic or zoomorphic figures.

Husbands could take concubines, but wives could not take (legitimate) lovers (see above). Husbands could divorce their wives: 'The Fantis assert that a man may repudiate his wife at will, but, if no substantial reason is given, he forfeits the dowry and all payments made on her behalf, pays all her expenses, and in addition pays her heavy compensation, so that it is never done. Elsewhere repudiation at will is unknown.' <sup id="cite_ref-629" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-629">[629]</a></sup> 'The following are held to be good grounds on which a husband may divorce his wife:— (1) Adultery. (2) Repeatedly insulting the husband's parents. (3) Refusal on the part of the woman to cohabit, after the man has preferred his claim against an adulterer. (4) If she becomes a notorious thief or criminal. (5) If she persists in not consenting to his taking another wife. (6) If the wife practises witchcraft. (7) Desertion.' <sup id="cite_ref-630" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-630">[630]</a></sup> 'In all these cases it is usual for both families to meet, and appoint an arbitrator, who may be the chief or any other person to whose decision they agree to submit. The case is gone into in the presence of both families, and if the grounds are held to be sufficient, the man is ordered to “chop” ( i.e., pipe-clay) the neck and breast of the woman, and she has to parade the town to publish the fact, and to show that she is free to marry again. If she was in the wrong, the man could then claim from her family restitution of the dowry, and all the expenses he had incurred throughout the marriage on her behalf, except the actual expense of maintaining her, doctor's bills, and the cloths that she had worn out; all jewels and the cloths that he had given her and which were not worn out are also returned. In Assin she is chalked on the foot.

Inquiry might show that she had committeed adultery after gross ill-treatment or desertion; in such cases a divorce would be decreed, but the man would forfeit his expenses. For adultery he also has an alternative, in that he could sue the adulterer for damages (Birebu), which might be more than the expenses that he could claim, and are never less; this depends on his position. In Cape Coast he has to elect, and cannot claim a divorce at the same time; he can only proceed to a divorce if the woman now refuses to pay some small satisfaction, and further refuses to live with him. In Assin he may divorce as well as claim. When a wife repeatedly inveighs against her husband's family, the family take the matter up, and the husband has to get a divorce or break with his family, but all endeavours are first made to persuade the woman to desist.' <sup id="cite_ref-632" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-632">[632]</a></sup> 'In the case of theft, unless the wife is notorious, she pacifies the husband with a sheep, and the marriage continues.

<dd><b>♠ Social class ♣ present ♥</b> Society was organized in matrilineal kin groups rather than castes: 'All Akan groups recognize matrilineal descent. The basic group is the clan, of which there are eight; they are dispersed among the many kingdoms. Members of a subclan tend to occupy a single town or village. The clan is an exogamous group. It is comprised of constituent groups that may be referred to as lineages, but these do not form any kind of segmentary lineage system, lineages being attached to others by propinquity and the power and wealth of the host lineage. Although there has been much confusion in accounts of the Akan peoples between matriliny and matriarchy, authority within clans and lineages is held firmly by men, succession being from a man to his brother or to his closest sister's son.' <sup id="cite_ref-637" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-637">[637]</a></sup> 'A child inherits his or her blood from the mother, and character or temperament from the father. Maternal blood ensures the child's membership in the ABUSUA (clan or lineage); paternity bestows membership in one of nine other groups or categories. Although some accounts claim the Akan descent system is one of double descent, this view appears to be based on a misreading of the actual roles of the two lines of descent. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-638" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-638">[638]</a></sup> 'There are groups in which membership is transmitted patrilineally, but these are neither exogamous nor corporate groups; nor are jural or political rights or duties derived from paternal descent. What is involved is the concept of NTORO; the male transmitted NTORO (spirit) which forms a unique spiritual bond between father and son. Following this principle, every person belongs to one of a limited number of named quasi-ritual categories, the ntoro divisions. Members of the same ntoro division are required to observe certain taboos, perform certain rituals, and are believed to have some common personality characteristics. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-639" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-639">[639]</a></sup> 'Consistent with the emphasis on matrilineal descent is the fact that the system of kinship terminology is of the Crow type.

Security of tenure was based on working the land. Abandoned land reverted to the stool. Rights to land were inherited matrilineally. Today Akan have the right to sell land although leasing seems to be the preferred arrangement. [IS]' <sup id="cite_ref-641" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-641">[641]</a></sup> 'The localized matrilineage tracing descent from a known common female ancestor for a period of 10 to 12 generations is the basic unit for political, legal, and ritual purposes.

[ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-642" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-642">[642]</a></sup> Lineage segments were differentiated along the lines of heritable interest in property: 'Segments: While the lineage as a whole has some corporate concern with sponsoring the funeral of any of its members and with assigning that member's property to an heir, heritable interests in various properties can differentiate lineage members. Subsets of the membership of a lineage — equalling lineage segments — are defined by the existence of any property for which members of the subsets (exclusive of others) are potential heirs. Such sets (subsets of the whole) may range from, at the one extreme, only the actual children of some man's actual sisters (in the case of property that he himself created) to, at the other extreme, all the members of the lineage (in the case of property, in effect, created by the lineage founder). In Egyaa, only chiefly positions fall in the long-lived extreme, while (almost) all other created property (in Egyaa) falls in or near the short-lived extreme. No property in Egyaa falls enough in between the two extremes to matter, but property that survived long enough to be inherited through several generations (but not substantially longer) were such to exist, would create sets of members representing intermediate segments of the lineage's membership.' <sup id="cite_ref-643" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-643">[643]</a></sup> Slavery was practiced: 'The Akan practiced slavery, obtaining slaves from northern slave dealers, usually Muslims. War captives, criminals, persons who opposed local chiefs, and many local ritual leaders were also enslaved. Slaves were used for domestic and field labor, for sale to traders across the Sahara and Atlantic, and as sacrifices to royal and other ancestors. In the middle of the nineteenth century, slaves amounted to half of the population in many towns. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-644" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-644">[644]</a></sup> Wealthy urban families relied on unfree labour, but wealth stratification had emerged before the colonial period: 'The Portuguese “blueprint” of 1572 associates gold mining, forest clearing, and food production, and implicitly postulates the existence [Page 96] of an appropriating class and a producing class. It is, I suggest, mutatis mutandis, a paradigm of sorts for the early Akan state. Those who controlled the production and sale of gold were those able to procure a supply of unfree labor. Those who procured unfree labor were those able to create arable land within the forest. Those who created the arable were those who founded the numerous early Akan polities. We see, in other words, a class of Akan entrepreneurs emerging: a class of those able to use the strength of the world bullion market, and the availability of labor locally (whether through Wangara or Portuguese suppliers), in such a way as to create the new agrarian system. These entrepreneurs were known as the aberemp[unavailable]n (sing. [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n), literally “big men” but correctly glossed in an early European source as “a superior rich man.” ' <sup id="cite_ref-645" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-645">[645]</a></sup> 'Akan village histories make frequent reference to hunters ranging the forest in search of land suitable for agricultural exploitation—taking account, presumably, of surface relief, water resources, soil, and so forth. The role of the aberemp[unavailable]n in these explorations is often described in considerable detail. By way of illustration I shall cite the cases of two, Tabiri Heman and Akuamoa Panin.' <sup id="cite_ref-646" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-646">[646]</a></sup> 'The descendants of free settlers became [unavailable]manmufo, citizens. Those of the proprietors became adehyeε, nobility. There remain the unfree laborers. They must surely be those who became the third major element in the composition of an [unavailable]man, namely the gyaasefo. Literally “the people of the hearth,” they were absorbed into Akan society as servants of the adehyeε. They became responsible not only for their own subsistence but for that of the nobles. They farmed for them, assumed responsibility for their debts, and provided them with a wide range of personal services as stool-carriers, drummers, hornblowers, umbrella-carriers, bathroom attendants, messengers, tradesmen, sextons, and so forth. Their masters (or mistresses) were heirs to their property. Their status, unlike that of nobles and citizens, was transmitted through the male line. Rattray commented on the matter: [Page 100] 'There is little doubt that the Gyasefo were in olden times recruited from the slave class. A “Stool” slave became one of the Gyasefo. The descendants of a Gyase woman were of course considered as Gyasefo, down the female line for all time; not only was this so, but the son of a Gyase man would ordinarily also enter the office to which his father belonged, irrespective of the position of his mother.' <sup id="cite_ref-647" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-647">[647]</a></sup> 'It is virtually impossible to render such terms as adehyeε, [unavailable]manmufo and gyaasefo into English with the appropriate nuances. Adehyeε may preside over the affairs of anything from villages on the one hand to kingdoms on the other. Their power will rest in no small measure upon the sheer numbers of gyaasefo whose services they command; indeed, this is one index of their rank. In 1936 Oheneba Sakyi Djan manfully struggled with the problem, though with reference to the more southerly forest Akan: 'The term “Gyaase”…applies to the most immediate adherents attached to the household of any important personage. In this instance, even an ordinary well-to-do man (rich man) may have his own Gyaase, so much so that the head of a family (Opanyin or Atrankonnua) or a ruler of a town (Odekro), or a head of a division of a state (Ohene) or the supreme head or king of a state (Omanhene) should necessarily have his own Gyaase-men, and the number of the members constituting the Gyaase of each of the above heads depends on the importance of the party concerned. That is to say, the number of the members of the Gyaase attached to the Ohene's household is by far fewer than that attached to the Omanhene household.' It was all to do with achievement. The fortunes of an [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n depended first on his ability to procure the labor that, the estate established, became his gyaasefo, and second on his ability to attract free settlers to the estate. Measured in these terms the relatively unsuccessful [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n emerged as no more than a village head, an [unavailable]dekuro, and was absorbed in time into the aman (qua state) of his more successful peer, the [unavailable]hene of this or that group of towns and villages, and he in turn into the aman (qua kingdom) of those even more successful. We turn to a consideration of the most successful of all.' <sup id="cite_ref-648" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-648">[648]</a></sup> 'ON THE BASIS OF HIS observations of Kumase society in 1817, Bowdich became strongly aware of the degree of social stratification present. Of the many indicators of this—housing, diet, hygiene, toiletry, marriage, and so forth —he commented most fully on matters of the household economy:[Page 140] 'the higher class could not support their numerous followers, or the lower their large families, in the city, and therefore employed them in plantations (in which small crooms [villages] were situated) generally within two or three miles of the capital, where their labours not only feed themselves, but supply the wants of the chief, his family, and more immediate suite. The middling orders station their slaves for the same purpose, and also to collect fruit and vegetables for sale, and when their children become numerous, a part are generally sent to be supported by these slaves in the bush.' <sup id="cite_ref-649" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-649">[649]</a></sup> 'Bowdich's “higher class” would appear to refer to the wealthy citizens, high officeholders for the most part, whose gyaasefo or “retainers” supported them; his “middling orders” to aspirant citizens  in the process of creating, through utilization of slaves, their own gyaasefo; and his “lower class” to those who perforce ensured their survival by the use of family labor. If Bowdich may be understood to be suggesting that the commanding morality of metropolitan society was one of upward mobility based on wealth, then he was undoubtedly correct. Had Bowdich remained in Kumase a few months longer, he would have observed that upward mobility was an institutionalized process.' <sup id="cite_ref-650" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-650">[650]</a></sup> Accordingly, political influence was tied to wealth. New formal titles were created for individuals who gained wealth and thus became part of an emerging 'bourgeoisie': 'Those who attained wealth in Asante were known as the sikafo, “the monied people.” This category subsumed the smaller group of those who acquired fortunes sufficiently substantial for them to seek formal recognition of their achievement. Of these, those able to demonstrate that they had acquired through their own enterprise a modest fortune of 125 peredwans might, with the approval of the Asantehene, obtain the entitlement of wearing in public a specially designed and woven cloth known as nyaw[unavailable]ho, “you have become rich.” It would seem that it was after the acquisition of such a resource in gold dust that the aspirant (and wise) citizen would begin to invest in people and land. The title to be acquired thereby was that of asafohene, an ancient one originally and exclusively meaning “a war captain.” But the title was available at different levels depending upon the number of subjects acquired. As noticed above, Yamoa Ponko gifted to his son, Gyesi Kwame, 100 subjects, and thereby Gyesi Kwame acquired the comparatively low-ranking dignity of an asafohene of the Kyidom Stool. By contrast, in late 1861 or early 1862 the Akyempemhene Owusu Koko, already an occupant of high office in Kumase, nevertheless publicly displayed his three thousand subjects—each in possession of a gun—who must be assumed to have represented self-acquired property. An asafohene able to show command of at least a thousand subjects was entitled not only to wear the nyaw[unavailable]ho cloth but also to have a horse-tail switch ( bodua) carried before him. It was, however, the right to use not the horse-tail but the elephant-tail switch ( mena or mmara) that was the most coveted of all honors—and one carrying with it use of the ancient title of [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n.' <sup id="cite_ref-651" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-651">[651]</a></sup> 'However many sikafo aspired to the award of the elephant tail, relatively few seem to have achieved it. Three successful nineteenth century claimants are well documented, namely, Gyaasewahene Opoku Frefre (died 1826), Ankobeahene Kwaku Tawia (died ca. 1850), and Manwerehene Kwasi Brantuo (died 1865). There were certainly others. A description of the ceremony surrounding the award was given by the Akyeamehene Kwasi Nuama in 1925. Because it is the fullest account of the procedures known to me, I cite it fully: 'Those chiefs who were allowed to use elephant tails were called Abrempons. A chief who lives on his own land with his own subjects is known by the King as Abrempon. An Abrempon must exhibit his wealth publicly by presenting £9 6s. [i.e., 1 peredwan with supplementary mmataho] to all the Abrempons in Kumase; and 10 peregwans (£80) to the King. He would then go to Tafo and pay £1 6s. to the chief there who would give him an egg to throw against a silk cotton tree. He would then return to Kumasi. He would then go to Essumja Santimanso and buy a carpet ( nsa) for £24 [3 peregwans] from the subjects of the Chief there. He must only dance on it and leave it after presenting Essumjahene with another £24. Your going and coming expenses (including the £48) will cost you some 20 pregwans. He would buy an elephant tail from the Assinhene (son of Essumjahene) for £9 6s. He would tie the elephant tail round the waist of one of his slaves and he must then past [ sic] round the outskirts of the town lying on the leaves of palm trees which have been strewn around the town, firing at his slave with blank fire from time to time. The slave falls down eventually and he then cuts the string to which the tail is fastened and takes the tail—then the ceremonies are completed, and his people applaud him. Next morning he would get mashed yam mixed with 30 peregwans and be carried on a litter round the town of Kumasi scattering largesse of the yam mixture. On the following morning he would be carried in a litter with all his regalia, his skin plastered with white clay. Then he would fix up a spear at Dwebirim (the market place) and challenge those of the same rank to remove it. After this he is called Brempon. On the last day anyone who aspires to the rank of Abrempon takes out the spear and appoints a time for performing the same ceremonies.' The Akyeamehene thus identified six stages in the ceremony. The first, the payments to the aberemp[unavailable]n of the capital and to the Asantehene, requires little comment. In the early nineteenth century Hutchison noted that the first step was, for obvious reasons, taken only “by those who are in favour with the King, and think themselves safe from palavers.” The second and third stages, the visits to Tafo and Asantemanso, involved the candidate in ancient rituals the nature of which will not be [Page 142] examined here; suffice to remind the reader that Tafo was an old (“aboriginal”) trading center, and Asantemanso one of the “cradles” of the Akan.' <sup id="cite_ref-652" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-652">[652]</a></sup> 'The fourth stage of the ceremony, that of catching of the “elephant,” was, by a fortunate chance, once witnessed by the missionary W. West on his visit to Kumase with Owusu Ansa in 1862. Although West does not name the candidate, one may be reasonably confident that it was the Kumase Manwerehene, Kwasi Brantuo. On March 29 West noted the arrival of several dignitaries in Kumase, “to take part in the ceremony, which was that of the display of wealth, by an old chief, in order to be entitled to the honour of having the elephant's tail carried before him; an honour to which only the wealthy can aspire.” he actual charade occurred the next day: 'A slave had been selected to enact the part of the elephant. Besmeared all over with chalk, holding in his hand a small tusk, which he occasionally applied to his mouth, and having an elephant's tail attached by a piece of string behind, he was started off; while some forty or fifty men, armed with muskets, and supplied with blank cartridges, followed in pursuit, keeping up an almost constant fire. His elephantship as we were informed, made his way, according to usage, to a small kroom [village] not far from Kumasi, where he fell down as if shot, and lay there until the chief himself appeared to cut off the tail; who, having thus hunted the elephant, and possessed himself of its caudal appendage, was considered, as I suppose, entitled to have it borne before him.' The “kroom” near Kumase at which the chase ended was, seemingly, a parcel of land that the Akwamuhene donated to aspirant aberemp[unavailable]n. Kwasi Brantuo was, in fact, given the Adiebeba lands in 1862 by the Kumase Akwamuhene Akwawua Dente; and Opoku Frefre, whose candidacy will be referred to next, was awarded the Daakwadwam lands by Akwawua Dente's forerunner in office, Kwakye Kofi.' <sup id="cite_ref-653" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-653">[653]</a></sup> 'IN THE COURSE OF HIS VISIT to Kumase in 1817, Bowdich testified unambiguously to the connection between office and wealth. “The chiefs,” he wrote, 'are fed bountifully by the labours of their slaves, and sharing large sums of the revenue (the fines their oppression has imposed on other governments), with incalculable fees for corruption or interference, refine upon the splendour of equipage even to satiety, and still possess a large surplus of income daily accumulating' Bowdich was, however, also aware of the prejudice that existed, on the part of the older aristocratic families whose fortunes had been consolidated during the wars of expansion in the earlier eighteenth century, against the parvenu rich whose profits derived principally from trade. Bowdich recorded what was clearly a partisan view of the issue. Of the encouragement of trade, he commented, 'their government would repress rather than countenance the inclination (believing no state can be aggrandized but by conquest), lest their genius for war might be enervated by it, and lest, either from the merchants increasing to a body too formidable for their wishes to be resisted, or too artful from their experience to be detected, they might sacrifice the national honour and ambition to their avarice, and furnishing Inta [Gonja], Dagwumba [Dagomba], or any of their more powerful neighbours (who have yielded to circumstances rather than force) with guns and powder (which are never to be exported from Ashantee), break the spell of their conquests, and undermine their powers.' Again, David Hume's general observations on the development of a merchant class are highly pertinent: 'This perhaps is the chief advantage which arises from commerce with strangers. It rouses men from their indolence; and presenting the gayer and more opulent part of the nation with objects of luxury, which they never before dreamed of, raises in them a desire of a more splendid way of life than what their ancestors enjoyed. And at the same time, the few merchants, who possess the secret of this importation and exportation, make great profits; and becoming rivals in wealth to the ancient nobility, tempt other adventurers to become their rivals in commerce.' [Page 152] Bowdich's report of the views of the Asante nobility appears to echo Hume: 'Were they to encourage commerce, pomp, the idol of which they are most jealous, would soon cease to be their prerogative, because it would be attainable by others; the traders growing wealthy, would vie with them; and for their own security, stimulated by reflections they have now too little at risk to originate, they would unite to repress the arbitrary power of the Aristocracy; and even if they did not, inevitably (as the chiefs conceive) divert the people's genius for war.' <sup id="cite_ref-654" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-654">[654]</a></sup> 'It would be easy to regard such appointees, collectively, as constituting a collaborating class. But one of the purposes of this essay has been to suggest that such a concept is of little analytical importance. It has been shown that those who were to collaborate with the colonial authorities had adopted ideological positions sharply divergent from the prevailing political mores long before the loss of Asante independence could have been foreseen. It has been suggested here that in the last quarter of the nineteenth century the fundamental challenge to the dominant mercantile ideology in Asante was presented by an embryonic bourgeoisie committed to the principles of laissez faire and that no analysis of the acute political conflicts which divided the Asante nation in that period is possible without reference to such ideological factors. Moreover, the history of the Gold Coast and of Ghana in the twentieth century can be understood, I believe, only with adequate reference to the nineteenth-century situation. The development of the cocoa industry represented, perhaps, the triumph of a new bourgeoisie “liberated” by the forces of colonialism. The economic policies of Kwame Nkrumah are to be seen as in many respects reviving those of Mensa Bonsu and Agyeman Prempeh, recognizing that the rapid development of the national economy must necessarily involve, albeit on mutually acceptable terms, the participation of foreign capital and expertise. The policies of Kofi Busia appeared designed, conversely, to stimulate the growth of the indigenous middle class. Subsequent governments have vacillated between these alternative paths to salvation.' <sup id="cite_ref-655" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-655">[655]</a></sup> While attributing class structures to non-capitalist economies is difficult, Wilks distinguishes between 'nobles', an emerging urban 'bourgeoisie', free farmers, and unfree servants: 'It is notoriously difficult to characterize the class structure of precapitalist societies. To this generalization Asante is no exception, though R. A. Kea's studies of a number of seventeenth century Akan polities have provided an invaluable lead.  For present purposes the postulate is that a class reproduces itself as a class and that it does so only insofar as it has a determinate and specific, though not necessarily direct, relationship to the means of production. Consider, for example, the Asante class of the adehyeε, a word commonly but inappropriately translated [Page 294] “royalty” in English. “The old adage” (and I quote the collective wisdom of the late Asantehene and his councillors in a judgment passed down in 1964) “is that a royal is one whose ancestor had established or founded a village." This succinct statement of traditional usage defines a class within Asante society by implicit reference to a set of proprietary rights over land exercised by those who were thereby able to appropriate, in the form of tributes, taxes, and services, part of the labor-value of others settled on the land. I have elsewhere suggested that the origins of the adehyeε class are to be sought in the context of the great economic transformations associated with the development of forest agriculture. I have also suggested that the gyaasefo emerged as a servile class in precisely the same context. In this chapter I argue that the asomfo, or those in administrative service, came to constitute a class within Asante society in precisely the same sense of class. Unlike both adehyeε and gyaasefo, however, the asomfo class emerged in an urban rather than rural context, and at a much later date: its full development was, therefore, specific to Asante rather than common to Akan society in general.' <sup id="cite_ref-656" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-656">[656]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Ethnicity or race ♣ present ♥</b> The emerging peasant class was largely made up of assimilated non-Asante: 'Arhin's article is a most welcome corrective to ideological arguments which attempt to force complex realities into simple schemes. His argument (re: Fallers) that a culturally distinct peasantry can be identified in precolonial Asante is supported, as he notes, by a large and growing body of historical work. Some of this research amplifies the urban/rural distinction even more than Arhin himself does: e.g., Wilks's (1975) discussion of the importance of the urban mercantile class (the asikafo) and his discussion of the way in which the state, embodied in the city itself, enforced its power. It is impossible to discuss the rise of the Asante state without talking about the rise of Kumasi as an urban center. By definition, the rise of the state therefore presupposes the rise of a hinterland and a peasantry. Unless one were to question whether the state existed at all (which no one is doing), there is not much question about a peasantry's existing, economically, politically, and culturally.' <sup id="cite_ref-657" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-657">[657]</a></sup> 'There are a few points which could be emphasized: the cultural distinctiveness of the peasantry is due, in part, to the enormous numbers of strangers (particularly northerners) assimilated into Asante. As the slave trade decreased in the early 19th century, after abolition, large numbers of northerners had to be absorbed into the Asante populace. As Wilks describes, the government had very specific policies for carrying out this absorption. Thus, the urban/rural distinction is not simply one of “class” (which Arhin himself says is very unclear), but also, on some level, an ethnic one. In Asante the ethnic lines became more and more blurred, and the assimilationist policy made and continues to make discussion of this issue difficult; but it is clear that in everyone's attempt to be a “Kumasi” person there is also an attempt to certify one's unquestionable (free) Asante origins, which Arhin calls the “distinctively indigenous.”' <sup id="cite_ref-658" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-658">[658]</a></sup> The same was true of other Akan states: 'Terray has already applied the concept “peasant” to the neighbouring Abron and, comparatively, to Asante (Terray 1974, 1975), but his usage differs from mine, perhaps because the political structures of the Abron and the Asante differ. For Terray the Abron peasant “classes” consist of the subject Kulango people, whom the Akan-Abron conquered before establishing a “conquest state,” a few Abron subjects, and above all slaves acquired through raids and warfare and by purchase. It is from these that the state, dominated by the Abron aristocracy, extracted its surpluses, and it is they that the state exploited. The slaves, in particular, formed the main labour force in the gold mines owned by the aristocrats and provided the main reason for the existence of the state.' <sup id="cite_ref-659" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-659">[659]</a></sup> 'Strangers' were not part of established kin networks: 'People have travelled from the Northern Territories or the Colony to Ashanti in search of employment. Some of them have settled there more or less permanently. There are many people from these areas who have lived in Ashanti most of their lives, but they are outside the Ashanti political structure. They are ‘strangers’, no matter how long they live there.' <sup id="cite_ref-660" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-660">[660]</a></sup> 'Even Ashantis are ‘strangers’ outside their own Divisions. There are many Ashantis living in Divisions other than those in which they are subjects by kinship. This is particularly so in Kumasi, where the opportunities of employment have attracted people from all parts of Ashanti. With reference to the kinship political organization, these Ashantis are strangers, just as are the settlers from the Northern Territories and the Colony.' <sup id="cite_ref-661" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-661">[661]</a></sup> 'These permanent but ‘stranger’ settlers, who have no political status in the traditional organization based on kinship, present the chiefs with a new problem, which has arisen most acutely in connexion with taxation.' <sup id="cite_ref-662" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-662">[662]</a></sup> The legal rights of 'strangers' were restricted: 'Asante men and women drew power and income from a well-developed internal marketplace system with three distinct types of market, in which chiefly regulations protected their privilege as traders and carriers. Non-Asantes were restricted from trading within Asante during most of the nineteenth century, so goods from outside passed into Asante hands at the officially designated border markets whose location contracted with the limits of effective political control (Wilks 1975). Quantities of imported consumer goods, mainly manufactures and crafts, passed from border markets either to the urban daily markets or directly to the regional periodic markets in leading Asante towns (Akoto 1980). These linked the rural population to the border markets and to other parts of Asante with different food supplies. Urban daily markets in Kumasi and leading provincial capitals served the needs of town dwellers for food and consumption goods of all kinds (Lewin 1974).' <sup id="cite_ref-663" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-663">[663]</a></sup> Mixed marriages were rare and in-marrying individuals were expected to conform to local norms: 'Mahommedan law has not influenced these marriage or family customs in the slightest degree; on the contrary, if a Hausa marries a Fanti he must conform to Fanti custom, unless the girl first embraces Mahommedanism, which is very rare, and even then her children are still held to belong to the Fanti family. Such mixed marriages are, however, rare, and are altogether unknown to the Omanhin of Denkera.' <sup id="cite_ref-664" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-664">[664]</a></sup> Politically and ideologically, Kumasi and the Asante occupied a central position compared to other peoples and locations: 'The central position of Kumasi and the Asante people, compared with neighboring rivals, has remained remarkably consistent over several centuries despite dramatic reconfigurations of trade—a testimonial to their strenuous and effective efforts. The Asantes emerged as an identifiable political unit in the seventeenth century when Akans moved into the forest to control gold mining areas and trade routes linking the ancient caravan routes across the Sahara to the European [Page 62] shipping routes pioneered by Portuguese explorers in the late fifteenth century. The Asante capital, Kumasi, lies about halfway between the coastal fort towns and the Northern savannah towns. Asante diplomacy and warfare first focused on defeating and absorbing their former overlords to the south to maintain free access to the coast. Then attention turned to its northern borders, turning the chiefs of Brong, Gonja, and Kete Krachi into subjects or tributaries (Arhin 1975; Maier 1983). Close relations with its “home port” of Elmina were threatened several times in the early 1800s by blockades or sieges by the British and Fante. The Asantes at first attempted to send more of their trade east via Accra and west via loyal ports around Takoradi. When the hostile British took over Elmina from the Dutch in 1868, the Asante army invaded it twice, in 1870 and 1874 (Wilks 1975). To the north of Asante, repeated unrest in the subjugated Brong chiefdom of Gyaman shifted trade west from its capital, Bonduku, to Salaga, and later to a new market at Kintampo when Salaga rebelled (Arhin 1971).' <sup id="cite_ref-665" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-665">[665]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<dd><b>♠ Property can be owned by people from all social classes ♣ present ♥</b> Society was organized in matrilineal clans: 'All Akan groups recognize matrilineal descent. The basic group is the clan, of which there are eight; they are dispersed among the many kingdoms. Members of a subclan tend to occupy a single town or village. The clan is an exogamous group. It is comprised of constituent groups that may be referred to as lineages, but these do not form any kind of segmentary lineage system, lineages being attached to others by propinquity and the power and wealth of the host lineage. Although there has been much confusion in accounts of the Akan peoples between matriliny and matriarchy, authority within clans and lineages is held firmly by men, succession being from a man to his brother or to his closest sister's son.' <sup id="cite_ref-680" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-680">[680]</a></sup> 'A child inherits his or her blood from the mother, and character or temperament from the father. Maternal blood ensures the child's membership in the ABUSUA (clan or lineage); paternity bestows membership in one of nine other groups or categories. Although some accounts claim the Akan descent system is one of double descent, this view appears to be based on a misreading of the actual roles of the two lines of descent. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-681" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-681">[681]</a></sup> 'There are groups in which membership is transmitted patrilineally, but these are neither exogamous nor corporate groups; nor are jural or political rights or duties derived from paternal descent. What is involved is the concept of NTORO; the male transmitted NTORO (spirit) which forms a unique spiritual bond between father and son. Following this principle, every person belongs to one of a limited number of named quasi-ritual categories, the ntoro divisions. Members of the same ntoro division are required to observe certain taboos, perform certain rituals, and are believed to have some common personality characteristics. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-682" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-682">[682]</a></sup> 'Consistent with the emphasis on matrilineal descent is the fact that the system of kinship terminology is of the Crow type. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-683" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-683">[683]</a></sup> Clans held and transmitted land: 'The localized matrilineage tracing descent from a known common female ancestor for a period of 10 to 12 generations is the basic unit for political, legal, and ritual purposes. Succession and inheritance rules stress sex, generation, and age, with men having precedence over women, "brothers" over "sisters' sons," and senior over junior. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-684" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-684">[684]</a></sup> 'Land was the unalienable possession of the clan--actually the clan's ancestral spirits were considered the true owners of the land and the tribal land's living occupants only trustees or tenants. Security of tenure was based on working the land. Abandoned land reverted to the stool. Rights to land were inherited matrilineally. Today Akan have the right to sell land although leasing seems to be the preferred arrangement. [IS]' <sup id="cite_ref-685" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-685">[685]</a></sup>  But inheritance was divided between a man's matrilineage and his own offspring: 'Despite being jurally matrilineal, inheritance is to some extent divided between sister's children and a man's own children. The basic principle is that lineage-inherited property goes to sisters' children, and property acquired with the help of a man's wife and children is distributed among the latter at his death. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-686" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-686">[686]</a></sup> Households cultivated family farms: 'The farm, known in Asante as the afuo, was essentially a smallholding capable of supporting a single family. It consisted of two or sometimes three distinct parts, the afuwa, mfufuwa and mfufuwa-nini. The land currently under cultivation was the afuwa, “the little farm” or field, and the land under fallow was the mfufuwa, literally “the non- afuwa.” A farmer's rights of tenure over his fallow were as secure as those over his land under cultivation. In some cases a farm may have attached to it further land — fallow that has not been brought back into cultivation at the appropriate time because, for example, of unsatisfactory yields or of the inability of the tenants (through illnesses, deaths, or the like) to resume cropping it. Such land is the mfufuwa-nini, literally “barren fallow.” The original tenants and their heirs retain rights to the produce from it — to the fruits of palm and kola trees, for example, and to firewood and poles — but Asante law appears not to have defined with any precision the point in time at which others might acquire rights in it and recommence farming operations. Much litigation results.' <sup id="cite_ref-687" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-687">[687]</a></sup> Land became the property of clans through clearing of forests and cultivation. Wilks describes the process of establishing estates: 'Akan village histories make frequent reference to hunters ranging the forest in search of land suitable for agricultural exploitation—taking account, presumably, of surface relief, water resources, soil, and so forth. The role of the aberemp[unavailable]n in these explorations is often described in considerable detail. By way of illustration I shall cite the cases of two, Tabiri Heman and Akuamoa Panin.' <sup id="cite_ref-688" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-688">[688]</a></sup> 'The aberemp[unavailable]n were essentially developers. They created estates, founding villages and clearing the arable land necessary for subsistence. I refer to such estates as “ beremp[unavailable]n-doms” (by analogy with “kingdoms,” “chiefdoms,” etc.). Of the actual work of felling, clearing, and building, and of how the imported unfree labor was used, we know nothing. Such is not the stuff of tradition. Kea has drawn attention to a possible model, that of Aduafo of Afutu and “other great lords” who had contracted with the Danish African Company to clear a site and construct a trading post for them. They brought 300 of their slaves to the site and divided them [Page 98] into two teams. One carried out the clearing while the other assembled the building materials. This was, however, at a coastal location and is therefore of uncertain relevance.' <sup id="cite_ref-689" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-689">[689]</a></sup> 'If the creation of an estate was predicated on the procurement of unfree labor, its prosperity depended on free settlers being attracted to it. Such was the pressure on land, on arable land, that they came. Sometimes the original estate was subdivided by purchase. For example, Adu Gyamfi, by origin from Adansemanso, founded a settlement named Aboforumu. It lay about 12 miles northwest of what was to become Kumase. He subsequently sold (“as the explorers or the owners of the land”) part of the estate to new settlers, Amma Badu and Antwi, who paid him mperedwan aduosia, 60 peredwans or some 135 oz. of gold. The estate was soon to be divided yet again. We have met Akosua Yitua of Asantemanso and her son Danso Abeam, above. She had five daughters. The third of these settled at Amoaman, but her descendants “became hemmed in at this village.” They moved northward, and their leader, Adu Panin, purchased a block of land from Amma Badu and Antwi. He renamed it Ntonso. The price is not reported. The transaction is said to have occurred at the time of Oti Akenten of Kumase. Other cases did not involve purchase, but contract sometimes sealed by marriage. The case of Kyerewa Akenten and her brother, Kagya, is instructive. They left Asantemanso in search of land and, after rejecting several places as unsuitable, arrived at Oyoko, near Feyiase. They went from there 'to Odum-Anaafuo to ask Berefo Kese, the Chief of the place for some land to settle on. He showed them a site where they built their village which they named “Kagya-kurom” [Kagya's village]. Owing to the large number of the followers of Kagya and his sister, Berefo Kese presented them a large portion of his lands on which they farmed. From Kagya-kurom Berefo Kese married Kyerewa Akenten and after their marriage Berefo Kese added a much larger portion of his lands to that already in their hands and presented it to them.' <sup id="cite_ref-690" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-690">[690]</a></sup> 'Obtaining land involved negotiation with the [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n who had developed it, who had (as it were) staked out first claims to it. Matrifiliation as such conferred no rights of settlement. It will follow that the free settlers within a beremp[unavailable]n-dom belonged to different matriclans. In fact these are dispersed almost randomly throughout forest society. As Fortes has remarked, the matriclan “delimits a diffuse field of amity, wide in extent but of minimal structural specificity.” Within the beremp[unavailable]n-dom, of the rule of exogamy, and in that respect was a socially integrative factor. But claims to land were based upon the heritable rights that the [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n conferred upon the settlers, and the matrilineages that thus arose were tied to specific tracts of land within the estate.' <sup id="cite_ref-691" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-691">[691]</a></sup> 'From the fifteenth century onward numerous estates or beremp[unavailable]n-doms arose as the frontier of farming expanded outward from the Adanse and Amansie regions. Such has been the thrust of the argument. Some were in time to become the capitals of aman, of states; some were to be incorporated into such states; and some were to falter and vanish. The struggles that attended the process are exhaustively chronicled in Akan traditions; the nature of the process itself, whereby a class of entrepreneurs became transformed into a ruling class, is not. The key lies in an understanding of the peculiar features of Akan land proprietorship.' <sup id="cite_ref-692" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-692">[692]</a></sup> 'A cardinal feature of the system is expressed in the maxim, afuo mu yε me deε, asase yε [unavailable]hene deε, “the farm is my property, the land is the king's.” It is necessary to extrapolate from more recent practice, described by Rattray, Busia, and Fortes among others. If the proprietor of the land conferred heritable rights to the arable on those who were permitted to settle, he also reserved or established certain rights to himself and his heirs — to his “stool.” He took an almost token part of the harvest at the time of the annual harvest festival (the odwira), but required a more substantial share of the produce of the land as opposed to the arable: fish, snails, game, kola, minerals, and the like. He could levy a wide range of taxes, such as peato for military expenses, ayieto for funerals, and [unavailable]manto to defray the costs of making regalia and putting up buildings. Most importantly, he could require the provision of labor for military service or, for example, for work on the roads. Such, briefly, were what led Potekhin to refer to “the relatively easy feudal dues of the free members of the community.” Relatively easy” they may or may not have been; there was variation from place to place and time to time. “Feudal” they were not, for the free settlers acquired almost unassailable titles to the land they farmed, while the various taxes and services provided to the landholder were ad hoc and sporadic and did not approximate in character to a rent, whether economic or otherwise.' <sup id="cite_ref-693" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-693">[693]</a></sup> 'The descendants of free settlers became [unavailable]manmufo, citizens. Those of the proprietors became adehyeε, nobility. There remain the unfree laborers. They must surely be those who became the third major element in the composition of an [unavailable]man, namely the gyaasefo. Literally “the people of the hearth,” they were absorbed into Akan society as servants of the adehyeε. They became responsible not only for their own subsistence but for that of the nobles. They farmed for them, assumed responsibility for their debts, and provided them with a wide range of personal services as stool-carriers, drummers, hornblowers, umbrella-carriers, bathroom attendants, messengers, tradesmen, sextons, and so forth. Their masters (or mistresses) were heirs to their property. Their status, unlike that of nobles and citizens, was transmitted through the male line. Rattray commented on the matter: [Page 100] 'There is little doubt that the Gyasefo were in olden times recruited from the slave class. A “Stool” slave became one of the Gyasefo. The descendants of a Gyase woman were of course considered as Gyasefo, down the female line for all time; not only was this so, but the son of a Gyase man would ordinarily also enter the office to which his father belonged, irrespective of the position of his mother.' <sup id="cite_ref-694" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-694">[694]</a></sup> While wealth stratification was present, all free individuals could own property in principle.</dd></dl>

The expansion of the state made necessary administrative reforms within Kumasi itself and for the maintenance of effective relations between the Asantehene, the head of the Asante Union and, by consent, also the head of the Kumasi state, and the heads of the conquered territories. The palace administration ( gyase) was expanded with appointive headships of innumerable functional units or palace associations ( afekuo, sing. fekuo) (Rattray 1929: 81-92; Wilks 1967: 214-28; Hagan 1971). The memberships of the palace associations, each of which had either military or nonmilitary functions, cut across the divisions, so that they formed checks on, and counterpoises to, the traditional power units. The heads of the most important of the palace associations, including the units assigned to the offspring of former and reigning Asantehene (Busia 1951: 95), were included in the state council. Since appointments to the headships of the palace associations were in the gift of the Asantehene, the administrative reform represented an intrusion of patrimonialism (Weber 1947: 347) into the traditional political organisation.' <sup id="cite_ref-695" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-695">[695]</a></sup> 'The vast area brought under Asante control by force or threat of arms could not be governed unless new methods of controlling it were developed. From the 1760s, beginning under Asantehene Osei Kwadwo, various steps were taken to bring the control of outlying areas directly under Kumase [...] Senior officeholders in Kumase were placed in charge of particular areas of the administration, controlling considerable numbers of lesser officials. Some supervised the trade in ivory and kola, while others oversaw the gold-producing regions which now fell within the borders of Asante. A form of treasury partly staffed by literate Muslims was created. Groups within the capital began to build up expertise in particular areas of administration and to concentrate on this as a way to power and wealth. Careers began to open for those with intelligence, negotiating skill and a steady nerve.' <sup id="cite_ref-696" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-696">[696]</a></sup> 'Significant changes in Asante administrative practice, in the direction of increasing specialization of role, were attributed to Asantehene Osei Kwadwo (1764-1777). The class of administrators was a growing one, but I do not think we should yet speak of an administrative class emerging, one reproducing itself as a class.' <sup id="cite_ref-697" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-697">[697]</a></sup> The purpose of this new administrative structure was to 'enforce subordination of the conquered rulers to the Asantehene. For this purpose the Asante kings used an administrative staff recruited from their gyase, household organization, consisting of units of functionaries with appointive headships [...] These palace associations, called afekuo (Reondorf, 1895: 119; Rattray, 1929: 91), were recruited from free attendants, warcaptives, purchased slaves (nnonkofo), and other bondsmen; in other words, persons connected by “ties of personal loyalty” (Weber, 1947: 342) to the various Asante Kings.' <sup id="cite_ref-698" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-698">[698]</a></sup> Appointed officials and other dependents increasingly displaced the hereditary authority of 'traditional' public functionaries: 'From Opoku Ware (1720-50) to Kwaku Duah (1834-67), these personal dependants competed with, and replaced the holders of hereditary authority, occupants of royal stools ( adehye nnwa), in Kumasi and in the component states of the Asante Union in the exercise of authority and the collection of tribute and other payments in the conquered territories. Wilks (1967: 211-214) has called this administrative organization the “Kwadwoan revolution” on the ground that it took firm root in the reign of Osei Kwadwo (1864-77) although it began in that of Opoku Ware, and has identified it as the emergence of Asante “bureaucracy”.' <sup id="cite_ref-699" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-699">[699]</a></sup> Senior public functionaries had a stool system of their own: 'In Kumasi proper there were seventy-seven stools, representing seventy-seven public functionaries, as, for example, the Bantuma Chief, or the Chief of the Royal Burial Grove, the Ateni Chief, or the Chief of the Lamplighters.' <sup id="cite_ref-700" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-700">[700]</a></sup> Some foreigners were employed in highly specialized roles: 'A form of treasury partly staffed by literate Muslims was created.

Careers began to open for those with intelligence, negotiating skill and a steady nerve.' <sup id="cite_ref-701" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-701">[701]</a></sup> Most government activities at Kumasi were associated with the ruler's palace and other royal structures. The above-mentioned treasury was located there as well. While some clerical positions were available to foreigners, most courtiers and state officials were probably members of elite families.

<dd><b>♠ Property can be owned by people from all ethnic/racial groups ♣ present ♥</b> Society was organized in matrilineal clans: 'All Akan groups recognize matrilineal descent. The basic group is the clan, of which there are eight; they are dispersed among the many kingdoms. Members of a subclan tend to occupy a single town or village. The clan is an exogamous group. It is comprised of constituent groups that may be referred to as lineages, but these do not form any kind of segmentary lineage system, lineages being attached to others by propinquity and the power and wealth of the host lineage. Although there has been much confusion in accounts of the Akan peoples between matriliny and matriarchy, authority within clans and lineages is held firmly by men, succession being from a man to his brother or to his closest sister's son.' <sup id="cite_ref-702" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-702">[702]</a></sup> 'A child inherits his or her blood from the mother, and character or temperament from the father. Maternal blood ensures the child's membership in the ABUSUA (clan or lineage); paternity bestows membership in one of nine other groups or categories.

[MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-703" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-703">[703]</a></sup> 'There are groups in which membership is transmitted patrilineally, but these are neither exogamous nor corporate groups; nor are jural or political rights or duties derived from paternal descent. What is involved is the concept of NTORO; the male transmitted NTORO (spirit) which forms a unique spiritual bond between father and son. Following this principle, every person belongs to one of a limited number of named quasi-ritual categories, the ntoro divisions. Members of the same ntoro division are required to observe certain taboos, perform certain rituals, and are believed to have some common personality characteristics.

Succession and inheritance rules stress sex, generation, and age, with men having precedence over women, "brothers" over "sisters' sons," and senior over junior. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-706" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-706">[706]</a></sup> 'Land was the unalienable possession of the clan--actually the clan's ancestral spirits were considered the true owners of the land and the tribal land's living occupants only trustees or tenants.

[IS]' <sup id="cite_ref-707" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-707">[707]</a></sup>  But inheritance was divided between a man's matrilineage and his own offspring: 'Despite being jurally matrilineal, inheritance is to some extent divided between sister's children and a man's own children. The basic principle is that lineage-inherited property goes to sisters' children, and property acquired with the help of a man's wife and children is distributed among the latter at his death. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-708" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-708">[708]</a></sup> Households cultivated family farms: 'The farm, known in Asante as the afuo, was essentially a smallholding capable of supporting a single family. It consisted of two or sometimes three distinct parts, the afuwa, mfufuwa and mfufuwa-nini. The land currently under cultivation was the afuwa, “the little farm” or field, and the land under fallow was the mfufuwa, literally “the non- afuwa.” A farmer's rights of tenure over his fallow were as secure as those over his land under cultivation. In some cases a farm may have attached to it further land — fallow that has not been brought back into cultivation at the appropriate time because, for example, of unsatisfactory yields or of the inability of the tenants (through illnesses, deaths, or the like) to resume cropping it. Such land is the mfufuwa-nini, literally “barren fallow.” The original tenants and their heirs retain rights to the produce from it — to the fruits of palm and kola trees, for example, and to firewood and poles — but Asante law appears not to have defined with any precision the point in time at which others might acquire rights in it and recommence farming operations. Much litigation results.' <sup id="cite_ref-709" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-709">[709]</a></sup> Land became the property of clans through clearing of forests and cultivation. Wilks describes the process of establishing estates: 'Akan village histories make frequent reference to hunters ranging the forest in search of land suitable for agricultural exploitation—taking account, presumably, of surface relief, water resources, soil, and so forth. The role of the aberemp[unavailable]n in these explorations is often described in considerable detail. By way of illustration I shall cite the cases of two, Tabiri Heman and Akuamoa Panin.' <sup id="cite_ref-710" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-710">[710]</a></sup> 'The aberemp[unavailable]n were essentially developers. They created estates, founding villages and clearing the arable land necessary for subsistence. I refer to such estates as “ beremp[unavailable]n-doms” (by analogy with “kingdoms,” “chiefdoms,” etc.). Of the actual work of felling, clearing, and building, and of how the imported unfree labor was used, we know nothing. Such is not the stuff of tradition. Kea has drawn attention to a possible model, that of Aduafo of Afutu and “other great lords” who had contracted with the Danish African Company to clear a site and construct a trading post for them. They brought 300 of their slaves to the site and divided them [Page 98] into two teams. One carried out the clearing while the other assembled the building materials. This was, however, at a coastal location and is therefore of uncertain relevance.' <sup id="cite_ref-711" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-711">[711]</a></sup> 'If the creation of an estate was predicated on the procurement of unfree labor, its prosperity depended on free settlers being attracted to it. Such was the pressure on land, on arable land, that they came. Sometimes the original estate was subdivided by purchase. For example, Adu Gyamfi, by origin from Adansemanso, founded a settlement named Aboforumu. It lay about 12 miles northwest of what was to become Kumase. He subsequently sold (“as the explorers or the owners of the land”) part of the estate to new settlers, Amma Badu and Antwi, who paid him mperedwan aduosia, 60 peredwans or some 135 oz. of gold. The estate was soon to be divided yet again. We have met Akosua Yitua of Asantemanso and her son Danso Abeam, above. She had five daughters. The third of these settled at Amoaman, but her descendants “became hemmed in at this village.” They moved northward, and their leader, Adu Panin, purchased a block of land from Amma Badu and Antwi. He renamed it Ntonso. The price is not reported. The transaction is said to have occurred at the time of Oti Akenten of Kumase. Other cases did not involve purchase, but contract sometimes sealed by marriage. The case of Kyerewa Akenten and her brother, Kagya, is instructive. They left Asantemanso in search of land and, after rejecting several places as unsuitable, arrived at Oyoko, near Feyiase. They went from there 'to Odum-Anaafuo to ask Berefo Kese, the Chief of the place for some land to settle on. He showed them a site where they built their village which they named “Kagya-kurom” [Kagya's village]. Owing to the large number of the followers of Kagya and his sister, Berefo Kese presented them a large portion of his lands on which they farmed. From Kagya-kurom Berefo Kese married Kyerewa Akenten and after their marriage Berefo Kese added a much larger portion of his lands to that already in their hands and presented it to them.' <sup id="cite_ref-712" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-712">[712]</a></sup> 'Obtaining land involved negotiation with the [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n who had developed it, who had (as it were) staked out first claims to it. Matrifiliation as such conferred no rights of settlement. It will follow that the free settlers within a beremp[unavailable]n-dom belonged to different matriclans. In fact these are dispersed almost randomly throughout forest society. As Fortes has remarked, the matriclan “delimits a diffuse field of amity, wide in extent but of minimal structural specificity.” Within the beremp[unavailable]n-dom, of the rule of exogamy, and in that respect was a socially integrative factor. But claims to land were based upon the heritable rights that the [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n conferred upon the settlers, and the matrilineages that thus arose were tied to specific tracts of land within the estate.' <sup id="cite_ref-713" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-713">[713]</a></sup> 'From the fifteenth century onward numerous estates or beremp[unavailable]n-doms arose as the frontier of farming expanded outward from the Adanse and Amansie regions. Such has been the thrust of the argument. Some were in time to become the capitals of aman, of states; some were to be incorporated into such states; and some were to falter and vanish. The struggles that attended the process are exhaustively chronicled in Akan traditions; the nature of the process itself, whereby a class of entrepreneurs became transformed into a ruling class, is not. The key lies in an understanding of the peculiar features of Akan land proprietorship.' <sup id="cite_ref-714" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-714">[714]</a></sup> 'A cardinal feature of the system is expressed in the maxim, afuo mu yε me deε, asase yε [unavailable]hene deε, “the farm is my property, the land is the king's.” It is necessary to extrapolate from more recent practice, described by Rattray, Busia, and Fortes among others. If the proprietor of the land conferred heritable rights to the arable on those who were permitted to settle, he also reserved or established certain rights to himself and his heirs — to his “stool.” He took an almost token part of the harvest at the time of the annual harvest festival (the odwira), but required a more substantial share of the produce of the land as opposed to the arable: fish, snails, game, kola, minerals, and the like. He could levy a wide range of taxes, such as peato for military expenses, ayieto for funerals, and [unavailable]manto to defray the costs of making regalia and putting up buildings. Most importantly, he could require the provision of labor for military service or, for example, for work on the roads. Such, briefly, were what led Potekhin to refer to “the relatively easy feudal dues of the free members of the community.” Relatively easy” they may or may not have been; there was variation from place to place and time to time. “Feudal” they were not, for the free settlers acquired almost unassailable titles to the land they farmed, while the various taxes and services provided to the landholder were ad hoc and sporadic and did not approximate in character to a rent, whether economic or otherwise.' <sup id="cite_ref-715" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-715">[715]</a></sup> 'The descendants of free settlers became [unavailable]manmufo, citizens. Those of the proprietors became adehyeε, nobility. There remain the unfree laborers. They must surely be those who became the third major element in the composition of an [unavailable]man, namely the gyaasefo. Literally “the people of the hearth,” they were absorbed into Akan society as servants of the adehyeε. They became responsible not only for their own subsistence but for that of the nobles. They farmed for them, assumed responsibility for their debts, and provided them with a wide range of personal services as stool-carriers, drummers, hornblowers, umbrella-carriers, bathroom attendants, messengers, tradesmen, sextons, and so forth. Their masters (or mistresses) were heirs to their property. Their status, unlike that of nobles and citizens, was transmitted through the male line. Rattray commented on the matter: [Page 100] 'There is little doubt that the Gyasefo were in olden times recruited from the slave class. A “Stool” slave became one of the Gyasefo. The descendants of a Gyase woman were of course considered as Gyasefo, down the female line for all time; not only was this so, but the son of a Gyase man would ordinarily also enter the office to which his father belonged, irrespective of the position of his mother.' <sup id="cite_ref-716" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-716">[716]</a></sup> While wealth stratification was present, all free individuals could own property in principle.

Subsets of the membership of a lineage — equalling lineage segments — are defined by the existence of any property for which members of the subsets (exclusive of others) are potential heirs. Such sets (subsets of the whole) may range from, at the one extreme, only the actual children of some man's actual sisters (in the case of property that he himself created) to, at the other extreme, all the members of the lineage (in the case of property, in effect, created by the lineage founder). In Egyaa, only chiefly positions fall in the long-lived extreme, while (almost) all other created property (in Egyaa) falls in or near the short-lived extreme. No property in Egyaa falls enough in between the two extremes to matter, but property that survived long enough to be inherited through several generations (but not substantially longer) were such to exist, would create sets of members representing intermediate segments of the lineage's membership.' <sup id="cite_ref-723" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-723">[723]</a></sup> Slavery was practiced: 'The Akan practiced slavery, obtaining slaves from northern slave dealers, usually Muslims.

[MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-724" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-724">[724]</a></sup> Wealthy urban families relied on unfree labour, but wealth stratification had emerged before the colonial period: 'The Portuguese “blueprint” of 1572 associates gold mining, forest clearing, and food production, and implicitly postulates the existence [Page 96] of an appropriating class and a producing class. It is, I suggest, mutatis mutandis, a paradigm of sorts for the early Akan state. Those who controlled the production and sale of gold were those able to procure a supply of unfree labor. Those who procured unfree labor were those able to create arable land within the forest. Those who created the arable were those who founded the numerous early Akan polities. We see, in other words, a class of Akan entrepreneurs emerging: a class of those able to use the strength of the world bullion market, and the availability of labor locally (whether through Wangara or Portuguese suppliers), in such a way as to create the new agrarian system. These entrepreneurs were known as the aberemp[unavailable]n (sing.

Adehyeε may preside over the affairs of anything from villages on the one hand to kingdoms on the other. Their power will rest in no small measure upon the sheer numbers of gyaasefo whose services they command; indeed, this is one index of their rank. In 1936 Oheneba Sakyi Djan manfully struggled with the problem, though with reference to the more southerly forest Akan: 'The term “Gyaase”…applies to the most immediate adherents attached to the household of any important personage. In this instance, even an ordinary well-to-do man (rich man) may have his own Gyaase, so much so that the head of a family (Opanyin or Atrankonnua) or a ruler of a town (Odekro), or a head of a division of a state (Ohene) or the supreme head or king of a state (Omanhene) should necessarily have his own Gyaase-men, and the number of the members constituting the Gyaase of each of the above heads depends on the importance of the party concerned. That is to say, the number of the members of the Gyaase attached to the Ohene's household is by far fewer than that attached to the Omanhene household.' It was all to do with achievement. The fortunes of an [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n depended first on his ability to procure the labor that, the estate established, became his gyaasefo, and second on his ability to attract free settlers to the estate. Measured in these terms the relatively unsuccessful [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n emerged as no more than a village head, an [unavailable]dekuro, and was absorbed in time into the aman (qua state) of his more successful peer, the [unavailable]hene of this or that group of towns and villages, and he in turn into the aman (qua kingdom) of those even more successful. We turn to a consideration of the most successful of all.' <sup id="cite_ref-728" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-728">[728]</a></sup> 'ON THE BASIS OF HIS observations of Kumase society in 1817, Bowdich became strongly aware of the degree of social stratification present. Of the many indicators of this—housing, diet, hygiene, toiletry, marriage, and so forth —he commented most fully on matters of the household economy:[Page 140] 'the higher class could not support their numerous followers, or the lower their large families, in the city, and therefore employed them in plantations (in which small crooms [villages] were situated) generally within two or three miles of the capital, where their labours not only feed themselves, but supply the wants of the chief, his family, and more immediate suite. The middling orders station their slaves for the same purpose, and also to collect fruit and vegetables for sale, and when their children become numerous, a part are generally sent to be supported by these slaves in the bush.' <sup id="cite_ref-729" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-729">[729]</a></sup> 'Bowdich's “higher class” would appear to refer to the wealthy citizens, high officeholders for the most part, whose gyaasefo or “retainers” supported them; his “middling orders” to aspirant citizens  in the process of creating, through utilization of slaves, their own gyaasefo; and his “lower class” to those who perforce ensured their survival by the use of family labor. If Bowdich may be understood to be suggesting that the commanding morality of metropolitan society was one of upward mobility based on wealth, then he was undoubtedly correct.

New formal titles were created for individuals who gained wealth and thus became part of an emerging 'bourgeoisie': 'Those who attained wealth in Asante were known as the sikafo, “the monied people.” This category subsumed the smaller group of those who acquired fortunes sufficiently substantial for them to seek formal recognition of their achievement. Of these, those able to demonstrate that they had acquired through their own enterprise a modest fortune of 125 peredwans might, with the approval of the Asantehene, obtain the entitlement of wearing in public a specially designed and woven cloth known as nyaw[unavailable]ho, “you have become rich.” It would seem that it was after the acquisition of such a resource in gold dust that the aspirant (and wise) citizen would begin to invest in people and land. The title to be acquired thereby was that of asafohene, an ancient one originally and exclusively meaning “a war captain.” But the title was available at different levels depending upon the number of subjects acquired. As noticed above, Yamoa Ponko gifted to his son, Gyesi Kwame, 100 subjects, and thereby Gyesi Kwame acquired the comparatively low-ranking dignity of an asafohene of the Kyidom Stool. By contrast, in late 1861 or early 1862 the Akyempemhene Owusu Koko, already an occupant of high office in Kumase, nevertheless publicly displayed his three thousand subjects—each in possession of a gun—who must be assumed to have represented self-acquired property. An asafohene able to show command of at least a thousand subjects was entitled not only to wear the nyaw[unavailable]ho cloth but also to have a horse-tail switch ( bodua) carried before him. It was, however, the right to use not the horse-tail but the elephant-tail switch ( mena or mmara) that was the most coveted of all honors—and one carrying with it use of the ancient title of [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n.' <sup id="cite_ref-731" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-731">[731]</a></sup> 'However many sikafo aspired to the award of the elephant tail, relatively few seem to have achieved it. Three successful nineteenth century claimants are well documented, namely, Gyaasewahene Opoku Frefre (died 1826), Ankobeahene Kwaku Tawia (died ca. 1850), and Manwerehene Kwasi Brantuo (died 1865). There were certainly others. A description of the ceremony surrounding the award was given by the Akyeamehene Kwasi Nuama in 1925. Because it is the fullest account of the procedures known to me, I cite it fully: 'Those chiefs who were allowed to use elephant tails were called Abrempons. A chief who lives on his own land with his own subjects is known by the King as Abrempon. An Abrempon must exhibit his wealth publicly by presenting £9 6s. [i.e., 1 peredwan with supplementary mmataho] to all the Abrempons in Kumase; and 10 peregwans (£80) to the King. He would then go to Tafo and pay £1 6s. to the chief there who would give him an egg to throw against a silk cotton tree. He would then return to Kumasi. He would then go to Essumja Santimanso and buy a carpet ( nsa) for £24 [3 peregwans] from the subjects of the Chief there. He must only dance on it and leave it after presenting Essumjahene with another £24. Your going and coming expenses (including the £48) will cost you some 20 pregwans. He would buy an elephant tail from the Assinhene (son of Essumjahene) for £9 6s. He would tie the elephant tail round the waist of one of his slaves and he must then past [ sic] round the outskirts of the town lying on the leaves of palm trees which have been strewn around the town, firing at his slave with blank fire from time to time. The slave falls down eventually and he then cuts the string to which the tail is fastened and takes the tail—then the ceremonies are completed, and his people applaud him. Next morning he would get mashed yam mixed with 30 peregwans and be carried on a litter round the town of Kumasi scattering largesse of the yam mixture. On the following morning he would be carried in a litter with all his regalia, his skin plastered with white clay. Then he would fix up a spear at Dwebirim (the market place) and challenge those of the same rank to remove it. After this he is called Brempon. On the last day anyone who aspires to the rank of Abrempon takes out the spear and appoints a time for performing the same ceremonies.' The Akyeamehene thus identified six stages in the ceremony. The first, the payments to the aberemp[unavailable]n of the capital and to the Asantehene, requires little comment. In the early nineteenth century Hutchison noted that the first step was, for obvious reasons, taken only “by those who are in favour with the King, and think themselves safe from palavers.” The second and third stages, the visits to Tafo and Asantemanso, involved the candidate in ancient rituals the nature of which will not be [Page 142] examined here; suffice to remind the reader that Tafo was an old (“aboriginal”) trading center, and Asantemanso one of the “cradles” of the Akan.' <sup id="cite_ref-732" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-732">[732]</a></sup> 'The fourth stage of the ceremony, that of catching of the “elephant,” was, by a fortunate chance, once witnessed by the missionary W. West on his visit to Kumase with Owusu Ansa in 1862. Although West does not name the candidate, one may be reasonably confident that it was the Kumase Manwerehene, Kwasi Brantuo. On March 29 West noted the arrival of several dignitaries in Kumase, “to take part in the ceremony, which was that of the display of wealth, by an old chief, in order to be entitled to the honour of having the elephant's tail carried before him; an honour to which only the wealthy can aspire.” he actual charade occurred the next day: 'A slave had been selected to enact the part of the elephant. Besmeared all over with chalk, holding in his hand a small tusk, which he occasionally applied to his mouth, and having an elephant's tail attached by a piece of string behind, he was started off; while some forty or fifty men, armed with muskets, and supplied with blank cartridges, followed in pursuit, keeping up an almost constant fire. His elephantship as we were informed, made his way, according to usage, to a small kroom [village] not far from Kumasi, where he fell down as if shot, and lay there until the chief himself appeared to cut off the tail; who, having thus hunted the elephant, and possessed himself of its caudal appendage, was considered, as I suppose, entitled to have it borne before him.' The “kroom” near Kumase at which the chase ended was, seemingly, a parcel of land that the Akwamuhene donated to aspirant aberemp[unavailable]n. Kwasi Brantuo was, in fact, given the Adiebeba lands in 1862 by the Kumase Akwamuhene Akwawua Dente; and Opoku Frefre, whose candidacy will be referred to next, was awarded the Daakwadwam lands by Akwawua Dente's forerunner in office, Kwakye Kofi.' <sup id="cite_ref-733" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-733">[733]</a></sup> 'IN THE COURSE OF HIS VISIT to Kumase in 1817, Bowdich testified unambiguously to the connection between office and wealth. “The chiefs,” he wrote, 'are fed bountifully by the labours of their slaves, and sharing large sums of the revenue (the fines their oppression has imposed on other governments), with incalculable fees for corruption or interference, refine upon the splendour of equipage even to satiety, and still possess a large surplus of income daily accumulating' Bowdich was, however, also aware of the prejudice that existed, on the part of the older aristocratic families whose fortunes had been consolidated during the wars of expansion in the earlier eighteenth century, against the parvenu rich whose profits derived principally from trade. Bowdich recorded what was clearly a partisan view of the issue. Of the encouragement of trade, he commented, 'their government would repress rather than countenance the inclination (believing no state can be aggrandized but by conquest), lest their genius for war might be enervated by it, and lest, either from the merchants increasing to a body too formidable for their wishes to be resisted, or too artful from their experience to be detected, they might sacrifice the national honour and ambition to their avarice, and furnishing Inta [Gonja], Dagwumba [Dagomba], or any of their more powerful neighbours (who have yielded to circumstances rather than force) with guns and powder (which are never to be exported from Ashantee), break the spell of their conquests, and undermine their powers.' Again, David Hume's general observations on the development of a merchant class are highly pertinent: 'This perhaps is the chief advantage which arises from commerce with strangers. It rouses men from their indolence; and presenting the gayer and more opulent part of the nation with objects of luxury, which they never before dreamed of, raises in them a desire of a more splendid way of life than what their ancestors enjoyed. And at the same time, the few merchants, who possess the secret of this importation and exportation, make great profits; and becoming rivals in wealth to the ancient nobility, tempt other adventurers to become their rivals in commerce.' [Page 152] Bowdich's report of the views of the Asante nobility appears to echo Hume: 'Were they to encourage commerce, pomp, the idol of which they are most jealous, would soon cease to be their prerogative, because it would be attainable by others; the traders growing wealthy, would vie with them; and for their own security, stimulated by reflections they have now too little at risk to originate, they would unite to repress the arbitrary power of the Aristocracy; and even if they did not, inevitably (as the chiefs conceive) divert the people's genius for war.' <sup id="cite_ref-734" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-734">[734]</a></sup> 'It would be easy to regard such appointees, collectively, as constituting a collaborating class. But one of the purposes of this essay has been to suggest that such a concept is of little analytical importance. It has been shown that those who were to collaborate with the colonial authorities had adopted ideological positions sharply divergent from the prevailing political mores long before the loss of Asante independence could have been foreseen. It has been suggested here that in the last quarter of the nineteenth century the fundamental challenge to the dominant mercantile ideology in Asante was presented by an embryonic bourgeoisie committed to the principles of laissez faire and that no analysis of the acute political conflicts which divided the Asante nation in that period is possible without reference to such ideological factors. Moreover, the history of the Gold Coast and of Ghana in the twentieth century can be understood, I believe, only with adequate reference to the nineteenth-century situation. The development of the cocoa industry represented, perhaps, the triumph of a new bourgeoisie “liberated” by the forces of colonialism. The economic policies of Kwame Nkrumah are to be seen as in many respects reviving those of Mensa Bonsu and Agyeman Prempeh, recognizing that the rapid development of the national economy must necessarily involve, albeit on mutually acceptable terms, the participation of foreign capital and expertise. The policies of Kofi Busia appeared designed, conversely, to stimulate the growth of the indigenous middle class. Subsequent governments have vacillated between these alternative paths to salvation.' <sup id="cite_ref-735" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-735">[735]</a></sup> While attributing class structures to non-capitalist economies is difficult, Wilks distinguishes between 'nobles', an emerging urban 'bourgeoisie', free farmers, and unfree servants: 'It is notoriously difficult to characterize the class structure of precapitalist societies. To this generalization Asante is no exception, though R. A. Kea's studies of a number of seventeenth century Akan polities have provided an invaluable lead.  For present purposes the postulate is that a class reproduces itself as a class and that it does so only insofar as it has a determinate and specific, though not necessarily direct, relationship to the means of production. Consider, for example, the Asante class of the adehyeε, a word commonly but inappropriately translated [Page 294] “royalty” in English. “The old adage” (and I quote the collective wisdom of the late Asantehene and his councillors in a judgment passed down in 1964) “is that a royal is one whose ancestor had established or founded a village." This succinct statement of traditional usage defines a class within Asante society by implicit reference to a set of proprietary rights over land exercised by those who were thereby able to appropriate, in the form of tributes, taxes, and services, part of the labor-value of others settled on the land. I have elsewhere suggested that the origins of the adehyeε class are to be sought in the context of the great economic transformations associated with the development of forest agriculture. I have also suggested that the gyaasefo emerged as a servile class in precisely the same context. In this chapter I argue that the asomfo, or those in administrative service, came to constitute a class within Asante society in precisely the same sense of class. Unlike both adehyeε and gyaasefo, however, the asomfo class emerged in an urban rather than rural context, and at a much later date: its full development was, therefore, specific to Asante rather than common to Akan society in general.' <sup id="cite_ref-736" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-736">[736]</a></sup> However, this does not seem to constitute a caste system.</dd></dl>
<p><b>♠ social mobility ♣ present ♥</b> Society was organized in matrilineal kin groups rather than castes: 'All Akan groups recognize matrilineal descent. The basic group is the clan, of which there are eight; they are dispersed among the many kingdoms. Members of a subclan tend to occupy a single town or village. The clan is an exogamous group. It is comprised of constituent groups that may be referred to as lineages, but these do not form any kind of segmentary lineage system, lineages being attached to others by propinquity and the power and wealth of the host lineage. Although there has been much confusion in accounts of the Akan peoples between matriliny and matriarchy, authority within clans and lineages is held firmly by men, succession being from a man to his brother or to his closest sister's son.' <sup id="cite_ref-737" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-737">[737]</a></sup> 'A child inherits his or her blood from the mother, and character or temperament from the father. Maternal blood ensures the child's membership in the ABUSUA (clan or lineage); paternity bestows membership in one of nine other groups or categories. Although some accounts claim the Akan descent system is one of double descent, this view appears to be based on a misreading of the actual roles of the two lines of descent. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-738" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-738">[738]</a></sup> 'There are groups in which membership is transmitted patrilineally, but these are neither exogamous nor corporate groups; nor are jural or political rights or duties derived from paternal descent. What is involved is the concept of NTORO; the male transmitted NTORO (spirit) which forms a unique spiritual bond between father and son. Following this principle, every person belongs to one of a limited number of named quasi-ritual categories, the ntoro divisions. Members of the same ntoro division are required to observe certain taboos, perform certain rituals, and are believed to have some common personality characteristics. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-739" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-739">[739]</a></sup> 'Consistent with the emphasis on matrilineal descent is the fact that the system of kinship terminology is of the Crow type.

Security of tenure was based on working the land. Abandoned land reverted to the stool. Rights to land were inherited matrilineally. Today Akan have the right to sell land although leasing seems to be the preferred arrangement. [IS]' <sup id="cite_ref-741" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-741">[741]</a></sup> 'The localized matrilineage tracing descent from a known common female ancestor for a period of 10 to 12 generations is the basic unit for political, legal, and ritual purposes.

[ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-742" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-742">[742]</a></sup> Lineage segments were differentiated along the lines of heritable interest in property: 'Segments: While the lineage as a whole has some corporate concern with sponsoring the funeral of any of its members and with assigning that member's property to an heir, heritable interests in various properties can differentiate lineage members. Subsets of the membership of a lineage — equalling lineage segments — are defined by the existence of any property for which members of the subsets (exclusive of others) are potential heirs. Such sets (subsets of the whole) may range from, at the one extreme, only the actual children of some man's actual sisters (in the case of property that he himself created) to, at the other extreme, all the members of the lineage (in the case of property, in effect, created by the lineage founder). In Egyaa, only chiefly positions fall in the long-lived extreme, while (almost) all other created property (in Egyaa) falls in or near the short-lived extreme. No property in Egyaa falls enough in between the two extremes to matter, but property that survived long enough to be inherited through several generations (but not substantially longer) were such to exist, would create sets of members representing intermediate segments of the lineage's membership.' <sup id="cite_ref-743" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-743">[743]</a></sup> Slavery was practiced: 'The Akan practiced slavery, obtaining slaves from northern slave dealers, usually Muslims. War captives, criminals, persons who opposed local chiefs, and many local ritual leaders were also enslaved. Slaves were used for domestic and field labor, for sale to traders across the Sahara and Atlantic, and as sacrifices to royal and other ancestors. In the middle of the nineteenth century, slaves amounted to half of the population in many towns. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-744" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-744">[744]</a></sup> Wealthy urban families relied on unfree labour, but wealth stratification had emerged before the colonial period: 'The Portuguese “blueprint” of 1572 associates gold mining, forest clearing, and food production, and implicitly postulates the existence [Page 96] of an appropriating class and a producing class. It is, I suggest, mutatis mutandis, a paradigm of sorts for the early Akan state. Those who controlled the production and sale of gold were those able to procure a supply of unfree labor. Those who procured unfree labor were those able to create arable land within the forest. Those who created the arable were those who founded the numerous early Akan polities. We see, in other words, a class of Akan entrepreneurs emerging: a class of those able to use the strength of the world bullion market, and the availability of labor locally (whether through Wangara or Portuguese suppliers), in such a way as to create the new agrarian system. These entrepreneurs were known as the aberemp[unavailable]n (sing. [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n), literally “big men” but correctly glossed in an early European source as “a superior rich man.” ' <sup id="cite_ref-745" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-745">[745]</a></sup> 'Akan village histories make frequent reference to hunters ranging the forest in search of land suitable for agricultural exploitation—taking account, presumably, of surface relief, water resources, soil, and so forth. The role of the aberemp[unavailable]n in these explorations is often described in considerable detail. By way of illustration I shall cite the cases of two, Tabiri Heman and Akuamoa Panin.' <sup id="cite_ref-746" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-746">[746]</a></sup> 'The descendants of free settlers became [unavailable]manmufo, citizens. Those of the proprietors became adehyeε, nobility. There remain the unfree laborers. They must surely be those who became the third major element in the composition of an [unavailable]man, namely the gyaasefo. Literally “the people of the hearth,” they were absorbed into Akan society as servants of the adehyeε. They became responsible not only for their own subsistence but for that of the nobles. They farmed for them, assumed responsibility for their debts, and provided them with a wide range of personal services as stool-carriers, drummers, hornblowers, umbrella-carriers, bathroom attendants, messengers, tradesmen, sextons, and so forth. Their masters (or mistresses) were heirs to their property. Their status, unlike that of nobles and citizens, was transmitted through the male line. Rattray commented on the matter: [Page 100] 'There is little doubt that the Gyasefo were in olden times recruited from the slave class. A “Stool” slave became one of the Gyasefo. The descendants of a Gyase woman were of course considered as Gyasefo, down the female line for all time; not only was this so, but the son of a Gyase man would ordinarily also enter the office to which his father belonged, irrespective of the position of his mother.' <sup id="cite_ref-747" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-747">[747]</a></sup> 'It is virtually impossible to render such terms as adehyeε, [unavailable]manmufo and gyaasefo into English with the appropriate nuances. Adehyeε may preside over the affairs of anything from villages on the one hand to kingdoms on the other. Their power will rest in no small measure upon the sheer numbers of gyaasefo whose services they command; indeed, this is one index of their rank. In 1936 Oheneba Sakyi Djan manfully struggled with the problem, though with reference to the more southerly forest Akan: 'The term “Gyaase”…applies to the most immediate adherents attached to the household of any important personage. In this instance, even an ordinary well-to-do man (rich man) may have his own Gyaase, so much so that the head of a family (Opanyin or Atrankonnua) or a ruler of a town (Odekro), or a head of a division of a state (Ohene) or the supreme head or king of a state (Omanhene) should necessarily have his own Gyaase-men, and the number of the members constituting the Gyaase of each of the above heads depends on the importance of the party concerned. That is to say, the number of the members of the Gyaase attached to the Ohene's household is by far fewer than that attached to the Omanhene household.' It was all to do with achievement. The fortunes of an [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n depended first on his ability to procure the labor that, the estate established, became his gyaasefo, and second on his ability to attract free settlers to the estate. Measured in these terms the relatively unsuccessful [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n emerged as no more than a village head, an [unavailable]dekuro, and was absorbed in time into the aman (qua state) of his more successful peer, the [unavailable]hene of this or that group of towns and villages, and he in turn into the aman (qua kingdom) of those even more successful. We turn to a consideration of the most successful of all.' <sup id="cite_ref-748" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-748">[748]</a></sup> 'ON THE BASIS OF HIS observations of Kumase society in 1817, Bowdich became strongly aware of the degree of social stratification present. Of the many indicators of this—housing, diet, hygiene, toiletry, marriage, and so forth —he commented most fully on matters of the household economy:[Page 140] 'the higher class could not support their numerous followers, or the lower their large families, in the city, and therefore employed them in plantations (in which small crooms [villages] were situated) generally within two or three miles of the capital, where their labours not only feed themselves, but supply the wants of the chief, his family, and more immediate suite. The middling orders station their slaves for the same purpose, and also to collect fruit and vegetables for sale, and when their children become numerous, a part are generally sent to be supported by these slaves in the bush.' <sup id="cite_ref-749" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-749">[749]</a></sup> 'Bowdich's “higher class” would appear to refer to the wealthy citizens, high officeholders for the most part, whose gyaasefo or “retainers” supported them; his “middling orders” to aspirant citizens  in the process of creating, through utilization of slaves, their own gyaasefo; and his “lower class” to those who perforce ensured their survival by the use of family labor. If Bowdich may be understood to be suggesting that the commanding morality of metropolitan society was one of upward mobility based on wealth, then he was undoubtedly correct. Had Bowdich remained in Kumase a few months longer, he would have observed that upward mobility was an institutionalized process.' <sup id="cite_ref-750" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-750">[750]</a></sup> Accordingly, political influence was tied to wealth.

Of the encouragement of trade, he commented, 'their government would repress rather than countenance the inclination (believing no state can be aggrandized but by conquest), lest their genius for war might be enervated by it, and lest, either from the merchants increasing to a body too formidable for their wishes to be resisted, or too artful from their experience to be detected, they might sacrifice the national honour and ambition to their avarice, and furnishing Inta [Gonja], Dagwumba [Dagomba], or any of their more powerful neighbours (who have yielded to circumstances rather than force) with guns and powder (which are never to be exported from Ashantee), break the spell of their conquests, and undermine their powers.' Again, David Hume's general observations on the development of a merchant class are highly pertinent: 'This perhaps is the chief advantage which arises from commerce with strangers. It rouses men from their indolence; and presenting the gayer and more opulent part of the nation with objects of luxury, which they never before dreamed of, raises in them a desire of a more splendid way of life than what their ancestors enjoyed. And at the same time, the few merchants, who possess the secret of this importation and exportation, make great profits; and becoming rivals in wealth to the ancient nobility, tempt other adventurers to become their rivals in commerce.' [Page 152] Bowdich's report of the views of the Asante nobility appears to echo Hume: 'Were they to encourage commerce, pomp, the idol of which they are most jealous, would soon cease to be their prerogative, because it would be attainable by others; the traders growing wealthy, would vie with them; and for their own security, stimulated by reflections they have now too little at risk to originate, they would unite to repress the arbitrary power of the Aristocracy; and even if they did not, inevitably (as the chiefs conceive) divert the people's genius for war.' <sup id="cite_ref-754" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-754">[754]</a></sup> 'It would be easy to regard such appointees, collectively, as constituting a collaborating class. But one of the purposes of this essay has been to suggest that such a concept is of little analytical importance. It has been shown that those who were to collaborate with the colonial authorities had adopted ideological positions sharply divergent from the prevailing political mores long before the loss of Asante independence could have been foreseen. It has been suggested here that in the last quarter of the nineteenth century the fundamental challenge to the dominant mercantile ideology in Asante was presented by an embryonic bourgeoisie committed to the principles of laissez faire and that no analysis of the acute political conflicts which divided the Asante nation in that period is possible without reference to such ideological factors. Moreover, the history of the Gold Coast and of Ghana in the twentieth century can be understood, I believe, only with adequate reference to the nineteenth-century situation. The development of the cocoa industry represented, perhaps, the triumph of a new bourgeoisie “liberated” by the forces of colonialism. The economic policies of Kwame Nkrumah are to be seen as in many respects reviving those of Mensa Bonsu and Agyeman Prempeh, recognizing that the rapid development of the national economy must necessarily involve, albeit on mutually acceptable terms, the participation of foreign capital and expertise. The policies of Kofi Busia appeared designed, conversely, to stimulate the growth of the indigenous middle class. Subsequent governments have vacillated between these alternative paths to salvation.' <sup id="cite_ref-755" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-755">[755]</a></sup> While attributing class structures to non-capitalist economies is difficult, Wilks distinguishes between 'nobles', an emerging urban 'bourgeoisie', free farmers, and unfree servants: 'It is notoriously difficult to characterize the class structure of precapitalist societies. To this generalization Asante is no exception, though R. A. Kea's studies of a number of seventeenth century Akan polities have provided an invaluable lead.  For present purposes the postulate is that a class reproduces itself as a class and that it does so only insofar as it has a determinate and specific, though not necessarily direct, relationship to the means of production. Consider, for example, the Asante class of the adehyeε, a word commonly but inappropriately translated [Page 294] “royalty” in English. “The old adage” (and I quote the collective wisdom of the late Asantehene and his councillors in a judgment passed down in 1964) “is that a royal is one whose ancestor had established or founded a village." This succinct statement of traditional usage defines a class within Asante society by implicit reference to a set of proprietary rights over land exercised by those who were thereby able to appropriate, in the form of tributes, taxes, and services, part of the labor-value of others settled on the land. I have elsewhere suggested that the origins of the adehyeε class are to be sought in the context of the great economic transformations associated with the development of forest agriculture. I have also suggested that the gyaasefo emerged as a servile class in precisely the same context. In this chapter I argue that the asomfo, or those in administrative service, came to constitute a class within Asante society in precisely the same sense of class. Unlike both adehyeε and gyaasefo, however, the asomfo class emerged in an urban rather than rural context, and at a much later date: its full development was, therefore, specific to Asante rather than common to Akan society in general.' <sup id="cite_ref-756" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-756">[756]</a></sup> While chiefly positions and stools were passed on within matrilineages, the fact that 'newly rich' men could obtain special titles seems to indicate some degree of social mobility.

<dl><dd> <b>♠ recruitment of chief executive ♣ higher ♥</b> Arhin describes the power hierarchy from the village upwards: 'Female stools complemented the hierarchy of male stools. In the village the elders, mpanyinfo, heads of the matrilineages, who constituted with the odekro the village council, had their aberewa or obaapanyin, who looked after the women's affairs. The odekro had an obaapanyin who was responsible for the affairs of the women of the village and was a member of the village council; the ohene, head of a division, and the omanhene, head of the autonomous political community, had their female counterparts known as ohemma, female ruler, who sat on their councils. The ohene and the ohemma were all of the same mogya, blood, or clan. The Asantehemma, the occupant of the female stool of the Kumasi state, and therefore of united Asante, since her male counterpart was ex officio the Asantehene, king of Asante, was a member of the Kotoko council, the executive committee or cabinet of the Asanteman Nhyiamu, general assembly of Asante rulers.' <sup id="cite_ref-757" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-757">[757]</a></sup> Major and minor chiefs were also summoned to council: 'Where the paramount King of a state summons the Head-Chiefs of provinces and chiefs of minor communities to attend a State Council, it is the privilege of the Councillors of the several communities composing the State, according to their rank and importance, to accompany their several Heads to the capital and to join in the “palaver,” or discussion, that will take place, the King in person presiding over the deliberations, supported by his own Councillors and principal Linguists. This is the full Parliament of the people, who are thus fully and duly represented in every way from the highest to the lowest. The commands which go forth from this assembly are binding upon every individual family of the entire State, from the most important province to the most insignificant hamlet, and the sanction operates equally upon all.' <sup id="cite_ref-758" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-758">[758]</a></sup> The paramount executive authority was the Asantehene: 'The King is the Chief Executive Officer of the State, but not the Executive Council of the State. Such a council exists, and any acts done by the King without its concurrence are liable to be set aside.' <sup id="cite_ref-759" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-759">[759]</a></sup> The attribution of concrete entities to a particular executive level is not always clear, though, especially in the early period: 'The state of the union that emerged after the War of Independence was obviously a very fluid one. The Asanteman is referred to as the  Asante Aman Nnum, the Five Asante States, but there is no clear consensus about which states comprised the original union. [...] The fact of the matter seems to have been that the coalition against the Denkyira included what were no more than “estates” on the one hand, like Bekwae, and what were established states on the other, like Mampon, Dwaben, and Kumase itself. Some were to decline and some were to prosper; some were to become powerful components of the Asanteman and some were to become little more than their clients.' <sup id="cite_ref-760" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-760">[760]</a></sup> On the executive level it therefore seems best to go with the stool system: 'Every Asante village was a microcosm of the Asante economic, social, and political universe. Its population included both rulers and ruled, both “owners” of the land with the right of succession to the local, divisional, and state stools and free men grouped in other lineages with corporate interests in other political offices.' <sup id="cite_ref-761" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-761">[761]</a></sup> Only a few leaders in executive positions achieved the additional special status of Abrempon or 'big man': 'However many sikafo aspired to the award of the elephant tail, relatively few seem to have achieved it. Three successful nineteenth century claimants are well documented, namely, Gyaasewahene Opoku Frefre (died 1826), Ankobeahene Kwaku Tawia (died ca. 1850), and Manwerehene Kwasi Brantuo (died 1865). [...] I know of no female recipient of the honor. I do not think that women were disbarred by reason of their sex, rather that few if any achieved the necessary level of accumulation. [...] Those chiefs who were allowed to use elephant tails were called Abrempons. A chief who lives on his own land with his own subjects is known by the King as Abrempon.' <sup id="cite_ref-762" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-762">[762]</a></sup> The initiation required involved presentations of wealth as well as ritualized ceremonial. However, the office of Asantehene as well as other chiefly positions were passed on within matrilineages.

<p><b>♠ occupational mobility ♣ present ♥</b> Cultivation systems varied with local ecology: 'The different ecological zones have given rise to contrasting types of agriculture. In the north the main subsistence and cash crop is yams, followed by guinea corn; by 1950 there still had not been any large-scale development of export crops. In the south, a much larger variety of subsistence crops are grown, especially yams, cocoyams, manioc, and maize. Also, there has been widespread development of major commercial crops such as the kola-nut and cocoa, which has become the main economic activity in the southern zone. In former times, until the end of the nineteenth century, farm work was done by servile labor: slaves, pawns, and various kinds of servants. Today sharecropping and hired labor are the most prevalent, although domestic peonage is still common. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-763" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-763">[763]</a></sup> While the rural population consisted primarily of farmers and craftsmen, the towns offered a more diverse labor market: 'The Kumasi Central Market is among the largest in West Africa and lies at the center of a vast market region. Traders, wholesalers, distributors, transporters, and retailers make up a complex network of exchanges, which are bolstered by a variety of kin, ethnic, and local ties. Commodity chiefs control the wholesale end of the business regulating prices. In the early nineteenth century men moved into commercial farming, leaving women to run the markets. [IS]' <sup id="cite_ref-764" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-764">[764]</a></sup> 'But by the late eighteenth century the capital, Kumase, and several other major centers of local administration - Bekwae, Dwaben, Kokofu, and Mampon, for example - had come to offer a wide range of employment opportunities other than farming: in court, in the civil and military administrations, in business, in crafts, and so forth. In the early nineteenth century Kumase was already a town of about 20,000 people, few of whom were directly engaged in food production.' <sup id="cite_ref-765" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-765">[765]</a></sup>
Craft specializaton was also present:  'The Ashanti are noted for their expertise in a variety of specialized crafts. These include weaving, woodcarving, ceramics, and metallurgy. Weaving is a highly developed craft, with dozens of standardized and named textile designs. Weaving in cotton and silk is of a technically and aesthetically high order, and much commerce is built around it. Woodcarvings have also become a valuable commodity, especially with the rise of the tourist trade in the late twentieth century. Woodcarving is divided into many branches, each with its own specialists. Among the major products are wooden sculptures of outstanding artistic quality, talking-drums (NTUPANE), and the famous wooden "stools," which are symbolic and ritual objects rather than items of furniture.' <sup id="cite_ref-766" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-766">[766]</a></sup> 'One of the most specialized crafts is metallurgy. Traditionally, Ashanti metal smiths worked in iron, brass, bronze, silver, and gold. Agricultural implements and other metal utensils were made of iron. Using a lost-wax process, smiths cast brass and bronze gold weights (MRAMMUE) of geometric, human, or animal forms. Although these objects are now mainly of interest to art collectors, their original function was practical; they were standard weights used to measure gold dust. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-767" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-767">[767]</a></sup> 'Craft production was an individual undertaking, and apprentice craftsmen were more often sons than sisters' sons. There were concentrations of certain crafts in certain villages, which were founded with war captives or refugees. Among these were settlements in the Kumase district such as Bonwire (cloth weaving), Ntonso (cloth dyeing), Pankrono (pottery), Ahwia (woodworking), and Breman and Adum (metalworking). Blacksmithery and joinery which catered to the needs of cultivators were scattered throughout the kingdom (Bowdich 1819, Dupuis 1824, Freeman 1967 [1898]). The crafts concerned with the elaboration of regalia were located in the immediate neighbourhood of the state capitals and the imperial capital of Kumasi (Rattray 1927: 216-308; Arhin 1982). Craft practitioners owned their own tools, and the factors that conditioned production were agricultural demand and state requirements.' <sup id="cite_ref-768" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-768">[768]</a></sup> Trade was also important: 'There were early cultural and commercial links with the empires of the southern Sahara. The major commodities exchanged were gold from the Akan region and salt from the Sahara. The main Akan trading town was Bighu (Bitu) with links to Jenne on the Niger bend. Trade in gold and slaves formed the commercial basis of the traditional Ashanti state. Kola-nuts were also exported to the north. Today cocoa is Ghana's main export commodity.

<p><b>♠ Proportion of population enslaved ♣ 50% ♥</b> Slavery was widely practiced: 'The Akan practiced slavery, obtaining slaves from northern slave dealers, usually Muslims. War captives, criminals, persons who opposed local chiefs, and many local ritual leaders were also enslaved. Slaves were used for domestic and field labor, for sale to traders across the Sahara and Atlantic, and as sacrifices to royal and other ancestors. In the middle of the nineteenth century, slaves amounted to half of the population in many towns. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-770" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-770">[770]</a></sup> Uncles could 'pawn' their nephew and nieces: 'An uncle had the power to pawn his nephew or niece. The whole legal position of pawns ( nwowa) will be examined later in detail under that heading. An uncle was expected to give the father of the person he wished to pawn ‘the first refusal’, that is, to ask him if he would not himself like to take his own child as his pawn. In any case, whether the father desired to do so or not, he might not protest or interfere. My Ashanti informants state that the person to be pawned would not wish him to do either, and remarked, Oba ose ose dome abusua (‘A child may resemble his father, but affection (duty) is for the blood relations’); and again, Gyadua si abontene ne hi wo fie (‘The gyadua (tree) may stand in the street, but its roots are in the house). ‘His uncle may not beat or punish your child while he is under your care, but, on the other hand, you may spend much money on your children, consulting the gods, yet when their uncle's house becomes poor he will sell them.’' <sup id="cite_ref-771" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-771">[771]</a></sup> 'An uncle had the power to compel his niece to divorce her husband so that he might pawn her to raise money to ‘buy the head’ of one of his abusua. He would give her husband the option to advance the money, taking his wife as a pawn, but if he could not or would not do so, two courses were open to him: ( a) To put white clay upon his wife's back, i. e. divorce her, to enable her uncle to pawn her elsewhere, or, ( b) Pawn himself or his nephew to pay the debt of his wife's uncle.' <sup id="cite_ref-772" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-772">[772]</a></sup> 'My informant added, ‘If you refused to do either of these things, the uncle would “swear an oath” upon you to buy your wife for some large amount ( tramma), for your wife is the property of her uncle, she is his agyapadie (inherited ancestral property).' <sup id="cite_ref-773" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-773">[773]</a></sup> There were multiple classes of slaves: 'The Akan groups are characterized by matrilineal descent, inheritance, and succession. The Fanti and Ashanti have exogamous patrilineages also, making a double descent system. There is polygamy. In traditional Ghana when custom had determining influence on social life, a preference was given to cross-cousin marriage which among other things ensured that, in spite of matrilineal system of inheritance, the daughters of a man benefited from his property which they and their mother helped him to acquire. Local endogamy and traditional slavery and debt slavery also prevailed. There are no endogamous castes and no initiation schools.' <sup id="cite_ref-774" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-774">[774]</a></sup> 'Slaves were not allowed to mix freely with free-men or allowed to go to the chief's palace; they were required to work harder and to do the dirty work. Moreover they were not accorded a funeral custom. There were four sub-classes of slaves. (1) The akoa (plural nkoa) originally referred only to voluntary servitude of a person to, for example, his MoBr (w[unavailable]fa). The best translation originally would have been “subject”; in reality it came to include persons whom another person had power over, merging with [unavailable]d[unavailable]nk[unavailable], the slave proper. (2) [unavailable]d[unavailable]nk[unavailable] (plural nn[unavailable]nk[unavailable], nn[unavailable]nk[unavailable]fo is a non-Akan purchased expressly as a slave. The second generation would always be termed akoa. They were usually bought at Salaga, a male costing the equivalent in cowries of 9,000 kola nuts, a female costing the equivalent of 14,000 kola nuts. Outside of Ashanti the master had life and death prerogative over his slaves; within Ashanti any execution had to be performed by the Asantehene's executioners. (3) The dommum was a foreign prisoner of war or tribute. All these [Page 40] classes of slaves could marry, own property (including his own slaves), swear an oath, and become heir to his master. A slave could swear an oath to be taken by another master if badly treated. Slaves could be sacrificed, and a reserve of them were kept at a special village (Akyere kurom). (4) An akyere was a slave condemned to death for an offense but saved until a sacrifice was required.'  <sup id="cite_ref-775" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-775">[775]</a></sup> Slaves could not hold stools and only inherited their master's wealth if no matrikin were present: 'Inheritance is arranged by the ohurew or executor responsible for all the funeral arrangements. Ideally the ohurew is the deceased's father's younger brother's son, in the same generation but preferably junior to the deceased. For a female deceased the ideal is FaBrDa. A dying declaration (samansew) is binding if there are witnesses. Although the ohurew is required to settle and distribute the estate, there is a constant problem of distinguishing family from self-acquired property. “The uncle seems in theory the heir to the personal property of his nephews, but almost invariably he waives his right in favour of the deceased's next eldest brother” (Rattray 1929:4). Next in line after eldest brother is the next brother in age until all the deceased's brothers are exhausted. Next is SiSo, then MoSiSo, and finally after all the male possibilities are exhausted the females are eligible for male property, beginning with the deceased's eldest sister. If all relatives are dead, the property (but never a stool) is inherited by a slave, even before the man's actual children — who are completely excluded. This same line of inheritance is followed in the succession for a stool, except that the line stops at slaves and women.' <sup id="cite_ref-776" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-776">[776]</a></sup> But slaves could be adopted into matrilineages: 'Douglas has argued that “matrilineal descent groups are organised to recruit members by other means additional to direct lineal descent”; that “matrilineal descent goes with a quality of openness in the texture of effective descent groups”; and that [Page 80] 'because of the open texture of its descent groups and its bias towards a wide-ranging recruitment of manpower, matriliny is well adapted to any situation in which competing demands for men are higher than demands for material resources.' We suggest, then, that this “open texture” may have been at least one of the factors dictating the new form of social organization that appeared [Page 81] at the time of the clearances: the matriclan functioned to facilitate the assimilation of strangers and, to the point, of the unfree labor being drawn into the forest country. From more recent times we know that those of unfree origins were assimilated as rapidly as possible into the class of free Asante commoners and their acquired status afforded full protection of the law. An Ashanti slave,” wrote Rattray, in nine cases out of ten, possibly became an adopted member of the family, and in time his descendants so merged and intermarried with the owner's kinsmen that only a few would know their origin.' But Rattray still failed to allow fully for the “open texture” of the matrilineal group. The view has been expressed to the writer on many occasions that “in the old days” women married at a young age and men at a relatively advanced one; hat a male slave might often become the third, fourth, or even fifth husband of a (by then elderly) free woman, so that any children she bore by him would be free; and that female slaves were often married by free men and their children immediately adopted into the father's lineage.' <sup id="cite_ref-777" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-777">[777]</a></sup> But slaves had no recourse to corporate descent groups of their own and could be ritually sacrificed: 'Such briefly were the rights of an Ashantislave. They seemed in many instances practically the ordinary privileges of any Ashanti free man, with whom, in these respects, his position did not seem to compare so unfavourably. The chief danger in which his peculiar status placed him appears to me to lie in the fact that the slave was generally a solitary creature more or less at the mercy of a single individual. Every one around him was in a sense ‘the slave’ of some one, but such persons had always behind them a whole group of relatives, whose numbers and wealth and power were ever at their disposal. The slave was not ordinarily possessed jointly (a position which would have ensured certain safeguards); at least, not when a member of a family had purchased him with the proceeds of his own individual labour. It seems probable that circumstances generally would have tended towards his kind treatment. An Ashanti slave, in nine cases out of ten, possibly became an adopted member of the family, and in time his descendants so merged and intermarried with the owner's kinsmen that only a few would know their origin. One outstanding fact, however, remained, i.e. that the status of a slave, i.e. an odonko, could never be lost, and, when necessity arose, or the terrible practice of human sacrifice became the vogue, an otherwise kind and considerate master would turn instinctively to the man who had no friend in the world, in order to satisfy the need for money or for a victim. The liability to be sacrificed at funeral customs may have been an ever-present fear in the mind of a West African slave. Many persons indeed were inevitably condemned to such an end. This idea was, as time went on, developed in an extraordinary degree. Whole villages existed where all the inhabitants were looked upon as a human reservoir from which, when occasion arose, sacrificial victims might be drawn. Such villages were called Akyere kurom (village of Akyere). Akyere means a slave who, instead of suffering immediate capital punishment for some offence of which he had been found guilty, was [Page 43] held over till his unhappy services were required. Meanwhile the person thus condemned went about his or her ordinary vocations, possibly was kept waiting for death for many years, married, brought children into the world, who again married and bore grandchildren to the original culprit. All these descendants (through the female line) inherited the liability of their ancestor to suffer capital punishment at any moment, and helped to swell a reserve of potential funeral victims.' <sup id="cite_ref-778" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-778">[778]</a></sup> Slaves featured prominently in the trade with European powers: 'The fact of the matter is, then, that when the Portuguese entered the Akan gold trade in 1471, those they sought to do business with already had strong consumer preferences, formed in the context of their prior involvement with the Wangara. There was, however, one commodity that was not available from the northern traders: firearms. Initially, so it seems, a brisk exchange of guns for gold took place at Elmina, though such transactions were banned by papal decree. Pope Sixtus IV was petitioned to lift the restriction. On 28 January 1481, he forgave those who had transgressed but reaffirmed the ban. The Christian fear that arms sold at Elmina might find their way into Muslim hands was, in the circumstances, not entirely without foundation. The decision to build the fort of São Jorge at Elmina was taken in the belief that other Portuguese-manufactured produce—“silk, woollen and linen cloths, and other domestic goods” —would find a ready market there. Certainly objects of copper and brass did, whether shaving bowls, urinals, chamber pots, water jugs, bells, boxes, or bracelets (manilhas). Portuguese cloth, however, was apparently not so well received, and the Casa de Guiné in Lisbon was obliged to procure North African “lambens,” “aljaravias,” and the like, to service the Elmina trade. Vogt has suggested that in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries cloth accounted for about 40 percent of the business done at São Jorge, and metals for about 37 percent. Next to these was the sale of slaves, accounting for about 10 percent of trade. Duarte Pacheco Pereira's informants on the Gambia spoke, as we have seen, of the merchants of Bitu, “Banbarranaa,” and “Bahaa” going to “Toom,” that is, the Akan country, “to buy gold in exchange for the merchandise and slaves which they take there.” In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries a strong demand for labor arose in forest Akan society as local entrepreneurs, the aberemp[unavailable]n, sought to increase the extent of the cleared land available for tillage (see chapters 2 and 3). Slaves, in other words, could readily be traded against gold. By virtue of their command of the maritime routes, the Portuguese were able to insinuate themselves into this lucrative business. By 1479 Portuguese vessels were already [Page 24] moving slaves to Elmina from as far east as the Benin coast, and after 1515 the islands of São Tomé and Principe were developed as depots for the expanding enterprise. “Both during the life of Don João (1481-95) and of Dom Manuel (1495-1521),” wrote De Barros, 'this sale of slaves continued from Beny [Benin] to Mina, for ordinarily the ships that left this Kingdom went to Beny to buy the slaves, and then carried them to the Mina, until this trade was altered on account of the great inconvenience which arose. A large caravel was wont to sail from the island of S. Thome, where the slaves of the coast of Beny joined those from the kingdom of Congo, because all the vessels that sailed to those parts called there, and this caravel carried them from the island to Mina.' <sup id="cite_ref-779" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-779">[779]</a></sup> 'For the period 1500-35 it has been estimated that the Portuguese imported ten to twelve thousand slaves to Elmina, though the figure takes no account of those landed by smugglers and interlopers. Although their sale accounted for only some 10 percent of the Portuguese trade at Elmina, it was critical in luring the inland merchants to the coast. “An adequate and continuous supply of slaves was indispensable for the success of Portuguese trade at São Jorge da Mina,” Vogt remarks. “Without such slaves, much of the remainder of the trade-goods would not have been sold.” The total cost, including purchase price, transportation, and food, of a slave procured in the Slave Rivers and sold at Elmina was reckoned at about one-third of an ounce of gold. The sale price ranged from about three to six ounces, according to physique.' <sup id="cite_ref-780" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-780">[780]</a></sup> We have adopted the estimate provided by eHRAF, but this may overestimate the number of slaves in Asante.

Human sacrifices were offered at private as well as at royal funerals, and also to gods to ensure the success of Asante military operations and on occasions of national disaster. In addition, human victims were killed at regular Asante festivals, such as the annual Yam festival (Odwira), which involved over 100 deaths a year, and the monthly Adae Festival, at which over 70 people were killed on one occasion in 1820.95 Richard Burton, seeking to defend Dahomey against charges of excess in these matters in the 1860s, could reasonably claim that Asante was worse." <sup id="cite_ref-781" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-781">[781]</a></sup> See also slavery above.

Each kingdom and town has, or had in past years, an annual purification ritual, known as ODWIRA, in which the king, the office of kingship, the kingdom, and the town are purified of the pollution of the preceding year; this is often known in the literature as a "yam festival."

<dd> <b>♠ Ideological thought distinguishes elites and commoners ♣ present ♥</b> Society was organized in matrilineal kin groups rather than castes: 'All Akan groups recognize matrilineal descent. The basic group is the clan, of which there are eight; they are dispersed among the many kingdoms. Members of a subclan tend to occupy a single town or village. The clan is an exogamous group. It is comprised of constituent groups that may be referred to as lineages, but these do not form any kind of segmentary lineage system, lineages being attached to others by propinquity and the power and wealth of the host lineage. Although there has been much confusion in accounts of the Akan peoples between matriliny and matriarchy, authority within clans and lineages is held firmly by men, succession being from a man to his brother or to his closest sister's son.' <sup id="cite_ref-800" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-800">[800]</a></sup> 'A child inherits his or her blood from the mother, and character or temperament from the father. Maternal blood ensures the child's membership in the ABUSUA (clan or lineage); paternity bestows membership in one of nine other groups or categories. Although some accounts claim the Akan descent system is one of double descent, this view appears to be based on a misreading of the actual roles of the two lines of descent. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-801" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-801">[801]</a></sup> 'There are groups in which membership is transmitted patrilineally, but these are neither exogamous nor corporate groups; nor are jural or political rights or duties derived from paternal descent. What is involved is the concept of NTORO; the male transmitted NTORO (spirit) which forms a unique spiritual bond between father and son. Following this principle, every person belongs to one of a limited number of named quasi-ritual categories, the ntoro divisions. Members of the same ntoro division are required to observe certain taboos, perform certain rituals, and are believed to have some common personality characteristics. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-802" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-802">[802]</a></sup> 'Consistent with the emphasis on matrilineal descent is the fact that the system of kinship terminology is of the Crow type. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-803" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-803">[803]</a></sup> Matrilineages held and transmitted land and political positions: 'Land was the unalienable possession of the clan--actually the clan's ancestral spirits were considered the true owners of the land and the tribal land's living occupants only trustees or tenants. Security of tenure was based on working the land. Abandoned land reverted to the stool. Rights to land were inherited matrilineally. Today Akan have the right to sell land although leasing seems to be the preferred arrangement. [IS]' <sup id="cite_ref-804" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-804">[804]</a></sup> 'The localized matrilineage tracing descent from a known common female ancestor for a period of 10 to 12 generations is the basic unit for political, legal, and ritual purposes.

[ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-805" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-805">[805]</a></sup> Lineage segments were differentiated along the lines of heritable interest in property: 'Segments: While the lineage as a whole has some corporate concern with sponsoring the funeral of any of its members and with assigning that member's property to an heir, heritable interests in various properties can differentiate lineage members. Subsets of the membership of a lineage — equalling lineage segments — are defined by the existence of any property for which members of the subsets (exclusive of others) are potential heirs. Such sets (subsets of the whole) may range from, at the one extreme, only the actual children of some man's actual sisters (in the case of property that he himself created) to, at the other extreme, all the members of the lineage (in the case of property, in effect, created by the lineage founder). In Egyaa, only chiefly positions fall in the long-lived extreme, while (almost) all other created property (in Egyaa) falls in or near the short-lived extreme. No property in Egyaa falls enough in between the two extremes to matter, but property that survived long enough to be inherited through several generations (but not substantially longer) were such to exist, would create sets of members representing intermediate segments of the lineage's membership.' <sup id="cite_ref-806" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-806">[806]</a></sup> Slavery was practiced: 'The Akan practiced slavery, obtaining slaves from northern slave dealers, usually Muslims. War captives, criminals, persons who opposed local chiefs, and many local ritual leaders were also enslaved. Slaves were used for domestic and field labor, for sale to traders across the Sahara and Atlantic, and as sacrifices to royal and other ancestors. In the middle of the nineteenth century, slaves amounted to half of the population in many towns. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-807" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-807">[807]</a></sup> Wealthy urban families relied on unfree labour, but wealth stratification had emerged before the colonial period: 'The Portuguese “blueprint” of 1572 associates gold mining, forest clearing, and food production, and implicitly postulates the existence [Page 96] of an appropriating class and a producing class. It is, I suggest, mutatis mutandis, a paradigm of sorts for the early Akan state. Those who controlled the production and sale of gold were those able to procure a supply of unfree labor. Those who procured unfree labor were those able to create arable land within the forest. Those who created the arable were those who founded the numerous early Akan polities. We see, in other words, a class of Akan entrepreneurs emerging: a class of those able to use the strength of the world bullion market, and the availability of labor locally (whether through Wangara or Portuguese suppliers), in such a way as to create the new agrarian system. These entrepreneurs were known as the aberemp[unavailable]n (sing. [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n), literally “big men” but correctly glossed in an early European source as “a superior rich man.” ' <sup id="cite_ref-808" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-808">[808]</a></sup> 'Akan village histories make frequent reference to hunters ranging the forest in search of land suitable for agricultural exploitation—taking account, presumably, of surface relief, water resources, soil, and so forth. The role of the aberemp[unavailable]n in these explorations is often described in considerable detail. By way of illustration I shall cite the cases of two, Tabiri Heman and Akuamoa Panin.' <sup id="cite_ref-809" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-809">[809]</a></sup> 'The descendants of free settlers became [unavailable]manmufo, citizens. Those of the proprietors became adehyeε, nobility. There remain the unfree laborers. They must surely be those who became the third major element in the composition of an [unavailable]man, namely the gyaasefo. Literally “the people of the hearth,” they were absorbed into Akan society as servants of the adehyeε. They became responsible not only for their own subsistence but for that of the nobles. They farmed for them, assumed responsibility for their debts, and provided them with a wide range of personal services as stool-carriers, drummers, hornblowers, umbrella-carriers, bathroom attendants, messengers, tradesmen, sextons, and so forth. Their masters (or mistresses) were heirs to their property. Their status, unlike that of nobles and citizens, was transmitted through the male line. Rattray commented on the matter: [Page 100] 'There is little doubt that the Gyasefo were in olden times recruited from the slave class. A “Stool” slave became one of the Gyasefo. The descendants of a Gyase woman were of course considered as Gyasefo, down the female line for all time; not only was this so, but the son of a Gyase man would ordinarily also enter the office to which his father belonged, irrespective of the position of his mother.' <sup id="cite_ref-810" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-810">[810]</a></sup> 'It is virtually impossible to render such terms as adehyeε, [unavailable]manmufo and gyaasefo into English with the appropriate nuances. Adehyeε may preside over the affairs of anything from villages on the one hand to kingdoms on the other. Their power will rest in no small measure upon the sheer numbers of gyaasefo whose services they command; indeed, this is one index of their rank. In 1936 Oheneba Sakyi Djan manfully struggled with the problem, though with reference to the more southerly forest Akan: 'The term “Gyaase”…applies to the most immediate adherents attached to the household of any important personage. In this instance, even an ordinary well-to-do man (rich man) may have his own Gyaase, so much so that the head of a family (Opanyin or Atrankonnua) or a ruler of a town (Odekro), or a head of a division of a state (Ohene) or the supreme head or king of a state (Omanhene) should necessarily have his own Gyaase-men, and the number of the members constituting the Gyaase of each of the above heads depends on the importance of the party concerned. That is to say, the number of the members of the Gyaase attached to the Ohene's household is by far fewer than that attached to the Omanhene household.' It was all to do with achievement. The fortunes of an [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n depended first on his ability to procure the labor that, the estate established, became his gyaasefo, and second on his ability to attract free settlers to the estate. Measured in these terms the relatively unsuccessful [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n emerged as no more than a village head, an [unavailable]dekuro, and was absorbed in time into the aman (qua state) of his more successful peer, the [unavailable]hene of this or that group of towns and villages, and he in turn into the aman (qua kingdom) of those even more successful. We turn to a consideration of the most successful of all.' <sup id="cite_ref-811" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-811">[811]</a></sup> 'ON THE BASIS OF HIS observations of Kumase society in 1817, Bowdich became strongly aware of the degree of social stratification present. Of the many indicators of this—housing, diet, hygiene, toiletry, marriage, and so forth —he commented most fully on matters of the household economy:[Page 140] 'the higher class could not support their numerous followers, or the lower their large families, in the city, and therefore employed them in plantations (in which small crooms [villages] were situated) generally within two or three miles of the capital, where their labours not only feed themselves, but supply the wants of the chief, his family, and more immediate suite. The middling orders station their slaves for the same purpose, and also to collect fruit and vegetables for sale, and when their children become numerous, a part are generally sent to be supported by these slaves in the bush.' <sup id="cite_ref-812" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-812">[812]</a></sup> 'Bowdich's “higher class” would appear to refer to the wealthy citizens, high officeholders for the most part, whose gyaasefo or “retainers” supported them; his “middling orders” to aspirant citizens  in the process of creating, through utilization of slaves, their own gyaasefo; and his “lower class” to those who perforce ensured their survival by the use of family labor. If Bowdich may be understood to be suggesting that the commanding morality of metropolitan society was one of upward mobility based on wealth, then he was undoubtedly correct. Had Bowdich remained in Kumase a few months longer, he would have observed that upward mobility was an institutionalized process.' <sup id="cite_ref-813" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-813">[813]</a></sup> Accordingly, political influence was tied to wealth. New formal titles were created for individuals who gained wealth and thus became part of an emerging 'bourgeoisie': 'Those who attained wealth in Asante were known as the sikafo, “the monied people.” This category subsumed the smaller group of those who acquired fortunes sufficiently substantial for them to seek formal recognition of their achievement. Of these, those able to demonstrate that they had acquired through their own enterprise a modest fortune of 125 peredwans might, with the approval of the Asantehene, obtain the entitlement of wearing in public a specially designed and woven cloth known as nyaw[unavailable]ho, “you have become rich.” It would seem that it was after the acquisition of such a resource in gold dust that the aspirant (and wise) citizen would begin to invest in people and land. The title to be acquired thereby was that of asafohene, an ancient one originally and exclusively meaning “a war captain.” But the title was available at different levels depending upon the number of subjects acquired. As noticed above, Yamoa Ponko gifted to his son, Gyesi Kwame, 100 subjects, and thereby Gyesi Kwame acquired the comparatively low-ranking dignity of an asafohene of the Kyidom Stool. By contrast, in late 1861 or early 1862 the Akyempemhene Owusu Koko, already an occupant of high office in Kumase, nevertheless publicly displayed his three thousand subjects—each in possession of a gun—who must be assumed to have represented self-acquired property. An asafohene able to show command of at least a thousand subjects was entitled not only to wear the nyaw[unavailable]ho cloth but also to have a horse-tail switch ( bodua) carried before him. It was, however, the right to use not the horse-tail but the elephant-tail switch ( mena or mmara) that was the most coveted of all honors—and one carrying with it use of the ancient title of [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n.' <sup id="cite_ref-814" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-814">[814]</a></sup> 'However many sikafo aspired to the award of the elephant tail, relatively few seem to have achieved it. Three successful nineteenth century claimants are well documented, namely, Gyaasewahene Opoku Frefre (died 1826), Ankobeahene Kwaku Tawia (died ca. 1850), and Manwerehene Kwasi Brantuo (died 1865). There were certainly others. A description of the ceremony surrounding the award was given by the Akyeamehene Kwasi Nuama in 1925. Because it is the fullest account of the procedures known to me, I cite it fully: 'Those chiefs who were allowed to use elephant tails were called Abrempons. A chief who lives on his own land with his own subjects is known by the King as Abrempon. An Abrempon must exhibit his wealth publicly by presenting £9 6s. [i.e., 1 peredwan with supplementary mmataho] to all the Abrempons in Kumase; and 10 peregwans (£80) to the King. He would then go to Tafo and pay £1 6s. to the chief there who would give him an egg to throw against a silk cotton tree. He would then return to Kumasi. He would then go to Essumja Santimanso and buy a carpet ( nsa) for £24 [3 peregwans] from the subjects of the Chief there. He must only dance on it and leave it after presenting Essumjahene with another £24. Your going and coming expenses (including the £48) will cost you some 20 pregwans. He would buy an elephant tail from the Assinhene (son of Essumjahene) for £9 6s. He would tie the elephant tail round the waist of one of his slaves and he must then past [ sic] round the outskirts of the town lying on the leaves of palm trees which have been strewn around the town, firing at his slave with blank fire from time to time. The slave falls down eventually and he then cuts the string to which the tail is fastened and takes the tail—then the ceremonies are completed, and his people applaud him. Next morning he would get mashed yam mixed with 30 peregwans and be carried on a litter round the town of Kumasi scattering largesse of the yam mixture. On the following morning he would be carried in a litter with all his regalia, his skin plastered with white clay. Then he would fix up a spear at Dwebirim (the market place) and challenge those of the same rank to remove it. After this he is called Brempon. On the last day anyone who aspires to the rank of Abrempon takes out the spear and appoints a time for performing the same ceremonies.' The Akyeamehene thus identified six stages in the ceremony. The first, the payments to the aberemp[unavailable]n of the capital and to the Asantehene, requires little comment. In the early nineteenth century Hutchison noted that the first step was, for obvious reasons, taken only “by those who are in favour with the King, and think themselves safe from palavers.” The second and third stages, the visits to Tafo and Asantemanso, involved the candidate in ancient rituals the nature of which will not be [Page 142] examined here; suffice to remind the reader that Tafo was an old (“aboriginal”) trading center, and Asantemanso one of the “cradles” of the Akan.' <sup id="cite_ref-815" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-815">[815]</a></sup> 'The fourth stage of the ceremony, that of catching of the “elephant,” was, by a fortunate chance, once witnessed by the missionary W. West on his visit to Kumase with Owusu Ansa in 1862. Although West does not name the candidate, one may be reasonably confident that it was the Kumase Manwerehene, Kwasi Brantuo. On March 29 West noted the arrival of several dignitaries in Kumase, “to take part in the ceremony, which was that of the display of wealth, by an old chief, in order to be entitled to the honour of having the elephant's tail carried before him; an honour to which only the wealthy can aspire.” he actual charade occurred the next day: 'A slave had been selected to enact the part of the elephant. Besmeared all over with chalk, holding in his hand a small tusk, which he occasionally applied to his mouth, and having an elephant's tail attached by a piece of string behind, he was started off; while some forty or fifty men, armed with muskets, and supplied with blank cartridges, followed in pursuit, keeping up an almost constant fire. His elephantship as we were informed, made his way, according to usage, to a small kroom [village] not far from Kumasi, where he fell down as if shot, and lay there until the chief himself appeared to cut off the tail; who, having thus hunted the elephant, and possessed himself of its caudal appendage, was considered, as I suppose, entitled to have it borne before him.' The “kroom” near Kumase at which the chase ended was, seemingly, a parcel of land that the Akwamuhene donated to aspirant aberemp[unavailable]n. Kwasi Brantuo was, in fact, given the Adiebeba lands in 1862 by the Kumase Akwamuhene Akwawua Dente; and Opoku Frefre, whose candidacy will be referred to next, was awarded the Daakwadwam lands by Akwawua Dente's forerunner in office, Kwakye Kofi.' <sup id="cite_ref-816" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-816">[816]</a></sup> 'IN THE COURSE OF HIS VISIT to Kumase in 1817, Bowdich testified unambiguously to the connection between office and wealth. “The chiefs,” he wrote, 'are fed bountifully by the labours of their slaves, and sharing large sums of the revenue (the fines their oppression has imposed on other governments), with incalculable fees for corruption or interference, refine upon the splendour of equipage even to satiety, and still possess a large surplus of income daily accumulating' Bowdich was, however, also aware of the prejudice that existed, on the part of the older aristocratic families whose fortunes had been consolidated during the wars of expansion in the earlier eighteenth century, against the parvenu rich whose profits derived principally from trade. Bowdich recorded what was clearly a partisan view of the issue. Of the encouragement of trade, he commented, 'their government would repress rather than countenance the inclination (believing no state can be aggrandized but by conquest), lest their genius for war might be enervated by it, and lest, either from the merchants increasing to a body too formidable for their wishes to be resisted, or too artful from their experience to be detected, they might sacrifice the national honour and ambition to their avarice, and furnishing Inta [Gonja], Dagwumba [Dagomba], or any of their more powerful neighbours (who have yielded to circumstances rather than force) with guns and powder (which are never to be exported from Ashantee), break the spell of their conquests, and undermine their powers.' Again, David Hume's general observations on the development of a merchant class are highly pertinent: 'This perhaps is the chief advantage which arises from commerce with strangers. It rouses men from their indolence; and presenting the gayer and more opulent part of the nation with objects of luxury, which they never before dreamed of, raises in them a desire of a more splendid way of life than what their ancestors enjoyed. And at the same time, the few merchants, who possess the secret of this importation and exportation, make great profits; and becoming rivals in wealth to the ancient nobility, tempt other adventurers to become their rivals in commerce.' [Page 152] Bowdich's report of the views of the Asante nobility appears to echo Hume: 'Were they to encourage commerce, pomp, the idol of which they are most jealous, would soon cease to be their prerogative, because it would be attainable by others; the traders growing wealthy, would vie with them; and for their own security, stimulated by reflections they have now too little at risk to originate, they would unite to repress the arbitrary power of the Aristocracy; and even if they did not, inevitably (as the chiefs conceive) divert the people's genius for war.' <sup id="cite_ref-817" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-817">[817]</a></sup> 'It would be easy to regard such appointees, collectively, as constituting a collaborating class. But one of the purposes of this essay has been to suggest that such a concept is of little analytical importance. It has been shown that those who were to collaborate with the colonial authorities had adopted ideological positions sharply divergent from the prevailing political mores long before the loss of Asante independence could have been foreseen. It has been suggested here that in the last quarter of the nineteenth century the fundamental challenge to the dominant mercantile ideology in Asante was presented by an embryonic bourgeoisie committed to the principles of laissez faire and that no analysis of the acute political conflicts which divided the Asante nation in that period is possible without reference to such ideological factors. Moreover, the history of the Gold Coast and of Ghana in the twentieth century can be understood, I believe, only with adequate reference to the nineteenth-century situation. The development of the cocoa industry represented, perhaps, the triumph of a new bourgeoisie “liberated” by the forces of colonialism. The economic policies of Kwame Nkrumah are to be seen as in many respects reviving those of Mensa Bonsu and Agyeman Prempeh, recognizing that the rapid development of the national economy must necessarily involve, albeit on mutually acceptable terms, the participation of foreign capital and expertise. The policies of Kofi Busia appeared designed, conversely, to stimulate the growth of the indigenous middle class. Subsequent governments have vacillated between these alternative paths to salvation.' <sup id="cite_ref-818" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-818">[818]</a></sup> While attributing class structures to non-capitalist economies is difficult, Wilks distinguishes between 'nobles', an emerging urban 'bourgeoisie', free farmers, and unfree servants: 'It is notoriously difficult to characterize the class structure of precapitalist societies. To this generalization Asante is no exception, though R. A. Kea's studies of a number of seventeenth century Akan polities have provided an invaluable lead.  For present purposes the postulate is that a class reproduces itself as a class and that it does so only insofar as it has a determinate and specific, though not necessarily direct, relationship to the means of production. Consider, for example, the Asante class of the adehyeε, a word commonly but inappropriately translated [Page 294] “royalty” in English. “The old adage” (and I quote the collective wisdom of the late Asantehene and his councillors in a judgment passed down in 1964) “is that a royal is one whose ancestor had established or founded a village." This succinct statement of traditional usage defines a class within Asante society by implicit reference to a set of proprietary rights over land exercised by those who were thereby able to appropriate, in the form of tributes, taxes, and services, part of the labor-value of others settled on the land. I have elsewhere suggested that the origins of the adehyeε class are to be sought in the context of the great economic transformations associated with the development of forest agriculture. I have also suggested that the gyaasefo emerged as a servile class in precisely the same context. In this chapter I argue that the asomfo, or those in administrative service, came to constitute a class within Asante society in precisely the same sense of class. Unlike both adehyeε and gyaasefo, however, the asomfo class emerged in an urban rather than rural context, and at a much later date: its full development was, therefore, specific to Asante rather than common to Akan society in general.' <sup id="cite_ref-819" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-819">[819]</a></sup></dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Ideological thought distinguishes all ethnicities ♣ present ♥</b> The emerging peasant class was largely made up of assimilated non-Asante: 'Arhin's article is a most welcome corrective to ideological arguments which attempt to force complex realities into simple schemes. His argument (re: Fallers) that a culturally distinct peasantry can be identified in precolonial Asante is supported, as he notes, by a large and growing body of historical work. Some of this research amplifies the urban/rural distinction even more than Arhin himself does: e.g., Wilks's (1975) discussion of the importance of the urban mercantile class (the asikafo) and his discussion of the way in which the state, embodied in the city itself, enforced its power. It is impossible to discuss the rise of the Asante state without talking about the rise of Kumasi as an urban center. By definition, the rise of the state therefore presupposes the rise of a hinterland and a peasantry. Unless one were to question whether the state existed at all (which no one is doing), there is not much question about a peasantry's existing, economically, politically, and culturally.' <sup id="cite_ref-820" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-820">[820]</a></sup> 'There are a few points which could be emphasized: the cultural distinctiveness of the peasantry is due, in part, to the enormous numbers of strangers (particularly northerners) assimilated into Asante. As the slave trade decreased in the early 19th century, after abolition, large numbers of northerners had to be absorbed into the Asante populace. As Wilks describes, the government had very specific policies for carrying out this absorption. Thus, the urban/rural distinction is not simply one of “class” (which Arhin himself says is very unclear), but also, on some level, an ethnic one. In Asante the ethnic lines became more and more blurred, and the assimilationist policy made and continues to make discussion of this issue difficult; but it is clear that in everyone's attempt to be a “Kumasi” person there is also an attempt to certify one's unquestionable (free) Asante origins, which Arhin calls the “distinctively indigenous.”' <sup id="cite_ref-821" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-821">[821]</a></sup> The same was true of other Akan states: 'Terray has already applied the concept “peasant” to the neighbouring Abron and, comparatively, to Asante (Terray 1974, 1975), but his usage differs from mine, perhaps because the political structures of the Abron and the Asante differ. For Terray the Abron peasant “classes” consist of the subject Kulango people, whom the Akan-Abron conquered before establishing a “conquest state,” a few Abron subjects, and above all slaves acquired through raids and warfare and by purchase. It is from these that the state, dominated by the Abron aristocracy, extracted its surpluses, and it is they that the state exploited. The slaves, in particular, formed the main labour force in the gold mines owned by the aristocrats and provided the main reason for the existence of the state.' <sup id="cite_ref-822" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-822">[822]</a></sup> 'Strangers' were not part of established kin networks: 'People have travelled from the Northern Territories or the Colony to Ashanti in search of employment. Some of them have settled there more or less permanently. There are many people from these areas who have lived in Ashanti most of their lives, but they are outside the Ashanti political structure. They are ‘strangers’, no matter how long they live there.' <sup id="cite_ref-823" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-823">[823]</a></sup> 'Even Ashantis are ‘strangers’ outside their own Divisions. There are many Ashantis living in Divisions other than those in which they are subjects by kinship. This is particularly so in Kumasi, where the opportunities of employment have attracted people from all parts of Ashanti. With reference to the kinship political organization, these Ashantis are strangers, just as are the settlers from the Northern Territories and the Colony.' <sup id="cite_ref-824" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-824">[824]</a></sup> 'These permanent but ‘stranger’ settlers, who have no political status in the traditional organization based on kinship, present the chiefs with a new problem, which has arisen most acutely in connexion with taxation.' <sup id="cite_ref-825" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-825">[825]</a></sup> The legal rights of 'strangers' were restricted: 'Asante men and women drew power and income from a well-developed internal marketplace system with three distinct types of market, in which chiefly regulations protected their privilege as traders and carriers. Non-Asantes were restricted from trading within Asante during most of the nineteenth century, so goods from outside passed into Asante hands at the officially designated border markets whose location contracted with the limits of effective political control (Wilks 1975). Quantities of imported consumer goods, mainly manufactures and crafts, passed from border markets either to the urban daily markets or directly to the regional periodic markets in leading Asante towns (Akoto 1980). These linked the rural population to the border markets and to other parts of Asante with different food supplies. Urban daily markets in Kumasi and leading provincial capitals served the needs of town dwellers for food and consumption goods of all kinds (Lewin 1974).' <sup id="cite_ref-826" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-826">[826]</a></sup> Mixed marriages were rare and in-marrying individuals were expected to conform to local norms: 'Mahommedan law has not influenced these marriage or family customs in the slightest degree; on the contrary, if a Hausa marries a Fanti he must conform to Fanti custom, unless the girl first embraces Mahommedanism, which is very rare, and even then her children are still held to belong to the Fanti family. Such mixed marriages are, however, rare, and are altogether unknown to the Omanhin of Denkera.' <sup id="cite_ref-827" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-827">[827]</a></sup> Politically and ideologically, Kumasi and the Asante occupied a central position compared to other peoples and locations: 'The central position of Kumasi and the Asante people, compared with neighboring rivals, has remained remarkably consistent over several centuries despite dramatic reconfigurations of trade—a testimonial to their strenuous and effective efforts. The Asantes emerged as an identifiable political unit in the seventeenth century when Akans moved into the forest to control gold mining areas and trade routes linking the ancient caravan routes across the Sahara to the European [Page 62] shipping routes pioneered by Portuguese explorers in the late fifteenth century. The Asante capital, Kumasi, lies about halfway between the coastal fort towns and the Northern savannah towns. Asante diplomacy and warfare first focused on defeating and absorbing their former overlords to the south to maintain free access to the coast. Then attention turned to its northern borders, turning the chiefs of Brong, Gonja, and Kete Krachi into subjects or tributaries (Arhin 1975; Maier 1983). Close relations with its “home port” of Elmina were threatened several times in the early 1800s by blockades or sieges by the British and Fante. The Asantes at first attempted to send more of their trade east via Accra and west via loyal ports around Takoradi. When the hostile British took over Elmina from the Dutch in 1868, the Asante army invaded it twice, in 1870 and 1874 (Wilks 1975). To the north of Asante, repeated unrest in the subjugated Brong chiefdom of Gyaman shifted trade west from its capital, Bonduku, to Salaga, and later to a new market at Kintampo when Salaga rebelled (Arhin 1971).' <sup id="cite_ref-828" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-828">[828]</a></sup></dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Ideological thought distinguishes men and women ♣ present ♥</b> Descent was matrilineal: 'All Akan groups recognize matrilineal descent. The basic group is the clan, of which there are eight; they are dispersed among the many kingdoms. Members of a subclan tend to occupy a single town or village. The clan is an exogamous group. It is comprised of constituent groups that may be referred to as lineages, but these do not form any kind of segmentary lineage system, lineages being attached to others by propinquity and the power and wealth of the host lineage. Although there has been much confusion in accounts of the Akan peoples between matriliny and matriarchy, authority within clans and lineages is held firmly by men, succession being from a man to his brother or to his closest sister's son.' <sup id="cite_ref-829" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-829">[829]</a></sup> 'A child inherits his or her blood from the mother, and character or temperament from the father. Maternal blood ensures the child's membership in the ABUSUA (clan or lineage); paternity bestows membership in one of nine other groups or categories.

What is involved is the concept of NTORO; the male transmitted NTORO (spirit) which forms a unique spiritual bond between father and son. Following this principle, every person belongs to one of a limited number of named quasi-ritual categories, the ntoro divisions. Members of the same ntoro division are required to observe certain taboos, perform certain rituals, and are believed to have some common personality characteristics.

[ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-832" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-832">[832]</a></sup> Female stools and councils complemented male power hierarchies: 'Female stools complemented the hierarchy of male stools. In the village the elders, mpanyinfo, heads of the matrilineages, who constituted with the odekro the village council, had their aberewa or obaapanyin, who looked after the women's affairs. The odekro had an obaapanyin who was responsible for the affairs of the women of the village and was a member of the village council; the ohene, head of a division, and the omanhene, head of the autonomous political community, had their female counterparts known as ohemma, female ruler, who sat on their councils. The ohene and the ohemma were all of the same mogya, blood, or clan. The Asantehemma, the occupant of the female stool of the Kumasi state, and therefore of united Asante, since her male counterpart was ex officio the Asantehene, king of Asante, was a member of the Kotoko council, the executive committee or cabinet of the Asanteman Nhyiamu, general assembly of Asante rulers.' <sup id="cite_ref-833" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-833">[833]</a></sup> 'As members of their respective councils, female stool occupants participated in the legislative and judicial processes, in the making and the unmaking of war, and in the distribution of land, the basic resource of the economy. An ohemma of a state also had her own ntam, oath, a formula for starting the judicial process, and her own court, as well as her own okyeame (spokesman) who in the Akan courts acted as prosecutor and judge.'  <sup id="cite_ref-834" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-834">[834]</a></sup> 'An ohemma was a refuge for a fugitive from the ohene's court who often successfully sought her intervention in cases of the death penalty. Called the ‘mother’ of the ohene, she was the latter's most effective adviser and she had the right to administer to him even a public admonition. The ohemma was the aberewa, wisdom personified: an Akan court panel preceded their retirement to discuss a case before passing judgement by saying that they were going to consult aberewa,the old woman. As the aberewa of the town, the ohemma was the moral guardian of the females of the political community and a kind of moral censor: she examined adolescent girls before the main puberty rites which ushered them into adulthood and licensed their marriage, and was expected to say whether or not pregnancy had occurred before the rites. A girl who was found to have become pregnant before the rites was known as kyiribra, and was punished [Page 94] with ostracism together with her partner. The polity thrived on a sound moral order.' <sup id="cite_ref-835" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-835">[835]</a></sup> 'As the abrewa, the ohemma was also custodian of ‘custom’. She was officially the foremost authority on the genealogy of the royal matrilineage, and hence the first and final arbiter on who was qualified by blood to be a male ruler; it was said of the ohemma's stool in relation to the male stool that it was the elder stool, akonnua panyin. It was the ohemma who played the leading role in the selection of a successor to a deceased or destooled (removed from office) ohene.' <sup id="cite_ref-836" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-836">[836]</a></sup> 'The ohemma's role in the succession to a vacant stool can be understood in terms, first, of the composite nature of most of the Akan matrilineages and, secondly, of the Akan rules of succession. The composite nature of the Akan matrilineage lay not in its segmentation over time and space, but in the incorporation into it of ‘stranger’ segments which in time became concealed; even when it was known it was not permitted for outsiders to point it out. ‘Stranger’ segments could be descended from slave women or freeborn women of another clan who, therefore, were not of pure blood and whose descendants were not eligible for the stool. The ohemma was the one who could pronounce on the fitness of potential successors for the stool from the viewpoint of true descent from the founding ancestors/ancestresses.' <sup id="cite_ref-837" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-837">[837]</a></sup> 'Secondly, while the Akan vested the right of succession in the royal matrilineage, they left open the question of the actual successor among the eligible males, which was resolved by joint consultations between the ohemma, as leader of the royal matrilineage, and the members of the village, divisional, or national council. In the process of consultation the ohemma and the council were governed by the following rules: brothers should succeed each other before sisters' sons in the order of seniority in age; but age could be discounted in favour of superior wisdom and character in a junior person. Seniority in age could also be discounted in favour of a younger successor, if rotational succession among the segments of the royal lineage had been adopted as a ‘convention’ by the lineage and the community as a whole. Where rotation had been adopted as a working rule, both the male and female stools rotated among the segments, so that at any moment the occupants belonged to different competing segments.' <sup id="cite_ref-838" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-838">[838]</a></sup> 'It was the ohemma who operated these rules and ensured orderly succession to the stool. On the decease or de-stoolment of an ohene, the members of the council formally asked the ohemma to nominate a candidate for their approval, and gave her three succeeding options at the end of which the councillors could in turn present a candidate for her approval. It rarely, if ever, came to this. An ohemma consulted members of her matrilineage, her husband, if she had one, and the community at large through discreet inquiries by her nkotimsefo, [Page 95] household servants, who, like the palace functionaries, were so selected as to represent the various sections of the community. The candidate she turned up was thus more often than not the result of communal consensus.

Women have, however, been [Page 400] known to occupy the stool as reigning chiefs. Adoption proper is unknown, but if a distressed native commends himself to a family, and they approve, he is received by them as a domestic slave, and, as such, becomes absorbed into it. Again, in Fanti Yankumase, for instance, if a member of another tribe settles with them, and his sept, the Kwonna (say) will not help him, he may choose one of the others, who will, and he henceforth is treated as a member of the latter.' <sup id="cite_ref-840" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-840">[840]</a></sup> According to Rattray, women were not oppressed by husbands and other men due to support from their matrilineage: 'In the chapter on ‘the Ashanti Classificatory System’ it was [Page 79] recorded that wives were inherited in exactly the same way as any other property; even in the case of a chief who is not dead but who has been deposed, or de-stooled as it is called in West Africa, his successor has a perfect right to have his predecessor's wives transferred to him equally with any other stool property.

A student writes: “Because witchery is mostly attributed to old women, any misfortune that occurs in the family of such a woman is accredited to her. If care is not taken, such women will be cast out from family matters entirely”. Administrator Tauxier finds that the old women are accused by society of witchcraft because they have become useless to it—they cannot have children and cannot give pleasure to men.' <sup id="cite_ref-852" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-852">[852]</a></sup> Farm labour was shared, but participation in crafts was largely restricted to men: 'Men and women share in labor, but both may own farms and houses and both may provide the labor for them. With respect to crafts, only pottery making is a female activity; the others are restricted to male specialists. Even in the case of pottery making, only men are allowed to fashion pots or pipes representing anthropomorphic or zoomorphic figures. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-853" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-853">[853]</a></sup> However, marriage and divorce norms discriminated along gender lines. Husbands could take concubines, but wives could not take (legitimate) lovers (see above). Husbands could divorce their wives: 'The Fantis assert that a man may repudiate his wife at will, but, if no substantial reason is given, he forfeits the dowry and all payments made on her behalf, pays all her expenses, and in addition pays her heavy compensation, so that it is never done. Elsewhere repudiation at will is unknown.' <sup id="cite_ref-854" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-854">[854]</a></sup> 'The following are held to be good grounds on which a husband may divorce his wife:— (1) Adultery. (2) Repeatedly insulting the husband's parents. (3) Refusal on the part of the woman to cohabit, after the man has preferred his claim against an adulterer. (4) If she becomes a notorious thief or criminal. (5) If she persists in not consenting to his taking another wife. (6) If the wife practises witchcraft. (7) Desertion.' <sup id="cite_ref-855" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-855">[855]</a></sup> 'In all these cases it is usual for both families to meet, and appoint an arbitrator, who may be the chief or any other person to whose decision they agree to submit.

If she was in the wrong, the man could then claim from her family restitution of the dowry, and all the expenses he had incurred throughout the marriage on her behalf, except the actual expense of maintaining her, doctor's bills, and the cloths that she had worn out; all jewels and the cloths that he had given her and which were not worn out are also returned.

However, it appears that gender complementarity rather than either gender equality or gender stratification was the norm.</dd>

<p><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of inequality ♣ present ♥</b> See above.
</p><p><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of monogamy ♣ present ♥</b> Society was organized in matrilineal kin groups: 'All Akan groups recognize matrilineal descent. The basic group is the clan, of which there are eight; they are dispersed among the many kingdoms. Members of a subclan tend to occupy a single town or village. The clan is an exogamous group. It is comprised of constituent groups that may be referred to as lineages, but these do not form any kind of segmentary lineage system, lineages being attached to others by propinquity and the power and wealth of the host lineage. Although there has been much confusion in accounts of the Akan peoples between matriliny and matriarchy, authority within clans and lineages is held firmly by men, succession being from a man to his brother or to his closest sister's son.' <sup id="cite_ref-862" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-862">[862]</a></sup> 'A child inherits his or her blood from the mother, and character or temperament from the father. Maternal blood ensures the child's membership in the ABUSUA (clan or lineage); paternity bestows membership in one of nine other groups or categories. Although some accounts claim the Akan descent system is one of double descent, this view appears to be based on a misreading of the actual roles of the two lines of descent. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-863" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-863">[863]</a></sup> 'There are groups in which membership is transmitted patrilineally, but these are neither exogamous nor corporate groups; nor are jural or political rights or duties derived from paternal descent. What is involved is the concept of NTORO; the male transmitted NTORO (spirit) which forms a unique spiritual bond between father and son. Following this principle, every person belongs to one of a limited number of named quasi-ritual categories, the ntoro divisions. Members of the same ntoro division are required to observe certain taboos, perform certain rituals, and are believed to have some common personality characteristics. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-864" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-864">[864]</a></sup> 'Consistent with the emphasis on matrilineal descent is the fact that the system of kinship terminology is of the Crow type. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-865" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-865">[865]</a></sup> Exogamy was the norm: 'Marriage is expected to be exogamous, and is extremely simple. There is no bride-wealth, the union being effected by the transfer of rum or other drink and some money from the groom to the bride's immediate family. Divorce is extremely easy and may be initiated by either men or women. The most usual causes are adultery and the barrenness of wives.' <sup id="cite_ref-866" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-866">[866]</a></sup> Society was matrilineal, but legitimacy was still important: 'Legitimacy is important both for inheritance and to define a person as having, or not having, slave ancestry. It demands not only a proper marriage, however short, but also a recognized pater: he gives the child his own spiritual identity and his or her name; he admits his responsibility for the child's education, and he has the expectation that the child will carry out the father's funerary rites. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-867" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-867">[867]</a></sup> Multiple residence patterns were present: 'Domestic organization long remained one of the most ambiguous aspects of Akan social structure. It was Fortes who finally delineated the key structural principles and processes through his research in the 1940s in the communities of Asokore and Agogo. He distinguished three major household types each based on a different residence pattern. First are households grouped around a minimal matrilineage, such as a woman and her sister or daughters, or a man and his sister or sister's son. Such households are based on duolocal residence, with a husband and wife living apart in different domestic units; about 62 percent of the households in Agogo were of this type.' <sup id="cite_ref-868" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-868">[868]</a></sup> 'Second are households consisting of a man, his wife, and their children, sometimes including other kinsfolk; this type of patrilocal or virilocal unit constituted about 22 percent of the households in Agogo. Finally, there are households made up of combinations of the previous types (e.g. a man, his wife, and children) plus his sister's children. Often these reflect an avunculocal residence pattern. The matrilineal domestic group is usually preponderant in the larger communities, while virilocal or patrilocal households are the most common type in small farming villages or hamlets. But all three "types" should be viewed simply as phases in a domestic cycle. In the early years of marriage, residence is predominantly duolocal, but with the passage of time this could shift to avunculocal or patrilocal/virilocal. Thus the composition of a domestic group would evolve over time. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-869" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-869">[869]</a></sup> Fathers played a prominent role in the arrangement of marriages: 'THERE are two forms of marriage recognised in the Fanti districts of the Gold Coast Colony, ( a) Marriage by native custom, and ( b) Marriage under Ordinance No. 14 of 1884 of the Colony.' <sup id="cite_ref-870" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-870">[870]</a></sup> 'I intend to deal only with the native custom, and I may here state that I have always relied rather on illiterate natives and chiefs, for my information, than on educated native men, for the following reasons:—the illiterate native tells one all he knows, or all he dares, and, having no reason to lie when he is not in court, he generally relates facts. A chief is the judge of his people, and, with his councillors, is the repository and exponent of the law, and must necessarily be taken as an expert. The scholar studies anything but his own customs, while an educated native is too inclined to embellish those customs, and present them in a form that would do credit to Justinian.' <sup id="cite_ref-871" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-871">[871]</a></sup> 'According to the Family System of the Tˇw-speaking races of the Gold Coast, although the children belong to the family of the mother, and not of the father, yet the father seems always to have been the person responsible for the marriage of his children.' <sup id="cite_ref-872" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-872">[872]</a></sup> 'He was liable for their maintenance and up-bringing, and was responsible for their actions. Thus if any of his sons, living under his roof, seduced any woman, the father had to pay satisfaction. If any of his daughters were seduced, he claimed and obtained compensation. He supplied his children with means to trade, or to make a living, and in return was entitled to all their earnings. The liability for the sons ceased on their marriage, or when they became self-supporting, so that it was to the father's advantage to find them wives as soon as possible after they reached the age of puberty, and this became recognised as a duty.' <sup id="cite_ref-873" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-873">[873]</a></sup> 'Hence it is clear that primitive negro marriages were interparental contracts, in which the consent of the parties themselves was never considered. The father gave his son a peto and a half of gold dust, and the mother contributed half a peto, to start him in life (a peto being roughly an ounce), and he then worked for himself instead of for his father.' <sup id="cite_ref-874" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-874">[874]</a></sup> 'As time went on fathers came to look on their daughters as sources of income, and demanded sums of money when approached for their hands; this was only natural, as they had nothing to lose by keeping them unmarried, and lost at least their services when they parted with them; whereas unmarried sons were always a possible source of danger.' <sup id="cite_ref-875" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-875">[875]</a></sup> 'Thus it came about, within historical times, that when a man had a marriageable son he approached a man with a marriageable daughter, and having made a suitable present, which varied from one ackie (4 s. 6 d.) to four ackies (18 s.), the two were betrothed, and cohabitation completed the marriage. [Some reckon the ackie as worth 5 s.]' <sup id="cite_ref-876" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-876">[876]</a></sup> 'Sometimes it happened, for personal reasons, that children were betrothed before they were mature; in such cases the boy's parent maintained the girl in her father's house and watched her, and was entitled to satisfaction if she were tampered with. When both had reached puberty the marriage was completed by cohabitation. The betrothal could be broken off meanwhile by the boy's parent, on forfeiting the so-called ‘consawment’ money, or by the girl's parent, by returning the money that had been paid.' <sup id="cite_ref-877" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-877">[877]</a></sup> According to Ffoukes, marriage negotiations became more extensive in the colonial period. There was a lot of regional variation: 'This state continued so long as children quietly submitted to the dictates of their parents, but during the last five centuries the natives have been brought into touch with various European nations, and the much-despised civilisation [Page 33] has tended to modify all their customs and ideas. Sons gradually came to be consulted, and were later allowed to choose their own wives; while the consent of the women was never considered until very recently, and even now it is not usual, except in Coast towns, where girls are far more independent than in the bush.' <sup id="cite_ref-878" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-878">[878]</a></sup> 'The marriage custom, instead of being the simple process of parents pairing off their children, now entails considerable expense. For instance, the present procedure in Cape Coast is as follows:—The relatives of the man (or more often the man himself) approach the relatives of the girl with rum, and if they appear willing a further “dash” is taken, which varies from £1 to 30 s., according to the suitor's circumstances; this is called Abombo or the “knocking” fee, as the suitor knocks at the door to ask for the girl; the father fixes the amount. On the acceptance of the abombo the girl becomes the affianced bride of the man, and although this is only a moral obligation, it is very strictly adhered to, and breach of promise is unknown to native custom. Occasional presents may now be exchanged, and shortly afterwards her parents receive the Etsir-Nsã (Fantee, Etsir a head, Nsã rum), which consists of two flasks of gin and a sum varying from five dollars (£1) to half an ounce of gold (£2) which is distributed amongst her relatives.' <sup id="cite_ref-879" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-879">[879]</a></sup> 'Her parents then may or may not make a further claim for dowry or head money, etsirkyeradzi or etsiradzi (from etsir, “head,” kyere “to show” or “prove,” and adzi, “thing”), of one to two ounces of gold, or £6 to £9; and the man further sends a box to the girl containing cloths, handkerchiefs, a comb, lavender-water and pomade, with perhaps pipes and a supply of tobacco, and a day is fixed to hand the girl over.' <sup id="cite_ref-880" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-880">[880]</a></sup> 'Some time usually elapses between sending the etsir nsã and contributing the etsiradzi, and this, it is alleged, is to give the man and his parents time to watch the character of the girl, as well as to meet the increasing demands of the avaricious parents who fix the dowry; but there is nothing to prevent sending both at once and completing the nuptial ceremony forthwith. However, the negro never does anything in a hurry! No precautions are now taken with the girl other than to warn her not to visit her intended husband's house before she is handed over, and she is never confined before her marriage, but satisfaction must be paid for cohabitation before she is so handed over.' <sup id="cite_ref-881" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-881">[881]</a></sup> 'In Fanti Yankumase [Assin] the custom varies appreciably from Cape Coast, for here the suitor sends to ask the girl's family, without rum or abombo, and if they agree, both families meet to drink rum or palm wine; this ceremony, to show the couple is engaged, is called Wakagyir. Then the man seals his bond by sending three small bottles of gin to the girl's family, and this is termed etsir nsã. He also [Page 35] gives the town crier 1 s. 6 d. to publish his betrothal, and 4 s. to witnesses. He further sends 8 s. to the girl's mother to maintain her until marriage; this payment is called Ntamboba (= Tanbiba, see infra), which implies, “as the mother has looked after the child, now somebody takes her.”' <sup id="cite_ref-882" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-882">[882]</a></sup> 'The matter then waits until the man has sufficient money, and if the girl or her family has a debt he pays it; this they call the etsiradzi. At this stage the Assins make sure that the bride-elect is a virgin, and, if not, lay their claim against the seducer. If there are no debts, the bridegroom merely provides a box, with cloths, handkerchiefs, looking-glass, and perfumes, and takes the bride home.' <sup id="cite_ref-883" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-883">[883]</a></sup> 'In Denkera the matter is much simpler; the man asks the father for his daughter, and notifies the girl's family, if he gets the father's consent, by sending them rum; he then pays her family the abombo, which they fix, and which may vary from £1 to 30 s., and the man takes the girl home; although he may pay a further dowry of £4 or £5, but this is not essential.' <sup id="cite_ref-884" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-884">[884]</a></sup> Marriage and divorce became more regulated in the colonial period: 'The passing of the 1884 Marriage Ordinance Act attempted to set a standard for monogamous marriage and spousal inheritance of self-acquired property. Conflict over inheritance often ended up in court where officials tried to determine whether or not a spouse was a true and therefore legal wife. Women began to organize in the 1950's to change the distinction between ‘wife’ and ‘non-wife’ in order to protect the interests of women and children. The results were the passage of the Maintenance of Children Bill in 1965 and a new divorce law in 1971. [IS]' <sup id="cite_ref-885" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-885">[885]</a></sup> Concubinage was practiced, but the rights of concubines differed from those of wives: 'Concubinage is everywhere practised on the Coast, and is generally respected, although civilisation has made educated natives profess to disparage it; the sole difference amongst the Fantis is, that Mpata or satisfaction can be sued for by a married man if his wife commits adultery, whereas he can obtain no redress in the case of a concubine. Further, a native can hardly be said to buy his wife, as all moneys paid by him are received on trust for the good behaviour of the wife during the marriage, and are returnable to the husband if he divorces his wife for her misconduct, only vesting in her family on her death, or the death of her husband.' <sup id="cite_ref-886" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-886">[886]</a></sup> 'Concubinage is openly permitted, and although it is not encouraged on the Coast, it is widely practised elsewhere. It is really quite as honourable a connection as the native marriage, as couples frequently live through life with no other bond than mutual affection. The essential difference is that for lack of consideration the man cannot claim damages if the woman misconducts herself; and if the man misbehaves, the woman has only to leave him at will. In fact the difference is all in favour of the woman, as will be seen when dealing with divorce. Even a married man may keep a concubine openly if his wife has no objection, but she cooks only at the wife's request; it is when a man keeps concubines clandestinely or against his wife's will that the custom is deprecated, and he has to “pacify” her whenever she finds him out. Wives do not appear to discourage it so long as they themselves get their fair share of attention. Whatever is given to a concubine is given outright, and cannot be reclaimed if she chooses to leave him for someone else. Her children can hardly be called illegitimate, as they still belong to her family, and as in the case of a chieftainess the children succeed to the stool. If she has children, and then marries another man, the natural father usually takes and brings them up, so that they may bury him; but if he does not, the husband is obliged to look after them.' <sup id="cite_ref-887" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-887">[887]</a></sup> 'There is this great difference, however, that, whereas the father of legitimate children is bound to support them, and he is responsible for all their acts, the natural father is not so bound, the obligation and liability falling on the woman's family; he only does so to keep up his good name, and the children do not participate equally in the funeral expenses.' <sup id="cite_ref-888" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-888">[888]</a></sup> Levirate was also practiced: 'There is a peculiar exception to one of these prohibitions, for when a Fanti dies he is succeeded by his eldest surviving brother, and if he has no brothers, by his eldest sister's eldest son. If the brother succeeds, he is said to take his [Page 44] place, and part of his duty is to marry the widow; this is called Okuranba; if the nephew ( Awofasepenyin) inherits he has a wider choice, for if the man leaves a daughter the nephew can take his choice between the widow and her daughter, but he cannot marry both. ' <sup id="cite_ref-889" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-889">[889]</a></sup> Husbands were obliged to pay compensation to the wife in the case of divorce unless a legitimate reason for the dissolution of the marriage could be provided: 'The Fantis assert that a man may repudiate his wife at will, but, if no substantial reason is given, he forfeits the dowry and all payments made on her behalf, pays all her expenses, and in addition pays her heavy compensation, so that it is never done.

</p><p><b>♠ Ideology reinforces prosociality ♣ present ♥</b>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>♠ charity ♣ absent ♥</b> Cooperation among matrikin was common and expected: 'Two categories of matrikin who have invested in farms must be clearly distinguished: those who from the information might expect a return and those who do not. In addition, when considering rights and obligations of matrikin, we are looking both at individuals and at the matrilineage as a whole. Among the individuals are nephews working for their mothers' brothers while having no independent income of their own. Of the Dominase farmers, several were working with their sisters' sons on a permanent basis. Matrikin were also supervising work on bearing farms elsewhere, but these were more senior kinsmen who themselves had farms, and for them there was no question of expecting a direct return for assistance given. Among this second group of matrikin are mother's brothers and a large number of temporary assistants, who included mothers, sisters, a brother and sisters' sons. Most of the twelve male owners studied at Dominase had received assistance from this category, who were in a position to give rather than to receive. In a number of instances this was in the form of contacts, money, or land to make the venture possible in the first place. In some cases part of their financial backing came from the proceeds of farms which they had inherited and which were therefore lineage property. The position of this group can only be understood if account is taken of the corporate nature of descent groups and the sense of obligation existing between members, doing things for one another because they must, particularly men for their sisters' sons. A good mother's brother is expected to help his sisters' sons, thereby obliging the latter to reciprocate in the next generation either through their own sisters' sons or through other matrilineal dependants (Fortes, 1950). Returns are not always therefore related directly to inputs on farms. Three farmers had each made gifts of farms or land to matrikin which could not be related directly to inputs. One had purchased four pieces of land for the children of four sisters, and one [Page 177] for his oldest sister which was to have been for his own mother, who died before he was able to complete the project. A second had offered land to the adult offspring of his mother's sister. In the first case the only assistance he claimed to have received from matrikin was labour from a grand-nephew when he first arrived at Dominase; whereas the second man did rely financially on matrikin and used the proceeds of a family farm which he had inherited, although he had until then received little help from his grand-nephews. The third farmer said that he had purchased land for a brother who had not worked for him.' <sup id="cite_ref-898" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-898">[898]</a></sup> However, this does not constitute charity. Families in need had recourse to wealthier relatives, but could not force the latter to support them: 'Mutual assistance within the lineage should be substantial, but it too stops far short of pooling. Even inherited lineage property clearly belongs to one individual heir, who should use it for the benefit of kin but has virtually unchallenged power to decide what uses will serve their long-term benefit. Relatives can ask for help without offense, and pressures from the abusua to agree can be intense, but this help cannot be compelled or assumed. Pleas to wealthier kin are based on needs, not rights, and one certainly cannot use their property as one's own.' <sup id="cite_ref-899" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-899">[899]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ production of public goods ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> Danquah and Rattray describe 'companies' of young men: 'Asafo. A union or company of men banded together under a leader, chosen from among their number by popular vote, to compel the recognition of a real or imaginary grievance or to further some plan, good or perhaps bad, upon which all are of one mind; or perhaps again, merely for the purpose of joining together to work in turns for each other, say at cultivating or clearing a plantation.' <sup id="cite_ref-900" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-900">[900]</a></sup> 'These companies or confederations adopt a leader, as already [Page 46] stated, and assume an emblem or flag, and the confederation is given a name, generally one explaining the raison d'être for the amalgamation. The following are a few examples of ‘company’ names.' <sup id="cite_ref-901" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-901">[901]</a></sup> 'IF one had to make a choice between a purely social as distinguished from a political institution in the Akan state system it would be difficult to point to a characteristic mark by which to differentiate between the two. “Society” at the stage in which we are studying it among the Akan peoples is not far removed from the idea of association of families, clans, or tribes. Invariably the head of the family is not only the patriarch but also the social leader of that family or clan. Matches between marriageable youths are contracted under his personal advice; free consent of girl or boy to a marriage is only conditional on the sanction of the head of family. Dances are usually held within the family compound and when the youth of two or more families meet for some social purpose they do so under the aegis of the central head of those families. Society is more or less clannish in structure, and in proportion as the family tie is close, the youth of the family or tribe are constrained to model their social intercourse on the structure of the political or tribal units. Thus then starting from the highest structure in the State with the Omanhene as its head, we meet a descending scale of social institutions having some head or other who partakes of the hierarchy inherent in the supreme head. The town with a Chief or Odikro as political head has also a corresponding head for the social activities of the town. This head is directly under the Odikro or Chief, but in so far as members of his association are concerned, he is supreme as supremacy goes in the Akan institutional regime. There are several such institutions in every Akan state, and almost every town in an Akan state has a social association of young men with their own leaders called captains (Asafohene or Asafoatse) and lieutenants (Sripi). These Asafo companies as they are called have very definite functions in the political and social community wherein they are found, and as the host (Asafo) of all the young men in a town or state, they were in historical times the only disciplined association [Page 225] of able-bodied men who fought their country's battles in time of war and did yeoman service in time of peace.' <sup id="cite_ref-902" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-902">[902]</a></sup> 'Thus, then, these Asafo Companies of young men are established with very different and diverse purposes, and their activities in recent years have given cause to much controversy as to whether they should be regarded as indispensable parts of the Akan constitution, or whether they are mere associations of young men working for their own immediate benefit and enjoyment. At one time, the rivalry between the different companies, the so-called “company fights”, became so serious that Government had to institute inquiries into the origin, constitution, and status of the Company System. The result of these inquiries did not make the contemplated abolition of the system necessary or practicable, and, for sociological purposes, the value of such associations admits of no cursory treatment.' <sup id="cite_ref-903" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-903">[903]</a></sup> 'Mr. Casely Hayford deals with the Company System in his Native Institutions, but apparently he has in mind the relation between an Asafo Company and the Chief of a town or division, or between the Government and the Company System. He does not, however, lose sight of the fact that the Asafo Companies are the backbone of the country. Such a company in a town consists really of the whole male inhabitants of a town or village, exclusive only of boys under sixteen or seventeen, and of the Councillors in a Chief's Tribunal. They form a strong body of commons who, besides other duties, have also a distinct voice in the enstoolment or destoolment of local Chiefs. Without them, the governments of the Akan nations would not have that glamour of liberal sanction which makes the government of any free people at once orderly and democratic.' <sup id="cite_ref-904" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-904">[904]</a></sup> 'The Asafo Companies have assumed different forms in successive ages. First there is the company which for services rendered to the town or country in time of war or of peace, has been raised to a status which entitles it to participate in the direct government of the town or country. This is effected by making the Company's captain or leader a Captain-on-Stool ( Okonnuasoni). It should be observed that captains of Asafo companies have, as a fact, no stools, and until a Company captain is created as a stool-holding captain, the succession to the captaincy is always made by vote of the members. In the old days companies were usually formed not by the admixture of different members of various families, as is the case at present, but by a collection of the members of a single family, primarily for [Page 226] defensive and offensive purposes. This class of Asafo Companies is now extinct. They have all of them obtained statutory right to partake in the direct government of the town or country to which they belong.' <sup id="cite_ref-905" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-905">[905]</a></sup> 'The form of the institution now in vogue consists of the young men of a town who have brought themselves together for social intercourse, and for the purpose of devoloping a unified national spirit.' <sup id="cite_ref-906" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-906">[906]</a></sup> We are unsure whether the activities performed by companies count as public goods.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ communal dining ♣ present ♥</b> Feasting was practiced during festivals. Akan communities celebrated the annual yam harvest with a public festival: 'An annual custom is always held in connection with the first fruits of each staple crop such as yam. The general name for a festival is Afahyε (afa, “festival”; hyε, “fix a day”). The chief's and head priest's house and things are refurbished [Page 35] by singing old women, the blackened stools are taken to the stream and sprinkled with water; pieces of sacrificed and new food crops are put on each stool. The spirits are invoked to start the new year and make it a good one, the new year beginning at different times in different localities.' <sup id="cite_ref-907" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-907">[907]</a></sup>//'The Akan annual yam festival, a purificatory ceremony lasting one-two weeks usually in September or October, is called Odwira, meaning “to purify/cleanse”. (It is sometimes also called apafram). It is similar to the Apo in that all disputes are settled, bringing harmony back to the town. The central part of the festival is the re-purification of the stools and the abosom shrines. It is a festival involving remembrance of the dead, harvest, and thanksgiving.' <sup id="cite_ref-908" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-908">[908]</a></sup>//'The Odwira Festival is the most important yearly celebration among the Ashanti people. It is held in autumn, the time when new yams are ready. They cannot be eaten until the second day of the festival, when they are paraded through the streets. The whole festival lasts for five days is celebrated slightly differently in each community. Throughout the festival, music and drumming abound. On the first day the path leading towards the chief's burial is cleaned. On the second day priests make offerings at the burial chambers and a great yam parade takes place. On the third day people mourn and fast. On the fourth a splendid feast for everyone in the community is held at the local chief's house. That night, everyone stay indoors, to avoid catching sight of the chief's thrones, symbols of the dead men's spirits, which are carried to the river to be ceremonially washed. On the fifth and final day, chiefs and other important clan members dressed in their best, parade through the town in a  grand procession to pay homage to the senior local chief. Some are carried shoulder high on litters and shaded with brilliantly coloured umbrellas. Then people play music and dance late into the night.'<sup id="cite_ref-909" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-909">[909]</a></sup>//Warren provides a description of the relevant narratives and proceedings among the Techiman-Bono:'The other major annual Bono Festival is the Yam Festival ( henerεk dibayerefoforo: literally, the chief is going to eat new yams). The myth explaining the origin of the festival states that when the Techiman-Bono people came from the cavern at Amowi, Onyame pointed out forest yams (aha bayere). Seeing that bush pigs and elephants had eaten some of the yams, they cooked a few and saw that the yam was good food. They gave some to their chief, who also enjoyed it. After that, they began to celebrate on an annual basis the day on which they first found yams. After their chief died, they fed his soul (saman) yams on the same day. Later the Bono began to plant yams, and the yam became the most important staple in the Bono diet. Every farmer celebrates the festival to thank Onyame after the harvest. The living and the deceased are all invited to share in the abundance. Every Bono chief and priest celebrates a yam festival, but before the celebrations begin, a man from the village of Kenten whose title is Akokohwedeε (woodhen) first tastes the yam. When he sees that the yam is ripe, early in the morning on the traditional day called Fodwo he informs the god Taa Mεnsah that the yam is ready to be prepared for εto (mashed yams mixed with palmoil).' <sup id="cite_ref-910" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-910">[910]</a></sup>//'The Taa Mεnsah deity celebrates his yam festival on Fodwo, a Monday. The new yam is hung from rafters in the shrine room for some weeks before the Akokohwedeε comes to taste it. After the yam is hung, children may begin to eat new yam and the elders can [Page 57] [Page 58] begin to eat aso bayere (one species of yam). In the evening on Fodwo, the god Taa Mεnsah is prepared to eat yam after being carried on the main street from one end of the town to the other end three times and consulted. After this, the god informs the manhene that he is about to eat yam and the manhene gives the god permission to eat the yam. The manhene sends a yam to the god and it is always this yam which is cooked as εto and placed on the shrine. The next day, Tuesday, the manhene sends a sheep and wine to the god.' <sup id="cite_ref-911" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-911">[911]</a></sup>//'Two weeks after the Taa Mεnsah Yam Festival, the yam festivals for the Queenmother, the Adontenhene, and the Nifahene are celebrated on a Monofie, a Friday. Nwonakusie, a Thursday, is the yam festival day for the Twafohene, the Adaatihene, the Akyeamehene, the Konkontiwahene, and the Krontihene. Fofie, another Friday, is the yam festival day for the manhene, the Gyaasehene, the Ankbeahene, and the Barimhene. The manhene provides about six sheep and a cow for his own yam festival. These are sacrificed, the blood being spilled on the ancestral stools; the meat is cooked and distributed.' <sup id="cite_ref-912" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-912">[912]</a></sup>// The Apo Festival was celebrated annually and included carnivalesque elements: 'Many festivals exist among the Akan; their foundations and functions are found in the traditional religion. The Apo festival is celebrated yearly among the Brong; it is a feast of eight days duration in which complete lampooning liberty (in the form of song) of both superiors and inferiors (without punishment) is given. The people explain that if one's sunsum is hurt, the body becomes ill; often ill health is caused by evil and the hatred another person may have for you. In like manner, if you have a hatred for someone, it affects your own sunsum, so this time is set aside to allow any man to tell any other man what has offended him. This frees the spirit, and both sunsum become relaxed. During this festival there is theoretical sexual license; this isn't really taken [Page 33] [Page 34] advantage of since traditional court action can be initiated after the eight day festival. Punishment is therefore deferred until the rites are over. Should an aggrieved party take action he forfeits the right to investigation, to satisfaction, and he is also heavily fined. During this period all the priests and priestesses of the area are present with their shrines; they touch each shrine with every other one to re-establish communications which might have been lost. The major gods are taken to the river and cleansed of all evil. On the eighth day everyone makes a concerted effort to drive all evil from the area. Around twenty-five distinct Apo songs are sung, and there is a specific Apo dance for the festival.' <sup id="cite_ref-913" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-913">[913]</a></sup>//Purification is a major element in the rituals performed: 'The festival period is, in fact, a period of coming together in which the people from all over the Techiman traditional area, including well-wishers and invitees from other states, meet in the capital to display the traditional Bono culture through singing, dancing, and drumming. The manhene and his elders, through the Barimhene, purify the soul of King Ameyaw (the chief defeated by the Asante in 1723), adorn his grave with the royal regalia of the incumbent manhene, recall the deeds that Ameyaw performed for the State (man), and present drinks, sheep, and food to his soul and those of the other ancestral chiefs of the Techiman-Bono State. Finally, the Apo is a period during which the shrines of various gods and goddesses are purified. The shrine of the main deity in Techiman Township, Taa Kεse (Taa Mεnsah), is, at this time, purified at the River Agyentoamu during the last hour of the celebration; this serves as a sign of the completion of the Apo Festival.' <sup id="cite_ref-914" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-914">[914]</a></sup>//The festival also served as a check on authority and as a forum for the resolution of mutual resentment: 'The functions of the Apo festival seem to be four: (1) psychological release, (2) a forum for public opinion, (3) a means to periodically check those in authority, (4) a method of enforcing sanctions of behaviour.' <sup id="cite_ref-915" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-915">[915]</a></sup> According to Warren, the restoration of amicable relations is one of the major purposes of the festival: 'This festival allows every person resident in Techiman Traditional State, without regard to class, creed, ethnic group, or race, eleven days of liberty to lampoon, in the form of songs and proverbs, the faults and malpractices of any other person, including those in authority-especially the manhene and his divisional chiefs. In addition, the people may sing the praises of those in authority in appreciation of worthy achievements so as to encourage them to even greater deeds. During this period it is strictly forbidden to fight in any way. The emphasis of the festival is upon the removal of bitterness and misfortune in the State. After all personal grudges, faults, and hatreds are sung and spoken out amicably, the end result is renewed peace and harmony among the Techiman inhabitants; the spirit (sunsum) of the [Page 56] state is cleansed after all the unspoken interpersonal bitternesses are voiced.' <sup id="cite_ref-916" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-916">[916]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b>♠ Ideology forbids slavery universally ♣ absent ♥</b> Slavery was widely practiced: 'The Akan practiced slavery, obtaining slaves from northern slave dealers, usually Muslims. War captives, criminals, persons who opposed local chiefs, and many local ritual leaders were also enslaved. Slaves were used for domestic and field labor, for sale to traders across the Sahara and Atlantic, and as sacrifices to royal and other ancestors. In the middle of the nineteenth century, slaves amounted to half of the population in many towns. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-917" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-917">[917]</a></sup> Uncles could 'pawn' their nephew and nieces: 'An uncle had the power to pawn his nephew or niece. The whole legal position of pawns ( nwowa) will be examined later in detail under that heading. An uncle was expected to give the father of the person he wished to pawn ‘the first refusal’, that is, to ask him if he would not himself like to take his own child as his pawn. In any case, whether the father desired to do so or not, he might not protest or interfere. My Ashanti informants state that the person to be pawned would not wish him to do either, and remarked, Oba ose ose dome abusua (‘A child may resemble his father, but affection (duty) is for the blood relations’); and again, Gyadua si abontene ne hi wo fie (‘The gyadua (tree) may stand in the street, but its roots are in the house). ‘His uncle may not beat or punish your child while he is under your care, but, on the other hand, you may spend much money on your children, consulting the gods, yet when their uncle's house becomes poor he will sell them.’' <sup id="cite_ref-918" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-918">[918]</a></sup> 'An uncle had the power to compel his niece to divorce her husband so that he might pawn her to raise money to ‘buy the head’ of one of his abusua. He would give her husband the option to advance the money, taking his wife as a pawn, but if he could not or would not do so, two courses were open to him: ( a) To put white clay upon his wife's back, i. e. divorce her, to enable her uncle to pawn her elsewhere, or, ( b) Pawn himself or his nephew to pay the debt of his wife's uncle.' <sup id="cite_ref-919" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-919">[919]</a></sup> 'My informant added, ‘If you refused to do either of these things, the uncle would “swear an oath” upon you to buy your wife for some large amount ( tramma), for your wife is the property of her uncle, she is his agyapadie (inherited ancestral property).' <sup id="cite_ref-920" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-920">[920]</a></sup> There were multiple classes of slaves: 'The Akan groups are characterized by matrilineal descent, inheritance, and succession. The Fanti and Ashanti have exogamous patrilineages also, making a double descent system. There is polygamy. In traditional Ghana when custom had determining influence on social life, a preference was given to cross-cousin marriage which among other things ensured that, in spite of matrilineal system of inheritance, the daughters of a man benefited from his property which they and their mother helped him to acquire. Local endogamy and traditional slavery and debt slavery also prevailed. There are no endogamous castes and no initiation schools.' <sup id="cite_ref-921" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-921">[921]</a></sup> 'Slaves were not allowed to mix freely with free-men or allowed to go to the chief's palace; they were required to work harder and to do the dirty work. Moreover they were not accorded a funeral custom. There were four sub-classes of slaves. (1) The akoa (plural nkoa) originally referred only to voluntary servitude of a person to, for example, his MoBr (w[unavailable]fa). The best translation originally would have been “subject”; in reality it came to include persons whom another person had power over, merging with [unavailable]d[unavailable]nk[unavailable], the slave proper. (2) [unavailable]d[unavailable]nk[unavailable] (plural nn[unavailable]nk[unavailable], nn[unavailable]nk[unavailable]fo is a non-Akan purchased expressly as a slave. The second generation would always be termed akoa. They were usually bought at Salaga, a male costing the equivalent in cowries of 9,000 kola nuts, a female costing the equivalent of 14,000 kola nuts. Outside of Ashanti the master had life and death prerogative over his slaves; within Ashanti any execution had to be performed by the Asantehene's executioners. (3) The dommum was a foreign prisoner of war or tribute. All these [Page 40] classes of slaves could marry, own property (including his own slaves), swear an oath, and become heir to his master. A slave could swear an oath to be taken by another master if badly treated. Slaves could be sacrificed, and a reserve of them were kept at a special village (Akyere kurom). (4) An akyere was a slave condemned to death for an offense but saved until a sacrifice was required.'  <sup id="cite_ref-922" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-922">[922]</a></sup> Slaves could not hold stools and only inherited their master's wealth if no matrikin were present: 'Inheritance is arranged by the ohurew or executor responsible for all the funeral arrangements. Ideally the ohurew is the deceased's father's younger brother's son, in the same generation but preferably junior to the deceased. For a female deceased the ideal is FaBrDa. A dying declaration (samansew) is binding if there are witnesses. Although the ohurew is required to settle and distribute the estate, there is a constant problem of distinguishing family from self-acquired property. “The uncle seems in theory the heir to the personal property of his nephews, but almost invariably he waives his right in favour of the deceased's next eldest brother” (Rattray 1929:4). Next in line after eldest brother is the next brother in age until all the deceased's brothers are exhausted. Next is SiSo, then MoSiSo, and finally after all the male possibilities are exhausted the females are eligible for male property, beginning with the deceased's eldest sister. If all relatives are dead, the property (but never a stool) is inherited by a slave, even before the man's actual children — who are completely excluded. This same line of inheritance is followed in the succession for a stool, except that the line stops at slaves and women.' <sup id="cite_ref-923" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-923">[923]</a></sup> But slaves could be adopted into matrilineages: 'Douglas has argued that “matrilineal descent groups are organised to recruit members by other means additional to direct lineal descent”; that “matrilineal descent goes with a quality of openness in the texture of effective descent groups”; and that [Page 80] 'because of the open texture of its descent groups and its bias towards a wide-ranging recruitment of manpower, matriliny is well adapted to any situation in which competing demands for men are higher than demands for material resources.' We suggest, then, that this “open texture” may have been at least one of the factors dictating the new form of social organization that appeared [Page 81] at the time of the clearances: the matriclan functioned to facilitate the assimilation of strangers and, to the point, of the unfree labor being drawn into the forest country. From more recent times we know that those of unfree origins were assimilated as rapidly as possible into the class of free Asante commoners and their acquired status afforded full protection of the law. An Ashanti slave,” wrote Rattray, in nine cases out of ten, possibly became an adopted member of the family, and in time his descendants so merged and intermarried with the owner's kinsmen that only a few would know their origin.' But Rattray still failed to allow fully for the “open texture” of the matrilineal group. The view has been expressed to the writer on many occasions that “in the old days” women married at a young age and men at a relatively advanced one; hat a male slave might often become the third, fourth, or even fifth husband of a (by then elderly) free woman, so that any children she bore by him would be free; and that female slaves were often married by free men and their children immediately adopted into the father's lineage.' <sup id="cite_ref-924" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-924">[924]</a></sup> But slaves had no recourse to corporate descent groups of their own and could be ritually sacrificed: 'Such briefly were the rights of an Ashantislave. They seemed in many instances practically the ordinary privileges of any Ashanti free man, with whom, in these respects, his position did not seem to compare so unfavourably. The chief danger in which his peculiar status placed him appears to me to lie in the fact that the slave was generally a solitary creature more or less at the mercy of a single individual. Every one around him was in a sense ‘the slave’ of some one, but such persons had always behind them a whole group of relatives, whose numbers and wealth and power were ever at their disposal. The slave was not ordinarily possessed jointly (a position which would have ensured certain safeguards); at least, not when a member of a family had purchased him with the proceeds of his own individual labour. It seems probable that circumstances generally would have tended towards his kind treatment. An Ashanti slave, in nine cases out of ten, possibly became an adopted member of the family, and in time his descendants so merged and intermarried with the owner's kinsmen that only a few would know their origin. One outstanding fact, however, remained, i.e. that the status of a slave, i.e. an odonko, could never be lost, and, when necessity arose, or the terrible practice of human sacrifice became the vogue, an otherwise kind and considerate master would turn instinctively to the man who had no friend in the world, in order to satisfy the need for money or for a victim. The liability to be sacrificed at funeral customs may have been an ever-present fear in the mind of a West African slave. Many persons indeed were inevitably condemned to such an end. This idea was, as time went on, developed in an extraordinary degree. Whole villages existed where all the inhabitants were looked upon as a human reservoir from which, when occasion arose, sacrificial victims might be drawn. Such villages were called Akyere kurom (village of Akyere). Akyere means a slave who, instead of suffering immediate capital punishment for some offence of which he had been found guilty, was [Page 43] held over till his unhappy services were required. Meanwhile the person thus condemned went about his or her ordinary vocations, possibly was kept waiting for death for many years, married, brought children into the world, who again married and bore grandchildren to the original culprit. All these descendants (through the female line) inherited the liability of their ancestor to suffer capital punishment at any moment, and helped to swell a reserve of potential funeral victims.' <sup id="cite_ref-925" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-925">[925]</a></sup> Slaves featured prominently in the trade with European powers: 'The fact of the matter is, then, that when the Portuguese entered the Akan gold trade in 1471, those they sought to do business with already had strong consumer preferences, formed in the context of their prior involvement with the Wangara. There was, however, one commodity that was not available from the northern traders: firearms. Initially, so it seems, a brisk exchange of guns for gold took place at Elmina, though such transactions were banned by papal decree. Pope Sixtus IV was petitioned to lift the restriction. On 28 January 1481, he forgave those who had transgressed but reaffirmed the ban. The Christian fear that arms sold at Elmina might find their way into Muslim hands was, in the circumstances, not entirely without foundation. The decision to build the fort of São Jorge at Elmina was taken in the belief that other Portuguese-manufactured produce—“silk, woollen and linen cloths, and other domestic goods” —would find a ready market there. Certainly objects of copper and brass did, whether shaving bowls, urinals, chamber pots, water jugs, bells, boxes, or bracelets (manilhas). Portuguese cloth, however, was apparently not so well received, and the Casa de Guiné in Lisbon was obliged to procure North African “lambens,” “aljaravias,” and the like, to service the Elmina trade. Vogt has suggested that in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries cloth accounted for about 40 percent of the business done at São Jorge, and metals for about 37 percent. Next to these was the sale of slaves, accounting for about 10 percent of trade. Duarte Pacheco Pereira's informants on the Gambia spoke, as we have seen, of the merchants of Bitu, “Banbarranaa,” and “Bahaa” going to “Toom,” that is, the Akan country, “to buy gold in exchange for the merchandise and slaves which they take there.” In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries a strong demand for labor arose in forest Akan society as local entrepreneurs, the aberemp[unavailable]n, sought to increase the extent of the cleared land available for tillage (see chapters 2 and 3). Slaves, in other words, could readily be traded against gold. By virtue of their command of the maritime routes, the Portuguese were able to insinuate themselves into this lucrative business. By 1479 Portuguese vessels were already [Page 24] moving slaves to Elmina from as far east as the Benin coast, and after 1515 the islands of São Tomé and Principe were developed as depots for the expanding enterprise. “Both during the life of Don João (1481-95) and of Dom Manuel (1495-1521),” wrote De Barros, 'this sale of slaves continued from Beny [Benin] to Mina, for ordinarily the ships that left this Kingdom went to Beny to buy the slaves, and then carried them to the Mina, until this trade was altered on account of the great inconvenience which arose. A large caravel was wont to sail from the island of S. Thome, where the slaves of the coast of Beny joined those from the kingdom of Congo, because all the vessels that sailed to those parts called there, and this caravel carried them from the island to Mina.' <sup id="cite_ref-926" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-926">[926]</a></sup> 'For the period 1500-35 it has been estimated that the Portuguese imported ten to twelve thousand slaves to Elmina, though the figure takes no account of those landed by smugglers and interlopers. Although their sale accounted for only some 10 percent of the Portuguese trade at Elmina, it was critical in luring the inland merchants to the coast. “An adequate and continuous supply of slaves was indispensable for the success of Portuguese trade at São Jorge da Mina,” Vogt remarks. “Without such slaves, much of the remainder of the trade-goods would not have been sold.” The total cost, including purchase price, transportation, and food, of a slave procured in the Slave Rivers and sold at Elmina was reckoned at about one-third of an ounce of gold.

This practice is easily confounded with human sacrifice, since it tended to occur on a large scale in the context of funerals, when there were suspicions that the deceased had been killed by witchcraft. But since it involves punishment for a supposed offence, rather than killing for a religious or ritual purpose, it is evidently conceptually distinct from human sacrifice. It is also likely to affect a different range of victims, and vari- ations in its incidence may have to be explained by other factors than those affecting human sacrifice." <sup id="cite_ref-942" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-942">[942]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b>♠ Influential figure forbids human sacrifice for in-group member ♣ {absent; present}: 1701-1874 CE; present: 1875-1895 CE ♥</b> "In Asante also, disputes over human sacrifice played some role in the deposition of two kings during the eighteenth century, but the details are far from being clear. King Kusi Obodum, who was deposed in 1764, is said by one traditional account to have alienated his chiefs and people by forbidding human sacrifices. This, however, is probably a misunderstanding: other accounts stress rather Kusi Obodum's lack of military success, and it seems likely therefore that the true complaint against him (as against Adandozan in Dahomey in 1818) was that he was failing to secure sufficient war captives for sacrifice, rather than that he had banned sacrifices. A similar ambiguity surrounds the disputes which led to the deposition of King Osei Kwame in 1798. A contemporary report of 1797 states that the killing of excessive numbers of people for the funerals of two Asante princes had led to a rebellion against Osei Kwame, which was ended by an agreement that 'the king may no longer kill or sacrifice anyone', but that convicted criminals should instead be sold as slaves at the coast.157 Here again, however, it seems improbable that this was really a total abolition of human sacrifice (far less of capital punishment), and more likely that it was an attempt to impose limitations and controls on the practice, perhaps specifically to restrict the sacrifice of free citizens. Moreover, an account of these disputes recorded a generation later gives a quite different account, which makes the king rather than his subjects the initiator of reform. This claims that Osei Kwame was deposed for his attachment to Islam, which had led him to prohibit many religious festivals involving human sacrifice, although he still continued to offer human victims to the royal ancestors. This suggests that Osei Kwame was not so much seeking to suppress human sacrifice altogether, as to concentrate its practice upon the cult of the royal ancestors. On this supposition, the to accounts may perhaps be reconciled: Osei Kwame, it may be suggested, sought to enhance royal power by prohibiting or reducing human sacrifice for the non-ancestral cults, while the opposition in turn sought to impose limits on the ancestral sacrifices. What was at issue was not the legitimacy of human sacrifice as such, but rather the rival claims for victims of the royal ancestor cult and the cults of the gods, which in turn expressed the tension between royal and chiefly power. The situation which arose in Asante in the aftermath of the British punitive expedition against it in 1874 is somewhat clearer. There was then a move to abolish human sacrifice, as was required by the treaty of 1874, and laws to this effect were promulgated in 1876 and 1881. The practical effect of these laws seems to have been, in 1876 to restrict sacrifices to convicted murderers, and in 1881 to abolish public executions at religious ceremonies. In part, of course, these reforms were merely a response to British pressure, born out of a desire for better relations with the British. As the king of Asante himself explained in a letter to the British authorities in 1876: 'The King and people knowing very well that human sacrifice is distressing to the feelings of whitemen, and that their friendship will not go well with them while they keep up that custom, they determined to abolish it'. 160 But more than this was involved. It appears from Ivor Wilks' work that the issue of human sacrifice served as a symbol in a struggle between modernizers and traditionalists in late nineteenth century Asante, between those who supported and those who opposed the reshaping of Asante institutions and values on the model of those of Europe. The discontinuation of the sacrifice of war captives implicit in the law of 1876 served specifically to symbolize the renunciation of the militarist (or, in Wilks' own term, 'imperialist') policies which had earlier been dominant in Asante, but which had been decisively discredited by the defeat of 1874."  <sup id="cite_ref-943" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-943">[943]</a></sup></dd>

The discontinuation of the sacrifice of war captives implicit in the law of 1876 served specifically to symbolize the renunciation of the militarist (or, in Wilks' own term, 'imperialist') policies which had earlier been dominant in Asante, but which had been decisively discredited by the defeat of 1874."  <sup id="cite_ref-946" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-946">[946]</a></sup> The official cult did not prohibit it, but other practical reasons, including an alliance with the British, made the prohibition politically desirable.</dd></dl>

<p><b>Supernatural beings (e.g., gods, spirits, ancestors)</b>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>♠ Number of officially sanctioned supernatural beings ♣ polytheistic ♥</b> The pantheon was made up of an omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient high/creator god as well as various other deities, spirits and ancestors. eHRAF provides the following summary: 'Indigenous Akan religion is based upon the worship of a High God, various spirits or deities, and ancestors. The High God-known as Onyame, Onyankopon, and by other names-is the Creator, now otiose; Asase Yaa, the goddess of the earth, accompanies him. The ancestors live in the land of the dead and may demand offerings, in the past including those of slaves.'<sup id="cite_ref-950" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-950">[950]</a></sup> It is unclear how many spirits and gods there were, which is partly due to the fact that different towns and other localities had their own gods.

Another strong name of Onyankopon Kwame is Abommubuwafre, that is to say, “he is the one who when lamentation or weeping comes upon you, you call upon.” When thus called upon, he answers you. Another strong name of Onyankopon is Nya-amane-kose, that is to say, “he is the one to whom if you report (or tell) any need or trouble, he is able to help you.” Onyankopon Kwame's further strong name is Brckyirihuade, that is to say, “he is the one who knows what is happening in his presence as well as behind his back.” He is the knower of the universe of things.'<sup id="cite_ref-951" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-951">[951]</a></sup></dd>

<p><b>Supernatural Enforcement of Morality</b>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement against harm ♣ inferred present ♥</b> Belief that morality flows from the gods in Akan religion, and widespread taboo against murder in African religions. "According to Opoku (1978), this [Akan] proverb [i.e. "God is against sin or evil"] is a clear indication that morality flows from God, and that the nature of God demands an appropriate response from His creatures. Adding to Opoku (1978), Harris and Sawyerr (1968) also refer to the Mende myth that explains the origin of sacrifice of fowls, performed when someone has offended another to illustrate God’s attitude towards morality. For Mbiti (1969), morality flows from religion. By this assertion, he argues that one should view morality as an authoritative code of conduct directly sanctioned by superhuman being (god, deities and even ancestors). The moral code that Mbiti (1969) refers to is therefore not autonomous, but its autonomy is derived from the creator god. Any breach of the moral code would accordingly be an offence against god and his instruction. Mbiti (1969) points out that there is in existence and operation numerous taboos and prohibitions in African societies which Ghana is of no exemption. These taboos and prohibitions, which have their source from religion according to Mbiti, are instituted to shape the moral lives of the people belonging to that society. Taboos and prohibitions such as, stealing, pre-marital sex, murder, incest, having sexual intercourse in the bush, adultery and suicide were viewed with serious concerns and offenders were seriously punished not by man as such, but predominantly by the gods and the ancestral spirits.

New formal titles were created, which were subject to wealth payments and ceremonial initiations. According to some sources, obedience to authority was valued. Insulting or attacking the Asantehene or his officials was a capital offence. The stools of ancestral chiefs retained ceremonial importance: 'The [unavailable]manhene and his elders, through the Barimhene purify the soul of King Ameyaw (the chief defeated by the Asante in 1723), adorn his grave with the royal regalia of the incumbent [unavailable]manhene, recall the deeds that Ameyaw performed for the State ([unavailable]man), and present drinks, sheep, and food to his soul and those of the other ancestral chiefs of the Techiman-Bono State.'<sup id="cite_ref-982" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-982">[982]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of purity ♣ inferred present ♥</b> Belief that morality flows from the gods in Akan religion, and widespread taboo against sexual transgression in African religions. "According to Opoku (1978), this [Akan] proverb [i.e. "God is against sin or evil"] is a clear indication that morality flows from God, and that the nature of God demands an appropriate response from His creatures. Adding to Opoku (1978), Harris and Sawyerr (1968) also refer to the Mende myth that explains the origin of sacrifice of fowls, performed when someone has offended another to illustrate God’s attitude towards morality. For Mbiti (1969), morality flows from religion. By this assertion, he argues that one should view morality as an authoritative code of conduct directly sanctioned by superhuman being (god, deities and even ancestors). The moral code that Mbiti (1969) refers to is therefore not autonomous, but its autonomy is derived from the creator god. Any breach of the moral code would accordingly be an offence against god and his instruction. Mbiti (1969) points out that there is in existence and operation numerous taboos and prohibitions in African societies which Ghana is of no exemption. These taboos and prohibitions, which have their source from religion according to Mbiti, are instituted to shape the moral lives of the people belonging to that society. Taboos and prohibitions such as, stealing, pre-marital sex, murder, incest, having sexual intercourse in the bush, adultery and suicide were viewed with serious concerns and offenders were seriously punished not by man as such, but predominantly by the gods and the ancestral spirits. By this, the divine (gods and ancestors) inflict drought, infertility and sicknesses on the life of the offender and the entire society."<sup id="cite_ref-986" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-986">[986]</a></sup> The following is also worth noting, especially as it related specifically to this NGA: 'Each man's way of life (abrabo) serves as his conduct before the ancestors.

<dd><b>♠ general supernatural enforcement of morality ♣ present ♥</b> Menstruation was considered unclean, and contact with a menstruating woman made a man vulnerable to "evil powers". 'In the belief system of the Asante, blood (mogya) was the vital force which, transmitted from generation to generation, bound the living and the ancestors together in a web of kinship (abusua). The shedding of blood was therefore seen as fundamentally antithetical to the natural order and was regulated by the Seventy-Seven Laws of Okomfo Anokye. Putting criminals to death and the slaying of persons to accompany the dead in the next world were sanctioned, but had to be carried out by the highly trained and ritually prepared adumfo or public executioners. The same Laws addressed the matter of menstrual blood. Menstruating women were forbidden from entering any regular dwelling house and were provided with special buildings for the duration. They were not allowed to swear an oath, to address any servant of the king (ahenkwaa) or any priest ([unavailable]komfo), or to have sexual intercourse. Pollution was the issue. “Even by indirect contact,” Rattray wrote in 1927, 'an unclean woman is capable of breaking down all barriers which stand between defenceless man and those evil unseen powers which beset him on every side. These protective powers once thus rendered inactive, have to be “recharged”, as it were, by propitiation, extirpation, and augmentation rites, to placate them and build them up anew.' <sup id="cite_ref-988" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-988">[988]</a></sup></dd>

Marriage serves personal preference, convenience, and pleasure rather than family interest, except in the cases of elite marriages of alliance. For Asantes marriage is structurally optional in a way that motherhood and fatherhood are not, so they talked of it as an individual, idiosyncratic relationship without an absolute moral mandate. Teenagers and young adults under thirty or forty are expected to devote their primary attention to courtship and marriage as part of enjoying a pleasurable stage of life without substantial family responsibility.

It is, I suggest, mutatis mutandis, a paradigm of sorts for the early Akan state. Those who controlled the production and sale of gold were those able to procure a supply of unfree labor. Those who procured unfree labor were those able to create arable land within the forest. Those who created the arable were those who founded the numerous early Akan polities. We see, in other words, a class of Akan entrepreneurs emerging: a class of those able to use the strength of the world bullion market, and the availability of labor locally (whether through Wangara or Portuguese suppliers), in such a way as to create the new agrarian system. These entrepreneurs were known as the aberemp[unavailable]n (sing. [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n), literally “big men” but correctly glossed in an early European source as “a superior rich man.” ' <sup id="cite_ref-1004" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1004">[1,004]</a></sup> 'Akan village histories make frequent reference to hunters ranging the forest in search of land suitable for agricultural exploitation—taking account, presumably, of surface relief, water resources, soil, and so forth. The role of the aberemp[unavailable]n in these explorations is often described in considerable detail. By way of illustration I shall cite the cases of two, Tabiri Heman and Akuamoa Panin.' <sup id="cite_ref-1005" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1005">[1,005]</a></sup> 'The descendants of free settlers became [unavailable]manmufo, citizens. Those of the proprietors became adehyeε, nobility. There remain the unfree laborers. They must surely be those who became the third major element in the composition of an [unavailable]man, namely the gyaasefo. Literally “the people of the hearth,” they were absorbed into Akan society as servants of the adehyeε. They became responsible not only for their own subsistence but for that of the nobles. They farmed for them, assumed responsibility for their debts, and provided them with a wide range of personal services as stool-carriers, drummers, hornblowers, umbrella-carriers, bathroom attendants, messengers, tradesmen, sextons, and so forth. Their masters (or mistresses) were heirs to their property. Their status, unlike that of nobles and citizens, was transmitted through the male line. Rattray commented on the matter: [Page 100] 'There is little doubt that the Gyasefo were in olden times recruited from the slave class. A “Stool” slave became one of the Gyasefo. The descendants of a Gyase woman were of course considered as Gyasefo, down the female line for all time; not only was this so, but the son of a Gyase man would ordinarily also enter the office to which his father belonged, irrespective of the position of his mother.' <sup id="cite_ref-1006" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1006">[1,006]</a></sup> 'It is virtually impossible to render such terms as adehyeε, [unavailable]manmufo and gyaasefo into English with the appropriate nuances. Adehyeε may preside over the affairs of anything from villages on the one hand to kingdoms on the other. Their power will rest in no small measure upon the sheer numbers of gyaasefo whose services they command; indeed, this is one index of their rank. In 1936 Oheneba Sakyi Djan manfully struggled with the problem, though with reference to the more southerly forest Akan: 'The term “Gyaase”…applies to the most immediate adherents attached to the household of any important personage. In this instance, even an ordinary well-to-do man (rich man) may have his own Gyaase, so much so that the head of a family (Opanyin or Atrankonnua) or a ruler of a town (Odekro), or a head of a division of a state (Ohene) or the supreme head or king of a state (Omanhene) should necessarily have his own Gyaase-men, and the number of the members constituting the Gyaase of each of the above heads depends on the importance of the party concerned. That is to say, the number of the members of the Gyaase attached to the Ohene's household is by far fewer than that attached to the Omanhene household.' It was all to do with achievement. The fortunes of an [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n depended first on his ability to procure the labor that, the estate established, became his gyaasefo, and second on his ability to attract free settlers to the estate. Measured in these terms the relatively unsuccessful [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n emerged as no more than a village head, an [unavailable]dekuro, and was absorbed in time into the aman (qua state) of his more successful peer, the [unavailable]hene of this or that group of towns and villages, and he in turn into the aman (qua kingdom) of those even more successful. We turn to a consideration of the most successful of all.' <sup id="cite_ref-1007" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1007">[1,007]</a></sup> It appears that social stratification accelerated during the Ashanti period and largely relied on unfree labour: 'ON THE BASIS OF HIS observations of Kumase society in 1817, Bowdich became strongly aware of the degree of social stratification present. Of the many indicators of this—housing, diet, hygiene, toiletry, marriage, and so forth —he commented most fully on matters of the household economy:[Page 140] 'the higher class could not support their numerous followers, or the lower their large families, in the city, and therefore employed them in plantations (in which small crooms [villages] were situated) generally within two or three miles of the capital, where their labours not only feed themselves, but supply the wants of the chief, his family, and more immediate suite. The middling orders station their slaves for the same purpose, and also to collect fruit and vegetables for sale, and when their children become numerous, a part are generally sent to be supported by these slaves in the bush.' <sup id="cite_ref-1008" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1008">[1,008]</a></sup> 'Bowdich's “higher class” would appear to refer to the wealthy citizens, high officeholders for the most part, whose gyaasefo or “retainers” supported them; his “middling orders” to aspirant citizens  in the process of creating, through utilization of slaves, their own gyaasefo; and his “lower class” to those who perforce ensured their survival by the use of family labor. If Bowdich may be understood to be suggesting that the commanding morality of metropolitan society was one of upward mobility based on wealth, then he was undoubtedly correct. Had Bowdich remained in Kumase a few months longer, he would have observed that upward mobility was an institutionalized process.' <sup id="cite_ref-1009" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1009">[1,009]</a></sup> New formal titles were created for individuals who had accumulated wealth: 'Those who attained wealth in Asante were known as the sikafo, “the monied people.” This category subsumed the smaller group of those who acquired fortunes sufficiently substantial for them to seek formal recognition of their achievement. Of these, those able to demonstrate that they had acquired through their own enterprise a modest fortune of 125 peredwans might, with the approval of the Asantehene, obtain the entitlement of wearing in public a specially designed and woven cloth known as nyaw[unavailable]ho, “you have become rich.” It would seem that it was after the acquisition of such a resource in gold dust that the aspirant (and wise) citizen would begin to invest in people and land. The title to be acquired thereby was that of asafohene, an ancient one originally and exclusively meaning “a war captain.” But the title was available at different levels depending upon the number of subjects acquired. As noticed above, Yamoa Ponko gifted to his son, Gyesi Kwame, 100 subjects, and thereby Gyesi Kwame acquired the comparatively low-ranking dignity of an asafohene of the Kyidom Stool. By contrast, in late 1861 or early 1862 the Akyempemhene Owusu Koko, already an occupant of high office in Kumase, nevertheless publicly displayed his three thousand subjects—each in possession of a gun—who must be assumed to have represented self-acquired property. An asafohene able to show command of at least a thousand subjects was entitled not only to wear the nyaw[unavailable]ho cloth but also to have a horse-tail switch ( bodua) carried before him. It was, however, the right to use not the horse-tail but the elephant-tail switch ( mena or mmara) that was the most coveted of all honors—and one carrying with it use of the ancient title of [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n.' <sup id="cite_ref-1010" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1010">[1,010]</a></sup> 'However many sikafo aspired to the award of the elephant tail, relatively few seem to have achieved it. Three successful nineteenth century claimants are well documented, namely, Gyaasewahene Opoku Frefre (died 1826), Ankobeahene Kwaku Tawia (died ca. 1850), and Manwerehene Kwasi Brantuo (died 1865). There were certainly others. A description of the ceremony surrounding the award was given by the Akyeamehene Kwasi Nuama in 1925. Because it is the fullest account of the procedures known to me, I cite it fully: 'Those chiefs who were allowed to use elephant tails were called Abrempons. A chief who lives on his own land with his own subjects is known by the King as Abrempon. An Abrempon must exhibit his wealth publicly by presenting £9 6s. [i.e., 1 peredwan with supplementary mmataho] to all the Abrempons in Kumase; and 10 peregwans (£80) to the King. He would then go to Tafo and pay £1 6s. to the chief there who would give him an egg to throw against a silk cotton tree. He would then return to Kumasi. He would then go to Essumja Santimanso and buy a carpet ( nsa) for £24 [3 peregwans] from the subjects of the Chief there. He must only dance on it and leave it after presenting Essumjahene with another £24. Your going and coming expenses (including the £48) will cost you some 20 pregwans. He would buy an elephant tail from the Assinhene (son of Essumjahene) for £9 6s. He would tie the elephant tail round the waist of one of his slaves and he must then past [ sic] round the outskirts of the town lying on the leaves of palm trees which have been strewn around the town, firing at his slave with blank fire from time to time. The slave falls down eventually and he then cuts the string to which the tail is fastened and takes the tail—then the ceremonies are completed, and his people applaud him. Next morning he would get mashed yam mixed with 30 peregwans and be carried on a litter round the town of Kumasi scattering largesse of the yam mixture. On the following morning he would be carried in a litter with all his regalia, his skin plastered with white clay. Then he would fix up a spear at Dwebirim (the market place) and challenge those of the same rank to remove it. After this he is called Brempon. On the last day anyone who aspires to the rank of Abrempon takes out the spear and appoints a time for performing the same ceremonies.' The Akyeamehene thus identified six stages in the ceremony. The first, the payments to the aberemp[unavailable]n of the capital and to the Asantehene, requires little comment. In the early nineteenth century Hutchison noted that the first step was, for obvious reasons, taken only “by those who are in favour with the King, and think themselves safe from palavers.” The second and third stages, the visits to Tafo and Asantemanso, involved the candidate in ancient rituals the nature of which will not be [Page 142] examined here; suffice to remind the reader that Tafo was an old (“aboriginal”) trading center, and Asantemanso one of the “cradles” of the Akan.' <sup id="cite_ref-1011" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1011">[1,011]</a></sup> 'The fourth stage of the ceremony, that of catching of the “elephant,” was, by a fortunate chance, once witnessed by the missionary W. West on his visit to Kumase with Owusu Ansa in 1862. Although West does not name the candidate, one may be reasonably confident that it was the Kumase Manwerehene, Kwasi Brantuo. On March 29 West noted the arrival of several dignitaries in Kumase, “to take part in the ceremony, which was that of the display of wealth, by an old chief, in order to be entitled to the honour of having the elephant's tail carried before him; an honour to which only the wealthy can aspire.” he actual charade occurred the next day: 'A slave had been selected to enact the part of the elephant. Besmeared all over with chalk, holding in his hand a small tusk, which he occasionally applied to his mouth, and having an elephant's tail attached by a piece of string behind, he was started off; while some forty or fifty men, armed with muskets, and supplied with blank cartridges, followed in pursuit, keeping up an almost constant fire. His elephantship as we were informed, made his way, according to usage, to a small kroom [village] not far from Kumasi, where he fell down as if shot, and lay there until the chief himself appeared to cut off the tail; who, having thus hunted the elephant, and possessed himself of its caudal appendage, was considered, as I suppose, entitled to have it borne before him.' The “kroom” near Kumase at which the chase ended was, seemingly, a parcel of land that the Akwamuhene donated to aspirant aberemp[unavailable]n. Kwasi Brantuo was, in fact, given the Adiebeba lands in 1862 by the Kumase Akwamuhene Akwawua Dente; and Opoku Frefre, whose candidacy will be referred to next, was awarded the Daakwadwam lands by Akwawua Dente's forerunner in office, Kwakye Kofi.' <sup id="cite_ref-1012" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1012">[1,012]</a></sup> Wilks provides a general description of the class structure: 'It is notoriously difficult to characterize the class structure of precapitalist societies. To this generalization Asante is no exception, though R. A. Kea's studies of a number of seventeenth century Akan polities have provided an invaluable lead.  For present purposes the postulate is that a class reproduces itself as a class and that it does so only insofar as it has a determinate and specific, though not necessarily direct, relationship to the means of production. Consider, for example, the Asante class of the adehyeε, a word commonly but inappropriately translated [Page 294] “royalty” in English. “The old adage” (and I quote the collective wisdom of the late Asantehene and his councillors in a judgment passed down in 1964) “is that a royal is one whose ancestor had established or founded a village." This succinct statement of traditional usage defines a class within Asante society by implicit reference to a set of proprietary rights over land exercised by those who were thereby able to appropriate, in the form of tributes, taxes, and services, part of the labor-value of others settled on the land. I have elsewhere suggested that the origins of the adehyeε class are to be sought in the context of the great economic transformations associated with the development of forest agriculture. I have also suggested that the gyaasefo emerged as a servile class in precisely the same context. In this chapter I argue that the asomfo, or those in administrative service, came to constitute a class within Asante society in precisely the same sense of class.

An elderly female has handmade beads placed in a brass pan before her body; these are buried with her. It is said that a spirit-woman called Amokye will not allow women without beads to pass into the ancestral realm. A sheep is slaughtered to purify the town and the lineage stool; this ritual is called the removal of misfortune or evil. Guns, frequently old Danish guns, are fired at intervals; Christians, however, seldom follow this particular custom. The corpse is usually buried the same or the day after death; the actual funeral (ayie) usually takes place a week or so later, after the entire extended family can be informed. The date may be extended further into the future if the family lacks sufficient financial resources. Ideally there are remembrance funeral ceremonies at one week, at two weeks, at 42 days, at 80 days, and at a year (afrenhyia) after a death, although ceremonies subsequent to the first-week funeral may be quite perfunctory.

It consisted of two or sometimes three distinct parts, the afuwa, mfufuwa and mfufuwa-nini. The land currently under cultivation was the afuwa, “the little farm” or field, and the land under fallow was the mfufuwa, literally “the non- afuwa.” A farmer's rights of tenure over his fallow were as secure as those over his land under cultivation. In some cases a farm may have attached to it further land — fallow that has not been brought back into cultivation at the appropriate time because, for example, of unsatisfactory yields or of the inability of the tenants (through illnesses, deaths, or the like) to resume cropping it. Such land is the mfufuwa-nini, literally “barren fallow.” The original tenants and their heirs retain rights to the produce from it — to the fruits of palm and kola trees, for example, and to firewood and poles — but Asante law appears not to have defined with any precision the point in time at which others might acquire rights in it and recommence farming operations. Much litigation results.' <sup id="cite_ref-1044" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1044">[1,044]</a></sup> 'Akan village histories make frequent reference to hunters ranging the forest in search of land suitable for agricultural exploitation—taking account, presumably, of surface relief, water resources, soil, and so forth.

By way of illustration I shall cite the cases of two, Tabiri Heman and Akuamoa Panin.' <sup id="cite_ref-1045" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1045">[1,045]</a></sup> 'The aberemp[unavailable]n were essentially developers. They created estates, founding villages and clearing the arable land necessary for subsistence. I refer to such estates as “ beremp[unavailable]n-doms” (by analogy with “kingdoms,” “chiefdoms,” etc.). Of the actual work of felling, clearing, and building, and of how the imported unfree labor was used, we know nothing. Such is not the stuff of tradition. Kea has drawn attention to a possible model, that of Aduafo of Afutu and “other great lords” who had contracted with the Danish African Company to clear a site and construct a trading post for them. They brought 300 of their slaves to the site and divided them [Page 98] into two teams. One carried out the clearing while the other assembled the building materials. This was, however, at a coastal location and is therefore of uncertain relevance.' <sup id="cite_ref-1046" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1046">[1,046]</a></sup> 'If the creation of an estate was predicated on the procurement of unfree labor, its prosperity depended on free settlers being attracted to it. Such was the pressure on land, on arable land, that they came. Sometimes the original estate was subdivided by purchase. For example, Adu Gyamfi, by origin from Adansemanso, founded a settlement named Aboforumu. It lay about 12 miles northwest of what was to become Kumase. He subsequently sold (“as the explorers or the owners of the land”) part of the estate to new settlers, Amma Badu and Antwi, who paid him mperedwan aduosia, 60 peredwans or some 135 oz. of gold. The estate was soon to be divided yet again. We have met Akosua Yitua of Asantemanso and her son Danso Abeam, above. She had five daughters. The third of these settled at Amoaman, but her descendants “became hemmed in at this village.” They moved northward, and their leader, Adu Panin, purchased a block of land from Amma Badu and Antwi. He renamed it Ntonso. The price is not reported. The transaction is said to have occurred at the time of Oti Akenten of Kumase. Other cases did not involve purchase, but contract sometimes sealed by marriage. The case of Kyerewa Akenten and her brother, Kagya, is instructive. They left Asantemanso in search of land and, after rejecting several places as unsuitable, arrived at Oyoko, near Feyiase. They went from there 'to Odum-Anaafuo to ask Berefo Kese, the Chief of the place for some land to settle on. He showed them a site where they built their village which they named “Kagya-kurom” [Kagya's village]. Owing to the large number of the followers of Kagya and his sister, Berefo Kese presented them a large portion of his lands on which they farmed. From Kagya-kurom Berefo Kese married Kyerewa Akenten and after their marriage Berefo Kese added a much larger portion of his lands to that already in their hands and presented it to them.' <sup id="cite_ref-1047" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1047">[1,047]</a></sup> 'Obtaining land involved negotiation with the [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n who had developed it, who had (as it were) staked out first claims to it.

In fact these are dispersed almost randomly throughout forest society. As Fortes has remarked, the matriclan “delimits a diffuse field of amity, wide in extent but of minimal structural specificity.” Within the beremp[unavailable]n-dom, of the rule of exogamy, and in that respect was a socially integrative factor.

The struggles that attended the process are exhaustively chronicled in Akan traditions; the nature of the process itself, whereby a class of entrepreneurs became transformed into a ruling class, is not. The key lies in an understanding of the peculiar features of Akan land proprietorship.' <sup id="cite_ref-1049" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1049">[1,049]</a></sup> 'A cardinal feature of the system is expressed in the maxim, afuo mu yε me deε, asase yε [unavailable]hene deε, “the farm is my property, the land is the king's.” It is necessary to extrapolate from more recent practice, described by Rattray, Busia, and Fortes among others. If the proprietor of the land conferred heritable rights to the arable on those who were permitted to settle, he also reserved or established certain rights to himself and his heirs — to his “stool.” He took an almost token part of the harvest at the time of the annual harvest festival (the odwira), but required a more substantial share of the produce of the land as opposed to the arable: fish, snails, game, kola, minerals, and the like. He could levy a wide range of taxes, such as peato for military expenses, ayieto for funerals, and [unavailable]manto to defray the costs of making regalia and putting up buildings. Most importantly, he could require the provision of labor for military service or, for example, for work on the roads. Such, briefly, were what led Potekhin to refer to “the relatively easy feudal dues of the free members of the community.” Relatively easy” they may or may not have been; there was variation from place to place and time to time. “Feudal” they were not, for the free settlers acquired almost unassailable titles to the land they farmed, while the various taxes and services provided to the landholder were ad hoc and sporadic and did not approximate in character to a rent, whether economic or otherwise.' <sup id="cite_ref-1050" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1050">[1,050]</a></sup> 'The descendants of free settlers became [unavailable]manmufo, citizens. Those of the proprietors became adehyeε, nobility. There remain the unfree laborers. They must surely be those who became the third major element in the composition of an [unavailable]man, namely the gyaasefo. Literally “the people of the hearth,” they were absorbed into Akan society as servants of the adehyeε. They became responsible not only for their own subsistence but for that of the nobles. They farmed for them, assumed responsibility for their debts, and provided them with a wide range of personal services as stool-carriers, drummers, hornblowers, umbrella-carriers, bathroom attendants, messengers, tradesmen, sextons, and so forth. Their masters (or mistresses) were heirs to their property. Their status, unlike that of nobles and citizens, was transmitted through the male line. Rattray commented on the matter: [Page 100] 'There is little doubt that the Gyasefo were in olden times recruited from the slave class. A “Stool” slave became one of the Gyasefo. The descendants of a Gyase woman were of course considered as Gyasefo, down the female line for all time; not only was this so, but the son of a Gyase man would ordinarily also enter the office to which his father belonged, irrespective of the position of his mother.' <sup id="cite_ref-1051" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1051">[1,051]</a></sup> Theft was punished: 'By virtue of his position, all penalties for breach of the [Page 30] tribal or public oath are collected for and paid to the Ohene, in addition to certain court fees, such as Asida, or Atingé. In former times the Ohene of every large town was entitled to fine strangers entering his town bearing arms without his permission so to do. Fines are paid for accidental homicide; such as carelessly wounding a person taking part in the chase. A person found guilty of criminal intercourse with a married woman is liable to pay to the injured husband a fine of two ounces of gold (benda), that is, £7 4 s. In cases of theft the guilty offender is made to restore to the owner the stolen article or its value, and to his ruler he pays a fine. Where a thief is unable to restore a priceless article, he is killed, and his nearest blood relatives are fined, and, if unable to pay, are sold for the amount. The amount of a fine for theft does not depend so much on the value of the article as upon the nature thereof; e.g. it is not considered theft for a starving man to steal any foodstuff to appease his hunger. Among a people who have been accustomed to have all things in common, the sensibility of many persons to the criminality of theft is not so great as in Europe. In the old settlements, however, the standard of morality in this respect is steadily rising.' <sup id="cite_ref-1052" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1052">[1,052]</a></sup> 'The earliest account of these customary dues is that given by Artus, who was trading at Mowre and other Gold [Page 86] Coast ports in the year 1600.

<p><b>♠ Moralistic punishment by human religious agents ♣ absent ♥</b> eHRAF provides the following summary: 'Indigenous Akan religion is based upon the worship of a High God, various spirits or deities, and ancestors. The High God-known as Onyame, Onyankopon, and by other names-is the Creator, now otiose; Asase Yaa, the goddess of the earth, accompanies him. The ancestors live in the land of the dead and may demand offerings, in the past including those of slaves.' <sup id="cite_ref-1055" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1055">[1,055]</a></sup> 'The Akan have largely been Christian since the nineteenth century, except for most kings, who have had to retain their indigenous religious status and practices. European Christian missions were highly successful, bringing not only Christianity but also education, and most Akan have been literate for a long time. Islam has a long history among the Akan, having been introduced by early traders from the north. Royalty made use of Muslim scribes for court duties. The Akan have a long history of "prophets" of many kinds-Christian, Muslim, and "heathen"-and of separatist Christian movements. All these various forms of religious belief and activity exist side by side, and most people have recourse to all of them, according to their particular needs and wishes.

Traditionally, the stools were anointed with human blood, gunpowder, and spider webs, and given alcoholic drink; human sacrifices are no longer made. Each kingdom and town has, or had in past years, an annual purification ritual, known as ODWIRA, in which the king, the office of kingship, the kingdom, and the town are purified of the pollution of the preceding year; this is often known in the literature as a "yam festival." [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-1058" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1058">[1,058]</a></sup> The Akan pantheon featured an omnipotent and omniscient supreme being (see also above). Gods and ancestors were thought to watch over the moral conduct of humans. Good deeds were rewarded in the afterlife, while bad deeds were punished: 'All ancestors are children of Nyame. Ancestors pass on to their children those things required of them by the Supreme Being as his children. They stand (mediate) between their children and the Supreme Being. They show the right way in which mortal man should live so as to come to the Supreme Being. That good or right way is called conduct ( obra) or good conduct ( obra pa). The Ga people call it dzenba (world-coming) [Page 24] that is, way of being, or living, in this world; the way in which one makes good or behaves himself in the world.' <sup id="cite_ref-1059" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1059">[1,059]</a></sup> 'Each man's way of life ( abrabo) serves as his conduct before the ancestors.

He who does not live in the right way is an accursed soul, and when he dies, he is not called Nana; he has not a good soul, and he does not join the Nananom. The sunsum of a wicked or accursed man does not agree with Odomankoma, who is spoken of in succeeding chapters and who created the Thing.

In their simplest form the temples were small rectangular buildings, entered by steps, the outer surfaces decorated with low reliefs and covered with red and white clay. More usually they consisted of a number of units around a court. Here male priests would periodically carry the god's shrine on their heads, becoming possessed and showing their powers to see, say and do things beyond the abilities of ordinary mortals.' <sup id="cite_ref-1062" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1062">[1,062]</a></sup> 'Beneath 'Nyame are the atano and abosom, ‘gods’ or ‘powers’ who possess men and women to serve as mediumistic priests ( ak[unknown]mfo) and can provide guidance and aid. Each god has its own character, revealed by the movements and speech of the possessed priest, although the latter cannot recall what occurs when he is seized by the god.' <sup id="cite_ref-1063" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1063">[1,063]</a></sup> 'Gods still reveal themselves, perhaps most commonly by ‘seizing’ persons, making them behave as if they were becoming mad ( abondamfo). The person becomes disoriented (sometimes running wildly into the bush and becoming lost), speaks incoherently and hears voices. He or she may cease to eat and become withdrawn. Herbalists ( dunsinfo) and priests will be consulted until the cause has been identified. Sometimes the priests will decide, while possessed by their own gods, that a new or an established god wishes the afflicted person to become its priest. The situation of the first seizing may suggest this: for example, if a person is possessed at a priest's funeral, it will be assumed that the dead priest's god is seeking a successor.' <sup id="cite_ref-1064" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1064">[1,064]</a></sup> 'These shrines ( yowa) are of crucial importance in Asante religion. Each was usually kept in a special room inside a compound, a white cloth draped over the door to warn menstruating women away. Some of the most successful gods were kept in a separate temple ( bosom'dan or bosom'fie). The shrine was placed upon the head of a male priest on ‘bad’ days ( nnabone) in the forty-two-day cycle (see p.53), and the priest became possessed, usually inside the shrine room, where supplicants consulted him. Later in the day he would sometimes dance with the god on his head to the music of the god's drums and the songs of women devotees. Numbers of gold-weights depict this dance. Occasionally a priest would display his prowess by dancing with the heavy pan resting on his shoulders and the nape of his neck, his head pushed forward.' <sup id="cite_ref-1065" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1065">[1,065]</a></sup> 'It was the role of gods and priests to advise on obscure areas of existence, to trace the causes of sickness and misfortune, and help alleviate or remove these. The gods helped to make sense of the ways in which the lives of individuals and the community departed from the expected. Answers to supplicants' inquiries were often phrased in allusive and ambiguous terms.' <sup id="cite_ref-1066" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1066">[1,066]</a></sup> 'Powerful priests are believed to be aided by creatures from the wild — mmoatia (literally, ‘short’ or ‘little beasts’), a term usually translated as ‘dwarfs’. These are described as being about 30-60 cm in height, more or less of human form except that their feet point backwards. There are three sorts: red, black and white, the three basic colour groups of the Asante spectrum. Dwarfs are unpredictable: they may either attack or befriend those lost in the bush. A person befriended is miraculously sustained with eggs touched to the mouth. Dwarfs also teach the powers of herbs to lost people who help others when they return from the bush. They communicate by whistling, the pattern of tones reproducing those of ordinary speech.' <sup id="cite_ref-1067" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1067">[1,067]</a></sup> 'Formerly priests and priestesses lived somewhat outside normal society and were feared by ordinary people. Their primary function was to control the [Page 63] intrusion of supernatural beings into human life and they conversed with powers unknown and invisible to most humans. It is said priests and priestesses did not marry, and Bowdich claimed priestesses were highly promiscuous, that is they disregarded normal sexual rules. Appearance emphasised ak[unknown]mfo'sdifference. Their costume was a raffia skirt ( d[unknown]s[unknown]) and when possessed they went barefoot — the antithesis of chiefs whose feet were supposed never to touch the earth. Priests' hair was allowed to grow into long, matted locks in the style known as mpesempese (a term sometimes translated as ‘I don't like it’). Uncut hair is usually associated with dangerous behaviour: madmen let their locks grow, and the same hair-style was worn by royal executioners.' <sup id="cite_ref-1068" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1068">[1,068]</a></sup> The relationship between priests and political power was complicated: 'The relationship of priests to the system of chiefly rule is obscure, and it is unclear how far ak[unknown]mfo acted together, apart from training new members. Missionaries suspected that priests passed information to impress and trick ordinary people, but such charges are impossible to substantiate, and in any case it is hard to accept that the whole religious system was founded on trickery and self-delusion.' <sup id="cite_ref-1069" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1069">[1,069]</a></sup> 'Many priests seem to have achieved an unusual degree of independence. This and their self-confidence struck several nineteenth-century observers favourably. Ramseyer and Kuhne, for example, testified to the kindness of one priest who sent them food and drink and to the way in which other priests visited them, apparently feeling that they and the Christians were engaged on the same type of work' <sup id="cite_ref-1070" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1070">[1,070]</a></sup> 'There is evidence that chiefs tried to exercise a degree of control over priests. In several states ( oman) it is claimed that new gods could not be introduced without the approval of the Omanhene and his council, although it is impossible to say how far this operated in practice. There also exist numerous traditions telling how rulers laid traps to see which priests could prophesy or divine accurately. The Asantehene had a god called Diakomfo (‘eat priests’), and it is said priests adjudged false were killed over his shrine. Certain gods were classed as state gods and were thought to have a particularly close relationship to the state's success and prosperity. Many of these seem to have been brought by the first settlers in the area or to have been ‘found’ by them in the new land. Other gods seem to have been captured in war and, with their priests, to have been brought back to help the victorious group. Bonnat noted a tradition that the priests with a defeated army were not slain. ' <sup id="cite_ref-1071" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1071">[1,071]</a></sup> 'The priesthood's political power is difficult to estimate, and in any case the situation was never static. Early in the nineteenth century some senior Asante appear to have considered that Islam could provide a firmer support for the state, but little came of this. Later, the disruptive potential of Christianity was recognised, and its missionaries were given little chance of preaching either within or outside the capital until the British seized control. At the time of Bowdich's visit the cult of the royal ancestors, incorporated in the great annual Odwira new yam festival, may have been emphasised to counterbalance the priesthood. Towards the end of Asante independence the priesthood, or at least the idiom of priesthood, was used to counter royal power. In the troubles of the 1880s some of those opposed to Asantehene Mensa Bonsu claimed to be reincarnations of the famous priest Anokye and other long-dead priests. They tried to assassinate the King, and many were taken and executed. The incident is obscure, but it appears that those involved were declaring their complete separation from the usual political process and appealing to a different view of the Asante state. The use of the names of famous priests for this purpose seems, therefore, to indicate a pre-existing tension between state and priesthood.' <sup id="cite_ref-1072" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1072">[1,072]</a></sup>

</p>
<dl><dd> <b>♠ physical punishment ♣ present ♥</b> eHRAF provides a general description of offenses and sanctions, which included corporeal punishment: 'The two major kinds of offenses were the violation of tribal taboos and household cases. The family head (ABUSUA PANIN) adjudicated the later and chiefs the former. A public declaration of a forbidden oath by the plaintiff had the immediate effect of bringing a chief in to adjudicate the dispute. Murder and assault were capital crimes, and suicide a capital sin. Incest and adultery were also abhorred and at one time were capital crimes. Capital punishment included death by beheading, strangulation, or clubbing. Mutilation and public ridicule were other sanctions employed. Extra-clan offenses were avoided at all costs. Expulsion from the clan avoided blood feuds and in most cases resulted in the offender's enslavement. [IS]' <sup id="cite_ref-1073" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1073">[1,073]</a></sup> The offender's kin were sometimes considered to be liable to punishment as well: 'Crime we have seen, no less than every other individual act, was a corporate deed; it therefore involved the innocent as well as the guilty. Here we have further extension of this theory as exemplified in the fact that should the guilty person be permitted to continue to live and reproduce the species, such offspring were liable to share in the sentence once passed on their parent. This custom raises an interesting question: Was the child liable to punishment because of the act of his parent, whose guilt he or she was now considered to have inherited, or was he punished because he was considered to inherit an inevitable propensity to re-enact the crime for which the parent had been condemned to death? The latter is, I believe, the notion in the West African's mind. An Ashanti once remarked to me, ‘An otofo (criminal who has been executed), if he or she “come back”, will “come back” as an otofo’.' <sup id="cite_ref-1074" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1074">[1,074]</a></sup> According to Rattray, punishments became more severe in the Ashanti period: 'With the rise of Ashanti to power, we find a marked increase in the severity of punishments meted out to offenders, which was probably the very antithesis of early justice, when tradition points to mildness of régime as having been the predominating feature. It seems indeed not improbable that the functions of the early judge were largely confined to the pronouncement of a statement as to innocence or guilt, and that punishment was left in the hands of supernatural powers. Where guilt was difficult of assignment, the judge might even leave the verdict to these hidden powers, and only intervene to pronounce sentence after they had manifested their decision. I shall deal with these subjects later, under the heading of Ordeals.' <sup id="cite_ref-1075" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1075">[1,075]</a></sup> 'The important place occupied by ridicule as a primitive sanction [Page opp. p. 293] [Page 293] among the Ashanti is of especial interest, and will be examined presently in some detail.' <sup id="cite_ref-1076" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1076">[1,076]</a></sup> Capital punishment was practiced for some offenses, but offenders could avoid this by paying 'blood money' to leaders: 'The law of evidence presents many curious and unusual features, shedding considerable light on the real meaning of ‘lying’ in the Ashanti mind. The method of using witnesses will, in one respect, be seen to be very reminiscent of the part played by ‘compurgators’ in our own early courts of justice. I have devoted considerable space to land tenure and alienation, a subject about which I had written in a previous book, 1 to which the new evidence that has come to light since that chapter was written may be taken as supplementary. I now propose to deal with those two main divisions of offences which the Ashanti alone seemed formerly to recognize, i. e. Oman Akyiwadie (Tribal taboos or sins), and Efiesem (literally, cases [that might be settled] in the house).' <sup id="cite_ref-1077" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1077">[1,077]</a></sup> 'THE offences set out in paragraph four of this chapter (among several others which may have escaped my notice) were known in Ashanti as Oman Akyiwadie, which, translated literally, means, ‘Things hateful to the Tribe’. These acts were looked upon as sins of which the central authority was bound to take immediate official notice, lest certain supernatural powers, to whom the deeds were regarded as peculiarly offensive, should wreak their vengeance upon those whose paramount duty it was to protect their interests and to punish breaches of immemorial law or custom.' <sup id="cite_ref-1078" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1078">[1,078]</a></sup> 'Up to the time of European intervention, an Ashanti who committed any of these sins was liable to summary arrest and trial, without any further legal formality, such as has been noted in the case of other offences. If found guilty, the culprit suffered capital punishment. At a later date he might have been permitted—in the case of some, but not all these sins—‘to buy his head’.' <sup id="cite_ref-1079" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1079">[1,079]</a></sup> 'I have tabulated these Tribal taboos under certain headings. It will be seen later, however, in a more detailed examination of each, that the Ashanti definition of many of the terms I have employed varied considerably from the meanings given to them in our own law. These Oman Akyiwadie then were: 1. Murder. 2. Suicide. 3. A class of ‘sins’ which we might describe as ‘sexual offences’, and others of a somewhat similar nature, which we should consider possibly as ‘immoral’ but not as ‘criminal’. 2 4. Certain forms of abuse. 5. Certain kinds of assault. 6. Certain kinds of stealing. 7. The invocation of a curse upon a Chief. 8. Treason and cowardice. 9. Witchcraft. [Page 295] 10. The violation, by word or deed, of any other recognized Tribal taboo. 11. The breaking of any law or command, the violation of which would not, in the ordinary way, involve the breaking of any Tribal taboo, but the observance of which had been enjoined on the clear understanding that disobedience would be taken, in this particular case, as entailing the violation of a specific taboo. In other words, refusal to obey any law or command issued and qualified by a ‘conditional curse’, i.e. by an Ntam (‘Oath’).' <sup id="cite_ref-1080" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1080">[1,080]</a></sup> Trials were held in order to prevent supernatural revenge: '‘The reason that a man might not be killed without first being told what he had done to deserve death was because, if he were executed without a trial, his sasa (ghost) would trouble the Chief in his sleep and also the people in the town.’ We have seen 2 how this fear of a [Page 296] dead man's sasa was present in a minor degree, even in the case of a prisoner duly executed by a strictly legal process. It seems therefore natural to suppose that the revengeful spirit should be feared still more when the person had been illegally done to death. That this spirit should be considered as likely to take vengeance on a Chief who allowed his death to pass unavenged, no less than on the actual murderer, is strictly in accordance with the belief in the corporate responsibility of certain persons for the acts of the individual, which is such an inseparable feature in the Ashanti law of crime. I think, therefore, it is right to assume that it was the dread of supernatural reprisal, rather than the outrage upon the central authority, which placed this act in the category of a tribal or national sin. Murder for long remained one of the offences for which it was impossible ‘to buy one's head’. It was also one of the few sins for which the punishment was death by dancing Atopere.' <sup id="cite_ref-1081" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1081">[1,081]</a></sup> Decapitation was the most common form of execution, but oher methods were also practiced: 'The kindred and—with the rise of territorial Chiefs and territorial Jurisdiction—the community as a body were thought possibly to suffer for the ritualistic offence of its individual members. It was—I hazard the opinion—to such a belief that we can trace the creation of that important category of offences which have been dealt with in this volume under the heading of ‘Tribal Taboos’ ( Oman Akyiwadie), the punishment for the violation of which was death, inflicted not by the supernatural agency that had been outraged, but by man. At first, I believe, the death penalty was the only corporal sanction which the higher central authority inflicted. This form of punishment later became modified by the march of economic events. Instead of being executed a man might ‘buy his head’, or he might be enslaved or banished, or suffer some minor mutilation. The sanctions at the disposal of the highest authority also included some that are beyond the [Page 375] bounds of our civilized secular community to enforce. They included not only reprisals upon the living, but the punishment of the dead. The defunct criminal in Ashanti was never quite beyond the arm of the law. He might, as we have seen, be decapitated, or he might be denied the essential funeral obsequies, including burial.' <sup id="cite_ref-1082" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1082">[1,082]</a></sup> 'I shall close this brief chapter—brief because the subject with which it deals has already been set forth in the pages which comprise this and its kindred volumes—with a list of the common corporal sanctions which were once in the power of the central authority to inflict.' <sup id="cite_ref-1083" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1083">[1,083]</a></sup> 'Perhaps the commonest form of capital punishment was for the victim to have his or her head cut off with a small knife. Many of the old executioners' knives which I have seen appear to have been bread or carving knives imported from Europe. The executioner or executioners, for he generally had his young assistants, having seized his man, either proceeded to decapitate him by cutting from the front of the neck, and working back, or ‘if he did not wish to look upon his victim's face, he would hold the head down and slice or saw through the neck, commencing at the back’.' <sup id="cite_ref-1084" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1084">[1,084]</a></sup> 'A sepow knife would almost invariably have first been thrust through the cheeks in order to prevent the criminal from ‘blessing the Chief’. This form of decapitation might follow the preliminaries described in a previous volume and known as Atopere. Only the Asante Hene (King of Ashanti) and the great paramount Chiefs had power to inflict capital punishment. A Birempon of a Head-Chief or a Safohene (Elder or war captain) who did so, even in the case of a slave, without the permission of his Head-Chief, would have been guilty of murder and liable, at least, to destoolment or a very heavy fine. The King and Paramount Chiefs of Divisions alone ‘held the knife’ ( Ono owo sekan). A Birempon of a Divisional Head-Chief might, it is true, have had his own abrafo (executioners), but they could not ply their trade without the permission of the Head-Chief. This right of a Paramount Divisional Chief to inflict capital punishment extended also only to his own subjects, and not even to all of these, for, without the permission of the Asante Hene, a Divisional Head-Chief might not execute his own Safohene, Birempon, princes, or Adehye (blood members of the royal family). [Page 376] Certain other persons were, as we have seen, also entirely exempt from capital punishment. Decapitation was not the only way in which a person might be killed. The death sentence might also have been carried out by the following methods: ( a) Strangling ( Abomporo). Ahenkwa (young ‘palace’ attendants), heralds; Safohene (war captains); Adehye (kindred of the ruling house); wives of a Chief, killed or volunteering to die on the death of their master, were generally executed in this fashion. The idea was to avoid distasteful mutilation or the shedding of blood. The strangling was sometimes performed with a leather thong or done by the hands of the executioners ( bu no kon). ( b) Clubbing ( Abaporowa). This method of dispatch was also used for young ‘palace’ attendants; a pestle was sometimes the form of club employed, or the tusk of an elephant (where the victim was of royal blood).' <sup id="cite_ref-1085" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1085">[1,085]</a></sup> 'Witches were also sometimes clubbed instead of being burned, strangled, or drowned. The last-named form of punishment was known euphemistically as ‘crossing the river’ ( asu twa).' <sup id="cite_ref-1086" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1086">[1,086]</a></sup> Mutilation, flogging and castration were also practiced: 'Mutilation.

This was probably resorted to to obtain recruits for the posts of eunuchs in the various royal harems. A concrete case was given, which is as follows: ‘Two young boys were playing together when one “abused” the other by saying, Owonta! (begetter of twins). The boy who was called this retaliated by “swearing the great oath” that he had never yet even had sexual intercourse with any woman.

<dl><dd> <b>♠ The state regulates banking ♣ absent ♥</b> Note: Cultivation systems varied with local ecology: 'The different ecological zones have given rise to contrasting types of agriculture. In the north the main subsistence and cash crop is yams, followed by guinea corn; by 1950 there still had not been any large-scale development of export crops. In the south, a much larger variety of subsistence crops are grown, especially yams, cocoyams, manioc, and maize. Also, there has been widespread development of major commercial crops such as the kola-nut and cocoa, which has become the main economic activity in the southern zone. In former times, until the end of the nineteenth century, farm work was done by servile labor: slaves, pawns, and various kinds of servants. Today sharecropping and hired labor are the most prevalent, although domestic peonage is still common. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-1105" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1105">[1,105]</a></sup> While the rural population consisted primarily of farmers and craftsmen, the towns offered a more diverse labor market: 'The Kumasi Central Market is among the largest in West Africa and lies at the center of a vast market region. Traders, wholesalers, distributors, transporters, and retailers make up a complex network of exchanges, which are bolstered by a variety of kin, ethnic, and local ties. Commodity chiefs control the wholesale end of the business regulating prices. In the early nineteenth century men moved into commercial farming, leaving women to run the markets. [IS]' <sup id="cite_ref-1106" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1106">[1,106]</a></sup> 'But by the late eighteenth century the capital, Kumase, and several other major centers of local administration - Bekwae, Dwaben, Kokofu, and Mampon, for example - had come to offer a wide range of employment opportunities other than farming: in court, in the civil and military administrations, in business, in crafts, and so forth. In the early nineteenth century Kumase was already a town of about 20,000 people, few of whom were directly engaged in food production.' <sup id="cite_ref-1107" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1107">[1,107]</a></sup> Craft specializaton was also present:  'The Ashanti are noted for their expertise in a variety of specialized crafts. These include weaving, woodcarving, ceramics, and metallurgy. Weaving is a highly developed craft, with dozens of standardized and named textile designs. Weaving in cotton and silk is of a technically and aesthetically high order, and much commerce is built around it. Woodcarvings have also become a valuable commodity, especially with the rise of the tourist trade in the late twentieth century. Woodcarving is divided into many branches, each with its own specialists. Among the major products are wooden sculptures of outstanding artistic quality, talking-drums (NTUPANE), and the famous wooden "stools," which are symbolic and ritual objects rather than items of furniture.' <sup id="cite_ref-1108" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1108">[1,108]</a></sup> 'One of the most specialized crafts is metallurgy. Traditionally, Ashanti metal smiths worked in iron, brass, bronze, silver, and gold. Agricultural implements and other metal utensils were made of iron. Using a lost-wax process, smiths cast brass and bronze gold weights (MRAMMUE) of geometric, human, or animal forms. Although these objects are now mainly of interest to art collectors, their original function was practical; they were standard weights used to measure gold dust. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-1109" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1109">[1,109]</a></sup> 'Craft production was an individual undertaking, and apprentice craftsmen were more often sons than sisters' sons. There were concentrations of certain crafts in certain villages, which were founded with war captives or refugees. Among these were settlements in the Kumase district such as Bonwire (cloth weaving), Ntonso (cloth dyeing), Pankrono (pottery), Ahwia (woodworking), and Breman and Adum (metalworking). Blacksmithery and joinery which catered to the needs of cultivators were scattered throughout the kingdom (Bowdich 1819, Dupuis 1824, Freeman 1967 [1898]). The crafts concerned with the elaboration of regalia were located in the immediate neighbourhood of the state capitals and the imperial capital of Kumasi (Rattray 1927: 216-308; Arhin 1982). Craft practitioners owned their own tools, and the factors that conditioned production were agricultural demand and state requirements.' <sup id="cite_ref-1110" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1110">[1,110]</a></sup> Trade was also important: 'There were early cultural and commercial links with the empires of the southern Sahara. The major commodities exchanged were gold from the Akan region and salt from the Sahara. The main Akan trading town was Bighu (Bitu) with links to Jenne on the Niger bend. Trade in gold and slaves formed the commercial basis of the traditional Ashanti state. Kola-nuts were also exported to the north. Today cocoa is Ghana's main export commodity. [IS]' <sup id="cite_ref-1111" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1111">[1,111]</a></sup> While some occupational mobility was present, Ashanti did not have an industrial economy at the time.

According to SCCS variable 18 'Credit Source' while 'Internal money lending specialists' are present, 'External money lending specialists; and 'Banks or comparable institutions' are not present. Barter probably continued into the colonial period, at least on the local level. Units of gold dust wwere adopted as currency: 'At least from the beginning of the 18th century on, the Asante economy was growing, as is shown in the adoption of units of gold dust as currency in the territories of the Asante Union in the reign of Osei Tutu, 1712 (Reindorf 1895:17). In the absence of the kinds of descriptions of the Asante area that were made by European and other travellers to Kumasi in the 19th century, it is impossible to detail this growth. One can only suggest that what visitors reported in the first half of the 19th century represented its culmination.' <sup id="cite_ref-1112" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1112">[1,112]</a></sup> Cowries were also used: ‘Tramma means literally cowries, the small shells from the Indian Ocean which, by the route from the north, found their way all over West Africa, and to this day may be seen used for small change in the native markets.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1113" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1113">[1,113]</a></sup> There was a state treasury at the court in Kumasi: 'The Kumase treasury was strictly organised.

It has been estimated that this contained 11,340 kg of gold when full, worth about £1,500,000 at nineteenth-century rates. The gold was stored in cloth bundles of given values, and the chest was under the direct care of the Gyaasewahene who, according to an early source, held the only key to the room where it was kept. [...] Smaller containers held lesser quantities of gold for use in everyday court business. Sums of gold were also apparently kept with the royal skeletons at the Bantama mausoleum. Gold was handled on a day-to-day basis by a group of officials under the Fotosanfohene who was responsible for weighing sums in or out as required. Withdrawals were recorded simply: a cowrie shell was put aside for every peredwan (approximately 70 g) of gold-dust removed. The state's wealth was great: there is some reason to believe that the war chest taken on the 1820s' campaign before the battle of Kantamanso contained about £500,000 in gold-dust.' <sup id="cite_ref-1114" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1114">[1,114]</a></sup> However, we have found no evidence of a banking system.

It was a system well suited for measuring, say, cloth, or for laying out the foundations of a house. It was of no use for determining how far a town or village was from Kumase. Distance had to be described in terms of time, and speed was a critical variable' <sup id="cite_ref-1115" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1115">[1,115]</a></sup> Wilks suggests that space was mentally represented in the terminology of travel time rather than spatial area: 'Asante armies sometimes campaigned beyond the frontier. They did so, for example, in 1840-1844. But the reach of government, its ano, was recognized as less than that of the military. The former was fixed - [unavailable]hyε - at a notional twenty days from Kumase. The mental map of Greater Asante as a month reflected, it may be supposed, a rational recognition of reality: that without any major change in the speed of communications, no lands more distant than a month from Kumase, in and out, could effectively be administered even though they might be subdued for the duration of a campaign.' <sup id="cite_ref-1116" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1116">[1,116]</a></sup> Gold dust was measured with brass weights: 'Gold was handled on a day-to-day basis by a group of officials under the Fotosanfohene who was responsible for weighing sums in or out as required.

Geometric weights outnumber representational ones by perhaps ten or fifteen to one. A few weights were made by adapting an existing object of roughly the right mass: beads, bits of European brass, or brass castings from groups near Asante, or seeds, especially those of the Abrus pecatorius bush ( damma). [...] The basic equipment was simple. The dust was weighed in a simple set of beam scales ( nsania). A weight ( abramo[unknown]) was placed in one pan and the gold-dust in the other, usually with a sheet-brass spoon ( saawa). Impurities in the gold could be removed by placing it in a sort of scoop ( famfa) and blowing across it. Gold-dust was usually kept in tied twists of cloth placed in small brass boxes ( adaka ketewa, abampuruwa), occasionally in quills plugged at the open end.' <sup id="cite_ref-1118" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1118">[1,118]</a></sup> We have assumed that this constitutes a form of state-led standardization of weights and measures.</dd>

Writing about the pre-Ashanti period, Sarbah mentions urban storage facilities: 'On the 21st of February he sent one of his men with attendants to King Abaan, whose town was about four leagues up-country, where was stored a large quantity of corn and millet. This town is described to be as large as the London of that period. It was guarded every night, and to warn the watchmen, cords were stretched across the roads and paths leading to it. Attached to the cords were bells, which give the alarm. In addition to these cords, nets were hung over the few entrances, and were so contrived as to fall on any person endeavouring to steal into the town. Four hours after their arrival in the morning, these men were sent for by the king at nine o'clock, “for there may no man come to him before he be sent for,” nor was it customary in that country to offer their presents to the ruler until they had visited him thrice. On the last visit, after the king had accepted their presents, he drank palm-wine with them. The king, we are informed, used a cup of gold, and when he drank, the people cried all with one voice, “Abaan, Abaan,” with certain other words. “The king drinks; and when he had drunk, then they gave drink to every one, and that done, the king licensed them to depart; and every one that departeth from him boweth three times towards him, and waveth with both hands together, as they bow and do depart. The king hath commonly sitting by him eight or ten ancient men with grey beards.”' <sup id="cite_ref-1120" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1120">[1,120]</a></sup> Sarbah also speaks of quasi-feudal arragements in some Akan polities prior to Ashanti rule: 'In the Fanti system allegiance is personal, but in the Asanti it is personal and territorial combined. ‡ The head ruler is not necessarily the owner of any land in his jurisdiction; e.g., Ohene Tchibu, of Asin Yankumasi, owns no land, and is a tenant of Abesibro, his captain; so also is Ohene Aka Ayima, of Beyin in Appolonia, by the [Page 25] judgment of Mr. Justice Nicoll, declared to own no land in his district-at least he did not lead evidence to show the land in question was his. In the case of Ohene Tchibu, the explanation is, that his ancestors fled to Fantiland for protection from the north side of the Pra in the kingdom of Asanti. The greater part of the Asinfu settled on lands within the jurisdiction of the head ruler of Abura, who became their feudal superior. * Many of the Asinfu continued to work on their lands across the river Pra, and held them. Among such is Akessi of Fumsu, until, by an order of the Executive Council of Gold Coast, an arbitrary boundary was fixed, and the possessions of the Asinfu, Denkerafu, and others, trans-Pra and trans-Ofin, were declared Asanti territory in the district of Adansi, and this in spite of the fact that Yamsu village, the stool of which was the subject of the case, Ghambra v. Ewea, † is situate on the Adansi side of the Ofin.' <sup id="cite_ref-1121" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1121">[1,121]</a></sup> We have assumed this to be true of the Ashanti period as well, given the cultivation of plantations around towns housing rulers and other elites.

These shrines are important in regulating social behaviour. A person may invoke the shrine in an oath, an extra-judicial outlet for emotions.

Singing, long preaching and praying, and at some centres speaking in tongues precedes it. The congregation is made to participate in the proceedings. They may pray aloud each to his own words, the sound being like the roaring of surf. They are “welded” together into a sort of power-field by laying-on of hands by an officiating prophet who is in a trance under the influence of the Holy Spirit. Palm-branches may be given to the congregation. At another prophet's centre people queue up, sing and are sprinkled with holy water. This they carefully rub in, the women opening up their blouses so as to present their breasts to the precious liquid. Then they are given some of the holy water to drink. During this lengthy process the prophet moves around and inspires the singing and drumming of the band, until the whole congregation, gently swaying, has coalesced into one mystical body. This conveys to the devotee a feeling of security and importance. Only after these preparations does the actual direct treatment begin. This may consist of a symbolic rubbing in of holy oil on the front, the ears, the toes and the hands of the patient, thus symbolizing the healing power of Christ over the five senses and the whole of life. The prophet massages liniment and holy water on his patients<sup id="cite_ref-1125" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1125">[1,125]</a></sup> 'Exorcism. After a long service (preaching, announcement, testimony of an old woman said to have been raised from the dead, ordination of ministers for his church) the prophet announced that the evil spirits would now be driven out. A group of church officers and priests busied themselves gathering particulars from about forty men, women and children all eager to confess and to have their supposed witch spirits evicted. They were all lined up in rows, facing “towards Sierra Leone”. Anyone who happened to be looking in the Sierra Leone direction was warned to keep out of the way for a while lest the fleeing spirits might possess one of them. The congregation struck a hand-clapping hymn, accompanied by a band, and in this way obviously built up the psychological pressure on the “witches”, who had already been instructed to kneel down. The prophet and one or two priests moved among them, here and there putting one hand on the head of a witch, and pointing with the other in the direction of “Sierra Leone”, commanding the witch spirit to go there. Some of the witches began to tremble under the psychic stress, and this was taken as a sign that the unclean spirits were beginning to feel uneasy in their bodies. Those spirits who persisted in resisting the prophet's influence shook their owners so severely that they fell writhing on the ground, and remained there quivering for some time. In such severe cases, the prophet or one of his assistants would sprinkle holy sand on them, particularly on their shaking limbs. By close observation, the prophet established the exact spot on limbs or head through which the witch spirit had departed. This danger point was anointed with holy oil and sacred sand to provide special protection against the counter attack. When the treatment was over, the patients lay supine like so many corpses. They were soaked by a rainstorm which had set in during the process of exorcism, and more sand was laid on to symbolize their “burial”, because they were considered as ritually “dead and buried with Christ”, so the prophet told me. Not all the witches, however, reacted so violently as this, more than half of them remained kneeling and shook only moderately or not at all. “Their witch spirits are not so bad and leave earlier” I was told. The ceremony eventually came to an end. Those “dead and buried” were “raised up to new life” by the prophet or one of the priests who pulled them to their feet. Some, however, were so far gone in their stupor that they could not be reawakened to consciousness so easily, and were carried off to the adjoining rooms.'<sup id="cite_ref-1126" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1126">[1,126]</a></sup> We are unsure whether Christian missionaries provided medical services.

<p><b>♠ State pensions for elites ♣ absent ♥</b> The time period in question was characterized by a trend towards greater bureaucratization and functional specialization: 'State organisation became extremely complex in the Kumasi state because at the close of the 17th century it became the capital of the union of Asante states and, in the course of the following century, the seat of an empire which was roughly coterminous with the boundaries of modern Ghana and southeastern Ivory Coast (Wilks 1975: 374-86). The expansion of the state made necessary administrative reforms within Kumasi itself and for the maintenance of effective relations between the Asantehene, the head of the Asante Union and, by consent, also the head of the Kumasi state, and the heads of the conquered territories. The palace administration ( gyase) was expanded with appointive headships of innumerable functional units or palace associations ( afekuo, sing. fekuo) (Rattray 1929: 81-92; Wilks 1967: 214-28; Hagan 1971). The memberships of the palace associations, each of which had either military or nonmilitary functions, cut across the divisions, so that they formed checks on, and counterpoises to, the traditional power units. The heads of the most important of the palace associations, including the units assigned to the offspring of former and reigning Asantehene (Busia 1951: 95), were included in the state council. Since appointments to the headships of the palace associations were in the gift of the Asantehene, the administrative reform represented an intrusion of patrimonialism (Weber 1947: 347) into the traditional political organisation.' <sup id="cite_ref-1127" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1127">[1,127]</a></sup> The purpose of this new administrative structure was to 'enforce subordination of the conquered rulers to the Asantehene. For this purpose the Asante kings used an administrative staff recruited from their gyase, household organization, consisting of units of functionaries with appointive headships [...] These palace associations, called afekuo (Reondorf, 1895: 119; Rattray, 1929: 91), were recruited from free attendants, warcaptives, purchased slaves (nnonkofo), and other bondsmen; in other words, persons connected by “ties of personal loyalty” (Weber, 1947: 342) to the various Asante Kings.' <sup id="cite_ref-1128" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1128">[1,128]</a></sup> Senior public functionaries had a stool system of their own: 'In Kumasi proper there were seventy-seven stools, representing seventy-seven public functionaries, as, for example, the Bantuma Chief, or the Chief of the Royal Burial Grove, the Ateni Chief, or the Chief of the Lamplighters.' <sup id="cite_ref-1129" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1129">[1,129]</a></sup> Appointed officials and other dependents increasingly displaced the hereditary authority of 'traditional' public functionaries: 'From Opoku Ware (1720-50) to Kwaku Duah (1834-67), these personal dependants competed with, and replaced the holders of hereditary authority, occupants of royal stools ( adehye nnwa), in Kumasi and in the component states of the Asante Union in the exercise of authority and the collection of tribute and other payments in the conquered territories. Wilks (1967: 211-214) has called this administrative organization the “Kwadwoan revolution” on the ground that it took firm root in the reign of Osei Kwadwo (1864-77) although it began in that of Opoku Ware, and has identified it as the emergence of Asante “bureaucracy”.' <sup id="cite_ref-1130" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1130">[1,130]</a></sup> Some foreigners were employed in highly specialized roles: 'A form of treasury partly staffed by literate Muslims was created.

The myth explaining the origin of the festival states that when the Techiman-Bono people came from the cavern at Amowi, Onyame pointed out forest yams (aha bayere). Seeing that bush pigs and elephants had eaten some of the yams, they cooked a few and saw that the yam was good food. They gave some to their chief, who also enjoyed it. After that, they began to celebrate on an annual basis the day on which they first found yams. After their chief died, they fed his soul (saman) yams on the same day. Later the Bono began to plant yams, and the yam became the most important staple in the Bono diet. Every farmer celebrates the festival to thank Onyame after the harvest. The living and the deceased are all invited to share in the abundance. Every Bono chief and priest celebrates a yam festival, but before the celebrations begin, a man from the village of Kenten whose title is Akokohwedeε (woodhen) first tastes the yam. When he sees that the yam is ripe, early in the morning on the traditional day called Fodwo he informs the god Taa Mεnsah that the yam is ready to be prepared for εto (mashed yams mixed with palmoil).' <sup id="cite_ref-1135" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1135">[1,135]</a></sup>//'The Taa Mεnsah deity celebrates his yam festival on Fodwo, a Monday. The new yam is hung from rafters in the shrine room for some weeks before the Akokohwedeε comes to taste it. After the yam is hung, children may begin to eat new yam and the elders can [Page 57] [Page 58] begin to eat aso bayere (one species of yam). In the evening on Fodwo, the god Taa Mεnsah is prepared to eat yam after being carried on the main street from one end of the town to the other end three times and consulted. After this, the god informs the manhene that he is about to eat yam and the manhene gives the god permission to eat the yam. The manhene sends a yam to the god and it is always this yam which is cooked as εto and placed on the shrine. The next day, Tuesday, the manhene sends a sheep and wine to the god.' <sup id="cite_ref-1136" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1136">[1,136]</a></sup>//'Two weeks after the Taa Mεnsah Yam Festival, the yam festivals for the Queenmother, the Adontenhene, and the Nifahene are celebrated on a Monofie, a Friday. Nwonakusie, a Thursday, is the yam festival day for the Twafohene, the Adaatihene, the Akyeamehene, the Konkontiwahene, and the Krontihene. Fofie, another Friday, is the yam festival day for the manhene, the Gyaasehene, the Ankbeahene, and the Barimhene. The manhene provides about six sheep and a cow for his own yam festival. These are sacrificed, the blood being spilled on the ancestral stools; the meat is cooked and distributed.' <sup id="cite_ref-1137" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1137">[1,137]</a></sup>// The Apo Festival was celebrated annually and included carnivalesque elements: 'Many festivals exist among the Akan; their foundations and functions are found in the traditional religion. The Apo festival is celebrated yearly among the Brong; it is a feast of eight days duration in which complete lampooning liberty (in the form of song) of both superiors and inferiors (without punishment) is given. The people explain that if one's sunsum is hurt, the body becomes ill; often ill health is caused by evil and the hatred another person may have for you. In like manner, if you have a hatred for someone, it affects your own sunsum, so this time is set aside to allow any man to tell any other man what has offended him. This frees the spirit, and both sunsum become relaxed. During this festival there is theoretical sexual license; this isn't really taken [Page 33] [Page 34] advantage of since traditional court action can be initiated after the eight day festival. Punishment is therefore deferred until the rites are over. Should an aggrieved party take action he forfeits the right to investigation, to satisfaction, and he is also heavily fined. During this period all the priests and priestesses of the area are present with their shrines; they touch each shrine with every other one to re-establish communications which might have been lost. The major gods are taken to the river and cleansed of all evil. On the eighth day everyone makes a concerted effort to drive all evil from the area. Around twenty-five distinct Apo songs are sung, and there is a specific Apo dance for the festival.' <sup id="cite_ref-1138" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1138">[1,138]</a></sup>//Purification is a major element in the rituals performed: 'The festival period is, in fact, a period of coming together in which the people from all over the Techiman traditional area, including well-wishers and invitees from other states, meet in the capital to display the traditional Bono culture through singing, dancing, and drumming. The manhene and his elders, through the Barimhene, purify the soul of King Ameyaw (the chief defeated by the Asante in 1723), adorn his grave with the royal regalia of the incumbent manhene, recall the deeds that Ameyaw performed for the State (man), and present drinks, sheep, and food to his soul and those of the other ancestral chiefs of the Techiman-Bono State. Finally, the Apo is a period during which the shrines of various gods and goddesses are purified. The shrine of the main deity in Techiman Township, Taa Kεse (Taa Mεnsah), is, at this time, purified at the River Agyentoamu during the last hour of the celebration; this serves as a sign of the completion of the Apo Festival.' <sup id="cite_ref-1139" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1139">[1,139]</a></sup>//The festival also served as a check on authority and as a forum for the resolution of mutual resentment: 'The functions of the Apo festival seem to be four: (1) psychological release, (2) a forum for public opinion, (3) a means to periodically check those in authority, (4) a method of enforcing sanctions of behaviour.' <sup id="cite_ref-1140" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1140">[1,140]</a></sup> According to Warren, the restoration of amicable relations is one of the major purposes of the festival: 'This festival allows every person resident in Techiman Traditional State, without regard to class, creed, ethnic group, or race, eleven days of liberty to lampoon, in the form of songs and proverbs, the faults and malpractices of any other person, including those in authority-especially the manhene and his divisional chiefs. In addition, the people may sing the praises of those in authority in appreciation of worthy achievements so as to encourage them to even greater deeds. During this period it is strictly forbidden to fight in any way. The emphasis of the festival is upon the removal of bitterness and misfortune in the State. After all personal grudges, faults, and hatreds are sung and spoken out amicably, the end result is renewed peace and harmony among the Techiman inhabitants; the spirit (sunsum) of the [Page 56] state is cleansed after all the unspoken interpersonal bitternesses are voiced.' <sup id="cite_ref-1141" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1141">[1,141]</a></sup> While chiefs and priests played a prominent role during festivals, we have found no evidence of 'public funding'.

It has always seemed to me that the purpose of the minstrels' songs is to remind the king of his incomparable pedigree relative to those of his audience and also to encourage him in ‘manly and heroic’ deeds, — as the praise poems put it — so that he can carry out the necessary acts of state. Such acts include passing death sentences, stripping erstwhile court favourites of their authority and wealth, and declaring wars.

Chiefs appear anxious for their sons to learn all they can at the schools available so that their progeny may be in a position to compete with literate coast people and no longer remain at the mercy of alien clerks.' <sup id="cite_ref-1160" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1160">[1,160]</a></sup> 'Many more schools were opened by the Missions in the ten years between 1914 and 1924.

Adinkra are used extensively in fabrics, pottery, logos and advertising. They are incorporated into walls and other architectural features. Fabric adinkra are often made by woodcut sign writing as well as screen printing. Adinkra symbols appear on some traditional akan gold weights. The symbols are also carved on stools for domestic and ritual use. [...] Akan oral tradition dates the arrival of adinkra among the Akan to the end of the 1818 Asante-Gyaman War. However, the Englishman Thomas Edward Bowdich collected a piece of adinkra cloth in 1817, which demonstrates that adinkra art existed before the traditional starting date.[2] Bowdich obtained this cotton cloth in Kumasi, a city in south-central Ghana. The patterns were printed using carved calabash stamps and a vegetable-based dye. The cloth features fifteen stamped symbols, including nsroma (stars), dono ntoasuo (double Dono drums), and diamonds. It is now in the British Museum.' <sup id="cite_ref-1163" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1163">[1,163]</a></sup> Other kinds of mnemonic devices were also in use: 'Oral creators also attached their texts to material objects. A particular tree or rock could serve as the starting point for a narrative that was associated with this landmark. In the Asante kingdom in Ghana, an elaborate material culture was developed which filled the social space with verbal texts: the finials on chiefs' ceremonia lumbrellas embodied proverbs; gold-weights -small brass figurines used to weigh gold dust in the extensive trading networks centered on the Asanta kingdom- were often designed to represent sayings or epithets relating to the owner; adinkra symbols, also evoking proverbs and other verbal formulations, were carved into wooden prestige objects and metal jewellery, and stamped on cloth. Across West Africa, cloth carried woven, dyed or appliquéd symbols that alluded to oral texts. [...] Thus the Asante gold-weight showing two leopards might call to mind different proverbs [...] And most proverbs can be interpreted in more than one way.' <sup id="cite_ref-1164" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1164">[1,164]</a></sup> The Akan had 'officialized' oral traditions about lineage ancestors and past royal exploits: 'Every Akan state has official custodians of its history.

The herald is present at all state occasions and has thereby become a storehouse of knowledge about public affairs; the drummer ‘drums’ the history of the state on public occasions; and the executioner is a policeman, a protocol officer and a bard (Wilks, 1967: 231).' <sup id="cite_ref-1165" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1165">[1,165]</a></sup> Akan languages were written down by early missionaries and native elites: 'Twi is a tonal language and, since missionary work during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, has been written in Roman script' <sup id="cite_ref-1166" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1166">[1,166]</a></sup> 'Akan languages started to be written down, mainly in religious publication, by Danish, German and British missionaries during the 17th and 18th centuries.'<sup id="cite_ref-1167" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1167">[1,167]</a></sup> Some members of the elite were educated by missionaries, but the majority of the population remained illiterate during the period in question: 'Towards the end of the century the use of written records and communications had made some headway.

<dd> <b>♠ Endemic malnutrition ♣ present ♥</b> Accordingy to Wilks, a typical family farm was sufficient to support a household: 'The view of Asante agriculturalists that a typical farm of between two and three acres will support a family of five has been cited above. This observation may now be tested, and the model of the rural economy be developed further. Recent investigations of the food consumption of Asante farmers indicate an average daily intake of 3.86 pounds per person, with an energy value of 1,773 calories. Of these totals, about 80 percent of the daily intake by weight is from the five staples, and about 77 percent by calorific value. In table 3 the average daily intake of each of the five staples is shown, and the total requirement for five persons over three years is computed. The assumption may reasonably be made that patterns of food consumption at least in rural areas have not changed significantly in recent times: it has already been noted, for example, that the same staples have been grown certainly since the early nineteenth century. Tables 2 and 3, derived from different sets of data, are then comparable, both being relevant to the traditional economy. Several observations may be offered. First, it would seem that the produce of a one-hectare field is more than adequate to support a family of five. Second, however, allowances must be made for ordinary loss of crops through disease, storms, or damage from animals (whether wild or domestic). Third, allowance must also be made for a fall in yields as a result of an extraordinary failure of the rains, for example, or of a drop in soil fertility through inadequacy of the fallow or of an insufficiency of labor through death, illness, or the like. It might seem, then, that the one-hectare field is indeed appropriate to the support of a family of five, adequate even in the bad year and yielding a small surplus of food (which might either rot on the farm or be bartered locally) in the good year. The model of the Asante rural economy developed here would thus exemplify a general feature of successful ecosystems, that communities adapt not to usual but to unusual conditions.' <sup id="cite_ref-1187" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1187">[1,187]</a></sup> Women typically extended inter-birth intervals in order to avoid malnutrition in their children: 'According to Bono values, it is considered unwise for a birth to follow a preceding birth too soon. After a woman gives birth, the minimal period before she should get pregnant again is a year; usually a two-year interval between the birth and a succeeding pregnancy is considered desirable. After a first-born child, the mother is to abstain from sexual intercourse for at least six months; after succeeding births a 40-day period is deemed sufficient. There are no legal sanctions which can be brought against a couple who do not respect the one to two year period during which a succeeding pregnancy should not take place, although a woman who bears children in rapid succession is called ntetewa and it will be said of her, “ [unavailable]wo ntetewaa,” “she bears children in close succession.” Since children are breast fed for several years, a newly born child following a preceding birth too closely will put a strain on the mother and result in nutritional deficiency in both children. Often the older child becomes neglected, resulting in various degrees of kwashiorkor. The traditional explanation for this condition is that the older child becomes jealous of the younger one.' <sup id="cite_ref-1188" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1188">[1,188]</a></sup> However, Field's material seems to indicate that malnutrition was common even in the 20th century: 'In general the concept of good nourishment is virtually absent: it is known, of course, that life cannot be preserved without food, but the dependence of health on the quality of food is not appreciated. That food is transformed by physiological processes into body substance is too materialistic an idea to be entertained. A woman came from a village to my clinic bringing four children and asking for medicine because “their bodies were weak”. And indeed they were: their limbs were but little sticks and they could hardly walk for fatigue. I asked what food she gave them: she replied, cocoa-yam. I inquired what else, but there was nothing else. She was wholly unable to accept, or even consider the suggestion, that cocoa-yam was insufficient: she said they were “only children”. I always found it necessary when prescribing good food for convalescent children to diagnose a sulky kra which needed propitiation with pleasing food.' <sup id="cite_ref-1189" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1189">[1,189]</a></sup> Ffoulkes attributes infant mortality to malnutrition: 'With regard to children, infant mortality is great, owing principally to bad nourishment, fever, and smallpox.

<p><b>♠ Volunteering ♣ absent ♥</b>
</p><p><b>♠ Charity ♣ absent ♥</b> Cooperation among matrikin was common and expected: 'Two categories of matrikin who have invested in farms must be clearly distinguished: those who from the information might expect a return and those who do not. In addition, when considering rights and obligations of matrikin, we are looking both at individuals and at the matrilineage as a whole. Among the individuals are nephews working for their mothers' brothers while having no independent income of their own. Of the Dominase farmers, several were working with their sisters' sons on a permanent basis. Matrikin were also supervising work on bearing farms elsewhere, but these were more senior kinsmen who themselves had farms, and for them there was no question of expecting a direct return for assistance given. Among this second group of matrikin are mother's brothers and a large number of temporary assistants, who included mothers, sisters, a brother and sisters' sons. Most of the twelve male owners studied at Dominase had received assistance from this category, who were in a position to give rather than to receive. In a number of instances this was in the form of contacts, money, or land to make the venture possible in the first place. In some cases part of their financial backing came from the proceeds of farms which they had inherited and which were therefore lineage property. The position of this group can only be understood if account is taken of the corporate nature of descent groups and the sense of obligation existing between members, doing things for one another because they must, particularly men for their sisters' sons. A good mother's brother is expected to help his sisters' sons, thereby obliging the latter to reciprocate in the next generation either through their own sisters' sons or through other matrilineal dependants (Fortes, 1950). Returns are not always therefore related directly to inputs on farms. Three farmers had each made gifts of farms or land to matrikin which could not be related directly to inputs. One had purchased four pieces of land for the children of four sisters, and one [Page 177] for his oldest sister which was to have been for his own mother, who died before he was able to complete the project. A second had offered land to the adult offspring of his mother's sister. In the first case the only assistance he claimed to have received from matrikin was labour from a grand-nephew when he first arrived at Dominase; whereas the second man did rely financially on matrikin and used the proceeds of a family farm which he had inherited, although he had until then received little help from his grand-nephews. The third farmer said that he had purchased land for a brother who had not worked for him.' <sup id="cite_ref-1192" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1192">[1,192]</a></sup> However, this does not constitute charity. Families in need had recourse to wealthier relatives, but could not force the latter to support them: 'Mutual assistance within the lineage should be substantial, but it too stops far short of pooling. Even inherited lineage property clearly belongs to one individual heir, who should use it for the benefit of kin but has virtually unchallenged power to decide what uses will serve their long-term benefit. Relatives can ask for help without offense, and pressures from the abusua to agree can be intense, but this help cannot be compelled or assumed. Pleas to wealthier kin are based on needs, not rights, and one certainly cannot use their property as one's own.' <sup id="cite_ref-1193" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1193">[1,193]</a></sup>

Invariably the head of the family is not only the patriarch but also the social leader of that family or clan. Matches between marriageable youths are contracted under his personal advice; free consent of girl or boy to a marriage is only conditional on the sanction of the head of family. Dances are usually held within the family compound and when the youth of two or more families meet for some social purpose they do so under the aegis of the central head of those families. Society is more or less clannish in structure, and in proportion as the family tie is close, the youth of the family or tribe are constrained to model their social intercourse on the structure of the political or tribal units. Thus then starting from the highest structure in the State with the Omanhene as its head, we meet a descending scale of social institutions having some head or other who partakes of the hierarchy inherent in the supreme head. The town with a Chief or Odikro as political head has also a corresponding head for the social activities of the town. This head is directly under the Odikro or Chief, but in so far as members of his association are concerned, he is supreme as supremacy goes in the Akan institutional regime. There are several such institutions in every Akan state, and almost every town in an Akan state has a social association of young men with their own leaders called captains (Asafohene or Asafoatse) and lieutenants (Sripi). These Asafo companies as they are called have very definite functions in the political and social community wherein they are found, and as the host (Asafo) of all the young men in a town or state, they were in historical times the only disciplined association [Page 225] of able-bodied men who fought their country's battles in time of war and did yeoman service in time of peace.' <sup id="cite_ref-1196" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1196">[1,196]</a></sup> 'Thus, then, these Asafo Companies of young men are established with very different and diverse purposes, and their activities in recent years have given cause to much controversy as to whether they should be regarded as indispensable parts of the Akan constitution, or whether they are mere associations of young men working for their own immediate benefit and enjoyment. At one time, the rivalry between the different companies, the so-called “company fights”, became so serious that Government had to institute inquiries into the origin, constitution, and status of the Company System. The result of these inquiries did not make the contemplated abolition of the system necessary or practicable, and, for sociological purposes, the value of such associations admits of no cursory treatment.' <sup id="cite_ref-1197" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1197">[1,197]</a></sup> 'Mr. Casely Hayford deals with the Company System in his Native Institutions, but apparently he has in mind the relation between an Asafo Company and the Chief of a town or division, or between the Government and the Company System. He does not, however, lose sight of the fact that the Asafo Companies are the backbone of the country. Such a company in a town consists really of the whole male inhabitants of a town or village, exclusive only of boys under sixteen or seventeen, and of the Councillors in a Chief's Tribunal. They form a strong body of commons who, besides other duties, have also a distinct voice in the enstoolment or destoolment of local Chiefs. Without them, the governments of the Akan nations would not have that glamour of liberal sanction which makes the government of any free people at once orderly and democratic.' <sup id="cite_ref-1198" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1198">[1,198]</a></sup> 'The Asafo Companies have assumed different forms in successive ages. First there is the company which for services rendered to the town or country in time of war or of peace, has been raised to a status which entitles it to participate in the direct government of the town or country. This is effected by making the Company's captain or leader a Captain-on-Stool ( Okonnuasoni). It should be observed that captains of Asafo companies have, as a fact, no stools, and until a Company captain is created as a stool-holding captain, the succession to the captaincy is always made by vote of the members. In the old days companies were usually formed not by the admixture of different members of various families, as is the case at present, but by a collection of the members of a single family, primarily for [Page 226] defensive and offensive purposes. This class of Asafo Companies is now extinct. They have all of them obtained statutory right to partake in the direct government of the town or country to which they belong.' <sup id="cite_ref-1199" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1199">[1,199]</a></sup> 'The form of the institution now in vogue consists of the young men of a town who have brought themselves together for social intercourse, and for the purpose of devoloping a unified national spirit.' <sup id="cite_ref-1200" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1200">[1,200]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Tribute ♣ present ♥</b> eHRAF provides a general description of the rise and fall of the Ashanti empire: 'In 1701, the Asantemanso under the leadership of Osei Tutu (d. 1717) rebelled and defeated the Denkyira. The Ashanti formed a confederacy of Akan groups, who acknowledged the authority of the Kumasi Stool. Under Osei Tutu's successor, Opoku Ware (1717-1764), the Confederacy conducted wars of expansion defeating the Wankyi (1711-12), Takyiman (Bono)(1722-3) and Akyem (1742). By the end of Opoku Ware's reign the Greater Asante covered an area nearly the size of present-day Ghana and included the states of Mampon, Beckwa, Insuta, Juabin, Kokofu, Adansi, Akropong Manasu, Asanti Akim, Awiku, and Mamponsu. Subsequent rulers, Osei Kwadwo (1764-1777) and Osei Tutu Kwame (1804-1823) strengthened their control of the region by bureaucratic and ideological means. Senior office holders were put in charge of various functions such as gold production, roads, porters, and the kola and ivory trades. Osei Tutu's head priest Anokye had devised a new system of authority symbolized by the Golden Stool, which was superimposed on the authority of the clans. Later another royal symbol, the Golden Elephant Tail, was added representing wealth. Now Big Men (ABEREMPON) could acquire wealth and power outside of the clan system. However, all acquired wealth was subject to a heavy death duty (AWUNNYADE) and ultimately returned to the King's treasury. The Dutch, Danes, and British followed the Portuguese to the Gold Coast. By the nineteenth century, the British were the dominant European power in the region and in 1827, British-led forces defeated an Ashanti army at Katammanso. In 1831, the British and the Ashanti signed a peace treaty that opened up all ports to trade. The Bond of 1844 gave British authorities jurisdiction over criminal matters in the districts surrounding the forts, however, an attempt to exact a poll tax in the surrounding districts failed. In 1868 Fanti clan leaders and educated elite convened to write the Mankessim Constitution and form the Fanti Confederacy. The leaders were quickly arrested and imprisoned for sedition. By 1872 the British had complete control of the coast after taking over the Dutch and Danish forts. When they did not recognize Ashanti sovereignty in the area, the Ashanti invaded. In 1874, British forces launched a counteroffensive and sacked Kumasi. In 1883 a general uprising led to the overthrow of the Ashanti chi ef Mensu Bonsu and four years of civil war (1884-1888). A faction representing mercantile interests prevailed, although an Imperial faction regained power in the following decade. This led to another war with the British, who again attacked Kumasi in 1895 and captured the Ashanti king and chiefs. The king and chiefs were exiled and in 1901 the whole region was declared a British possession.' <sup id="cite_ref-1205" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1205">[1,205]</a></sup> The Union founded after Osei Tutu's military victory against the Denkyira incorporated a set of allied sub-polities under the overall authority of the Asantehene based at Kumasi: 'In the aftermath of the Denkyira war the military coalition of states was transformed into a political union.' <sup id="cite_ref-1206" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1206">[1,206]</a></sup> For Hayford, this union was essentially a confederation of several 'imperia in imperio' under the paramount authority of the Asantehene: 'The Native State, in its highest development, is to be found where a number of considerably important communities combine and own allegiance to one central paramount Authority. Such Authority is the King, properly so called. Thus in Ashanti, before the breaking up of the Court at Kumasi, there were the Manpons, the Juabins, the Kokofus, the Beckwas, the Adansis, and several other large and important communities, owning allegiance to the stool of Kumasi as the paramount stool of all Ashanti. Each of these important communities, when regarded with respect to the entire State, was a sort of imperium in imperio-in fact, several distinct native states federated together under the same laws, the same customs, the same faith and worship, the people speaking the same language, and all owning allegiance to a paramount king or president, who represented the sovereignty of the entire Union.' <sup id="cite_ref-1207" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1207">[1,207]</a></sup> For Arhin, the 'official', confederated character of the Ashanti Union was being increasingly eroded during the time period in question, with the Asantehene seeking to concentrate power in Kumasi: 'Formally the Asante lived within a system of decentralized ‘patrimonialism’: that is to say, under the authority of hereditary rulers selected by the heads of the constituent units of the  oman, the localized matrilineages, the villages and the districts who were, in the main, a gerontocratic body. The members of the various units also enjoyed rights of use in land. But the political history of Asante, from the beginning of the eighteenth century to the eve of colonial rule, was the history of the erosion of these political and economic rights. It was a history of the increasing personalization of power at the expense of the holders of hereditary authority and also of commoners.' <sup id="cite_ref-1208" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1208">[1,208]</a></sup> Subject polities paid tribute to Kumasi: 'Greater Asante' was a conglomerate made up of sub-polities paying allegiance to Kumasi and tributary states: 'First, there was the Kumasi state, administered like any other Asante state by the Asantehene and his council members. Second, Kumasi, together with the neighbouring Asante-Twi-speaking states, formed the Asante Union, with a council consisting of the Asantehene, some members of the Kumasi state council, and the heads of the other Asante states. Third, there were the “provinces,” consisting of the other Twi-speaking peoples north and south of Asante. Fourth, there were the non-Twi-speaking protectorate and tributary states southeast and north of the Twi-speaking peoples.' <sup id="cite_ref-1209" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1209">[1,209]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Degree of taxation ♣ present ♥</b> Gold dust was taxed by the state. Chiefs also collected taxes in the form of tolls and 'death duties': '(a) Death Duties (Ayibuadie): Bowdich mentions that the King of Ashanti was ‘heir to the gold of every subject from the highest to the lowest’,  and thus, according to Ashanti custom, had to contribute to the funeral custom ‘to validate his claim’. This statement, however, requires considerable qualification. While it is correct to state that, theoretically, a Chief (or rather a Stool) would sooner or later become heir—within the strict limitation implied in the Ashanti meaning of the word—to all his subjects, the majority of such death duties were received by a Stool, indirectly. It has been observed that a Chief only has direct dealings with a minority of his subordinate Chiefs, e.g. with his own Mpanyimfo and with his own Birempon, and that these officials have numerous subjects of their own whom the Head-Chief only attempts to control through them. Let us suppose that a wealthy subject died, who happened to be under one of the Mpanyimfo of the Head-Chief's Birempon. The Opanyini would succeed to a specified amount of his subordinate's private personal [Page 108] movable assets, gold-dust, slaves, cloths, and such like. On the Opanyini's death, the Birempon would take a similar proportion of his estate. The Birempon's Head-Chief, i.e. the Head of the whole Territorial Division, would not get anything on these occasions. Later, however, when the Birempon himself died, the Head-Chief would benefit by receiving the death duties from his estate, which would thus include all that he, the Birempon, had collected and accumulated in death duties from his subjects. The potential wealth of Ashanti Chiefs might thus be very great, the amount of their immediately realizable securities very small. The late Mary Kingsley, whose writings on West Africa are remarkable for observation and intuition, wrote: ‘In the capacity (eventually) to command these things his wealth lies. So take the whole together and you will see how you can have a very rich African, who could not possibly pay down £20, but a real millionaire for all that.’ The unfairness of demanding great sums as war indemnities at very short notice, which had been the policy of some of our civil and military commanders in the wars against Ashanti, may thus be realized.' <sup id="cite_ref-1210" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1210">[1,210]</a></sup> 'It is necessary to understand that when, in Ashanti, we speak of a Chief taking part of a man's property on death, only his personal self-acquired movable property is meant. Family property, in the possession of the deceased, which on his death reverted to the family, might not be touched. The proportion of the property of a dead man taken by a Chief varied in specified cases, and this will be noted when the Constitution of individual Stools comes under examination. In this chapter I am concerned with general principles rather than with the more minute details. Ayibuadie means literally ‘something to cover over or help the funeral rite’. There is a word in the vernacular, muhoma (lit. that with which to bind the breasts), which has a significance very similar to ayibuadie. Instead of a Chief coming down upon the estate of a dead subject, i.e. sending his Sana Hene (Treasurer) to lock up his rooms and boxes until the value of the estate had been assessed, he might leave the amount to be paid in death duties to the discretion of the relatives of the deceased. The levy then assumed more the appearance of a voluntary contribution on their part, ‘to bind the breast of the Chief’, ‘whose heart was sore’ owing to the loss of his subject and friend. This method of allowing the death duty to be paid was a more delicate and tactful way of going about the collection of this tax than the other more forcible method, but it practically amounted to [Page 109] the same thing in the end. It must not be overlooked that the claim to receive ayibuadie or muhoma involved some special obligations on the part of the recipient. Both these claims may be traced back to the original cell from which most of these more elaborate customs sprang. The house-father succeeded to the property of his dead kinsman, but he also had to see to it that he gave him a good and proper funeral. By a legal fiction, the Chief stood in a similar relationship to his subject, and by taking some of the latter's property on his death placed himself under the fictitious obligation of having to contribute to his funeral custom. By doing so he did not, however, become liable for the debts of the deceased. A Chief would also take care to see that the balance struck between what came in from ayibuadie or muhoma and what went out in funeral contributions ( nsa or nsawa) was in his favour. There is yet another expression which is sometimes confused with the above, i.e. awunyadie. This term, I think, means the inheritance of property by the legal heir.' <sup id="cite_ref-1211" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1211">[1,211]</a></sup> 'Death duties ( Ayibuadie): The Chief claimed ayibuadie from those subjects who served him directly. He could claim all private property on death of any gyase who was descended down the female line from a gyase female slave. In the case of the descendant of a gyase man who had married a free woman (but a subject of the Chief), a male would enter that company to which his father had belonged, but at his death the Chief would claim only one half of his private belongings, the other half going to his own kindred. The Chief of Kumawu also claimed about two-thirds of the private property of the Heads of the following fekuo (the remaining third went to the Stool of the deceased), the Atum'tufo, Asoamfo, Asokwafo, Barimfo, Obofo, Samanfo, Sodofo. He received from his Mpanyimfo (on their death) a voluntary contribution made by the successor which was known as muhoma, and generally consisted of one of the deceased's wives, a male servant, a cloth, and some gold-dust. The taking of ayibuadie or muhoma implied an obligation to contribute towards the funeral expenses and to present gifts to the dead. In the case of a wealthy man, from whose estate a considerable amount had been received in death duties, this contribution might consist of a velvet pillow ( agopekyi), a silk danta (loin-cloth), in the folds of which was wrapped a suru of gold-dust (£1); 10 s. worth of gold-dust, to mix with the fat which was used to rub down the corpse; the coffin (which it has now become the custom for the children to buy); two or three [Page opp. p 230] [Page 230] cloths, which were buried with the body; a sheep and about 10 s. in gold-dust towards the funeral expenses. In the case of a poor man, the death duties from whose estate would be a small amount, the Chief would give a sheep and a cheap cloth, ‘lest if he did not give anything, the dead should report him to the ' Samanfo (spirits)’. [These obligations are still often observed, possibly from a superstitious dread of reprisals on the part of the dead; the corresponding right to demand ayibuadie, or to expect muhoma, has on the other hand almost entirely lapsed, and this state of affairs is often given as one of the reasons for the impoverished state of Stool finances.] The Chief also informed me of another interesting possible source of revenue in olden times of which I had not previously been aware, though it is possible the custom was not confined to one Division. When the Chief had a son or daughter ( by a wife who was at the same time his own subject), and that child died, the Chief succeeded to all his or her private property and not the child's abusua (kindred group) as would ordinarily be the case. Only a Head-Chief had this right, not the lesser Chiefs—the Mpanyimfo. This rule also applied to the children of the Kyidom Hene, because he was known as the ‘son’ of the Chief.' <sup id="cite_ref-1212" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1212">[1,212]</a></sup> 'In Wilks' analysis the ultimate guarantee that wealth made by commoners would not be retained by commoners was the system of inheritance taxes or death duties. Fines could be disastrous to the payer, but we need to know more about their frequency before accepting them as something approaching a general obstacle to private accumulation of wealth. Meanwhile the various levies on economic activity during the lifetime of the actor, which included tolls on trade routes and market places, reduced the rate of private self-enrichment but did not prevent it. No commodity was more heavily taxed than gold, and all nuggets beyond a certain size had to be surrendered to the Asantehene's treasury. Yet, even so, the treasury would return part of the [Page 21] value, in gold dust, to be divided between the local chief and the finder. Again, in most areas non-subjects of the local stool, and in some chieftaincies subjects themselves, were charged a rent of one- or two-thirds of their production of gold dust. So let us examine the impact of death duties. There were two categories, awunyadie and ayibuadie, but there is some disagreement amongst scholars over whether they related to the estates of subordinate chiefs and commoners respectively, or to movable and immovable property, respectively. The point at issue, however, is best presented through Wilks's quotation of Bowdich as follows: 'The King is heir to the gold of every subject, from the highest to the lowest … The King contributes to the funeral custom to validate his claim, and usually bestows ten periguins  of the gold dust on the successor (if of a rich man,) who is in all cases liable for the debts of the deceased, though the amount is generally made good to him sooner or later, if he has influence with those about the King, or recommends himself to his notice personally.' Thus the reality was less dramatic than the opening words suggest. Part of the estate went to the successor, on behalf of the matrilineage of the deceased. Indeed, the missing words in the first line of Wilks' quotation are: ‘the fetish gold and the cloths are generally presented by him to the successor to the stool, from which the slaves and other property of the deceased are inseparable’. The general point is that the treasury taxed the estates of commoners rather than seizing them. The usual rate seems to have varied between a third and a half of the value of the property concerned. Moreover, Wilks himself noted that ‘In practice it would seem that a small estate, of the ordinary farmer for example, was left intact, to be apportioned by the family of the deceased’, whereas the estates of government functionaries ‘were wholly at the disposal of the government’. If it were not the case that most inheritance proceeded within the matrilineage, it seems unlikely that Asante would have acquired a reputation in ethnography as a classic example of matrilineal inheritance. Moreover, a father could transmit some of his wealth to his son before the issue of death duties arose, by paying his son's marriage expenses, as did Kofi Pusuo's father, and/or by giving him a sum of money, for example as working capital for a long-distance trading expedition, with or without the agreement of the father's matrikin.' <sup id="cite_ref-1213" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1213">[1,213]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Wages ♣ ♥</b> Note: Cultivation systems varied with local ecology: 'The different ecological zones have given rise to contrasting types of agriculture. In the north the main subsistence and cash crop is yams, followed by guinea corn; by 1950 there still had not been any large-scale development of export crops. In the south, a much larger variety of subsistence crops are grown, especially yams, cocoyams, manioc, and maize. Also, there has been widespread development of major commercial crops such as the kola-nut and cocoa, which has become the main economic activity in the southern zone. In former times, until the end of the nineteenth century, farm work was done by servile labor: slaves, pawns, and various kinds of servants. Today sharecropping and hired labor are the most prevalent, although domestic peonage is still common.

Traders, wholesalers, distributors, transporters, and retailers make up a complex network of exchanges, which are bolstered by a variety of kin, ethnic, and local ties. Commodity chiefs control the wholesale end of the business regulating prices. In the early nineteenth century men moved into commercial farming, leaving women to run the markets.

In the early nineteenth century Kumase was already a town of about 20,000 people, few of whom were directly engaged in food production.' <sup id="cite_ref-1222" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1222">[1,222]</a></sup> Craft specializaton was also present:  'The Ashanti are noted for their expertise in a variety of specialized crafts. These include weaving, woodcarving, ceramics, and metallurgy. Weaving is a highly developed craft, with dozens of standardized and named textile designs. Weaving in cotton and silk is of a technically and aesthetically high order, and much commerce is built around it. Woodcarvings have also become a valuable commodity, especially with the rise of the tourist trade in the late twentieth century. Woodcarving is divided into many branches, each with its own specialists. Among the major products are wooden sculptures of outstanding artistic quality, talking-drums (NTUPANE), and the famous wooden "stools," which are symbolic and ritual objects rather than items of furniture.' <sup id="cite_ref-1223" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1223">[1,223]</a></sup> 'One of the most specialized crafts is metallurgy.

Using a lost-wax process, smiths cast brass and bronze gold weights (MRAMMUE) of geometric, human, or animal forms. Although these objects are now mainly of interest to art collectors, their original function was practical; they were standard weights used to measure gold dust. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-1224" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1224">[1,224]</a></sup> 'Craft production was an individual undertaking, and apprentice craftsmen were more often sons than sisters' sons. There were concentrations of certain crafts in certain villages, which were founded with war captives or refugees. Among these were settlements in the Kumase district such as Bonwire (cloth weaving), Ntonso (cloth dyeing), Pankrono (pottery), Ahwia (woodworking), and Breman and Adum (metalworking). Blacksmithery and joinery which catered to the needs of cultivators were scattered throughout the kingdom (Bowdich 1819, Dupuis 1824, Freeman 1967 [1898]). The crafts concerned with the elaboration of regalia were located in the immediate neighbourhood of the state capitals and the imperial capital of Kumasi (Rattray 1927: 216-308; Arhin 1982). Craft practitioners owned their own tools, and the factors that conditioned production were agricultural demand and state requirements.' <sup id="cite_ref-1225" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1225">[1,225]</a></sup> Trade was also important: 'There were early cultural and commercial links with the empires of the southern Sahara. The major commodities exchanged were gold from the Akan region and salt from the Sahara. The main Akan trading town was Bighu (Bitu) with links to Jenne on the Niger bend. Trade in gold and slaves formed the commercial basis of the traditional Ashanti state. Kola-nuts were also exported to the north. Today cocoa is Ghana's main export commodity. [IS]' <sup id="cite_ref-1226" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1226">[1,226]</a></sup> While some occupational mobility was present, Ashanti did not have an industrial economy at the time. Accordingly, some of the below variables might not apply to the Ashanti period.
</p><p><b>♠ staple cost of principal source of carbohydrates ♣ ♥</b> We have found no reliable figures on this for the time period in question. Most Ashanti were subsistence farmers.
</p><p><b>♠ Top fortune ♣ ♥</b> There was considerable wealth stratification in Ashanti (see also equity variables), but we are unsure how to quantify this.
</p><p><b>♠ Other wealth distribution ♣ ♥</b> There was considerable wealth stratification in Ashanti (see also equity variables), but we are unsure how to quantify this.
