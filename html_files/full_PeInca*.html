Carbon dates taken from Pumamarca architecture end in the fourteenth century (Hollowell 1987), while the Inca-style rectangular and ceremonial constructions at Pukara Pantillijlla are also earlier than we would expect from the historical chronology (Covey 2006b: 163). In light of the early dates, Bauer (1992: 47) has ventured that some structures usually thought to belong to the imperial era were actually raised during the Killke period. As noted in chapter 2 (section entitled “Time frames”), carbon dates suggest that the transition from the pre-Inca to Inca eras at Chokepuquio seems to have occurred 1400 - 30, which is in keeping with the idea of a late incorporation of the Lucre region." <sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>

Valcárcel (1934-5) made a major advance in understanding the early settlement through his extensive excavations in the early 1930s at that site.

Their work in and around the Qorikancha has yielded exceptionally high-quality pottery (Bauer and Covey 2004: 77-8). The planning of parts of the early town apparently foreshadowed the imperial capital’s layout. Building foundations under the present-day Hotel Libertador were found to have orientations like those of nearby imperial masonry. From that evidence, we may infer that at least part of the most prestigious imperial layout overlaid an existing design. In turn, that suggests that there was some sort of conceptual continuity from the pre-imperial to imperial eras (González Corrales 1984; Hyslop 1990: 30-4)." <sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> Outside the Cuzco NGA, the Incas conquered and either assimilated these polities culturally, as with the Chimu <sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> or relocated groups inside these zones, as in the case of Cerro Azul <sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>.

<dl><dd>The Inkas or Incas were just one of the multiple chiefdoms competing for power after the collapse of the Wari and Tiwanaku polities of the Middle Horizon.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> And yet, they developed to become the largest indigenous empire in the Americas, known as Tawantinsuyu ('the four parts together').<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> Growing from the Killke confederation, they started to expand in the Cuzco Valley and beyond over the late 14th and 15th centuries CE.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup> Over a short period from 1480 to 1532, three successive rulers ‒ Pachakuti, Thupa Inka Yupanqui and Huayna Capac ‒ pursued an expansionary policy which saw the empire stretch from southern Colombia to central Chile, covering most of the Andes.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup> Its geographical extent may have covered between 500,000 and 2 million square kilometres,<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup> including dry coastal deserts, snow-capped mountains, and the fringes of the Amazon rainforest.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Because of their expansionary policy over huge swathes of land, the Inkas needed to establish adequate ruling strategies. They could exert indirect control through their hegemony over local allies. At Farfán in northern Peru, the blend of Chimú and Inka architectural styles may indicate that local elites were the vessel through which Inka rule was manifested.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> Over the areas they conquered by force, the Inkas established new settlements and imposed their own regional administrators. Near Cañete, they massacred the local Guarco population and installed their own colonists at the site of Cerro Azul.<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup> The dispersion and relocation of unruly people was one of their strategies to avoid uprisings, and could also serve to foster the empire's productivity. Indeed, resettled populations could be clustered to create specialized centres of production, such as the weavers and potters of Milliraya, Bolivia.<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>In addition to these violent methods, however, the Inka elite used ideological strategies to create a sense of community among conquered populations. Inka art employed a uniform geometric style, easily recognizable throughout the empire. Apart from the fine textiles and metals crafted for the royal lineages by chosen craftspeople, the rest of their ceramics and textiles were mass-produced and mass-distributed.<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup> This meant that Inka identity could be easily replicated and grafted onto existing cultures. The Inka 'package' included ceremonial vessels known as <i>k'eros</i> and <i>aribalos</i>,<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> used to distribute maize beer or <i>chicha</i> in state-sponsored feasts. The Inkas also reused previously important ceremonial shrines (<i>wak'as</i>) ‒ Muyu Orco, for example, was revered from the Late Formative period to the arrival of the Spanish.<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup> ‒ and incorporated them into the network of shrines (<i>z'eque</i>) radiating outwards from Cuzco.<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup> Every year, important state rituals manifested this state ideology on an impressive scale: the Inti Raymi or solstice festival was a grand state ceremony lasting for eight or nine days.<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup> Cuzco acted as a great ceremonial centre with its sacred precincts; provincial administrators could be formally installed during the course of some of these rituals.<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The empire is also known for its elaborate infrastructure works. The royal highway, known as Qhapaq Ñan, was composed of two north/south axes linked by 20 east/west segments, and stretched over 40,000 kilometres.<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup> Empire-sponsored storage facilities were located near every major town and village along the Inka roads. These units, known as <i>tampus</i>, were located no further than 15-25 kilometres apart,<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup> a distance that corresponds to a day's walk and facilitated the transport of armies and commodities throughout the empire. A highly efficient courier system was also in place, whereby messengers called <i>chaski</i> were stationed every 6-9 kilometres to relay messages,<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup> allowing information and commands to travel 250 kilometres in a day.<sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p><i>Population and political organization</i>
</p>
<dl><dd>The Inka empire was unprecedented in the Andean region in its ambition and scale.<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup> Working backwards from colonial estimates, archaeologists and historians have estimated that its population in the early 16th century could have reached between 6<sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup> and 14 million.<sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup> The capital, Cuzco, was a thriving city of 20,000 people<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup> divided into two moieties, <i>hanan</i> and <i>hurin</i>, which represented both status divisions and geographical origin.<sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>At the top of the religious, military and administrative hierarchy was the the emperor, the Sapa Inka. Considered to be the Son of the Sun, he was believed to control supernatural powers.<sup id="cite_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup> After their deaths, Inka rulers were still venerated as mummies and their cults were managed by descendants from the same lineage.<sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The Inkas used a 10-tiered administrative system, with 80 provinces administered by a governor in a local urban settlement.<sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup> They implemented a characteristic mode of production known as <i>mit'a</i> ('to take a turn').<sup id="cite_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup> This built on Andean notions of reciprocal exchange to extract corvée service from heads of households for two or three months each year, ensuring that the state could rely on constant labour on a rotating basis.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The empire came to an abrupt end at the beginning of the 16th century. The Sapa Inka at this time, Huayna Khapaq, was stricken with disease ‒ possibly smallpox that had spread southwards from Central America, where it had been introduced by European invaders ‒ and died in 1528 CE.<sup id="cite_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup> His sons Waskhar and Atawallpa both claimed the throne, and the empire was soon weakened by civil war and disease. The Spanish. arrived in 1532 and conquered the Inka empire in a few years. It took several decades for them to assert their authority over the impressive geographical extent of the former Inka territory: by 1572, they had subdued the last bastion of Inka power at Vilcabamba.<sup id="cite_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup> However, indigenous resistance continued until Peru obtained its independence in 1821.</dd></dl>

<dd> Occupied almost exclusively by about 12 royal ayllus <sup id="cite_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-84">[84]</a></sup></dd>
<dd> "Commoners and foreigners were not permitted to live there and had to leave the city each night. These peoples were housed in satellite communities surrounding Cuzco at a short distance.

<dd> Cuzco had 20,000 inhabitants at its peak <sup id="cite_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-86">[86]</a></sup> and "the urban core was a planned settlement, covering about 40 hectares." <sup id="cite_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-87">[87]</a></sup></dd>
<dd> Alan Covey: These are both weak readings of the ethnohistory.  Eyewitnesses stated that nobles from across the empire had houses in Cuzco, and there were diverse populations of retainers in Inca royal households, as well as populations of craft specialists living in outer districts.  McEwan’s statement about population size is inaccurate regarding the size of provincial centers, which did not have permanent populations larger than Cuzco’s.  Only Chan Chan, the coastal Chimú capital, would have rivalled Cuzco in terms of population, and its size was probably greatest before Inca conquest. <sup id="cite_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-88">[88]</a></sup></dd></dl>

As territorial growth slowed in placed very far from Cuzco, the emperor moved up to the frontier and fought with Cuzco nobles and special troops that served more or less full-time.

At residential sites, the kancha housed permanent residents, while at tampu, it provided housing and craft quarters. Special sectors of some centers were also designed to house the Sapa Inca and his retinue when they passed through. A second unit, called the kallanka, is an elongated rectangular building with an undivided interior space; one side opens onto a plaza (plate 10.2). Common in the north, the kallanka housed mobile groups, such as soldiers on the move, and provided space for feasts.

<p>"According to Cieza (1967: 169-71), Pachakuti began the work and it was carried on by all his successors.

So it seems that 20,000 people were initially working on this project but the construction carried on for several decades afterwards, with no confirmation on whether the same amount of people were working on it. So, if the construction happened over 50 years with a steady supply of 20,000 workers, that would make the cost 1 million people-years. However, there is no confirmation on the number of years, so calculating an estimate in people-years is difficult.

<dl><dd><b> ♠ Length ♣ present ♥ </b> "The shortest measure may have been the length of a  nger (rok’ana), which is mentioned in Bertonio’s Aymara dictionary (1956) but not in the early Quechua lexicons (Rowe 1946: 323-4).  e next largest measurement was the distance between the tips of the outstretched index  nger and thumb, which amounted to about 12 - 14 cm.  en followed the ccapi, about 20 cm and roughly equivalent to the Spanish palmo.  e next largest measure was the khococ, which was about 45 cm. Finally came the rikra, which measured about 1.62 m; it was divided into two units. Rikra was also used to describe the load that could be carried in one arm (Urton 2010: 56). Rods a rikra long were reportedly used as a standard measurement for land and for constructions requiring precise lengths. In a test of this premise, Farrington (1984) found that architecture and terraces in Cuzco and on the Urubamba estates were regularly based on multiples of 1.6 m. Some of the central platform mounds at provincial centers along the main highway between Cuzco and Quito were similarly designed.  e platform at Huánuco Pampa, for example, is 32×48 m at its base, while the best preserved side of the platform at Hatun Xauxa also measures 32 m. Even the platform at the Argentine center of Shinkal, over 2000 km to the south, measures precisely 16 m on a side (Giovanetti 2009). The shortest unit used to measure travel distance was the pace (thatki). Rowe (1946: 325) suggests that it was counted as one step with each foot and may have equaled about 1.3 m. Another term, tupu, was used both for longer distances and for units of area. The length of a tupu is uncertain, since it was often described in the early sources as 1.5 times the Spanish league, which itself was a measure of uncertain distance.  e chronicler Murúa wrote that 6,000 thatki were equal to a tupu, and Hyslop’s (1984: 296-7) review of the literature suggested that a league usually fell between 4.1 and 6.3 km. If we work with those numbers, then a pace would have fallen between about 1.0 and 1.6 m and a tupu would correspond to about 6.2-9.4km. Hyslop (1984: 294-303) points out, however, that Andean concepts of travel distance were influenced by the amount of time needed to traverse a stretch. Rough terrain would have shortened the linear distance assigned to a tupu, while  at surfaces would have extended it. The Incas may have also used the concept of a day’s walk, since that distance was supposed to lie between adjacent tampu along the road. Although there was a substantial amount of variation, Hyslop found that the majority of tampu lay 15-25km apart. Since that is less than Andean people can easily traverse in a day, he suggests that the spacing was tightened up to accommodate the distance that a llama caravan would normally cover." <sup id="cite_ref-247" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-247">[247]</a></sup>  Alan Covey: Based on very late chronicles (probably filtered through Rowe 1946 and Rostworowski), but OK. <sup id="cite_ref-248" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-248">[248]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b> ♠ Area ♣ present ♥ </b> "The tupu as a measure of area was probably a flexible unit that was adjusted to the agricultural productivity of the lands that it was mea- suring (Rostworowski 1960a). Some of the chroniclers used European terms to describe the tupu, but they varied in the expanses that they cited. Cobo said that it was 50 fathoms by 25 fathoms, while Garcilaso suggested that it was equivalent to 1.5 Spanish fanegas. Garcilaso’s estimate (0.94 ha) unfortunately works out to about three times that of Cobo’s (0.33ha). Although Rowe suggests that Cobo was more likely to be right, Murra (1980a) points out that Andean farmers often resisted fixing their land area according to European measures. Instead, they considered a tupu to be the amount of land a couple needed to support themselves for a year, as Garcilaso noted. Since the land’s agricultural output varied markedly from one ecozone to the next, the area encompassed by a tupu would have varied accordingly. Terms were also used to denote half a tupu (checta), a quarter (sillcu), and an eighth (cutmu), illustrating that dual partitioning was extended into space in various contexts (Urton 2010: 56)." <sup id="cite_ref-249" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-249">[249]</a></sup>  Alan Covey: This is very flawed.  Spanish. had no measurement for the tupu until the 1590s, and the land titling records of that time varied from one place to another, even in the Cuzco region.  The tupu was almost always smaller than the fanegada, and it was not really standardized until the mid-1600s, after several rounds of titling.  These late chroniclers are wrong about Inca land measurement.  Murra is more accurate for early Colonial measurement—Andean elites were the principal agents who delimited and measured indigenous lands in tupu units, at least until the 1570s.  Cobo is more accurate for the mid-17th century, after land had become more commodified. <sup id="cite_ref-250" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-250">[250]</a></sup></dd>

The army paid dearly for the decision, because a contingent of Waskhar’s soldiers found and sacked the camp (Diez de Betanzos 1996: 217-18)."<sup id="cite_ref-343" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-343">[343]</a></sup>

"Cranial trauma increased from pre-Inca to Inca times, suggesting that violent conflict escalated during the time of Inca state development. Nearly one-quarter of the injuries were categorized as possible weapon wounds; of these possible weapon wounds, 96% were found in Early Inca or Late Horizon individuals. These data suggest that warfare-related violence intensified as the Inca rose to power in the Cuzco heartland. Nevertheless, the majority of the cranial injuries were small healed fractures, and may have resulted from non-lethal ritual encounters such as tinkus. In summary, the observed variation suggests that both types of violent encounters— small, circumscribed skirmishes and large-scale intergroup conflicts—occurred immediately prior to and during the time of Inca imperialism." <sup id="cite_ref-376" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-376">[376]</a></sup>

The reported suite of dates puts that event between 1400 and 1430 (with a 95 percent degree of confidence).

<dl><dd>"In the sequestered House of the Chosen Women (aqllawasi), they were taught religion, weaving, cooking, and chicha-making by lifelong virgins dedicated to the religious institutions. Cobo said that as many as 200 women of various ages could be found in the largest aqllawasi. Although they were well protected, the girls and women were not entirely confined, since they participated in many ceremonies at locations outside their quarters. After about four years, the girls were ready to serve as mamakuna (priestesses) or to marry men who merited the honor for their service to the Inca (Cobo 1990: 172-4; Rowe 1946: 283)." <sup id="cite_ref-385" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-385">[385]</a></sup></dd>

<p>Oracles

<dl><dd> "The mummies and their oracles also served the king in an advisory capacity. The ruling Inca was expected to seek advice from the ancestors on issues of importance, and it was carefully observed which oracles provided sound advice and which did not.

<p>Covey: "The ceque system was not so much a “system” of shrines as a collection of local shrines across the Cuzco Basin that were periodically visited by elite people from Cuzco to give them offerings.  For most of the year, many shrines were of local significance and ordinary people made offerings, but elite lineages from Cuzco were also charged with traveling outward from the Qorikancha temple to visit and give offerings to important shrines.  The shrine routes (ceques) linked particular shrines at that time, which were not necessarily affiliated during the rest of the year." <sup id="cite_ref-393" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-393">[393]</a></sup>
</p><p>Innovations relating to organization of state religion occurred during reign of Qhapaq Yupanki. "Several different Inka rulers are credited with the institution of the Sun cult." The Coricancha was the "principal temple in Cusco." This cult had a "high priest."  Inka Roq'a required that "aqlawasi (house of cloistered women) be established in Inka-controlled towns" which produced qumpi (fancy cloth) and aqha (maize beer) used in rituals. <sup id="cite_ref-394" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-394">[394]</a></sup>  Covey: "I would not treat this as historic, but rather as evidence that the formation of the Inca state brought new religious practices." <sup id="cite_ref-395" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-395">[395]</a></sup>

<p>Sacrifices:
"Similarly, an anonymous Jesuit chronicler (1968:155 [1594]) emphatically states that Andean people did not normally eat dog. The evidence from Wat’a, however, suggests that dogs were consumed only during the process through which spaces were transformed, or they were emplaced as offerings. Consistent with these data, several chroniclers claim that dogs were used in sacrifices (Jesuit 1968:154 [1594]; Avila 1987:161 [1598]), and others add that dogs were eaten during sacrificial practices (e.g., Cobo (1964:202 [1653]). Overall, the evidence suggests that these items were consumed or emplaced to heighten the social significance of the decommissioning process.
The people who enacted this process placed llama mandibula (Lama glama) on top of each fill context. Similar to the dog bones, llama mandibula were encountered throughout Wat’a only in select contexts corresponding to moments of transition, such as the beginning of Inka occupation or the Inka abandonment of a site. After placing these bones on the fill, the people lit another fire. The ash layers conform to the size of the ovoid structures that lay below, signaling that the fires were controlled (Figure 4.9). A radiocarbon date from the ash covering one of the ovoid structures indicates that it was buried in the fourteenth century, about two generations (or 100 years) after the date derived from its foundation." <sup id="cite_ref-406" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-406">[406]</a></sup>  =&gt; the source from the chroniclers is valid for the Inca empire polity, and the archaeological evidence for the Killke period.

<p>"Awkaypata was the most important open space in the entire realm. It often hosted the mummies or icons of dead rulers and their wives for a wide variety of ceremonies of state. They were seated according to their rank and fêted as though they were in living attendance.

</p><p>"Inti Raymi, or “Warriors’ Cultivation,” took place in the month that coincided with the June solstice. Like the Qhapaq Raymi, this celebration was intended primarily to honor the Sun. In recent years, this festival has been revived as a grand show in Cuzco that merges rekindled tradition with events staged for tourists. In 1535, a few months after Manqo Inka’s coronation, the Spanish cleric Bartolomé de Segovia was among those who witnessed the last great Inca festival to the Sun, which lasted eight or nine days (Segovia 1968: 82). His account conjures a vivid image of a grand state ceremony in which all the major figures were involved - the Sun, the Inka, the effigies of past rulers, the nobility, priestesses, and people of Cuzco. Segovia wrote that,
</p>
<dl><dd>they brought out all of the effigies from Cuzco’s temples onto a plain at the edge of Cuzco, toward the area where the Sun dawned. The effigies with the greatest prestige were placed beneath rich, finely-worked feather canopies, which had an elegant appearance ... The space [between the canopies] formed an avenue over thirty paces wide, and all the lords and other principal figures of Cuzco stood in it.</dd></dl>
<p>The lords, dressed in all their finery, were arrayed in two rows of about 300 each. As the sun rose, the Inca ruler led off a chant that ascended in volume till noon, and then slowly diminished as the sun descended. Throughout the day, offerings of meat were consumed in a great fire and great amounts of chicha, coca, and other materials brought out by maidens were given in sacrifice. At one point, a number of llamas were set loose and the common Indians leaped to catch them in a scramble that everyone enjoyed as great sport. As the sun completed its descent, the Incas expressed great sadness and humility. After sundown, the effigies were returned to their quarters and the canopies that had sheltered the nobility were packed up for the night. At the end of eight or nine days of similar celebrations, the Incas brought out foot plows and Manqo Inka took the lead in breaking the earth. Through this act, wrote Segovia, the Incas inaugurated the plowing season (chapter 12)." <sup id="cite_ref-408" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-408">[408]</a></sup>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Qhapaq Raymi ♥</b> "The Qhapaq Raymi, or “Magnificent Festival,” was both the year’s first festival and its greatest. During this celebration, the noble Inca boys went through the puberty rites that marked the passage from child to adult (chapter 9). A number of public ceremonies included dancing, drinking, and eating cakes of maize and llama blood said to symbolize the food of the Sun. As this was the year’s most solemn event, provincial subjects were required to leave the city for the duration of the rites." <sup id="cite_ref-409" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-409">[409]</a></sup>  Was also the occasion of a rite of passage: "The rite of adolescent passage (waracikoy) was celebrated once a year for a community; in Cuzco it coincided with the December solstice festival, called the Qhapaq Raymi (chapter 8). Boys who had reached the age of about 14 were given their breechclout at this time, woven by their mothers. They also received their adult names during these rites. Among the preferred names for Inca boys were Condor (Kuntur), Snake (Amaru), and Hawk (Waman). The royalty were given names that included Happy (Kusi), Powerful or Wealthy (Qhapaq), Honored (Yupanki), and Jaguar (Uturunku), among many others. The ceremonies for the sons of Inca nobility and royalty featured pilgrim- ages, sacrifices, and physical feats of daring and prowess. A month before the main ceremonies, the boys made a pilgrimage to the sacred mountain named Huanacauri to seek approval to go forward with the rites. During the preparations, the boys made slings and helped to chew maize for the chicha that would be consumed during the festivities. A second pilgrimage to Hua- nacauri marked the beginning of the month-long ceremonies; the journey was highlighted by sacrifices of camelids and was followed by a dance in Cuzco’s central plaza. Additional pilgrimages to other nearby mountains continued throughout the month, where the boys made sacrifices of llamas, their wool, and other materials. Periodically, their adult sponsors would whip them on the legs, admonishing them to be brave and to serve the Inca and the Sun with honor. One of the high points of the month was an hour-long race down a mountain face that often resulted in injury. The boys were spurred on by young maidens, who waited at the bottom with chicha. As the rituals came to a close, the boys received gifts from their adult male relatives - each one accompanied by a single whip stroke - and had their ears pierced for the large earspools that marked them as nobility. Thus they were known in adult life as orejones, or “big-ears.”." <sup id="cite_ref-410" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-410">[410]</a></sup>  "The First Month: Capac Raymi. The first month coincided with the onset of the rainy season in December and was marked by the summer solstice. According to Cobo (1990: 126), the name of this month meant “principal festival,” and it was the most important event of the year. During this festival, there was held a ceremony called huarachicoy, during which the boys of noble birth were initiated into manhood by receiving their earplugs and breechclouts. This ma- turity ceremony was viewed by the Spanish. as the equivalent to the knighting ceremonies carried out in Europe. Festivities included singing, dancing, presenting weapons to the boys, a footrace down the hill of Huanacauri, many offerings to the deities, and the sacrifice of many llamas. An equivalent ceremony called quicuchicoy was held at the same time for young women coming of age to be married. The girls ritually bathed in the Saphi River to purify themselves. They received a new name from their kinsmen and a new head- dress to mark the transition. During these rites, all provincial people resident in Cuzco were required to leave the city. They were lodged in places specially prepared for this purpose that were located on the highways running to each suyu or quarter of the empire (Brundage 1967: 91; Cobo 1990: 126-134)." <sup id="cite_ref-411" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-411">[411]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ qhapaq ucha ♥</b> "In some cases, when the Capac Ucha ceremony was to be celebrated in the whole of the empire, the victims would be required to walk to distant shrines or sometimes sacred mountain peaks throughout the realm. They were to travel as nearly as possible in perfectly straight lines from Cuzco to their place of sacrifice." <sup id="cite_ref-438" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-438">[438]</a></sup> "The fullest description of a qhapaq ucha comes from Molina (2011: 77-83), who placed it in the context of a monarch’s ascension. He wrote that all of the towns of the empire were called upon to send one or two boys and girls about 10 years old to the capital, along with fine cloth, camelids, and figurines of gold, silver, and shell. The boys and girls were dressed in finery and matched up as if they were married couples. The ceremony began with sacrifices in the main temple and an assembly in the main plaza, where the victims paraded solemnly around Cuzco’s notables-living, dead, and graven. Molina wrote that the ceremonies in Cuzco included sacrifices to the Creator God Wiraqocha, asking for health, long life, peace, and perennial victory for the new ruler. Some children were strangled while others had their hearts torn out and their blood painted across the faces of the images. Similar sacrifices were made to the Thunder, Mother Earth, Mother Cloud, and the petrified ancestor Huanacauri. Sacrifices of other kinds were then made to all of the other wak’a of Cuzco. Priests were then dispatched to the four quarters with sacrificial items and orders to make offerings to all wak’a according to their rank. The parties left the city in straight-line paths, deviating for neither mountain nor ravine. At some point, the burdens were transferred to other porters, who contin- ued along the route. The children who could walk would do so, while those who could not were carried by their mothers. The Inca himself traveled the royal road, as did the flocks. At each shrine in the provinces, the devotees interred gold, silver, and shell objects, while children were sacrificed only at the most exalted locations. And thus the parties continued with their travels and sacrifices, until they reached the markers that defined the edge of the civilized world, at a distance of 500 leagues (∼2,000 km) or a little less. To keep account of everything, wrote Molina, the Incas maintained mnemonic specialists (khipu kamayuq) and keepers of sacred things (villcakamayuq)." <sup id="cite_ref-439" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-439">[439]</a></sup> About hearts torn out - Alan Covey: "This is an inaccurate attribution of Aztec human sacrifice to the Incas.  It should be noted that the debate over Inca human sacrifice had colonial implications.  To the Spanish., people practicing human sacrifice could not be civilized, and their military conquest was justified.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ sitwa ♥</b> "The sitwa festival in September was used to drive out sickness, and it began when 400 warriors from the four urban suyu left the usnu in a relay into their own quarter as far as either the Vilcanota or Apurimaq rivers, where they ritually bathed. "<sup id="cite_ref-474" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-474">[474]</a></sup> "According to several chroniclers, during the month known as the Qoya Raymi (“Queen’s Festival”) or Citua, the Incas performed a rite of purification. Cobo explained that the ceremony was performed in the rainy season, because that was when people were prone to fall ill. Cuzco’s residents began the rituals by striking each other with torches and shaking clothing outside their doorways, as if to rid themselves of malignity. Molina’s account explains how social hierarchy and ceremony were played out over space. At one point, four groups of 100 people ran out of the city carrying sacrificial ashes in the four directions. The procession began with priests in the Temple of the Sun and fanned outward. Members of three royal panaqa and three non-royal ayllu carried their burdens out on the Kollasuyu and Chinchaysuyu roads, while two of each kindred did the same in the other two parts, Antisuyu and Cuntisuyu (Molina 2011: 30-4). When they reached a certain spot, they passed their burdens to people of lower status and so on outward from the city. The last carriers bathed in four major rivers many kilometers away to divest the city and its people of disease and other impurities." <sup id="cite_ref-475" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-475">[475]</a></sup> "During September, 100 white llamas were sacrificed and the Inca celebrated the solemn and important festival of Citua. This festival’s purpose was to prevent illness, and it was celebrated at the beginning of the rainy season, when many people were likely to get sick. All people from the provinces and anyone who had a physical defect were required to leave the city of Cuzco for the duration of the festival. Dogs were also removed from the city so that they would not howl during the ceremonies. At the appointed time, the people shook out their clothes from their doorways, symbolically throwing out disease and evil. They went through the streets with torches in their hands playfully hitting at one another. As they passed they shouted for sickness, disaster, and misfortune to leave the land. Four groups of armed warriors ran out along the four main highways that converged in Cuzco, passing along the cry of “Go away, evil” in relay fashion. The last of the runners ritually bathed in rivers so that the evil would be carried away by the water. The people remaining in Cuzco also ritually bathed and smeared maize porridge on their faces and the lintels of their doors to symbol- ize purification. Following this were days of dancing and feasting, after which the provincials were finally allowed back in. All of the peoples of the empire then brought their huacas that were residing in Cuzco to the main square to show allegiance to the Inca emperor." <sup id="cite_ref-476" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-476">[476]</a></sup> <span style="color:blue">AD: Suggested as most euphoric ritual by Brian Bauer. </span> Alan Covey: "The purification of the city and establishment of the Inca heartland was part of a two-stage ceremony.

<p>Candidates for the most dysphoric ritual:
</p>
<dl><dd>"Some rituals were held only on special occasions that were not tied to the ceremonial calendar. The most important of these was called Itu Raymi and was used to get the attention of the gods when help was needed. Generally, these ceremonies were reserved for severe crises, such as plagues, droughts, natural disasters, or war. All people from the provinces and dogs were sent out of the city of Cuzco. Those remaining then fasted for two days, avoiding salt, chili pepper, chicha, and sexual intercourse. The images of the gods were then brought into the main plaza and sacrifices were made. Depending on the seriousness of the occasion, llamas or even children could be sacrificed. There followed a solemn procession of boys under twenty years of age who circled the plaza wearing special costumes and beating drums. After circling the plaza once, they sat down in silence. A noble followed their path scattering coca leaves on the ground. The boys then circled the plaza again and more coca was scattered. After repeating the ritual eight times, the participants remained in the square all night praying to Viracocha and Inti. The following two days a joyous feast was held with dancing and drinking (Cobo 1990: 151-153; Rowe 1946: 311-312)." <sup id="cite_ref-488" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-488">[488]</a></sup> Considered as dysphoric because of the circumstances, and the fasting?</dd></dl>
<p><span style="color:blue">AD: but a qhapak ucha ritual took place at this occasion, so probably not a separate ritual?</span>  Alan Covey: "No, fasting was a part of all major ritual events.  As for the circumstances, this ritual (which is not mentioned by early chronicles) is comparable to the qhapaq hucha." <sup id="cite_ref-489" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-489">[489]</a></sup>
</p>
<dl><dd>Funerals with high numbers of sacrificial victims: "Funerals, especially those of an Inca ruler, could require very elaborate rituals. Family members of the deceased dressed in black for up to one year. Faces were smeared with black pigment. Women cut their hair and wore their cloaks over their heads. Food and drink were served to those who attended. Some of the personal effects of the deceased were burned, and the remainder kept with the body. For the funeral of the Inca Pachacuti, it is said that elaborate rituals were carried out in a month-long ceremony that he himself had designed. His possessions such as weapons, clothing, and jewelry were carried in processions to all the places around Cuzco that he had usually visited during his lifetime.

</p><p><span style="color:blue"> Pat Savage: I wonder whether the initiation rite during the Qhapaq Raymi involving ear piercing and whipping might be a good choice? To me, whipping (pain) and ear-piercing (mutilation) seem much more dysphoric than fasting. Meanwhile, the human sacrifice rituals suggested don’t qualify because, as noted in the codebook: "as we are interested in how these dysphoric moments are remembered it is necessary for the participants not normally to die during the rituals”.</span>

Because the panaqa could influence the selection of royal successors, candidates and kin groups likely negotiated with one another constantly in the quest for power. [...] The highest ranking panaqa were the kin closest to the current emperor, not to the most ancient. Earlier, we noted that ten royal panaqa and ten non-royal ayllu formed Cuzco’s elite when the Spaniards arrived.

<p><b>♠ Human sacrifice ♣ 5 ♥</b> "The Incas offered human sacrifices for ceremonies of great solemnity dedicated to the Sun, to the ascendancy, well-being, and death of an emperor, and to military victory. Specific wak'a around Cuzco, such as the petrified ancestor Huanacauri, Pachakuti's birthplace, and shrines dedicated to his wife, could also receive human sacrifices. In all, Cobo reported that 31 of the 332 shrines he described in and around the capital were owed human sacrifice (Dearborn and Schreiber 1989:51). Calamitous events such as earthquakes, eclipses, and epidemics called for the ultimate offering as well, as did critical divinations. The victims were usually boys and girls chosen for their beauty and recruited from the entire land. Prisoners taken in war were also sometimes executed in a gesture that paid homage to the Sun and symbolized Inca power. On infrequent but dramatic occasions - such as the death or investiture of a ruler - the victims could number in the thousands. [...] The rationale underlying human sacrifice in Inca ideology has not been as clearly laid out for us as it was in Aztec religion. [...] There are no comparable myths in Inca lore, but the chroniclers did explain that the intent was to ensure that humanity's best was sent to join the Creator, the Sun, and other deities, as well to accompany rulers into death. Cobo (1990: 8) reasoned that they could not have sacrificed their own children without expecting some reward, which is a different logic from one in which humanity was repaying an endless debt." <sup id="cite_ref-569" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-569">[569]</a></sup>

"According to several chroniclers, during the month known as the <i>Qoya Raymi</i> ('Queen's Festival') or <i>Citua</i>, the Incas performed a rite of purification. Cobo explained that the ceremony was performed in the rainy season, because that was when people were prone to fall ill. Cuzco's residents began the rituals by striking each other with torches and shaking clothing outside their doorways, as if to rid themselves of malignity. Molina's account explains how social hierarchy and ceremony were played out over space. At one point, four groups of one hundred people ran out of the city carrying sacrificial ashes in the four directions. The procession began with priests in the Temple of the Sun and fanned outward. Members of the three royal <i>panaqa</i> and three non-royal <i>ayllu</i> carried their burdens out on the Kollasuyu and Chinchaysuyu roads, while two of each kindred did the same in the other two parts, Antisuyu and Cuntisuyu (Molina 1988:73-5). When they reached a certain spot, they passed their burdens to people of lower-status and so on outward from the city.
