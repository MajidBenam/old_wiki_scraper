After the Iroquois had defeated the other Iroquoian speakers who lived in the area--Eries, Neutrals, and Hurons--the Senecas extended their hunting territories to the west, ranging into Ohio and southern Ontario, and established some small settlements in these regions notably at Niagara.' <sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

<b> ♠ Peak Date ♣ 1650-1701 CE ♥ </b> The Iroquois Confederacy pursued aggressive expansionism: 'The Iroquoian confederacy was organized sometime between 1400 and A.D. 1600 for the purpose of maintaining peaceful relations between the 5 constituent tribes. Subsequent to European contact relations within the confederacy were sometimes strained as each of the 5 tribes sought to expand and maintain its own interests in the developing fur trade. For the most part, however, the fur trade served to strengthen the confederacy because tribal interests often complemented one another and all gained from acting in concert. The League was skillful at playing French and English interests off against one another to its advantage and thereby was able to play a major role in the economic and political events of northeastern North America during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The Iroquois aggressively maintained and expanded their role in the fur trade and as a result periodically found themselves at war with their neighbors, such as the Huron, Petun, and the Neutral to the West and the Susquehannock to the south. Much of the fighting was done by the Seneca, the most powerful of the Iroquoian tribes. From 1667 to the 1680s the Iroquois maintained friendly relations with the French and during this time Jesuit missions were established among each of the 5 tribes. However, Iroquois aggression and expansion eventually brought them into conflict with the French and, at the same time, into closer alliance with the English. In 1687, 1693 and 1696 French military expeditions raided and burned Iroquois villages and fields. During Queen Anne's War (1702-1713) the Iroquois allied with the English and at the War's end were acknowledged to be British subjects, though they continued to aggressively maintain and extend their middleman role between English traders at Fort Orange (Albany) and native groups farther west.' <sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> The Confederacy achieved maximum geograhpical expansion by the mid-17th century: 'Between the Hudson and lake Erie, our broad territory was occupied by the Ho-de[unknown] -no-sau-nee,   or Iroquois, scattered far and wide, in small encampments, or in disconnected villages. Their council-fires, emblematical of civil jurisdiction, burned continuously from the Hudson to Niagara. At the era of Dutch discovery (1609), they had pushed their permanent possession as far west as the Genesee; and shortly after, about 1650, they extended it to the Niagara. They then occupied the entire territory of our State west of the Hudson, with the exception of certain tracts upon that river below the junction of the Mohawk, in the possession of the River Indians, and the country of the Delawares, upon the Delaware river.

In aboriginal times fish and animal species were diverse and abundant.' <sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> The individual member nations were represented in a common leage council: 'The Seneca ([unknown] sen[unknown] ku, locally also[unknown] sen[unknown] k[unknown] ), westernmost of the Iroquois tribes, were the largest in the Confederacy. Their numbers were often reported to be almost equal to or to exceed those of the other four Iroquois tribes combined (“The League of the Iroquois: Its History, Politics, and Ritual,” table 1, this vol.). Nevertheless, of all the Iroquois tribes they had the fewest number of chiefs on the League council; they held eight such chieftainships.' <sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> The Iroquois Confederacy was effective in dealing with external enemies until the American revolution, but individual nations also enjoyed considerable agency in handling their own affairs: 'The Iroquois Confederacy differed from other American Indian confederacies in the northeastern woodlands primarily in being better organized, more consciously defined, and more effective. The Iroquois used elaborately ritualized systems for choosing leaders and making important decisions. They persuaded colonial governments to use these rituals in their joint negotiations, and they fostered a tradition of political sagacity based on ceremonial sanction rather than on the occasional outstanding individual leader. Because the league lacked administrative control, the nations did not always act in unison; but spectacular successes in warfare compensated for this and were possible because of security at home.' <sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> The Confederacy was therefore an alliance of independent nations rather than a confederate state: 'Thus the League of the Iroquois was an alliance conceived among aboriginal nations which, though culturally related and speaking languages fundamentally similar but differing in vocabulary and idiom, had recurrently been in conflict. The league brought them out of conflict into peace. Then came the French, the Dutch, and the English, and the doom of the league was sealed, its desired results nullified. Here was an alliance binding together five distinct nations, based upon an orally transmitted constitution. It had no inscribed statutes, no taxes or levies, no gendarmerie, no hireling politicians. We hear, however, of tribute exacted of subjugated tribes. Tribute, as the Iroquois took it, consisted of stipulated sums of wampum demanded of the Algonkian tribes on the Atlantic Coast who produced it; and wampum was not an item of money, cash, or currency in native economy before the coming of Europeans to the Hudson Valley. Its function was that of a symbol, valuable in a spiritual sense and capable of serving the purposes of mnemonic record making. Thus the wampum tribute we read so much about would seem to be a measure pressed upon subjugated smaller tribes in the shell-bearing coastal regions, requiring them to furnish the wampum the Iroquois needed in the score of ceremonial uses they had developed for it.' <sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> 'During the 15th and early 16th centuries, warfare in the Northeast culture area fostered the creation of extensive political and military alliances. It is generally believed that this period of increasing conflict was instigated by internal events rather than by contact with Europeans; some scholars suggest that the region was nearing its carrying capacity. Two of the major alliances in the area were the Huron confederacy (which included the Wendat alliance) and the Five Tribes (later Six Tribes), or Iroquois Confederacy. The constituent tribes of both blocs spoke Iroquoian languages; the term “Iroquoian” is used to refer generally to the groups speaking such languages, while references to the “Iroquois” generally imply the tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy alone.' <sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> 'The Five Tribes of the Iroquois Confederacy lived south of the St. Lawrence River and Lake Erie, for the most part in the present-day state of New York. The alliance comprised the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca peoples; the Tuscarora joined the confederacy later. Evenly matched with the Huron alliance in terms of aggregate size, the Iroquois were more loosely united and somewhat less densely settled across the landscape. While the Huron nations traded extensively for food, this was less the case for the Five Tribes, who relied more thoroughly upon agriculture. Before colonization they seem to have removed southward, perhaps in response to raids from the Huron to their north. The alliances among the Five Tribes were initiated not only for defense but also to regulate the blood feuds that were common in the region. By replacing retributory raids among themselves with a blood money payment system, each of the constituent nations was better able to engage in offensive and defensive action against outside enemies.' <sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup>

The Iroquois aggressively maintained and expanded their role in the fur trade and as a result periodically found themselves at war with their neighbors, such as the Huron, Petun, and the Neutral to the West and the Susquehannock to the south.

<dl><dd>The Finger Lakes region of the modern-day state of New York was once part of Iroquois territory. On the eve of European contact, this territory stretched from Lake Champlain and Lake George west to the Genesee River and Lake Ontario and from the St. Lawrence River south to the Susquehanna River. Originally, the League of the Iroquois was a confederacy of five Native American tribes (the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, and Seneca), joined by a sixth tribe, the Tuscarora, in 1722, following its northward migration from the Roanoke River. This confederacy was created between 1400 and 1600 CE. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the confederacy was overall able to exploit the establishment of the European fur trade to its advantage, playing French and English interests off against one another, and gaining a major role in economic and political affairs. As a result of this, the Iroquois - particularly the Seneca - also frequently clashed with other Native tribes, such as the Huron, Petun, Neutral and Susquehannock. Eventually, the Iroquois also came into conflict with the Europeans, first with the French, then with the American revolutionaries. Starting in the 19th century, the Iroquois tribes settled on reservations in western New York state, southern Quebec and southern Ontario.<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup></dd></dl>

But a peculiar custom of our predecessors has divested this subject of much of its embarrassment, and enabled us to ascertain with considerable certainty the territorial  limits of the nations of the League.  The Iroquois rejected all natural boundaries, and substituted longitudinal lines. This appears to have resulted from the custom of establishing themselves upon both banks of the streams upon which they resided. Having no knowledge of the use of wells, they were accustomed to fix their habitations upon the banks of creeks, and easily forded rivers, or in the vicinity of copious springs. Inland lakes were never divided by a boundary line; but the line itself was deflected, that the entire circuit of each lake might be possessed by a single nation. The natural limits which rivers and lakes might furnish having thus been disregarded, and straight lines substituted, the inquiry is freed from some of its difficulties, and greater certainty is given to their boundaries, when certain points upon them are decisively ascertained.' <sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup> These comments seem to indicate an extensive territory of around 100,000 km squared.

</p><p><b> ♠ Polity Population ♣ 5,500: 1600 CE ♥ </b> People. The Britannica gives a number of 12,000, but seems to refer to the period immediately preceding the American Revolution: 'For a century and a quarter before the American Revolution, the Iroquois stood athwart the path from Albany to the Great Lakes, keeping the route from permanent settlement by the French and containing the Dutch and the English. In the 18th century the Six Nations remained consistent and bitter enemies of the French, who were allied with their traditional foes. The Iroquois became dependent on the British in Albany for European goods (which were cheaper there than in Montreal), and thus Albany was never attacked. The Iroquois’ success in maintaining their autonomy vis-à-vis both the French and English was a remarkable achievement for an aboriginal people that could field only 2,200 men from a total population of scarcely 12,000. During the American Revolution, a schism developed among the Iroquois. The Oneida and Tuscarora espoused the American cause, while the rest of the league, led by Chief Joseph Brant’s Mohawk loyalists, fought for the British out of Niagara, decimating several isolated American settlements. The fields, orchards, and granaries, as well as the morale of the Iroquois, were destroyed in 1779 when U.S. Major General John Sullivan led a retaliatory expedition of 4,000 Americans against them, defeating them near present-day Elmira, New York. Having acknowledged defeat in the Second Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1784), the Iroquois Confederacy effectively came to an end. In a treaty that was made at Canandaigua, New York, 10 years later, the Iroquois and the United States each pledged not to disturb the other in lands that had been relinquished or reserved. Of the Six Nations, the Onondaga, Seneca, and Tuscarora remained in New York, eventually settling on reservations; the Mohawk and Cayuga withdrew to Canada; and, a generation later, a large group of the Oneida departed for Wisconsin.' <sup id="cite_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup> eHRAF gives the total number of Iroquois at 5,500 for the beginning of the 17th century: 'In 1600 the population of the Five Nations is estimated to have been about 5,500 and that of the Tuscarora about 5,000.' <sup id="cite_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup> We have chosen to follow the eHRAF estimate.
</p><p><b> ♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ {600; 3,000} ♥ </b> Inhabitants. The Iroquois resided in longhouse communities: 'Villages were built on elevated terraces in close proximity to streams or lakes and were secured by log palisades. Village populations ranged between 300 and 600 persons. Typically, an enclosed village included numerous longhouses and several acres of fields for growing crops; surrounding the village were several hundred more acres of fields for growing crops. Longhouses were constructed of log posts and poles and covered with a sheathing of elm bark; they averaged 25 feet in width and 80 feet in length, though some exceeded 200 feet in length. Villages were semi-permanent and in use year round. When soil fertility in the fields declined and firewood in the vicinity of the village became scarce the village was moved to a new site. This was a gradual process, with the new village being built as the old one was gradually abandoned. The settlements of the 5 tribes lay along an east-west axis were connected by a system of trails.' <sup id="cite_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup> Morgan provides a wider range: 'The Iroquoians were gregarious, and apparently the size of their towns was limited only by the difficulty of raising corn and cutting firewood for a large population within a reasonable distance. Partly for protection and still more from their own fondness for society, nearly all were found in closely built villages varying in size from 300 to 3,000 inhabitants.' <sup id="cite_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-57">[57]</a></sup> Iroquois settlements were initially heavily concentrated, but gave way to smaller and more dispersed patterns during the colonial period: 'Iroquois settlements were formerly much concentrated. Before 1687, the League Iroquois were 12 or 13 villages, ranging between 300 and 600 persons per town: Mohawk (3), Oneida (1), Onondaga (2), Cayuga (3), Seneca (4). Two Seneca towns comprised upward of 100 houses, of which a good proportion were extended bark houses sheltering composite families. During the next century settlements dispersed and were smaller, the bark house giving way to log houses of smaller dimensions. By 1800 the bark longhouse was a thing of the past. With it went old patterns of coresidence.' <sup id="cite_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup> Onondaga doubled as the capital of the League, despite of intermittent relocations of the council fire in the colonia period, and was among the larger settlements in the area: 'The term “longhouse” was at one time symbolically applied to the League, and its members spoke of themselves as the “Hodinonhsióni ónon,” “the people of the longhouse.” The symbolic longhouse was represented as extending from the Hudson River to Lake Erie. It sheltered within its walls the five tribes who kept the five fires of the longhouse. At the ends of the house stood the doorkeepers, the Mohawk at the east and the Seneca at the west.

TheOnondaga village at Buffalo Creek, which in 1791 wassaid to consist of 28 good houses (Proctor 1864-1865,2:307), was located near the ford on Cazenovia Creek(near the present junction of Potter Road and SenecaStreet, a mile west of Ebenezer).

</p><p><b>♠ Largest communication distance ♣ ♥</b> in kilometers. Settlements were connected by trails: 'We have thus followed the great Indian trail, Wä-a-gwen[unknown] -ne-yu,   through the State, from the Hudson to lake Erie; noticing, as far as ascertained, the principal stopping-places on the route. To convey an adequate impression of the forest scenery, which then overspread the land, is beyond the power of description. This trail was traced through the over-hanging forest for almost its entire length. In the trail itself, there was nothing particularly remarkable. It was usually from twelve to eighteen inches wide, and deeply worn in the ground; varying in this respect from three to six, and even twelve inches, depending upon the firmness of the soil. The large trees on each side were frequently marked with the hatchet.  This well-beaten footpath,  which no runner, nor band of warriors could mistake, had doubtless been trodden by successive generations from  century to century. It had, without question, been handed down from race to race, as the natural line of travel, geographically considered, between the Hudson and lake Erie. While it is scarcely possible to ascertain a more direct route than the one pursued by this trail, the accuracy with which it was traced from point to point, to save distance, is extremely surprising. It proved, on the survey of the country, to have been so judiciously selected that the turnpike was laid out mainly on the line of this trail, from one extremity of the State to the other. In addition to this, all the larger cities and villages west of the Hudson, with one or two exceptions, have been located upon it.

</p><p>(2) Larger Villages doubling as Capitals of the confederacy of individual nations; (1) Residential Villages comprising several Longhouses
</p><p>Most Iroquois lived in residential villages: 'Villages were built on elevated terraces in close proximity to streams or lakes and were secured by log palisades. Village populations ranged between 300 and 600 persons. Typically, an enclosed village included numerous longhouses and several acres of fields for growing crops; surrounding the village were several hundred more acres of fields for growing crops. Longhouses were constructed of log posts and poles and covered with a sheathing of elm bark; they averaged 25 feet in width and 80 feet in length, though some exceeded 200 feet in length. Villages were semi-permanent and in use year round. When soil fertility in the fields declined and firewood in the vicinity of the village became scarce the village was moved to a new site. This was a gradual process, with the new village being built as the old one was gradually abandoned. The settlements of the 5 tribes lay along an east-west axis were connected by a system of trails.' <sup id="cite_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-64">[64]</a></sup> 'The primary local groups of Iroquois society were the extended household and the village. Each extended family lived in a long bark structure, some of which were from fifty to one hundred and fifty feet in length by sixty in breadth, known as longhouses. Throughout its length was a central passageway in which were located hearths at intervals of ten to twelve feet with each hearth being used by two conjugal families. On both sides of this central passageway were apartments each occupied by a simple family. The composition of the group inhabiting the longhouse appears to have been controlled by the matriarch of a lineage. Influential matriarchs who held a chiefly title tended to group their female relatives around them in the same longhouse.' <sup id="cite_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup> 'The characteristic dwelling of the Iroquois was a log and bark community house known as the longhouse (ganonh[unknown] sees) designed to  accommodate five, ten, or twenty families. The longhouse ranged in length from 30 to 200 feet, in width from 15 to 25 feet, and in height, at the center, from 15 to 20 feet. The average longhouse was 60 feet in length, 18 feet wide, and 18 feet high. It was built with a framework of upright posts with forked tops. The lower ends of the posts were set one foot into the ground to form a rectangular space the size of the building to be constructed. Horizontal poles were tied with withes to the vertical poles, along the sides and across the tops. A steep triangular or rounded roof was formed by bending the slender, flexible poles toward the center above the space enclosed by the poles.' <sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup> Some larger villages or towns doubled as capitals of the confederacy or individual nations: 'The term “longhouse” was at one time symbolically applied to the League, and its members spoke of themselves as the “Hodinonhsióni ónon,” “the people of the longhouse.” The symbolic longhouse was represented as extending from the Hudson River to Lake Erie.

Quebec was for some time their chief town. Probably they were the people whom Jacques Cartier found there. Their Huron kindred built Hochelaga on the island of Montreal. Between these related tribes arose jealousy and finally war. The Mohawks drove the Hurons from Hochelaga and built their capital there. This was the height of Mohawk power. Apparently they held the country from the mouth of the St. Lawrence to the headwaters of the Mohawk. From their capital at Montreal they controlled the great river down to Gaspe. Vermont and the Adirondacks were their hunting-grounds, and their outlying dependency the Oneidas had for some time had a permanent town in New York.' <sup id="cite_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-68">[68]</a></sup> Settlements were initially heavily concentrated, but became smaller and more dispersed during the colonial period, especially in the 19th century: 'Iroquois settlements were formerly much concentrated. Before 1687, the League Iroquois were 12 or 13 villages, ranging between 300 and 600 persons per town: Mohawk (3), Oneida (1), Onondaga (2), Cayuga (3), Seneca (4). Two Seneca towns comprised upward of 100 houses, of which a good proportion were extended bark houses sheltering composite families. During the next century settlements dispersed and were smaller, the bark house giving way to log houses of smaller dimensions. By 1800 the bark longhouse was a thing of the past.

The land tenure system changed from the late 1820's when Darling made his roport public. Most of the Iroquois were no longer living in villages by 1840. Only two villages existed, the Mehawk and Tusearera. Formerly, the Cayuga and Onendaga had longhouses in which whele lineages lived and the matron rodistributed the produce (Campbell, 1958.)

</p><p>(3) the central League Council; (2) Tribal Chiefs (Sachems) and associated Tribal Councils; (1) Village Elders and Village Councils
</p><p>The political organization distinguished between villages, tribes, and the common confederate level: 'THE POLITICAL ORGANIZATION of the Iroquois--the system by which decisions were made about problems affecting village, tribe, or confederacy --had three levels. The town or village itself decided local issues like the use of nearby hunting lands, the relocation of houses and cornfields, movement to another site, the acceptance or rejection of visitors, and the raising of war parties. There was a village chiefs' council, numbering up to twenty men, formally organized with a chairman and one or more representatives for each clan. These chiefs were influential men and women, who might be League sachems, warcaptains, warriors, or simply old men who were looked up to and consulted. The council generally met in the presence of the warriors and the women, and rarely diverged in its decisions from the popular consensus, or at least the majority view. This council met in the village's ceremonial longhouse, which usually was merely a large dwelling.' <sup id="cite_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup> Female lineage elders played an important role on the local level: 'The primary local groups of Iroquois society were the extended household and the village. Each extended family lived in a long bark structure, some of which were from fifty to one hundred and fifty feet in length by sixty in breadth, known as longhouses. Throughout its length was a central passageway in which were located hearths at intervals of ten to twelve feet with each hearth being used by two conjugal families.

The composition of the group inhabiting the longhouse appears to have been controlled by the matriarch of a lineage. Influential matriarchs who held a chiefly title tended to group their female relatives around them in the same longhouse.' <sup id="cite_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-72">[72]</a></sup> Various political levels were validated by wampum beads: 'The longhouse owns “wampums” which validate its position as a ritual center but which are rarely brought out. Wampum occasionally  figures in the ritual, such as the string of wampum used in the rite of confession. But the significance of wampum generally is that because it is a valuable object, it is used to indicate the significance of the event, either by giving it as a commemoration of the event or as being shown in remembrance of the event. Wampum belts, for example, were given at treaties to indicate good faith in the making of the treaty, and might be brought out to remind others of the treaty. In and of itself, wampum is not sacred.' <sup id="cite_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-73">[73]</a></sup> The central League Council dealt with commonn affairs, with tribal chiefs and councils (as well as the female elders of their respective lineages and more recently created non-hereditary positions) occupying an intermediary position: 'The Iroquois confederacy operated under a council of 50 sachems representing the five original tribes. When the Tuscarora joined the League in 1722, no new sachem positions were created for it. The council was a legislative, executive and judicial body that deliberated only on the external affairs of the confederacy, such as peace and war, and on matters common to the five constituent tribes. The council had no voice in the internal affairs of the separate tribes. Tribal representation on the council was unequally distributed among the 5 tribes although abuse of power was limited by the requirement of unanimity in all council decisions. Below the level of the League council were separate tribal councils concerned with the internal affairs of each tribe and each tribe's relations with external groups. The tribal council was composed of the sachems who represented the tribe on the League council. Sachem positions were hereditary within each tribe and belonged to particular matrisibs. The women of the matrisib nominated each new sachem, who was always a male, and had the power to recall or "dehorn" a chief who failed to represent the interests of his people. Theoretically, each sachem was equal to the others in power, but in practice those with better oratorial skills wielded greater influence. After the confederacy had been functioning for a period of time a new, nonhereditary office of Pine Tree Chief was created to provide local leadership and to act as advisors to the council sachems, although later they actually sat on the League council and equaled the sachems in power. Pine Tree Chiefs held their position for life and were chosen by the women of a matrisib on the basis of skill in warfare. Iroquois involvement in the fur trade and war with the French increased the importance and solidarity of the League council and thereby strengthened the confederacy. The strength of the confederacy continued to grow until the time of the American Revolution when Iroquois interests divided between alliances to the British and the American colonists.' <sup id="cite_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-74">[74]</a></sup> 'A Chief was appointed by the oldest woman of the maternal family in which the title descended. Her descendants and those who were related clanwise were his constituents. The matron and the chief tended to reside in the same settlement, for when the Chief removed, the clan had no one to regard with confidence unless he returned for village councils. If the matron removed, local succession was in jeopardy.  The results of deliberations by the clan were taken from village councils to the council of the tribe. The ranking clan chiefs residing at a place were the cochiefs of that settlement. All eight of the Seneca chiefs are now concentrated at Tonawanda, but formerly the Seneca had at least four villages, and all the rest save the Oneida had each two or three principal towns with satellite settlements. The tribe thus spoke a common language, it comprised two or more settlements, it was governed by a common council of village chiefs who also represented constituent clans, and they governed a common territory adjacent to the towns. In time all clans were present in all villages, probably about in the same proportions as they are now. As any clan predominated in a settlement, members had to seek mates in the next village, or divide their own house in twain, thus distributing the clans again.' <sup id="cite_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-75">[75]</a></sup> Tribes were composed of matrilineages: 'Matrilineages were organized into 15 matrisibs. Among the Cayuga, Onondaga, Seneca and Tuscarora the matrisibs were further organized into moieties. Among the Mohawk and the Oneida no moiety division was recognized. Descent was matrilineal.' <sup id="cite_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-76">[76]</a></sup> The League Council initially met at Onondaga, but the council fire was extinguished and rekindled in various places during the tribulations of the colonial period: 'The council continued to be composed of hereditary chiefs, who together with the “war chiefs” from 1812 andthe Pine Tree chiefs numbered over 50. The Crown madeno attempt to interfere with the appointment or dismissalof chiefs (Weaver 1975). The chiefs met in the Onondagacouncil house, a log structure near Middleport, two orthree times a year to deliberate in traditional fashionmatters of community interest (Weaver 1963-1974). The Onondagas, known collectively as the firekeepers, actedas mediators in the proceedings according to traditionalcustom. However, the tribal seating plan differed fromthe traditional one in that the Mohawks and Senecasoccupied the positions east of the council fire, while theOneidas and Cayugas sat on the west, together with thedependent nations: Tuscaroras, Nanticokes, Delawares,and Tutelos. Although the dependent nations were tospeak through “their voice,” the Cayugas, in fact theyoften directly addressed the assembly of chiefs, andoperated quite independently, though not equaling theoriginal five nations in power or status.' <sup id="cite_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-77">[77]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Religious levels ♣ 1 ♥ </b> levels.
</p><p>(1) Local ceremonial specialists (Keepers of the Faith) and shamans (False Face Societies)
</p><p>Religious specialists were generally village-based: 'Full time religious specialists were absent, however, there were part-time male and female specialists known as Keepers of the Faith whose primary responsibilities were to arrange and conduct the main religious ceremonies. Keepers of the Faith were appointed by matrisib elders and were accorded considerable prestige.' <sup id="cite_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-78">[78]</a></sup> 'Part time religious specialists known as Keepers of the Faith served in part to censure anti-social behavior. Unconfessed witches detected through council proceedings were punished with death, while those who confessed might be allowed to reform.' <sup id="cite_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-79">[79]</a></sup> 'Illness and disease were attributed to supernatural causes. Curing ceremonies consisted of group shamanistic practices directed towards propitiating the responsible supernatural agents. One of the curing groups was the False Face Society. False Face Societies were found in each village and, except for a female Keeper of the False Faces who protected the ritual paraphernalia, consisted only of male members who had dreamed of participation in False Face ceremonies.' <sup id="cite_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-80">[80]</a></sup> Christian attempts at proselytization were initially largely unsuccessful: 'The Iroquoian confederacy was organized sometime between 1400 and A.D. 1600 for the purpose of maintaining peaceful relations between the 5 constituent tribes. Subsequent to European contact relations within the confederacy were sometimes strained as each of the 5 tribes sought to expand and maintain its own interests in the developing fur trade. For the most part, however, the fur trade served to strengthen the confederacy because tribal interests often complemented one another and all gained from acting in concert. The League was skillful at playing French and English interests off against one another to its advantage and thereby was able to play a major role in the economic and political events of northeastern North America during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The Iroquois aggressively maintained and expanded their role in the fur trade and as a result periodically found themselves at war with their neighbors, such as the Huron, Petun, and the Neutral to the West and the Susquehannock to the south. Much of the fighting was done by the Seneca, the most powerful of the Iroquoian tribes. From 1667 to the 1680s the Iroquois maintained friendly relations with the French and during this time Jesuit missions were established among each of the 5 tribes. However, Iroquois aggression and expansion eventually brought them into conflict with the French and, at the same time, into closer alliance with the English. In 1687, 1693 and 1696 French military expeditions raided and burned Iroquois villages and fields. During Queen Anne's War (1702-1713) the Iroquois allied with the English and at the War's end were acknowledged to be British subjects, though they continued to aggressively maintain and extend their middleman role between English traders at Fort Orange (Albany) and native groups farther west.' <sup id="cite_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-81">[81]</a></sup>

It becomes an important inquiry, therefore, to ascertain in whom the military power, was vested. The Iroquois had no distinct class of war-chiefs, raised up and set apart to command in  time of war; neither do the sachems or chiefs appear to have possessed the power of appointing such persons as they considered suitable to the post of command. All military operations were left entirely to private enterprise, and to the system of voluntary service, the sachems seeking rather to repress and restrain, than to encourage the martial ardor of the people.

The singular method of warfare among the Iroquois renders it extremely difficult to obtain a complete and satisfactory explanation of the manner in which their varlike operations were conducted.

In addition, they fished and gathered berries, plants, and roots. Before the arrival of Europeans the primary weapons were bows and arrows, stone axes and knives and blowguns, however, by the late seventeenth century European trade goods had almost completely replaced the traditional weapons and tools. The principal crops were maize, beans, and squash which, in addition, were prominent in ceremonial activities. In good years surplus crops were dried and stored for future use. After the harvest of crops in the late summer, the seasonal round included fall hunting that lasted until the winter solstice, early spring fishing and hunting of passenger pigeons, and then spring and summer clearing and planting of fields.' <sup id="cite_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-86">[86]</a></sup> Labour was divided according to age and gender: 'Traditionally, men hunted and fished, built houses, cleared fields for planting, and were responsible for trade and warfare.

A good meatprovider was considered the best husband. But hunting was more a prestige and recreation point, than a necessity. Village sites were  changed when the fields near them were exhausted--every 15 or 20 years with this type of horticulture--rather than when the district had been hunted out. Conflicts with pioneers occurred more often over the decimation of the game animals, due to the clearing and planting of large numbers of acres, rather than over the scarcity of arable land.

</p><p><b> ♠ Professional soldiers ♣ absent ♥ </b> Full-time specialists The warriors were represented in their own council: 'Closely allied with the Council of Elders was the women's council who brought the matters up before the council. Lafitau maintained: Separate from both the women's and elder's councils was the warriors' council which sought to influence authority decisions of the council of elders because they were the soldiers or ‘police’ of the village. Their internal affairs idsally were limited to military raids, games,  and carrying out the military policy of the council of elders or League Council. In addition to the various councils, asseciations of men and women possibly existed for curing. Lafitau noted “I have been told that they have several sorts of private associations like fraternities” (Ibdd.:476). Fenton speculated that these associations were procursers of the “medicine societies” (Lafitau, 1724, 1:476). However, these associations seem to be the actual medicine societies and as such would have been village groups that criss-cross lineage, clan and moiety statuses.' <sup id="cite_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-92">[92]</a></sup> Distinguished war-leaders were eligible for non-hereditary chieftainships: 'The powers and duties of the sachems and chiefs were entirely of a civil character, and confined, by their organic laws, to the affairs of peace. No sachem could go out to war in his official capacity, as a civil ruler. If disposed to take the war-path, he laid aside his civil office, for the time being, and became a common warrior. It becomes an important inquiry, therefore, to ascertain in whom the military power, was vested. The Iroquois had no distinct class of war-chiefs, raised up and set apart to command in  time of war; neither do the sachems or chiefs appear to have possessed the power of appointing such persons as they considered suitable to the post of command. All military operations were left entirely to private enterprise, and to the system of voluntary service, the sachems seeking rather to repress and restrain, than to encourage the martial ardor of the people. Their principal war-captains were to be found among he class called chiefs, many of whom were elected to this office in reward for their military achievements. The singular method of warfare among the Iroquois renders it extremely difficult to obtain a complete and satisfactory explanation of the manner in which their varlike operations were conducted. Their whole civil policy was averse to the concentration of power in the hands of any single individual, but inclined to the opposite principle of division among a number of equals; and this policy they carried into their military as well as through their civil organization. Small bands were, in the first instance, organized by  individual leaders, each of which, if they were afterwards united upon the same enterprise, continued under its own captain, and the whole force, as well as the conduct of the expedition, was under their joint management. They appointed no one of their number to absolute command, but the general direction was left open to the strongest will, or the most persuasive voice.' <sup id="cite_ref-93" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-93">[93]</a></sup> 'When the power of the Ho-de[unknown] -no-sau-nee   began to develop, under the new system of oligarchies within an oligarchy, there sprang up around the sachems a class of warriors, distinguished for enterprise upon the war-path, and eloquence in council, who demanded some participation in the administration of public affairs. The serious objections to the enlargement of the number of rulers, involving, as it did, changes in the framework of the government, for a long period enabled the sachems to resist the encroachment. In the progress of events, this class became too powerful to be withstood, and the sachems were compelled to raise them up in the subordinate station of chiefs. The title was purely elective, and the reward of merit. Unlike the sachemships, the name was not hereditary in the tribe or family of the individual, but terminated with the chief himself; unless subsequently bestowed by the tribe upon some other  person, to preserve it as one of their illustrious names. These chiefs were originally invested with very limited powers, their principal office being that of advisers and counsellors of the sachems. Having thus obtained a foothold in the government, this class, to the number of which there was no limit, gradually enlarged their influence, and from generation to generation drew nearer to an equality with the sachems themselves.

In addition, men had the more visible roles in tribal and confederacy politics. Farming was the responsibility of women, whose work also included gathering wild foods, rearing children, preparing food, and making clothing and baskets and other utensils.' <sup id="cite_ref-95" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-95">[95]</a></sup>

Curing ceremonies consisted of group shamanistic practices directed towards propitiating the responsible supernatural agents. One of the curing groups was the False Face Society. False Face Societies were found in each village and, except for a female Keeper of the False Faces who protected the ritual paraphernalia, consisted only of male members who had dreamed of participation in False Face ceremonies.' <sup id="cite_ref-98" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-98">[98]</a></sup> Christian attempts at proselytization were not successful on a large scale: 'The Iroquoian confederacy was organized sometime between 1400 and A.D. 1600 for the purpose of maintaining peaceful relations between the 5 constituent tribes. Subsequent to European contact relations within the confederacy were sometimes strained as each of the 5 tribes sought to expand and maintain its own interests in the developing fur trade. For the most part, however, the fur trade served to strengthen the confederacy because tribal interests often complemented one another and all gained from acting in concert. The League was skillful at playing French and English interests off against one another to its advantage and thereby was able to play a major role in the economic and political events of northeastern North America during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The Iroquois aggressively maintained and expanded their role in the fur trade and as a result periodically found themselves at war with their neighbors, such as the Huron, Petun, and the Neutral to the West and the Susquehannock to the south. Much of the fighting was done by the Seneca, the most powerful of the Iroquoian tribes. From 1667 to the 1680s the Iroquois maintained friendly relations with the French and during this time Jesuit missions were established among each of the 5 tribes. However, Iroquois aggression and expansion eventually brought them into conflict with the French and, at the same time, into closer alliance with the English. In 1687, 1693 and 1696 French military expeditions raided and burned Iroquois villages and fields. During Queen Anne's War (1702-1713) the Iroquois allied with the English and at the War's end were acknowledged to be British subjects, though they continued to aggressively maintain and extend their middleman role between English traders at Fort Orange (Albany) and native groups farther west.' <sup id="cite_ref-99" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-99">[99]</a></sup>

<p><b> ♠ Full-time bureaucrats ♣ absent ♥ </b> Full-time specialists Most communal matters were decided by village, tribal, and central councils, combining judicial, executive, and legislative functions. Leadership in 'civil' affairs was largely hereditary and councils as well as lineage organization were not bureaucratized: 'Quite apart from this supervision by the women, however, the council suffered from another and more serious limitation. Its members obtained their position by birthright, not by military prowess or ability in other ways; and while they might declare peace or war in the name of the whole league, they could not control ambitious individuals who sought profit, revenge, or renown through sudden attacks on neighbouring peoples. Many of the so-called wars of the Iroquois seem to have been irresponsible affairs, organized and conducted without the consent and often without the knowledge of the council; for since the sachems were civil chieftains, not necessarily leaders in warfare or gifted with military talents, it was easy for a warrior who had gained a reputation for skill or valour to muster a band of hunters and start out on the warpath without notice. . . . There arose in consequence a group of warrior chiefs who attained considerable influence and sometimes rivalled the sachems themselves. It was the warrior chiefs, indeed, not the sachems, who won most fame and honour during the Revolutionary War.' <sup id="cite_ref-100" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-100">[100]</a></sup> The same is true for non-hereditary leadership in warfare: 'The powers and duties of the sachems and chiefs were entirely of a civil character, and confined, by their organic laws, to the affairs of peace.

<p><b> ♠ Communal buildings ♣ present ♥ </b> Villages were mostly residential: 'Villages were built on elevated terraces in close proximity to streams or lakes and were secured by log palisades. Village populations ranged between 300 and 600 persons. Typically, an enclosed village included numerous longhouses and several acres of fields for growing crops; surrounding the village were several hundred more acres of fields for growing crops. Longhouses were constructed of log posts and poles and covered with a sheathing of elm bark; they averaged 25 feet in width and 80 feet in length, though some exceeded 200 feet in length. Villages were semi-permanent and in use year round. When soil fertility in the fields declined and firewood in the vicinity of the village became scarce the village was moved to a new site. This was a gradual process, with the new village being built as the old one was gradually abandoned. The settlements of the 5 tribes lay along an east-west axis were connected by a system of trails.' <sup id="cite_ref-109" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-109">[109]</a></sup> Sweat lodges located at the edge of the village fulfilled various functions: 'In the old days a small dome-shaped hut about four feet high and six feet in diameter  was built of bent saplings to be used for the sweat bath in the summer time. It did not disappear until some time in the nineteenth century. Heated stones piled in the hut were covered with water poured from a bark receptacle and clouds of steam surrounded the bather, producing a cleansing sweat. The bather then was rubbed with sand, and plunged into a nearby stream.' <sup id="cite_ref-110" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-110">[110]</a></sup> 'Sweat lodges were formerly a common feature of Indian settlements throughout the eastern woodlands. They were usually situated on the edge of the village near a stream where they served not only as a regular place of bathing, but provided also a retreat for the shaman and the men of the village who gathered there for ceremonies and recreation. The songs which the Medicine Company continues to sing among the modern Iroquois refer to prominent features of sweating, for example the rise and condensation of steam, juggling with hot rocks, and tossing songs across a fire; but the sweat lodge has not survived as a reservation institution.

The aggressive behavior the Iroquois exhibited towards their neighbors during the fur trade period has been interpreted by some as the result of their aim to protect and expand their middleman role. Others have suggested that the aggressive behavior of the Iroquois tribes was related to the scarcity of furs in their own territory and the resulting difficulty in obtaining European trade goods. According to this theory, the Iroquois warred primarily to obtain the trade goods of their neighbors in closer contact with Europeans.

<dl><dd><b> ♠ Roads ♣ absent ♥ </b> Morgan describes the system of trails used by the Iroquois: 'The principal villages of the Iroquois, in the days of aboriginal dominion, were connected by well-beaten trails.  These villages were so situated that the central trail, which started from the Hudson at the site of Albany, passed through those of the Mohawks and Oneidas; and, crossing the Onondaga valley and the Cayuga country, a few miles north of the chief settlements of these nations, it passed through the most prominent villages of the Senecas, in its route to the valley of the Genesee. After crossing this celebrated valley, it proceeded westward to lake Erie, coming out upon it at the mouth of Buffalo creek, on the present site of Buffalo.' <sup id="cite_ref-122" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-122">[122]</a></sup> 'We have thus followed the great Indian trail, Wä-a-gwen[unknown] -ne-yu,   through the State, from the Hudson to lake Erie; noticing, as far as ascertained, the principal stopping-places on the route. To convey an adequate impression of the forest scenery, which then overspread the land, is beyond the power of description. This trail was traced through the over-hanging forest for almost its entire length. In the trail itself, there was nothing particularly remarkable. It was usually from twelve to eighteen inches wide, and deeply worn in the ground; varying in this respect from three to six, and even twelve inches, depending upon the firmness of the soil. The large trees on each side were frequently marked with the hatchet.  This well-beaten footpath,  which no runner, nor band of warriors could mistake, had doubtless been trodden by successive generations from  century to century. It had, without question, been handed down from race to race, as the natural line of travel, geographically considered, between the Hudson and lake Erie. While it is scarcely possible to ascertain a more direct route than the one pursued by this trail, the accuracy with which it was traced from point to point, to save distance, is extremely surprising. It proved, on the survey of the country, to have been so judiciously selected that the turnpike was laid out mainly on the line of this trail, from one extremity of the State to the other.

The Longhouse is furnished with two rows of benches along both long walls with additional benches along the short walls (fig. 10). This arrangement provides seating while leaving most of the floor space available for the dancing that is such an important part of the ritual. Most commonly, seating is by age and sex, the women and young children sitting on the benches on both sides at one end of the Longhouse and the men on those at the other end (fig. 11). If the musicians for a dance are to be seated, benches are placed in the middle of the Longhouse for them.

In 1816 Eleazar Williams, an adopted Mohawk catechist and layreader (see “Oneida,” this vol.), visited the Onondagas. Inthat and the following year, a few Onondagas were [Page 497] baptized by Episcopalian clergymen, and subsequentlysome attended the church at Onondaga Hill (Clark 1849,1:238-240). About the same time, a local Presbyterian minister also proselytized among the Onondagas, and in1821 there were said to be 34 who professed Christianityin the Presbyterian form of worship. In 1820 a schooltaught by a Stockbridge woman opened, but the teacherdied a few years later (J. Morse 1822:323-324, 394; Clark1849, 1:240-241). About 1828 a Quaker opened anindustrial school and stayed for six or seven years(Fletcher 1888:551). Nevertheless, there remained considerableopposition to Christian missionaries, and aftera Methodist church was established at Oneida in 1829, Indian exhorters rather than ministers were appointed tovisit Onondaga as the Onondagas remained hostile toChristianity (Clark 1849, 1:241).' <sup id="cite_ref-127" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-127">[127]</a></sup> 'What them was the impotus for change?

<dd><b> ♠ Burial site ♣ present ♥ </b> Cemeteries were associated with particular clans: 'Seasonal return to hunting and fishing economy meant that Iroquois villages were abandoned periodically. From the harvest to midwinter, families went to the woods to hunt for meat, seeking hunting partners in settlements adjacent to hunting grounds. Villages were again evacuated in early spring: (1) a short removal to the nearby sugar bush for several weeks, (2) for a longer period in March and April to attend pigeon nestings, and (3) to nearby fishing sites. In all these activities a semblance of local organization was maintained. Village and tribal holdings in sugar bush, pigeon nesting sites, and fishing places formed a continuous territory with the farm and ordinary hunting lands of the village. Major pigeon nestings and longterm fall hunts were carried on at some remove from the village settlements and required the movement of persons from say Buffalo some 70 or 80 miles to south of Warren, Pa. (Fenton and Deardorff, 1943, p. 296 and map). Villages tended to move within rather narrow orbits, quite definitely within the above territory, moving to perhaps a day's walk from the old settlement, frequently the “old town” giving way to the “new town” as a gradual development of one out of the other. At earlier times the movements were more abrupt (Fenton, 1940). Use of hunting territory, fishing sites, berrying grounds, and medicinal plant stations were deemed local privileges belonging to the inhabitants of that place. Ultimately, such ownership rested in the tribe or “nation.” To this day the title of lands rests in the nation; nothing like the Algonquian type of individual hunting territories was known. A Cayuga hunter, however, was careful to leave the pelt in the Seneca nation's territory, vouchsafing a privilege which was not extended to alien tribes outside the League. Similarly the use of fields and cemeteries will redound to local inhabitants. To the extent that coresidents are related unilaterally,  clan fields will adjoin; cemeteries will contain the bones of predominately one clan.' <sup id="cite_ref-129" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-129">[129]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b> ♠ Couriers ♣ present ♥ </b> Messages were transmitted by 'runners' or couriers: 'A brief reference to Indian runners will not be in appropriate in this connection. To convey intelligence from nation to nation, and to spread information throughout the Confederacy, as in summoning councils upon public exigencies, trained runners were employed. But three days were necessary, it is said, to convey intelligence from Buffalo to Albany. Swiftness of foot was an acquirement, among the Iroquois, which brought the individual into high repute. A trained runner would traverse a hundred miles per day. With  relays, which were sometimes resorted to, the length of the day's journey could be considerably increased. It is said that the runners of Montezuma conveyed intelligence to him of the movements of Cortes, at the rate of two hundred miles per day; but this must be regarded as extravagant. During the last war, a runner left Tonawanda at daylight in the summer season, for Avon, a distance of forty miles upon the trail. He delivered his message, and reached Tonawanda again about noon. In the night their runners were guided by the stars, from which they learned to keep their direction, and regain it, if perchance they lost their way. During the fall and winter, they determined their course by the Pleiades, or Seven Stars. This group in the neck of Taurus, they called Got-gwär[unknown] -där.   In the spring and summer they ran by another group, which they named Gwe-o-gä[unknown] -ah,   or the Loon, four stars at the angles of a rhombus. In preparing to carry messages they denuded themselves entirely, with the exception of the Gä-kä[unknown] -ah,   or breech cloth, and a belt. They were usually sent out in pairs, and took their way through the forest, one behind the other, in perfect silence.' <sup id="cite_ref-149" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-149">[149]</a></sup> 'If the envoy of a foreign people desired to submit a proposition to the sachems of the League, and applied to the Senecas for that purpose, the sachems of that nation would first determine whether the question was of sufficient importance to authorize a council. If they arrived at an affirmative conclusion, they immediately sent out runners to the Cayugas, the nation nearest in position, with a belt of wampum. This belt announced that, on a certain day thereafter, at such a place, and for such and such purposes, mentioning them, a council of the League would assemble. The Cayugas then notified the Onondagas, they the Oneidas, and these the Mohawks.  Each nation, within its own confines, spread the information far and wide; and thus, in a space of time astonishingly brief, intelligence of the council was heralded from one extremity of their country to the other. It produced a stir among the people in proportion to the magnitude and importance of the business to be transacted. If the subject was calculated to arouse a deep feeling of interest, one common impulse from the Hudson to the Niagara, and from the St. Lawrence to the Susquehanna, drew them towards the council-fire. Sachems, chiefs and warriors, women, and  even children, deserted their hunting grounds and woodland seclusions, and taking the trail, literally flocked to the place of council. When the day arrived, a multitude had gathered together, from the most remote and toilsome distances, but yet animated by an unyielding spirit of hardihood and endurance.' <sup id="cite_ref-150" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-150">[150]</a></sup> 'Upon the death of a sachem the nation in which the loss had occurred had power to summon a council, and designate the day and place. If the Oneidas, for example, had lost a ruler, they sent out runners at the earliest convenient day, with “belts of invitation” to the sachems of the League, and to the people at large, to assemble around their national council-fire at Gä-no-a-lo[unknown] -häle.  The invitation was circulated in the same manner, and with the same celerity as in convoking a civil council. These belts or the strings of wampum, sent out on such occasions, conveyed a laconic inessage: “the name” of the deceased “calls for a council.” It also announced the place and the time.' <sup id="cite_ref-151" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-151">[151]</a></sup></dd>

To convey an adequate impression of the forest scenery, which then overspread the land, is beyond the power of description. This trail was traced through the over-hanging forest for almost its entire length. In the trail itself, there was nothing particularly remarkable. It was usually from twelve to eighteen inches wide, and deeply worn in the ground; varying in this respect from three to six, and even twelve inches, depending upon the firmness of the soil. The large trees on each side were frequently marked with the hatchet.  This well-beaten footpath,  which no runner, nor band of warriors could mistake, had doubtless been trodden by successive generations from  century to century. It had, without question, been handed down from race to race, as the natural line of travel, geographically considered, between the Hudson and lake Erie. While it is scarcely possible to ascertain a more direct route than the one pursued by this trail, the accuracy with which it was traced from point to point, to save distance, is extremely surprising. It proved, on the survey of the country, to have been so judiciously selected that the turnpike was laid out mainly on the line of this trail, from one extremity of the State to the other. In addition to this, all the larger cities and villages west of the Hudson, with one or two exceptions, have been located upon it. As an independent cause, this forest highway of the Iroquois doubtless determined the establishment of a number of settlements, which have since grown up into cities and villages.' <sup id="cite_ref-153" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-153">[153]</a></sup> 'The principal villages of the Iroquois, in the days of aboriginal dominion, were connected by well-beaten trails.  These villages were so situated that the central trail, which started from the Hudson at the site of Albany, passed through those of the Mohawks and Oneidas; and, crossing the Onondaga valley and the Cayuga country, a few miles north of the chief settlements of these nations, it passed through the most prominent villages of the Senecas, in its route to the valley of the Genesee. After crossing this celebrated valley, it proceeded westward to lake Erie, coming out upon it at the mouth of Buffalo creek, on the present site of Buffalo.' <sup id="cite_ref-154" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-154">[154]</a></sup></dd></dl>

</p><p>NB: A general issue in coding this section is the lack of any indication by the sources concerning military technology as to which time period they refer to. Whilst a wide range of weapons were certainly present in the pre-contact period, other sources suggest that the use of traditional weapons had been almost entirely superseded by European weapons obtained through trade: "Before the arrival of Europeans the primary weapons were bows and arrows, stone axes and knives and blowguns, however, by the late seventeenth century European trade goods had almost completely replaced the traditional weapons and tools." <sup id="cite_ref-155" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-155">[155]</a></sup>. We have assumed here that most 'traditional' weapons, though augmented with imported metals, were in some form of active use until the early 18th century, despite of the introduction of firearms. This view is open to re-evaluation.

When the Indian went forth to war, he emphatically took his life in his hand, knowing that if he should be taken it was forfeited by the laws of war; and if saved by adoption, his country, at least, was lost forever. From the foundation of the Confederacy, the custom of adoption has prevailed among the Iroquois, who carried this principle farther, than other Indian nations. It was not confined to captives alone, but was extended to fragments of dismembered tribes, and even to the admission of independent nations into the League." <sup id="cite_ref-236" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-236">[236]</a></sup> This appears as a form of enslavement, so coded here

Controlling their passions, the organized raiding parties did not indulge in wholesale massacres and, except for one incident during Sullivan's campaign, they abstained from orgies of cruelty. There were inevitably isolated incidents where individuals bent solely on plunder, revenge, or sadistic enjoyment did commit some atrocities.

We have therefore decied to code for different sets of rituals. The below codes were largely based on colonial-period data and thus on inference. They are accordingly open to review.
</p><p>The following general description was extracted from eHRAF: 'The supernatural world of the Iroquois included numerous deities, the most important of which was Great Spirit, who was responsible for the creation of men, the plants and, animals and the forces of good in nature. The Iroquois believed that Great Spirit indirectly guided the lives of ordinary men. Other important deities were Thunderer and the Three Sisters, the spirits of Maize, Beans and Squash. Opposing the Great Spirit and the other forces of good were Evil Spirit and other lesser spirits responsible for disease and other misfortune. In the Iroquois view ordinary humans could not communicate directly with Great Spirit, but could do so indirectly by burning tobacco, which carried their prayers to the lesser spirits of good. The Iroquois regarded dreams as important supernatural signs and serious attention was given to interpreting dreams. It was believed that dreams expressed the desire of the soul and as a result the fulfillment of a dream was of paramount importance to the individual. Around 1800 a Seneca sachem named Handsome Lake received a series of visions which he believed showed the way for the Iroquois to regain their lost cultural integrity and promised supernatural aid to all those who followed him. The Handsome Lake religion emphasized many traditional elements of Iroquoian culture, but also incorporated Quaker beliefs and aspects of White culture. In the 1960s at least half of the Iroquoian people accepted the Handsome Lake religion.' <sup id="cite_ref-250" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-250">[250]</a></sup> 'Full time religious specialists were absent, however, there were part-time male and female specialists known as Keepers of the Faith whose primary responsibilities were to arrange and conduct the main religious ceremonies.

The first 5 festivals in this sequence involved public confessions followed by group ceremonies which included speeches by the Keepers of the Faith, tobacco offerings and prayer.

</p><p>Morgan provides a general introduction to Iroquois rituals and worship: 'The Iroquois had a systematic worship. It consisted in the celebration of periodical festivals, which were held at stated seasons of the year. These observances were suggested by the changes in the seasons, the ripening of the fruits, and the gathering of the harvest. They were performed annually, with the same established ceremonies, which had been handed down from age to age. The worship of the Iroquois, as before remarked, has undergone no change in centuries. It is still the same, in all essential particulars, that it was at the period of their discovery. Some slight additions, ascribable, doubtless, to missionary instructions, will be detected, but they are too inconsiderable to change the form, or disturb the harmony of the whole. Upon an examination of the principal features of the system, it will become apparent that it was chiefly a thanksgiving worship, although the supplication of the Great Spirit for the continuance of his protection entered into it as an essential element. Six regular festivals, or thanksgivings, were observed by the Iroquois. The first, in the order of [Page 176] time, was the Maple festival. This was a return of thanks to the maple itself, for yielding its sweet waters. Next was the Planting festival, designed, chiefly, as an invocation of the Great Spirit to bless the seed. Third came the Strawberry festival, instituted as a thanksgiving for the first fruits of the earth. The fourth was the Green Corn festival, designed as a thanksgiving acknowledgment for the ripening of the corn, beans and squashes. Next was celebrated the Harvest festival, instituted as a general thanksgiving to “Our Supporters,” after the gathering of the harvest. Last in the enumeration is placed the New Year's festival, the great jubilee of the lroquois, at which the white dog was sacrificed.' <sup id="cite_ref-254" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-254">[254]</a></sup> 'The principle involved in the formal worship of the Great Spirit at stated periods, and the fidelity with which the Iroquois, in prosperity and in adversity, adhered to these observances from generation to generation, are of much more importance in forming a judgment of their religious sentiments than the mere ceremonies themselves. In this constant recognition of their dependence upon the divine power, there is much to awaken a feeling of sympathy and a sentiment of respect for a people who, untaught by revelation, had reached such high conclusions. By assembling at periodical seasons to render their thanks to Hä-wen-ne[unknown] -yu for his gifts, they fully recognized the duty which rested upon them as the recipients of such favors. And, also, by supplicating the continuance of his watchful care, and by invoking his blessing upon their present acts, they manifested the sincerity of their faith, and the fulness [Page 177] of their trust in the great Author of their being. But the ceremonies themselves are not without a peculiar interest. They will convey to the mind a more distinct impression of the nature and simplicity of their worship. No attempt will be made to describe these observances with the minuteness of a picture. An outline of those appropriate to each festival will sufficiently illustrate their general character and purpose.' <sup id="cite_ref-255" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-255">[255]</a></sup> 'The question here presents itself as to the religious office or priesthood among the Iroquois. Under the League itself no sacerdotal office was recognized. Sachems were raised up, and invested with their titles by a council of all the sachems of the League. Chiefs were first raised up in the nation to which they belonged, and their title was afterwards confirmed by the same general council. But no religious dignitaries were ever raised up by the council of sachems to fill any priestly station. In each nation, however, there was a select class appointed by the several tribes to take the charge of their religious festivals, and the general supervision of their worship. They were styled Ho-nun-de[unknown] -ont, or “Keepers of the Faith,” as the term literally signifies. In the election of this class, their powers and duties, and the tenure of their office, there are many circumstances to distinguish them as a sacerdotal order. (53) To their number there was no limit, and they were usually about as numerous as the chiefs. The chiefs themselves were ex officio keepers of the fait 1. (65) The office was elective, and continued as long as the individual was faithful to his trust. Suitable persons were selected [Page 178] by the wise men and matrons out of their respective tribes, and advanced to the office. 1 Their original names were then taken away, and new ones assigned, out of a collection of names which belonged to this class. At the first subsequent council of the nation, their appointment and names were publicly announced, which in itself completed the investiture. The number furnished by each tribe was an evidence of its fidelity to the ancient faith. They were, to some extent, censors of the people; and their admonitions were received with kindness, as coming from those commissioned to remonstrate. In some cases they reported the evil deeds of individuals to the council, to make of them an example by exposure. Sometimes they held consultations to deliberate upon the moral condition of the people. It was the duty of every individual to accept the office when bestowed; but he could relinquish it at any moment by laying aside his new name and resuming his old. (68) It was their duty to designate the times for holding the periodical festivals, to make the necessary arrangements for their celebration, and to conduct the ceremonies. Certain ones of their number, by previous appointment, made the opening speech, and the thanksgiving address at the council, and also delivered religious discourses whenever they were deemed advisable. All of the members of this class were equal in authority and privileges. Those animated by the highest zeal and enthusiasm would naturally assume the most active charge; but they had no acknowledged head. The distribution of all powers, duties and offices among a number of equals was the prevailing [Page 179] feature of their civil polity. It was necessary that women as well as men should be appointed keepers of the faith, and about in equal numbers. To the matrons more particularly was intrusted the charge of the feast. The Iroquois never held a mourning or religious council, without preparing an entertainment for all the people in attendance on the evening of each day. None but those matrons who were keepers of the faith could take any part in its preparation. But their duties were not confined to the supervision of the feast. They had an equal voice in the general management of the festivals, and of all of their religious concernments. During a discourse or address, all the keepers of the faith acted, if necessary, as prompters to the speaker, and through him communicated to the people any injunction or precept which they deemed advisable. For this reason, one of their names as a class was that of “prompters.”' <sup id="cite_ref-256" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-256">[256]</a></sup> 'Notwithstanding the systematic organization of the keepers of the faith, and the precise limitation of their duties, there do not seem to be sufficient reasons for calling this class a religious order, or a priesthood, as these terms are usually understood. They were distinguished by no special privileges, except while in the act of discharging their prescribed duties; they wore no costume, or emblem of office, to separate them from the people. In fact they were common warriors, and common women, and, in every sense, of and among the people. The office was one of necessity, and was without reward, like all Indian offices of every name, and also without particular honor to the individual.' <sup id="cite_ref-257" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-257">[257]</a></sup>
</p><p>Morgan provides information on the various thanksgiving festivals associated with the agricultural cycle:
</p><p>'This was the first festival of the spring. It was usually called the Maple Dance. The primary idea of this ceremonial was to return thanks to the maple itself; but at the same time they rendered their thanks to the Great Spirit for the gift of the maple. It lasted but one day. When the sap began to flow, the keepers of the faith announced the time and place for commemorating the recurrence of this event, and summoned the people to assemble for that purpose. Some days before the time appointed for the festival, the people assembled for the mutual confession of their sins, both as an act of religious duty, and as a preparation for the council. This act preceded all the festivals; but it was more general and thorough at the three last than at the three first, as they were deemed more important, and continued for a greater length of time. This council, Sa-nun-dät-ha-wä[unknown] -ta, literally “a meeting for repentance,” was opened by one of the keepers of the faith, with an address upon the propriety and importance of acknowledging their evil deeds, to strengthen their minds against future temptations. He then took the string of white wampum in his hand, and set the example by a confession of his own faults; after which he handed the string to the one nearest to him, who received it, made his confession in like manner, and passed it to another. In this way the wampum went around from hand to hand; and those who had confessions to make stated wherein they had done wrong, and promised to do better in [Page 181] the future. Old and young, men, women, and even children all united in this public acknowledgment of their faults, and joined in the common resolution of amendment. On some occasions the string of wampum was placed in the centre of the room, and each one advanced in turn to perform the duty, as the inclination seized him. A confession and promise without holding the wampum would be of no avail. It was the wampum which recorded their words, and gave their pledge of sincerity. The object of the confession was future amendment. The Iroquois appear to have had no idea either of the atonement or of the forgiveness of sins. Meritorious acts neutralized evil deeds, but neither the one nor the other, when done, could be recalled, or changed, or obliterated.' <sup id="cite_ref-258" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-258">[258]</a></sup> 'The celebration of this festival was not limited to one particular place, but it was observed in all the villages of the several nations of the League, which were too remote to unite around the same council-fire. At the time appointed, the people gathered from the subjacent districts, some to offer religious admonitions, some prepared for the dance, others for the games, and still others for the enjoyment of the feast. It was one of their festive days, awakening the eagerness of expectation in the minds of all. On the morning of the day, the matrons, to whom the duty appertained, commenced the preparation of the customary feast for the people, which was as sumptaous as the season and the means of the hunter life would afford. Towards meridian, the out-door sports and games, which were common to such occasions, were suspended, and the people assembled in council. An opening speech was [Page 182] then delivered, by one of the keepers of the faith. The following, made at the opening of one of these councils among the Senecas, is in the usual form, and will illustrate their general chalacter:--' <sup id="cite_ref-259" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-259">[259]</a></sup> '“Friends and Relatives: -- The sun, the ruler of the day, is high in his path, and we must hasten to do our duty. We are assembled to observe an ancient custom. It is an institution handed down to us by our forefathers. It was given to them by the Great Spirit. He has ever required of his people to return thanks to him for all blessings received. We have always endeavored to live faithful to this wise command. “Friends and Relatives, continue to listen: -- It is to perform this duty that we are this day gathered. The season when the maple tree yields its sweet waters has again returned. We are all thankful that it is so. We therefore expect all of you to join in our general thanksgiving to the maple. We also expect you to join in a thanksgiving to the Great Spirit, who has wisely made this tree for the good of man. We hope and expect that order and harmony will prevail. “Friends and Relatives: -- We are gratified to see so many here, and we thank you all that you have thought well of this matter. We thank the Great Spirit, that he has been kind to so many of us, in sparing our lives to participate again in the festivities of this season. Na-bo[unknown] .” Other speeches often followed, which were in the nature of exhortations to duty. These occasions were seized upon by their moral teachers, to inculcate anew the precepts of their faith, and to offer admonitions for their spiritual guidance. One of the keepers of [Page 183] the faith, addressing the people at such a time, would inculcate the virtues which became a warrior, and unfold the duties which were incumbent upon them as members of one common brotherhood. The duty of living in harmony and peace, of avoiding evil speaking, of kindness to the orphan, of charity to the needy, and of hospitality to all, would be among the prominent topics brought under consideration. He would remind them that the Great Spirit noticed and rewarded good acts, and that those who hoped for success in the affairs of life, should be ready to do them whenever occasion offered; that those who had done wrong should not be treated harshly; that enmities were not to be contracted, lest a spirit of revenge should be awakened, which would never sleep; and finally, that those who pursued the right path would never fall into trouble.' <sup id="cite_ref-260" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-260">[260]</a></sup> 'When these speeches and exhortations were concluded, the dance, which was a prominent feature of their religious festivals, was announced. It is proper here to observe, that dancing was regarded by the Iroquois as an appropriate mode of worship. They regarded the dance as a perpetual outward ceremonial of thanksgiving to the Great Spirit. A belief prevailed among them that the custom was of divine origin. “The Great Spirit knew the Indian could not live without some amusement, therefore he originated the idea of dancing, which he gave to them.” 1 The dance set apart in a peculiar manner for the worship of the Great Spirit, at their festivals, was one of their [Page [facing p. 184]] [Page 184] own invention; and the most spirited, graceful and beautiful in their list. It is known as the Great Feather Dance ( O-sto-weh[unknown] -go-wä ). It was performed by a select band, in full costume, and was reserved exclusively for religious councils and for great occasions. It lasted about an hour, never failing to arouse a deep spirit of enthusiastic excitement. Before the band came in, one of the keepers of the faith made a brief speech, explanatory of its origin, nature and objects; in which the popular belief was interwoven, that this dance would be enjoyed by the faithful in the future life, in the realm of the Great Spirit, to whose worship it was especially consecrated.' <sup id="cite_ref-261" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-261">[261]</a></sup> 'After the conclusion of this dance others followed, in which all participated. Before they were ended, the usual thanksgiving address to the Great Spirit, with the burning of tobacco, was made. In ancient times the Maple festival was terminated with these dances. One of the keepers of the faith made a closing speech, after which the people partook of the feast, and separated for their respective homes. There is a popular belief among the Iroquois that the early part of the day is dedicated to the Great Spirit, and the after part to the spirits of the dead; consequently their religious services should properly be concluded at meridian. They still retain the theory, and to this day religious discourses are seldom continued after noon; but in practice it was found impossible, from the tardiness of the people in assembling, to conclude the ceremonies of the festival before twilight. A further innovation was made many years ago by [Page 185] devoting the evenings of these festive days to dancing, for the entertainment of guests from other villages or nations, who chanced to be with them. This became, in time, the universal custom, and they now continue the practice for their own amusement. These evening entertainments, however, in strictness, form no part of the festival, although apparently it is one proceeding from the opening of the council until late at night, when the entertainment is ended. A distinction should constantly be held in view, between their proper religious exercises, and their amusements, and also between the ancient mode of celebrating these festivals, and the modern. The regular religious ceremonies at the Maple festival consisted of the opening discourse by one of the keepers of the faith, the exhortations of others, the Feather dance, the thanksgiving address to the Great Spirit, with the incense of tobacco, two or three other dances, the closing speech, and the feast in common.' <sup id="cite_ref-262" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-262">[262]</a></sup> 'In ancient times these ceremonies were concluded at meridian, but in modern times at twilight. Formerly all the exercises at these festivals were of a strictly religious character, except certain games which were common to these occasions. But in later times other dances have been added, and also an evening entertainment devoted exclusively to dancing. There were likewise certain games of chance, sports, and athletic games, common to all these festivals, which yet formed no part of their religious ceremonies. They were merely outside diversions for the people. Still the Maple festival, as celebrated at the present day among the descendants of the ancient Iroquois, is [Page 186] the same, in its essential features, as at the period of its institution.' <sup id="cite_ref-263" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-263">[263]</a></sup>
</p><p>'This word signifies “the planting season.” When this time arrived another festival was held to celebrate the event. It continued but one day. In its observances there was nothing to distinguish it very materially from the Maple festival. A description is therefore unnecessary, except to point out some peculiarities. The object of this festival was two-fold: to render thanks to the Great Spirit for the return of the planting season, and to invoke his blessing upon the seed which they had committed to the earth, that it might yield an abundant harvest. The Indian had no Sabbath, no sacred writings to furnish him an inexhaustible fountain of instruction; but his gratitude was awakened by every returning manifestation of divine goodness. When nature had reclothed herself in the vestments of spring, and the teeming earth invited him to commit the seeds to her bosom, he recognized in the event the watchful kindness of the Great Spirit. There is something eminently spiritual and beautiful in this Indian conception of the natural periods of worship. Seizing upon the moment when the most conspicuous evidences of the protecting care of the Deity were before him, he acknowledged both his existence and his beneficence, [Page 187] and manifested, at the same time, his gratitude and devotion, by those simple rites which the piety of his heart suggested.' <sup id="cite_ref-264" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-264">[264]</a></sup> 'At the time appointed by the keepers of the faith, the people assembled to observe the day. After the speeches were over, the Feather and other dances were performed, as at the Maple festival. In ancient times, the thanksgiving address, or prayer to the Great Spirit, with the burning of tobacco, was confined to the last three, or the principal festivals; but in later days such a prayer was offered generally at the first three also. As elsewhere observed, when the Iroquois returned thanks to the various objects in nature which ministered to their wants, or when they acknowledged to each other their thankfulness to the Great Spirit, or to the lesser Spirits, they never burned tobacco. In these cases, their thanks were returned to the trees and plants and elements direct, to do which, according to their theology, did not require the use of incense, while, as to the spiritual world, they merely avowed to each other that they returned their thanks. But when they offered a prayer, or called upon the Great Spirit, or his Invisible Aids, they were obliged to use the ascending smoke to put themselves in communication with the spiritual world. This address occurred at no particular stage in the ceremonies of the day. The keepers of the faith having appointed one of their number to perform this duty, the person designated selected a suitable moment for its delivery. Advancing to the fire prepared for the purpose, he called the attention of the people by an exclamation, which was the known precursor of [Page 188] this address. Having sprinkled a few leaves of Indian tobacco upon the fire, he addressed Hä-wen-ne[unknown] -yu, as the smoke ascended. The ollowing, delivered at a Planting festival among the Senecas, will illustrate the general character of these prayers or thanksgiving addresses:--' <sup id="cite_ref-265" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-265">[265]</a></sup> '“Great Spirit, who dwellest alone, listen now to the words of thy people here assembled. The smoke of our offering arises. Give kind attention to our words, as they arise to thee in the smoke. We thank thee for this return of the planting season. Give to us a good season, that our crops may be plentiful. “Continue to listen, for the smoke yet arises. (Throwing on tobacco.) Preserve us from all pestilential diseases. Give strength to us all that we may not fall. Preserve our old men among us, and protect the young. Help us to celebrate with feeling the ceremonies of this season. Guide the minds of thy people, that they may remember thee in all their actions. Na-bo[unknown] . ” There was nothing further to distinguish this festival from the former. If, after the planting season, a drought should come upon the land, threatening a failure of the harvest, a special council was frequently called, to invoke He[unknown] -no, the Thunderer, to send rain upon the earth. Before the time appointed for this council, the people assembled, as before other festivals, for mutual confession. They feared, as they expressed it, “that some of their number had done some great wrong, for which the Great Spirit was angry with them, and withheld the rain as a merited punishment.” After this special council was opened in the usual form, the Thanksgiving [Page 189] dance, and the Ah-d[unknown] -web, hereafter to be described, were introduced, which were supposed to be peculiarly acceptable to He[unknown] -no. At a proper time, in the progress of these ceremonies, the keeper of the faith, who had been appointed as usual, advanced to the fire, and having laid on the leaves of tobacco, and gained the attention of the people, he made the following invocation of the Thunderer, as the incense ascended:--' <sup id="cite_ref-266" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-266">[266]</a></sup> '“ He[unknown] -no, our Grandfather, listen now to the words of thy grandchildren. We feel grieved. Our minds are sorely troubled. We fear Our Supporters will fail, and bring famine upon us. We ask our Grandfather that he may come, and give us rain, that the earth may not dry up, and refuse to produce for our support. Thy grandchildren all send their salutations to their grandfather, He[unknown] -no. ” Then taking another handful of tobacco, and placing it upon the fire, he changed the address to Hä-wen-ne[unknown] -yu: -- “Great Spirit: listen to the words of thy suffering children. They come to thee with pure minds. If they have done wrong, they have confessed, and turned their minds, (at the same time holding up the string of white wampum with which the confession was recorded.) Be kind to us. Hear our grievances, and supply our wants. Direct that He[unknown] -no may come, and give us rain, that Our Supporters may not fail us, and bring famine to our homes. Na-bo[unknown] . ” After concluding the dance the assembly was dismissed.' <sup id="cite_ref-267" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-267">[267]</a></sup>
</p><p>'In the progress of the seasons, next came the Strawberry, the first fruit of the earth. The Iroquois [Page [facing p. 190]] [Page 190] seized upon this spontaneous gift of nature for their sustenance as another suitable occasion for a thanksgiving festival. By such ceremonials they habituated their minds to a recognition of the providential care of Hä-wen-ne[unknown] -yu; cultivating, at the same time, a grateful spirit for the constant return of his gifts. The observances at this festival were the same as those at the Maple, with a sufficient variation of terms to designate the particular occasion. It was concluded with a feast of strawberries. The berries were prepared with maple sugar, in capacious bark trays, in the form of a jelly; and in this condition the people feasted upon this great luxury of nature.' <sup id="cite_ref-268" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-268">[268]</a></sup> 'The ripening of the Whortleberry was often made the occasion of another festival. It was in all respects like the last, the only difference consisting in the fact, that the former was an acknowledgment for the first fruit of plants, and the latter for the first fruit of trees.' <sup id="cite_ref-269" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-269">[269]</a></sup>
</p><p>'The word from which this takes its name signifies “a feast.” It continued four days, the proceedings of each being different in most particulars, but each one terminating with a feast. When the green corn became fit for use, the season of plenty with the Indian had emphatically arrived. They made it another occasion of general thanksgiving to the Great Spirit, and of feasting and rejoicing among themselves. Corn has ever been the staple article-of consumption among the Iroquois. They cultivated this plant, and also the bean and the [Page [facing p. 191]] [Page 191] squash, before the formation of the League. From the most remote period to which tradition reaches, the knowledge of the cultivation and use of these plants has been handed down among them. 1 They raised sufficient quantities of each to supply their utmost wants, preparing them for food in a great variety of ways, and making them at least the basis of their sustenance. (19) In their own mode of expressing the idea, these plants are mentioned together, under the figurative name of “Our Life,” or “Our Supporters.” It cannot, therefore, be affirmed with correctness, that the Indian subsisted principally by the chase. (84) After the formation of the League, they resided in permanent villages, and within certain well-defined territorial limits. The fruits of the chase then became a secondary, although a necessary means of subsistence.' <sup id="cite_ref-270" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-270">[270]</a></sup> 'On the first day of this festival, after the introductory speeches had been made, the Feather dance, the thanksgiving address, with the burning of tobacco, [Page 192] and three or four other dances, made up the principal religious exercises. This address was introduced in the midst of one of the dances which succeeded the first. One more specimen of these brief prayers of the Iroquois, as made by the Senecas, will be furnished. Having placed the leaves of tobacco on the fire, as usual, the keeper of the faith thus addressed Hä-wen-ne[unknown] -yu: --' <sup id="cite_ref-271" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-271">[271]</a></sup> '“Great Spirit in heaven, listen to our words. We have assembled to perform a sacred duty, as thou hast commanded. This institution has descended to us from our fathers. We salute thee with our thanks, that thou hast preserved so many of us another year, to participate in the ceremonies of this occasion.
“Great Spirit, continue to listen: We thank thee for thy great goodness in causing our mother, the earth, again to bring forth her fruits. We thank thee that thou hast caused Our Supporters to yield abundantly. “Great Spirit, our words still continue to flow towards thee. (Throwing on tobacco). Preserve us from all danger. Preserve our aged men. Preserve our mothers. Preserve our warriors. Preserve our children. We burn this tobacco; may its smoke arise to thee. May our thanks, ascending with it, be pleasing to thee. Give wisdom to the keepers of the faith, that they may direct these ceremonies with propriety. Strengthen our warriors, that they may celebrate with pleasure the sacred dances of thy appointment. “Great Spirit; the council here assembled, the aged men and women, the strong warriors, the women and children, unite their voice of thanksgiving to thee. Na-bo! ”' <sup id="cite_ref-272" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-272">[272]</a></sup> 'Before partaking of the feast, 1 the people went out to witness some of those games which were often introduced, as an amusement, to accompany the other exercises of these festive days. The second day commenced with the usual address, after which they had the Thanksgiving dance, Gä-na[unknown] -o-ub, which was the principal religious exercise of the day. This dance was not necessarily a costume performance, although it was usually given by a select band in full dress. In figure, step, and music, it was precisely like the Feather dance, the chief difference between them being the introduction of short thanksgiving speeches between the songs of the dance. This dance is fully explained elsewhere; but it is proper to say, to make it intelligible here, that the music consisted of a series of thanksgiving songs, performed by select singers, who accompanied themselves with turtleshell rattles, to mark time. Each song lasted about two minutes, during which the band danced around the room, in column, with great animation. When the song ceased, the dancers walked around the council-house, about the same length of time, to the beat of the rattles. The thanksgiving speeches were made during these intervals between the songs. A person arose, and perhaps thanked the Maple as follows: “We return thanks to the Maple, which yields its sweet waters for the good of man.” Again the dance was resumed, and another song danced out, after which another speech was made by some other person, perhaps as follows: “We return thanks to the bushes and trees, which provide us with fruit.” The dance was then resumed as before. In this manner the [Page 194] thanksgiving speeches, the songs and the dance were continued, until all the prominent objects in nature had been made the subjects of special notice. There were always set speeches introduced with the Thanksgiving dance, at the Green Corn and Harvest festivals, and they formed a conspicuous part of the worship of the Iroquois. These speeches, or the principal ones, may be collected into one, for the purpose of showing the range of subjects taken; yet it must be borne in mind that each object formed the subject of a separate speech, and was followed by a thanksgiving song, adapted to the case, which the band danced through. It may be proper further to add, that these speeches were consolidated to form the principal part of the annual thanksgiving address to the Great Spirit, made at the burning of the White Dog. The following is their natural order:--' <sup id="cite_ref-273" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-273">[273]</a></sup> '“We return thanks to our mother, the earth, which sustains us. We return thanks to the rivers and streams, which supply us with water. We return thanks to all herbs, which furnish medicines for the cure of our diseases. We return thanks to the corn, and to her sisters, the beans and squashes, which give us life. We return thanks to the bushes and trees, which provide us with fruit. We return thanks to the wind, which, moving the air, has banished diseases. We return thanks to the moon and stars, which have given to us their light when the sun was gone. We return thanks to our grandfather He[unknown] -no, that he has protected his grandchildren from witches and reptiles, and has given to us his rain. We return thanks to the sun, that he has looked upon [Page 195] the earth with a beneficent eye. Lastly, we return thanks to the Great Spirit, in whom is embodied all goodness, and who directs all things for the good of his children.”' <sup id="cite_ref-274" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-274">[274]</a></sup> 'After the conclusion of the Thanksgiving dance, two or three other dances followed, and after them the feast, with which the exercises of the day were concluded. The third morning was set apart for a thanksgiving concert, called the Ah-do[unknown] -weh, which constituted the chief ceremony of the day. The council was opened by an introductory speech by one of the keepers of the faith, upon its nature, objects, and institution. This novelty in their worship was a succession of short speeches made by different persons, one after another, returning thanks to a great variety of objects, each one following his speech with an appropriate song, the words of which were of his own composing, and oftentimes the music also. In a chorus to each song all the people joined, thus sending forth a united anthem of praise. They passed through the whole range of natural objects, thanking each one directly, as in the Thanksgiving dance; but they were not in the Ah-do[unknown] -weh confined either to the natural or to the spiritual world. Acts of kindness, personal achievements, political events, in a word, all the affairs of public and private life were open on this occasion to the indulgence of the grateful affections. Oftentimes one or two hours were consumed, before the people had all expressed their thanks to each other for personal favors, to the works of nature for their constant ministration to their wants, and to the Great Spirit and [Page 196] the “Invisible Aids” for their protecting care. Many of the speeches on these occasions, especially those which referred to objects in the natural world, were the same from year. But those which grew out of their private relations would vary with circumstances. This was esteemed one of their highest religious exercises, and it always continued to be one of their favorite observances. When the Ah-do[unknown] -weh was concluded, two or three dances were generally introduced before the enjoyment of the feast, with which, as before remarked, each day's proceedings were terminated.' <sup id="cite_ref-275" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-275">[275]</a></sup> 'On the fourth day, the festival was concluded with the peach-stone game, Gus-gä[unknown] -a, a game of chance, on which they bet profusely, and to which they were extravagantly attached. It was not in the nature of a religious exercise, but a favorite entertainment, with which to terminate the Green Corn ceremonial. It is elsewhere described. It should be held in the memory, that at the period of the institution of their religious festivals, they were concluded at meridian; during the middle period of their history, they were continued until towards twilight; but in modern times, an evening entertainment, in the way of dancing, always follows each day of the festival, so long as it continues, although it forms no part of their religious observances. It may be further observed, that at the present time, this festival lasts but three days, the proceedings of the third and fourth being completed on the former day. At the close of each day, 1 the people regaled themselves upon a sumptuous feast of succotash. This [Page 197] was always the entertainment at the green corn season. It was made of corn, beans and squashes, and was always a favorite article of food with the red man. It may be well to state in this connection, that among the Iroquois at the present day, they do not sit down together to a common repast, except at religious councils of unusual interest. The feast, after being prepared at the place of council, is distributed at its close, and carried by the women, in vessels brought for the purpose, to their respective homes, where it is enjoyed by each family at their own fireside. But when the people feasted together after the ancient fashion, as they still do occasionally, they selected the hour of twilight. The huge kettles of soup, or hommony, or succotash, as the case might be, were brought into their midst, smoking from the fire. Before partaking of this evening banquet, they never omitted to say grace, which, with them, was a simple ceremonial, but in perfect harmony with their mode of worship. It was a prolonged exclamation, upon a high key, by the solitary voice of one of the keepers of the faith, followed by a swelling chorus from the multitude, upon a lower note. It was designed as an acknowledgment to each other of their gratitude to the great Giver of the feast.' <sup id="cite_ref-276" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-276">[276]</a></sup>
</p><p>'After the gathering of the harvest, the Iroquois held another general thanksgiving for four days. It was the last in the year, as the New Year's observances were not of the same general character. The [Page 198] name given to this festival signifies “Thanksgiving to Our Supporters.” It was instituted primarily to return thanks to the corn, beans and squashes, which are always characterized by the Iroquois under this figurative name. Also, to the triad of Spirits, who are so intimately connected in their minds with the plants themselves, that they are nearly inseparable. The resulting object, however, of all these Indian rites, was the praise of Hä-wen-ne[unknown] -yu. Nature having matured and poured forth her stores for their sustenance, they instituted this ceremonial as a perpetual acknowledgment of their gratitude for each returning harvest.' <sup id="cite_ref-277" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-277">[277]</a></sup> 'In the mode of summoning this council, and in the religious ceremonies, and concluding festivities of each day, it so closely resembled the Green Corn worship, that a separate description is rendered unnecessary. These religious councils were seasons of animation and excitement. The greater activity in social intercourse among the people, generally awakened by these ceremonies and festivities, contributed largely to keep up the spirit of these occasions. In the evening, as soon as the twilight hour was passed, the people gathered for the dance, as this entertainment, since the innovation before referred to, always follows the religious ceremonies of each day. The Iroquois have numerous dances, and to the practice itself they have always been extravagantly addicted. On such occasions the passion was gratified by a free indulgence, and the hours of the night passed by unheeded. With the Iroquois in their festivities, as with more refined communities, neither the admonition of the setting stars, [Page 199] nor of the fallen dew, “counselled sleep.” Not, perhaps, until the faint light of approaching day illumined the east, did the spirit of enjoyment decline, and the last murmur of the dispersing council finally subside.' <sup id="cite_ref-278" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-278">[278]</a></sup>
</p><p>Morgan also describes new year's ceremonies:
</p><p>'The name given to this festival literally signifies “The most excellent faith,” or “The supreme belief.” 1 Among the ceremonies incident to the worship of the Iroquois, the most novel were those which ushered in the new year. In mid-winter, usually about the first of February, this religious celebration was held. It continued for seven successive days, revealing, in its various ceremonials, nearly every feature of their religious system. The prominent act which characterized this jubilee, and which, perhaps, indicated what they understood by “The most excellent faith,” was the burning of the White Dog, on the fifth day of the festival. This annual sacrifice of the Iroquois has long been known, attracting at various times considerable attention. But the true principle involved in it appears not to have been rightly understood. In the sequel, it will be found to be a very simple and tangible idea, harmonizing fully with their system of faith and worship. Several days before the time appointed for the jubilee, the people assembled for the confession of their sins. On this occasion they were more thorough [Page 200] in the work than at any other season, that they might enter upon the new year with a firm purpose of amendment. This council not unfrequently lasted three days, before all the people had performed this act of religious duty.' <sup id="cite_ref-279" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-279">[279]</a></sup> 'The observances of the new year were commenced on the day appointed, by two of the keepers of the faith, who visited every house in and about the Indian village, morning and evening. They were disguised in bear skins or buffalo robes, which were secured around their heads with wreaths of corn-husks, and then gathered in loose folds about the body. Wreaths of corn-husks were also adjusted around their arms and ankles. They were robed in this manner, and painted by the matrons, who, like themselves, were keepers of the faith, and by them were they commissioned to go forth in this formidable attire, to announce the commencement of the jubilee. Taking corn-pounders in their hands, they went out in company, on the morning of the day, to perform their duty. Upon entering a house, they saluted the inmates in a formal manner, after which, one of them, striking upon the floor, to restore silence and secure attention, thus addressed them: --“Listen, Listen, Listen: -- The ceremonies which the Great Spirit has commanded us to perform, are about to commence. Prepare your houses. Clear away the rubbish. Drive out all evil animals. We wish nothing to hinder or obstruct the coming observances. We enjoin upon every one to obey our requirements. Should any of your friends be taken sick and die, we command you not to mourn for them, nor allow any of your friends to mourn. But lay the body aside, [Page 201] and enjoy the coming ceremonies with us. When they are over, we will mourn with you.” 1' <sup id="cite_ref-280" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-280">[280]</a></sup> 'After singing a short thanksgiving song, they passed out. In the afternoon this visit was repeated in the same manner. After saluting the family as before, one of the keepers of the faith thus addressed them: --“My Nephews, my Nephews, my Nephews: -- We now announce to you that the New Year's ceremonies have commenced, according to our ancient custom. You are, each of you, now required to go forth, and participate in their observance. This is the will of the Great Spirit. Your first duty will be to prepare your wooden blades ( Gä-ger-we-sä[unknown] ) with which to stir up the ashes upon your neighbors' hearths. Then return to the Great Spirit your individual thanks for the return of this season, and for the enjoyment of this privilege.” Having sung another song, appropriate to the occasion, they departed finally, and when they had in this way made the circuit of the village, the ceremonies of the first day were concluded. On the first day, however, the White Dog was strangled. (96) They selected a dog, free from physical [Page 202] blemish, and of a pure white, if such an one could be found. The white deer, white squirrel, and other chance animals of the albino kind, were regarded as consecrated to the Great Spirit. White was the Iroquois emblem of purity and of faith. In strangling the dog, they were careful neither to shed his blood nor break his bones. The dog was then spotted, in places, over his body and limbs, with red paint, and ornamented with feathers in various ways. Around his neck was hung a string of white wampum, the pledge of their sincerity. In modern times, the dog is ornamented with a profusion of many-colored rib-bons, which are adjusted around his body and limbs. 1 The ornaments placed upon the dog were the voluntary offerings of the pious; and for each gift thus bestowed, the giver was taught to expect a blessing. When the dog had been thus decorated, it was suspended by the neck about eight feet from the ground, on the branching prong of a pole erected for that purpose. Here it hung, night and day, until the morning of the fifth day, when it was taken down to be burned. Oftentimes two dogs were burned, one for each four of the tribes. (57) In this case, the people separated into two divisions, and after going through separate preparatory ceremonies, they united around the same altar for the burning of the dogs, and the offering of the thanksgiving address to the Great Spirit.' <sup id="cite_ref-281" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-281">[281]</a></sup> 'On the second day 1 all the people went forth, and [Page 203] visited in turn the houses of their neighbors, either in the morning, at noon, or in the evening. They went in small parties apparelled in their best attire. It was customary, however, for the people to be preceded by the two keepers of the faith who made the recitations the day previous, as a matter of etiquette; the houses not being open to all, until these personages had made their call. At this time was performed the ceremony of stirring the ashes upon the hearth, which appears to have no particular idea attached to it, beyond that of a formal visitation. (95) Putting aside the disguise of the day before, the keepers of the faith assumed the costume of warriors, plumed and painted, in which attire they visited every family three times, in the morning, at noon, and in the evening. Taking in their hands wooden blades or shovels, they entered the lodge and saluted the family. One of them then stirred the ashes, and having taken up a quantity upon the blade of the shovel, and sprinkled them upon the hearth, he thus addressed the inmates, as they were in the act of falling: “I thank the Great Spirit that he has spared your lives again to witness this New Year's celebration.” Then repeating the process with another shovel full of ashes, he continued: “I thank the Great Spirit that he has spared my life, again to be an actor in this ceremony. And now I do this to please the Great Spirit.” The two then united in a chanksgiving song prepared for the occasion, upon the conclusion of which they took their departure. Other parties of the people then came in successively, and each went through the same performances. In this manner every house was thrice visited on the second day, by the [Page 204] keepers of the faith in the first instance, and afterwards by the whole community.' <sup id="cite_ref-282" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-282">[282]</a></sup> 'The proceedings upon the third and fourth days were alike. Small dancing parties were organized, which visited from house to house, and danced at the domestic fireside. Each set selected a different dance, appointed their own leader, and furnished their own music. One party, for instance, took the Feather dance, another the Fish dance, another the Trotting dance, to give variety to the short entertainments which succeeded each other at every house. It was not uncommon, on such occasions, to see a party of juveniles, about a dozen in number, dressed in full costume, feathered and painted, dancing the War dance, from house to house, with all the zeal and enthusiasm which this dance was so eminently calculated to excite. In this manner every house was made a scene of gaiety and amusement, for none was so humble or so retired as to remain unvisited. Another pastime incident to these days was the formation of a “thieving party,” as it was called, a band of mischievous boys, disguised with false faces, paint and rags, to collect materials for a feast. This vagrant company strolled from house to house, accompanied by an old woman carrying a huge basket. If the family received them kindly, and made them presents, they handed the latter to the female carrier, and having given the family a dance in acknowledgment of the present, they retired without committing any depredations. But if no presents were made, or such as were insufficient, they purloined whatever articles they could most adroitly and easily conceal. [Page 205] If detected, they at once made restitution, but if not, it was considered a fair win. On the return of this party from their rounds, all the articles collected were deposited in a place open to public examination; where any one who had lost an article which he particularly prized, was allowed to redeem it, on paying an equivalent. But no one was permitted to reclaim, as the owner, any article successfully taken by this thieving party on its professional round. Upon the proceeds of this forced collection, a feast was eventually given, together with a dance in some private family.' <sup id="cite_ref-283" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-283">[283]</a></sup> 'Guessing dreams was another of the novel practices of the Iroquois, which distinguished these festive days. It is difficult to understand precisely how far the self-delusion under which the dreamer appeared to act was real. A person with a melancholy and dejected countenance, entering a house, announced that he had a dream, and requested the inmates to guess it. He thus wandered from house to house, until he found a solution which suited him. This was either received as an interpretation of an actual dream, or suggested such a dream as the person was willing to adopt as his own. He at once avowed that his dream had been correctly guessed; and if the dream, as interpreted, prescribed any future conduct, he fulfilled it to the letter at whatever sacrifice. The celebrated Cornplanter, Gy-ant[unknown] -wä-ka, resigned his chiefship in consequence of a dream. 1 In relation to dreams, the [Page 206] Iroquois had ever been prone to extravagant and supernatural beliefs. They often regarded a dream as a divine monition, and followed its injunctions to the utmost extremity. Their notions upon this subject recall to remembrance the conceit of Homer, that “dreams descend from Jove.” (62)' <sup id="cite_ref-284" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-284">[284]</a></sup> 'During the first four days the people were without a feast, from the fact that the observances themselves did not require the assembling of the people at the council-house. But entertainments were given in the [Page 207] evenings at private houses, where the night was devoted to the dance. Another amusement at this particular season was the Snow-snake game, which, like all Indian games, was wont to arouse considerable interest.' <sup id="cite_ref-285" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-285">[285]</a></sup> 'On the morning of the fifth day, soon after dawn, the White Dog was burned on an altar of wood erected by the keepers of the faith near the councilhouse. It is difficult, from outward observation, to draw forth the true intent with which the dog was burned. The obscurity with which the object was veiled has led to various conjectures. Among other things, it has been pronounced a sacrifice for sin. In the religious system of the Iroquois, there is no recognition of the doctrine of atonement for sin, or of the absolution or forgiveness of sins. Upon this whole subject, their system is silent. An act once done was registered beyond the power of change. The greates advance upon this point of faith was the belief that good deeds cancelled the evil, thus placing heaven, through good works, within the reach of all. The notion that this was an expiation for sin is thus refuted by their system of theology itself. The other idea, that the sins of the people, by some mystic process, were transferred to the dog, and by him thus borne away, on the principle of the scapegoat of the Hebrews, is also without any foundation in truth. The burning of the dog had not the slightest connection with the sins of the people. On the contrary, the simple idea of the sacrifice was, to send up the spirit of the dog as a messenger to the Great Spirit, to announce their continued fidelity to his service, and also to convey to him their united [Page 208] thanks for the blessings of the year. The fidelity of the dog, the companion of the Indian, as a hunter, was emblematical of their fidelity. No messenger so trusty could be found to bear their petitions to the Master of life. The Iroquois believed that the Great Spirit made a covenant with their fathers to the effect, that when they should send up to him the spirit of a dog, of a spotless white, he would receive it as the pledge of their adherence to his worship, and his ears would thus be opened in a special manner to their petitions. To approach Hä-wen-ne[unknown] -yu in the most acceptable manner, and to gain attention to their thanksgiving acknowledgments and supplications in the way of his own appointing, was the end and object of burning the dog. They hung around his neck a string of white wampum, the pledge of their faith. They believed that the spirit of the dog hovered around the body until it was committed to the flames, when it ascended into the presence of the Great Spirit, itself the acknowledged evidence of their fidelity, and bearing also to him the united thanks and supplications of the people. This sacrifice was the most solemn and impressive manner of drawing near to the Great Spirit known to the Iroquois. They used the spirit of the dog in precisely the same manner that they did the incense of tobacco, as an instrumentality through which to commune with their Maker. This sacrifice was their highest act of piety.' <sup id="cite_ref-286" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-286">[286]</a></sup> 'The burning of the dog was attended with many ceremonies. It was first taken down and laid out upon a bench in the council-house, while the fire of the altar was kindling. A speech was then made over [Page 209] it by one of the keepers of the faith, in which he spoke of the antiquity of this institution of their fathers, of its importance and solemnity, and finally enjoined upon them all to direct their thoughts to the Great Spirit, and unite with the keepers of the faith in these observances. He concluded with thanking the Great Spirit, that the lives of so many of them had been spared through another year. A chant or song, appropriate to the occasion, was then sung, the people joining in chorus. By the time this was over, the altar was blazing up on every side ready for the offering. A procession was then formed, the officiating keeper of the faith preceding, followed by four others bearing the dog upon a kind of bark litter, behind which came the people in Indian file. A loud exclamation, in the nature of a warwhoop, announced the starting of the procession. They moved on towards the altar, and having marched around it, the keepers of the faith halted, facing the fising sun. With some immaterial ceremonies, the dog was laid upon the burning altar, and as the flames surrounded the offering, the officiating keeper of the faith, by a species of ejaculation, upon a high key, thrice repeated, invoked the attention of the Great Spirit.' <sup id="cite_ref-287" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-287">[287]</a></sup> '“ Luä, quä, quä: -- (Hail, hail, hail.) Thou who hast created all things, who rulest all things, and who givest laws and commands to thy creatures, listen to our words. We now obey thy commands.

It is rising to thee, by which it will appear that our words are true.” 1' <sup id="cite_ref-288" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-288">[288]</a></sup> 'Several thanksgiving songs or chants, in measured verse, were then sung by the keepers of the faith, the people joining in chorus. After this, was made the great thanksgiving address of the Iroquois. The keeper of the faith appointed to deliver it, invoked the attention of Hä-wen-ne[unknown] -yu by the same thricerepeated exclamation. As the speech progressed, he threw leaves of tobacco into the fire from time to time, that its incense might constantly ascend during the whole address. The following is the address, as delivered among the Senecas: 1 --“Hail, Hail, Hail: -- Listen now, with an open ear, to the words of thy people, as they ascend to thy dwelling, in the smoke of our offering. Behold thy people here assembled. Behold, they have come up to celebrate anew the sacred rites thou hast given them. Look down upon us beneficently. Give us wisdom faithfully to execute thy commands. “Continue to listen: -- The united voice of thy people continues to ascend to thee. Forbid, by thy wisdom, all things which shall tempt thy people to relinquish their ancient faith. Give us power to celebrate at all times, with zeal and fidelity, the sacred ceremonies which thou hast given us. “Continue to listen: -- Give to the keepers of the faith wisdom to execute properly thy commands. Give to our warriors, and our mothers, strength to perform the sacred ceremonies of thy institution. We thank thee that, in thy wisdom, thou hast given to us these commands. We thank thee that thou hast preserved them pure unto this day. “Continue to listen: -- We thank thee that the lives of [Page 211] so many of thy children are spared, to participate in the exercises of this occasion. Our minds are gladdened to be made partakers in the execution of thy commands. <sup id="cite_ref-289" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-289">[289]</a></sup> '“We return thanks to our mother, the earth, which sustains us.

Last of all came the feast, with which the proceedings of the day were terminated. On the morning of the sixth day, the people again assembled at the place of council. This day was observed in about the same manner as one of their ordinary religious days, at which the Thanksgiving dance was introduced.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ League Councils ♥</b> The material in the Ritual Database <sup id="cite_ref-293" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-293">[293]</a></sup> as imported to the colonial- and reservation-period data sheet (UsIroqL) covers the Six Nations Convention and seems to refer to the Handsome Lake religion rather than earlier ceremonies. We have therefore decided to code for a different set of rituals for the pre-reservation period. 'It is a singular fact, resulting from the structure of Indian institutions, that nearly every transaction, whether social or political, originated or terminated in a council. This universal and favorite mode of doing business became interwoven with all the affairs of public and private life. In council, public transactions of every name and character were planned, scrutinized and adopted. The succession of their rulers, their athletic games, dances, and religious festivals, and their social intercourse, were all alike identified with councils. It may be said that the life of the Iroquois was either spent in the chase, on the war-path, or at the council-fire. They formed the three leading objects of his existence; and it would be difficult to [Page 103] determine for which he possessed the strongest predilection. Regarding them in this light, and it is believed they are not over-estimated, a narrative of these councils would furnish an accurate and copious history of the Iroquois, both political and social. The absence of these records, now irreparable, has greatly abridged the fulness, and diminished the accuracy of our aboriginal history.' <sup id="cite_ref-294" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-294">[294]</a></sup>//A central council which represented the League as a whole was convened on an annual basis and when a particular problem demanded it: 'The Onondaga nation, being situated in a central position, were made the keepers both of the Council Brand, and of the Wampum, in which the structure and principles of their government, and their laws and treaties were recorded. At stated periods, usually in the autumn of each year, the sachems of the League assembled in council at Onondaga, which was in effect the seat of government, to legislate for the common welfare. Exigencies of a public or domestic character often led to the summoning of this council at extraordinary seasons, but the place was not confined to Onondaga. It could be appointed in the territory of either of the nations, under established usages. Originally the object of the general council was to raise up sachems to fill vacancies. In the course of time, as their intercourse with foreign nations became more important, it assumed the charge of all matters which [Page 63] concerned the League. It 1 declared war and made peace, sent and received embassies, entered into treaties of alliance, regulated the affairs of subjugated nations, received new members into the League, extended its protection over feeble tribes, in a word, took all needful measures to promote their prosperity, and enlarge their dominion.' <sup id="cite_ref-295" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-295">[295]</a></sup>//'The several sachems, in whom, when united in general council, resided the supreme powers of the League, formed, when apart in their own territories, the ruling bodies of their respective nations. When assembled as the Council of the League, the power of each sachem became co-extensive with the government, and direct relations were created between all the people and each individual ruler; but when the sachems of a nation were convened in council, all its internal affairs fell under their immediate cognizance. For all purposes of a local and domestic, and many of a political character, the nations were entirely independent of each other. The nine Mohawk sachems administered the affairs of that nation with joint authority, precisely in the same manner as they did, in connection with their colleagues, the affairs of the League at large. With similar powers, the ten Cayuga sachems regulated the domestic affairs of their nation.' <sup id="cite_ref-296" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-296">[296]</a></sup>//'Oratory, from the constitutional organization of the council, was necessarily brought into high repute. Questions involving the safety of the race, and the preservation of the League, were frequently before it. In those warlike periods, when the Confederacy was moving onward amid incessant conflicts with contiguous nations, or, perchance, resisting sudden tides of migratory population, there was no dearth of those exciting causes, of those emergencies of peril, which rouse the spirit of the people, and summon into activity their highest energies. Whenever events converged to such a crisis, the council was the first resort; and there, under the pressure of dangers, and in the glow of patriotism, the eloquence of the Iroquois flowed as pure and spontaneous as the fountains of their thousand streamlets.' <sup id="cite_ref-297" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-297">[297]</a></sup>//'If the envoy of a foreign people desired to submit a proposition to the sachems of the League, and applied to the Senecas for that purpose, the sachems of that nation would first determine whether the question was of sufficient importance to authorize a council. If they arrived at an affirmative conclusion, they immediately sent out runners to the Cayugas, the nation nearest in position, with a belt of wampum. This belt announced that, on a certain day thereafter, at such a place, and for such and such purposes, mentioning them, a council of the League would assemble. The Cayugas then notified the Onondagas, they the Oneidas, and these the Mohawks. (81) Each nation, within its own confines, spread the information far and wide; and thus, in a space of time astonishingly brief, intelligence of the council was heralded from one extremity of their country to the other. It produced a stir among the people in proportion to the magnitude and importance of the business to be transacted. If the subject was calculated to arouse a deep feeling of interest, one common impulse from the Hudson to the Niagara, and from the St. Lawrence to the Susquehanna, drew them towards the council-fire. Sachems, chiefs and warriors, women, and [Page 105] even children, deserted their hunting grounds and woodland seclusions, and taking the trail, literally flocked to the place of council. When the day arrived, a multitude had gathered together, from the most remote and toilsome distances, but yet animated by an unyielding spirit of hardihood and endurance.' <sup id="cite_ref-298" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-298">[298]</a></sup>//'Their mode of opening a council, and proceeding with the business before it, was extremely simple, yet dilatory, when contrasted with the modes of civilized life. Questions were usually reduced to single propositions, calling for an affirmative or negative response, and were thus either adopted or rejected. When the sachems were assembled in the midst of their people, and all were in readiness to proceed, the envoy was introduced before them. One of the sachems, by previous appointment, then arose, and having thanked the Great Spirit for his continued beneficence in permitting them to meet together, he informed the envoy that the council was prepared to hear him upon the business for which it had convened. The council being thus opened, the representative proceeded to unfold the objects of his mission. He submitted his propositions in regular form, and sustained them by such arguments as the case required. The sachems listened with earnest and respectful attention to the end of his address, that they might clearly understand the questions to be decided and answered. After the envoy had concluded his speech, he withdrew from the council, as was customary, to await at a distance the result of its deliberations. It then became the duty of the sachems to agree upon an answer; in doing which, as would be expected, they passed [Page [facing p. 105]] [Page 106] through the ordinary routine of speeches, consultations, and animated discussions. Such was the usual course of proceeding in the Iroquois council. Variations might be introduced by circumstances.' <sup id="cite_ref-299" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-299">[299]</a></sup>//'At this place another peculiar institution of the Ho-De’-No-Sau-Nee is presented. All the sachems of the League, in whom originally was vested the entire civil power, were required to be of “one mind,” to give efficacy to their legislation. Unanimity was a fundamental law. The idea of majorities and minorities was entirely unknown to our Indian predecessors. To hasten their deliberations to a conclusion, and ascertain the result, they adopted an expedient which dispensed entirely with the necessity of casting votes. The founders of the Confederacy, seeking to obviate as far as possible altercation in council, and to facilitate their progress to unanimity, divided the sachems of each nation into classes, usually of two and three each, as will be seen by referring to the table of sachemships. No sachem was permitted to express an opinion in council, until he had agreed with the other sachem or sachems of his class, upon the opinion to be expressed, and had received an appointment to act as speaker for the class. Thus the eight Seneca sachems, being in four classes, could have but four opinions; the ten Cayuga sachems but four. In this manner each class was brought to unanimity within itself. A cross-consultation was then held between the four sachems who represented the four classes; and when they had agreed, they appointed one of their number to express their resulting opinion, which was the answer of their nation. The several nations [Page 107] having, by this ingenious method, become of “one mind” separately, it only remained to compare their several opinions, to arrive at the final sentiment of all the sachems of the League. This was effected by a conference between the individual representatives of the several nations; and when they had arrived at unanimity, the answer of the League was determined.' <sup id="cite_ref-300" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-300">[300]</a></sup>//'The sovereignty of the nations, by this mode of giving assent, was not only preserved, but made subservient to the effort itself to secure unanimity. If any sachem was obdurate or unreasonable, influences were brought to bear upon him which he could not well resist; and it was seldom that inconvenience resulted from their inflexible adherence to the rule. When, however, all efforts to produce unanimity failed of success, the whole matter was laid aside. Farther action became at once impossible. A result, either favorable or adverse, having, in this way, been reached, it was communicated to the envoy by a speaker selected for the purpose. This orator was always chosen from the nation with whom the council originated, and it was usual with him to review the whole subject presented to the council in a formal speech, and at the same time to announce the conclusions to which the sachems of the Confederacy had arrived. This concluding speech terminated the business of the council, and the Indian diplomatist took his departure.' <sup id="cite_ref-301" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-301">[301]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Green Corn Festival ♥</b> The Iroquois celebrated multiple thanksgiving ceremonies associated with the agricultural cycle (for more information see above). We have selected the Green Corn Festival, as Morgan provides a detailed account of it. 'The word from which this takes its name signifies “a feast.” It continued four days, the proceedings of each being different in most particulars, but each one terminating with a feast. When the green corn became fit for use, the season of plenty with the Indian had emphatically arrived. They made it another occasion of general thanksgiving to the Great Spirit, and of feasting and rejoicing among themselves. Corn has ever been the staple article-of consumption among the Iroquois. They cultivated this plant, and also the bean and the [Page 191] squash, before the formation of the League. From the most remote period to which tradition reaches, the knowledge of the cultivation and use of these plants has been handed down among them. They raised sufficient quantities of each to supply their utmost wants, preparing them for food in a great variety of ways, and making them at least the basis of their sustenance. (19) In their own mode of expressing the idea, these plants are mentioned together, under the figurative name of “Our Life,” or “Our Supporters.” It cannot, therefore, be affirmed with correctness, that the Indian subsisted principally by the chase. (84) After the formation of the League, they resided in permanent villages, and within certain well-defined territorial limits. The fruits of the chase then became a secondary, although a necessary means of subsistence.//'On the first day of this festival, after the introductory speeches had been made, the Feather dance, the thanksgiving address, with the burning of tobacco, [Page 192] and three or four other dances, made up the principal religious exercises. This address was introduced in the midst of one of the dances which succeeded the first. One more specimen of these brief prayers of the Iroquois, as made by the Senecas, will be furnished. Having placed the leaves of tobacco on the fire, as usual, the keeper of the faith thus addressed Hä-wen-ne[unknown] -yu: --“Great Spirit in heaven, listen to our words. We have assembled to perform a sacred duty, as thou hast commanded. This institution has descended to us from our fathers. We salute thee with our thanks, that thou hast preserved so many of us another year, to participate in the ceremonies of this occasion. “Great Spirit, continue to listen: We thank thee for thy great goodness in causing our mother, the earth, again to bring forth her fruits. We thank thee that thou hast caused Our Supporters to yield abundantly. “Great Spirit, our words still continue to flow towards thee. (Throwing on tobacco). Preserve us from all danger. Preserve our aged men. Preserve our mothers. Preserve our warriors. Preserve our children. We burn this tobacco; may its smoke arise to thee. May our thanks, ascending with it, be pleasing to thee. Give wisdom to the keepers of the faith, that they may direct these ceremonies with propriety. Strengthen our warriors, that they may celebrate with pleasure the sacred dances of thy appointment. “Great Spirit; the council here assembled, the aged men and women, the strong warriors, the women and children, unite their voice of thanksgiving to thee. Na-bo!”//'Before partaking of the feast, the people went out to witness some of those games which were often introduced, as an amusement, to accompany the other exercises of these festive days. The second day commenced with the usual address, after which they had the Thanksgiving dance, Gä-na[unknown] -o-ub, which was the principal religious exercise of the day. This dance was not necessarily a costume performance, although it was usually given by a select band in full dress. In figure, step, and music, it was precisely like the Feather dance, the chief difference between them being the introduction of short thanksgiving speeches between the songs of the dance. This dance is fully explained elsewhere; but it is proper to say, to make it intelligible here, that the music consisted of a series of thanksgiving songs, performed by select singers, who accompanied themselves with turtleshell rattles, to mark time. Each song lasted about two minutes, during which the band danced around the room, in column, with great animation. When the song ceased, the dancers walked around the council-house, about the same length of time, to the beat of the rattles. The thanksgiving speeches were made during these intervals between the songs. A person arose, and perhaps thanked the Maple as follows: “We return thanks to the Maple, which yields its sweet waters for the good of man.” Again the dance was resumed, and another song danced out, after which another speech was made by some other person, perhaps as follows: “We return thanks to the bushes and trees, which provide us with fruit.” The dance was then resumed as before. In this manner the [Page 194] thanksgiving speeches, the songs and the dance were continued, until all the prominent objects in nature had been made the subjects of special notice. There were always set speeches introduced with the Thanksgiving dance, at the Green Corn and Harvest festivals, and they formed a conspicuous part of the worship of the Iroquois. These speeches, or the principal ones, may be collected into one, for the purpose of showing the range of subjects taken; yet it must be borne in mind that each object formed the subject of a separate speech, and was followed by a thanksgiving song, adapted to the case, which the band danced through. It may be proper further to add, that these speeches were consolidated to form the principal part of the annual thanksgiving address to the Great Spirit, made at the burning of the White Dog. The following is their natural order: “We return thanks to our mother, the earth, which sustains us. We return thanks to the rivers and streams, which supply us with water. We return thanks to all herbs, which furnish medicines for the cure of our diseases. We return thanks to the corn, and to her sisters, the beans and squashes, which give us life. We return thanks to the bushes and trees, which provide us with fruit. We return thanks to the wind, which, moving the air, has banished diseases. We return thanks to the moon and stars, which have given to us their light when the sun was gone. We return thanks to our grandfather He[unknown] -no, that he has protected his grandchildren from witches and reptiles, and has given to us his rain. We return thanks to the sun, that he has looked upon [Page 195] the earth with a beneficent eye. Lastly, we return thanks to the Great Spirit, in whom is embodied all goodness, and who directs all things for the good of his children.”//'After the conclusion of the Thanksgiving dance, two or three other dances followed, and after them the feast, with which the exercises of the day were concluded. The third morning was set apart for a thanksgiving concert, called the Ah-do[unknown] -weh, which constituted the chief ceremony of the day. The council was opened by an introductory speech by one of the keepers of the faith, upon its nature, objects, and institution. This novelty in their worship was a succession of short speeches made by different persons, one after another, returning thanks to a great variety of objects, each one following his speech with an appropriate song, the words of which were of his own composing, and oftentimes the music also. In a chorus to each song all the people joined, thus sending forth a united anthem of praise. They passed through the whole range of natural objects, thanking each one directly, as in the Thanksgiving dance; but they were not in the Ah-do[unknown] -weh confined either to the natural or to the spiritual world. Acts of kindness, personal achievements, political events, in a word, all the affairs of public and private life were open on this occasion to the indulgence of the grateful affections. Oftentimes one or two hours were consumed, before the people had all expressed their thanks to each other for personal favors, to the works of nature for their constant ministration to their wants, and to the Great Spirit and [Page 196] the “Invisible Aids” for their protecting care. Many of the speeches on these occasions, especially those which referred to objects in the natural world, were the same from year. But those which grew out of their private relations would vary with circumstances. This was esteemed one of their highest religious exercises, and it always continued to be one of their favorite observances. When the Ah-do[unknown] -weh was concluded, two or three dances were generally introduced before the enjoyment of the feast, with which, as before remarked, each day's proceedings were terminated.//'On the fourth day, the festival was concluded with the peach-stone game, Gus-gä[unknown] -a, a game of chance, on which they bet profusely, and to which they were extravagantly attached. It was not in the nature of a religious exercise, but a favorite entertainment, with which to terminate the Green Corn ceremonial. It is elsewhere described. It should be held in the memory, that at the period of the institution of their religious festivals, they were concluded at meridian; during the middle period of their history, they were continued until towards twilight; but in modern times, an evening entertainment, in the way of dancing, always follows each day of the festival, so long as it continues, although it forms no part of their religious observances. It may be further observed, that at the present time, this festival lasts but three days, the proceedings of the third and fourth being completed on the former day. At the close of each day, 1 the people regaled themselves upon a sumptuous feast of succotash. This [Page 197] was always the entertainment at the green corn season. It was made of corn, beans and squashes, and was always a favorite article of food with the red man. It may be well to state in this connection, that among the Iroquois at the present day, they do not sit down together to a common repast, except at religious councils of unusual interest. The feast, after being prepared at the place of council, is distributed at its close, and carried by the women, in vessels brought for the purpose, to their respective homes, where it is enjoyed by each family at their own fireside. But when the people feasted together after the ancient fashion, as they still do occasionally, they selected the hour of twilight. The huge kettles of soup, or hommony, or succotash, as the case might be, were brought into their midst, smoking from the fire. Before partaking of this evening banquet, they never omitted to say grace, which, with them, was a simple ceremonial, but in perfect harmony with their mode of worship. It was a prolonged exclamation, upon a high key, by the solitary voice of one of the keepers of the faith, followed by a swelling chorus from the multitude, upon a lower note. It was designed as an acknowledgment to each other of their gratitude to the great Giver of the feast.' <sup id="cite_ref-335" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-335">[335]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Healing Ritual ♥</b> 'The prime motive in the establishment of this organization was to propitiate those demons called Falsefaces, and among other good results to arrest pestilence and disease. In course of time the band itself was believed to have a species of control over diseases, and over the healing art; and they were often invoked for the cure of simple diseases, and to drive away, or exorcise the plague, if it had actually broken out in their midst. As recently as the summer of 1849, when the cholera prevailed through the State, the Falsefaces, in appropriate costume, went from house to house at Tonawanda, through the old school portion of the village, and performed the usual ceremonies prescribed for the expulsion of the pestilence.//'When any one was sick with a complaint within the range of their healing powers, and dreamed that he saw a Falseface, this was interpreted to signify that through their instrumentality he was to be cured. Having informed the mistress of the band, and prepared the customary feast, the Falsefaces at once appeared, preceded by their female leader, and marching in Indian file. Each one wore a mask or false face, a tattered blanket over his shoulders, and carried a turtle shell rattle in his hand. On entering the house of the invalid they first stirred the ashes upon the hearth, and then sprinkled the patient over with hot ashes until his head and hair were covered; after which they performed some manipulations over him in turn, and finally led him around with them in the falseface dance ( Gä-go-s[unknown] ), with which their ceremonies concluded. When these performances were over, the entertainment prepared for the occasion was distributed to the band, and by [Page 160] them carried away for their private feasting, as they never unmasked themselves before the people. Among the simple complaints which the Falsefaces could cure infallibly, were nose bleed, toothache, swellings, and inflammation of the eyes. The false face shown in the figure was purchased of an Onondaga on Grand river.' <sup id="cite_ref-374" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-374">[374]</a></sup>//'The other class, who were held in greater honor and were better paid, taught that disease was due rather to psychical than to physical causes, and for its cure they practised a course of treatment which may be most briefly and intelligibly described as <i>parva componere magnis</i>, a sort of Heathen Science. The patient was sick because of some evil thought, or other malevolence acting upon his spirit, and could be cured only by the spiritual efforts of the healer, exerted in both present and absent treatment, and often accompanied by much blowing, reciting of rituals, exercises, jugglery, etc., etc. Since this class of healer did not recognize the existence of disease, no knowledge of anatomy was necessary. Occasionally they made a slight concession to the widespread belief that disease has a physical cause and exhibited a stone, stick, or other object, which they pretended to have extracted [Page 286] from the patient, alleging that it had been implanted in his body by the malevolence of witch, demon, or other enemy.' <sup id="cite_ref-375" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-375">[375]</a></sup> We need to confirm whether healing rituals were performed in this manner prior to the reservation period as well.</dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ War Dance ♥</b> The reservation-period data sheet (see UsIroqL for reference) is coded for the Tenth-Day Funerary Feast as imported from the Ritual Database <sup id="cite_ref-406" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-406">[406]</a></sup>. The ethnography seems to imply that this ritual was introduced by the Handsome Lake religion. We have therefore decided to code for a different set of rituals for the pre-reservation period. 'With the Iroquois, as with the red race at large, dancing was not only regarded as a thanksgiving ceremonial, in itself acceptable to the Great Spirit, but they were taught to consider it a divine art, designed by Hä-wen-ne[unknown] -yu for their pleasure, as well as for his worship. It was cherished as one of the most suitable modes of social intercourse between the sexes, but more especially as the great instrumentality for arousing patriotic excitement, and for keeping alive the spirit of the nation. The popular enthusiasm broke forth in this form, and was nourished and stimulated by this powerful agency. These dances sprang, as it were, a living reflection from the Indian mind. With their wild music of songs and rattles, their diversities of step and attitude, their graces of motion, and their spirit-stirring associations, [Page 250] they contain within themselves both a picture and a realization of Indian life. The first stir of feeling of which the Indian youth was conscious was enkindled by the dance; the first impulse of patriotism, the earliest dreams of ambition were awakened by their inspiring influences. In their patriotic, religious and social dances, into which classes they are properly divisible, resided the soul of Indian life. It was more in the nature of a spell upon the people than of a rational guiding spirit. It bound them down to trivial things, but it bound them together; it stimulated them to deeds of frenzy, but it fed the flame of patriotism.' <sup id="cite_ref-407" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-407">[407]</a></sup> 'The Feather dance and the War dance were the two great performances of the Iroquois. One had a religious, and the other a patriotic character. Both were costume dances. They were performed by a select band, ranging from fifteen to twenty-five, who were distinguished for their powers of endurance, activity and spirit.' <sup id="cite_ref-408" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-408">[408]</a></sup>//'One was of original invention, the other imported; one was of a strictly religious character, and the other of a patriotic; but both were equally effective to arouse the enthusiasm of the people. All things considered, however, the last of the two, the War dance, Wä-sä[unknown] -seh, was the favorite. It was the mode of enlistment for a perilous expedition, the dance which preceded the departure of the band, and with which [Page 258] they celebrated their return. It was the dance at the ceremony of raising up sachems, at the adoption of a captive, at the entertainment of a guest, the first dance taught to the young. It was not of Iroquois origin, but was adopted from the Sioux, as its name imports, reaching back through them to a remote antiquity. The characteristic feature of this dance is to be found in the speeches which were made by those surrounding the band of dancers between each tune, or at each break in the dance. From this source the people derived as much entertainment as they did excitement from the performance itself. It was the only dance in which speeches and replies were appropriate, or ever introduced; and in this particular it was a novelty, leading oftentimes to the highest amusement. By these speeches, which both relieved the performers and diverted the people, the dance was lengthened out to two and even three hours, before the spirits of the company were expended.' <sup id="cite_ref-409" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-409">[409]</a></sup>//'The War dance was usually performed in the evening. It was only brought out on prominent occasions, or at domestic councils of unusual interest. Fifteen made a full company, but oftentimes twenty-five and even thirty participated. After the business of the day was disposed of, and the dusk of evening had crept in, [Page 259] preparations began for the dance. The people gathered within the council-house, usually in increased numbers, because of this expected entertainment, and arranging themselves in favorable positions, they quietly awaited the approach of the dancers. The arrangements were made, including the selection of the number, the appointment of the leader, and of the singers of the war-songs, by the keepers of the faith. In an adjacent lodge, the band assembled to array themselves in their costumes, and to paint and decorate their persons for the occasion. The war-whoop ever and anon broke in upon the stillness of the evening, indicating to the listening and expectant throng within the council-house, that their preparations were progressing to a completion. A keeper of the faith, in the mean time, occupied the attention of the people with a brief speech upon the nature and objects of this dance. Presently, a nearer war-whoop ringing through the air, announced that the band were approaching. Preceded by their leader, and marching in file to the beat of the drum, they drew near to the council-house. As they came up, the crowd gave way, the leader crossed the threshold, followed quickly by his feathered band, and immediately opened the dance. In an instant they grouped themselves within a circular area, standing thick together, the singers commenced the war-song, the drums beat time, and the dancers made the floor resound with their stirring feet. After a moment the song ceased, and with it the dance; the band walking around a common centre to the beat of the drum at half time. Another song soon commenced, the drums quickened their time, and the dance was resumed. In [Page 260] the middle of the song there was a change in the music, accompanied with a slight cessation of the dance, after which it became more animated than before, until the song ended, and the band again walked to the beat of the drum. Each tune or war-song lasted about two minutes, and the interval between them was about as long. These songs were usually recited by four singers, using two drums of the kind represented in the figure, to mark time, and as an accompaniment. The drums beat time about twice in a second, the voices of the singers keeping pace, thus making a rapid and strongly accented species of music.' <sup id="cite_ref-410" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-410">[410]</a></sup>//'It would be difficult, if not impossible, to describe the step, except generally. With the whites, the dancing is entirely upon the toe of the foot, with rapid changes of position, and but slight changes of attitude. But with the Iroquois, it was chiefly upon the heel, with slow changes of position, and rapid changes of attitude. The heel is raised and brought down with great quickness and force, by muscular strength, to keep time with the beat of the drum, to make a resounding noise by the concussion, and at the same time to shake the knee-rattles, which contributed materially to the “pomp and circumstance” of the dance. In the War dance, the attitudes were those of [Page 261] the violent passions, and consequently were not graceful. At the same instant of time, in a group of dancers, one might be seen in the attitude of attack, another of defence; one in the act of drawing the bow, another of striking with the war-club; some in the act of throwing the tomahawk, some of listening, or of watching an opportunity, and others of striking the foe. These violent motions of the body, while they, perhaps, increased the spirit and animation of the dance, led to disagreeable distortions of the countenance, as well as to uncouth attitudes. But, at the same time, the striking costumes of the dancers, their erect forms at certain stages of the figure, their suppleness and activity, the wild music, the rattle of the dance, together with the excitable and excited throng around them, made up a scene of no common interest.' <sup id="cite_ref-411" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-411">[411]</a></sup>//'In this dance, the war-whoop and the response always preceded each song. It was given by the leader, and answered by the band. A description of this terrific outbreak of human voices is scarcely possible. It was a prolonged sound upon a high note, with a decadence near the end, followed by an abrupt and explosive conclusion, in which the voice was raised again to the original pitch. The whole band responded in a united scream upon the same key with which the leader concluded, and at the same instant.' <sup id="cite_ref-412" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-412">[412]</a></sup>//'In this celebrated dance, therefore, which has doubtless been used for centuries, and been performed throughout the whole area of the American republic, we find this simple succession of acts: the war-whoop and responses, the simultaneous commencement of the war-song and the dance, the slight cessation at the middle of the tune, with a change in the music, the renewal of the dance with redoubled animation, and the final conclusion of the war-song in perhaps less than two minutes from its commencement; and lastly, the walk at the beat of the drum around a central point for about two minutes, until the war-whoop again sounded, and another war-song was introduced. This round was continued until the spirit of the dancers began to flag, and the desires of the people had been reasonably gratified. Without any speeches between the tunes to relieve the band, it usually lasted about an hour; but with speeches, it often continued for three hours with unabated animation. Any one present was at liberty to make a speech at any stage of the dance. His desire was manifested by a rap. At the sound the dance ceased, or, if finished, and the band were walking, they were required to stop, and all present, as well as the music, to be silent. The only condition affixed to the right of making a speech, was that of bestowing a present at its close upon the dancers, or upon the one to whom it was addressed. After the speech was concluded, and the present delivered, the war-whoop and responses were again sounded, the drums beat, the [Page 263] song and the dance commenced, and were ended as before. Then followed another speech, and still others, alternating with the songs, or suspending the dance at the moment of its highest animation, at the pleasure of the speaker. In this manner the War dance was continued until the spirit of enjoyment began to subside, when the final war-whoop put an end to the dance, and the band retired.' <sup id="cite_ref-413" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-413">[413]</a></sup>//Oratory was also present: 'These speeches were often pleasantries between individuals, or strictures upon each other's foibles, or earnest exhortations, or perchance patriotic ebullitions of feeling, according to the fancy of the person and of the moment. Some of them were received with rounds of applause, some with jeers, and others with seriousness and deference. They usually lasted but two or three minutes. The Indian has a keen appreciation of wit, and is fond of both jest and repartee, as well as of ridicule.' <sup id="cite_ref-414" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-414">[414]</a></sup>//The content of the speeches given refers to a reservation-period context, but we have assumed that earlier manifestations of the ceremony were broadly comparable.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ seasonally ♥</b> Based on the following quote, it seems likely that this dance was performed less often than monthly, but more often than yearly.

A group gathered around him, and as their martial ardor was aroused by the dance, they enlisted, one after the other, by joining in its performance. In this manner a company was soon formed; the matrons of the village prepared their subsistence while the dance was performing; and at its close, while they were yet fired with enthusiasm for the enterprise, they immediately left the village, and turned their footsteps towards the country of the enemy.

A group gathered around him, and as their martial ardor was aroused by the dance, they enlisted, one after the other, by joining in its performance. In this manner a company was soon formed; the matrons of the village prepared their subsistence while the dance was performing; and at its close, while they were yet fired with enthusiasm for the enterprise, they immediately left the village, and turned their footsteps towards the country of the enemy.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Funeral ♥</b> 'On the morning of the funeral the corpse is provided with a “lunch” consisting of corn bread 2 inches in diameter, which has been baked in ashes (“the dead people's way”). At Sour Springs the body is carried in and out of the longhouse through the women's door, while at Lower Cayuga and Seneca the east door is used for the entrance and the west for the exit. In all cases the foot end of the coffin is carried in first to simulate “walking” into the Longhouse, as if the person were “still with us.” The coffin is opened and placed in the center of the house on the singers' benches, the head westward and the feet eastward. Seating for a funeral is according to sex. A second condolence address is given by the speaker who had consoled the bereaved at home earlier. He says that perhaps some relatives had not heard the words expressed at the house, and therefore he condoles them again. Furthermore, he condoles the entire moiety of the bereaved, specifying as usual each of the ranks in the hierarchy. Then, the moiety of the deceased replies briefly in kind, avowing that the loss undoubtedly affected not them alone but also the condoling side. The speaker then announces that the people may now have a last look at the departed relative. All the speeches are phrased in such a way as to indicate that the deceased is still among the people, passing through the Longhouse a final time on his way to heaven. Going up to the coffin for a last look is considered extremely important, and orthodox members insist that the body must be brought into the Longhouse and must be visible. At Sour Springs the women circle the coffin counterclockwise first, followed by the men, and then followed by the family of the deceased, which is not separated by sex. After all have circled, the speaker announces that the coffin will be closed and the remains laid to rest. The coffin is carried out feet first, again as if the deceased were walking. Mourners then follow the coffin to the burial ground of the Longhouse, where the speaker delivers the last address. He indicates that now the departed has arrived at the final resting place and henceforth will be entrusted to the Creator. The mourners have done their duty as decreed by the Creator, and they should now release their hands from the dead. The coffin is lowered, again with the head to the west, and two shovels of earth are symbolically placed on the lowered coffin by a member of the moiety opposite to that of the deceased. Sometimes a single wreath from the family is added, and the mourners depart.' <sup id="cite_ref-449" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-449">[449]</a></sup></dd>

<p><b>♠ RA ♣ Eva Brandl ♥</b>
</p><p><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b>
</p><p><b>♠ Editor ♣ ♥</b>
</p><p>eHRAF Archeology provides a general summary of the Late Eastern Woodland tradition (1300 B.P. - 500 B.P., precedes the historic period): 'The Late Woodland Tradition is widespread throughout the eastern woodlands from southern Canada to the Gulf Coast and from just west of the Mississippi river trench in the west to the shores of the Atlantic ocean to the east.' <sup id="cite_ref-485" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-485">[485]</a></sup> 'Grit tempered, cordmarked ceramic cooking vessels in the northern region of the eastern woodlands, and ground shell-, limestone-, or grog-tempered vessels in the southern woodlands. A wide variety of projectile point forms were utilized during the Late Woodland period ranging from small, stemmed points early in the period, to notched and unnotched triangular forms after the introduction of the bow and arrow. House forms show a wide range of variation from the longhouse of the northeastern United States to the circular and ovoid forms of the western Great Lakes to rectangular, square, and ovoid forms of the southeastern United States.' <sup id="cite_ref-486" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-486">[486]</a></sup> 'The Late Woodland tradition developed during the period of climatic amelioration commonly called the little climatic optimum (or medieval warm period) dating from 2100 to 750 B.P. Following 750 B.P. the climate became cooler as the affects of the "Little Ice Age" became more prominent.' <sup id="cite_ref-487" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-487">[487]</a></sup> 'The topography of the eastern woodlands is highly diverse across the region. The Great Lakes and their associated low-lying coastal plains as well as the Mississippi river trench dominate the northwest portion of the area. The increasing relief of the Appalachian mountains characterizes the northeastern portion of the region, although the east coast is considered part of the Atlantic coastal plain. The southeast is dominated by the Atlantic and Gulf coastal plains, both of which provide diverse topography, which is however generally low lying. Finally, the southwestern portion of the eastern woodlands is relatively flat, with some relief being provided by the southwestern portion of the piedmont and Appalachian mountains. Mobile Late Woodland peoples appear to have taken advantage of both the major river floodplain environments and upland areas, practicing a seasonal round that maximized their landscape's potential for food production. More sedentary Late Woodland peoples chose river and lakeshore locations f or the majority of year.' <sup id="cite_ref-488" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-488">[488]</a></sup> 'The eastern woodlands area can be divided into two major geologic provinces or subdivisions: (1) the stable interior craton, which includes the Canadian shield underlying the Great Lakes region and a broad area of relatively undeformed sediment covering the shield, which extends from the Great Lakes to the Gulf coast, and (2) the Appalachian orogenic belts. The Canadian shield is the oldest rock in the continent and contains huge deposits of iron and copper. The area to the south has been slightly deformed into a series of basins and domes including the Wisconsin dome, and the Michigan and Illinois basins. The sediments in these areas have consolidated into limestone, dolomite, shales, and sandstones and indicate that deposition took place in a variety of shallow marine and coastal plain environments. These formations contain abundant chert deposits. The Appalachian mountains are a classic fold and thrust belt that extends from Newfoundland to Alabama and was formed by continental collision in the beginning of the Early Paleozoic. The Appalachian mountains consist of four zones: the valley and ridge province, the Blue Ridge province, the piedmont province, and the coastal plain. Some areas in the mountains contain localized deposits of copper, iron, crystals, and other minerals. Glaciation occurring in four major pulses depressed the central shield and Great Lakes area, creating the Great Lakes as well as the Mississippi and Ohio River drainages. A veneer of glacial drift covers the northern portion of the eastern woodlands area, creating hummocky, rolling topography. The drift contains copper, cherts, jaspers, and taconite. The southern Mississippi trench and Gulf coastal plain are characterized by a lack of stone and mineral resources, but are rich in fertile bottomland soils, clay, and salt springs.' <sup id="cite_ref-489" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-489">[489]</a></sup> 'Peoples of the Late Woodland tradition utilized a wide range of habitats throughout the eastern United States, including mixed conifer-hardwood forests, deciduous forests, forest-prairie mosaic, prairies, oak-pine forests, and the southeastern evergreen forests. Riverine and marshland environments were utilized heavily in the spring, summer, and early fall for their aquatic and closely related terrestrial resources. Upland forests and more sheltered locations seem to have been favored during the late fall and winter, apparently to take advantage of upland resources such as nut mast and grazing mammals.' <sup id="cite_ref-490" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-490">[490]</a></sup> 'Late Woodland settlement systems varied tremendously temporally and spatially throughout the eastern woodlands. In the north, Late Woodland peoples appear to have led a more mobile lifestyle during the early portions of the Late Woodland period. This is indicated by a pattern of large villages commonly inhabited during the late spring and summer and a series of smaller open-air and cave/rock shelter habitations representing a fall and winter dispersion of regional populations. These early larger villages usually did not contain monumental architecture and are commonly associated with mortuary facilities such as mounds and/or ossuaries. After the introduction of maize, larger, more permanent villages were established and were occupied for the majority of the year. Late Woodland tradition settlement systems in the southern portions of the eastern woodlands followed patterns similar to those in the north, with the exception of the development of civic-ceremonial centers with plazas and monumental architecture, i ncluding platform mounds, at a comparatively early date.' <sup id="cite_ref-491" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-491">[491]</a></sup> 'Early Late Woodland communities in the northern eastern woodlands were generally small, consisting of between 2-10 houses with little or no visible civic planning, although some groups tended to organize their houses around a central work area. In the later portion of the Late Woodland period in the north, there was a tendency for villages to become larger with more storage facilities. Single or multiple palisades commonly enclosed these villages. Southern Late Woodland communities exhibited a wide range of variation, but the larger villages that served as civic-ceremonial centers appear to have a fair degree of civic planning. Typically, the center of the village was demarcated as a plaza. Platform mounds, often constructed to align with solstices, surrounded three or four sides of the plaza.' <sup id="cite_ref-492" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-492">[492]</a></sup> 'Late Woodland house types varied throughout the eastern woodlands. In the northern portion of the region, five different Late Woodland house forms have been identified. These include oval, circular, "keyhole", rectangular with rounded corners, and longhouses. Although the first four styles imply single, nuclear family dwellings, the construction of longhouses indicates larger, multifamily units.' <sup id="cite_ref-493" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-493">[493]</a></sup> 'Most regions in the eastern woodlands experienced population growth during the Late Woodland period. This may have been caused in part by the increasing reliance on horticultural products and then ultimately by the adoption of maize by many Late Woodland groups. In general, Late Woodland peoples who practiced a balanced hunting/fishing and gathering lifestyle were healthy with males living on average to age 40 and women to age 35. With the adoption of maize, there was an increase in dental caries and other diseases associated with increasing population densities and a sedentary lifestyle.' <sup id="cite_ref-494" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-494">[494]</a></sup> 'Early in the Eastern Late Woodland tradition, the vast majority of peoples living outside of the American Bottom (the area at the confluence of the Mississippi, Illinois, and the Missouri Rivers in west-central Illinois and east-central Missouri) were largely hunters and gatherers with only a small percentage of their diet obtained through horticultural activities. This changed through time as Middle Mississippian tradition societies developed in the southern regions of the eastern woodlands and maize became more prevalent throughout the continent. Toward the end of the Eastern Late Woodland tradition, maize became a staple in many, if not most, Late Woodland societies.' <sup id="cite_ref-495" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-495">[495]</a></sup> 'Fruits, nuts, starchy and oily seeds, as well as various roots were gathered by most Late Woodland tradition people. Wild deer appears to have been the dominant source of animal protein for Late Woodland peoples, although a wide range of mammal, bird, fish, and shellfish resources were also exploited depending on the regional context.' <sup id="cite_ref-496" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-496">[496]</a></sup> 'Prior to the adoption of maize and beans, cucurbits, gourds, and domesticated starchy and oily seed plants such as sunflower, sumpweed, chenopod, knotweed, may grass, and little barley were presumably grown in small garden plots.' <sup id="cite_ref-497" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-497">[497]</a></sup> 'Eastern Late Woodland tradition industrial arts seem to have been fairly basic in that there was very little elaboration on the ceramic and stone-working technologies utilized in prior Woodland traditions. It appears that most items were manufactured by individual households for use and consumption by that household.' <sup id="cite_ref-498" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-498">[498]</a></sup> 'Ceramic domestic cooking jars and chipped stone tools were the most commonly used utensils during the Late Woodland tradition. Ceramics in the northern portion of the eastern woodlands were commonly grit tempered, relatively thin-walled, and covered with cord marking, a result of the paddling phase of the paddle and anvil production process. Additional decoration appeared in the form of cord wrapped-object, single and multiple strand cord, and fabric impressions. Vessels were generally globular in shape with a simple constricted orifice although a number of rim forms were utilized, including the application of thin strips of clay around the exterior of the vessel rim to create a collar. Ceramic vessels in the southern part of the eastern woodlands were tempered with grog, grit, or crushed limestone or shell. Vessel forms were more complex, with the addition of specialized forms such as water bottles, salt pans, and effigy forms. Southern decoration techniques often involved incising and the use of simple and complicated stamps. The near-universal acceptance of the bow and arrow across the region led to the rapid replacement of small stemmed projectile points with notched and unnotched triangular points.' <sup id="cite_ref-499" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-499">[499]</a></sup> 'In the northern portions of the eastern woodlands, the Late Woodland tradition saw the reduction of archaeologically visible personal or group affiliated ornamentation. In some instances, Late Woodland groups on the northern border of the Middle Mississippian frontier adopted some Middle Mississippian ornaments such as marine shell disc beads. The overall decline in the use of copper, obsidian, mica, and other exotic raw materials that characterizes this period in the north suggests that ornamentation did not play a significant role among northern peoples. Among southern Late Woodland peoples however, the use of shell beads in both the disk and barrel shapes, especially in mortuary settings, indicates that ornamentation remained a sign of status.' <sup id="cite_ref-500" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-500">[500]</a></sup> 'The basic economic unit among Late Woodland peoples appears to have been the nuclear family, which was able to produce most, if not all, of the food and goods that it needed to survive. Some have suggested that changes in trade relations formed the impetus for change in the sociopolitical landscape of eastern North America from band-level society to more complex forms of organization such as tribes and chiefdoms. The argument revolves around the concept that changes in material culture from more elaborate in the Middle Woodland, to very plain in the Late Woodland, indicates that individual Late Woodland groups were interested in forming inter-regional ties that would be capable of creating buffers against social and environmental shortfalls. Should one group be under pressure from another group, or need food, then allied groups would be under obligation to lend support. The nature of the items being exchanged in most cases is unknown, but it is fairly clear that at least in the northern portion of the eastern woodlands, the items being exchanged are not exotic raw materials or prestige goods.' <sup id="cite_ref-501" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-501">[501]</a></sup> 'There does not appear to be any evidence for craft specialization in the majority of Late Woodland societies in the eastern woodlands.

However, the ethnographic record is full of instances where lineages or households in middle-range societies have demonstrated unequal access and control of resources like arable land, food resources such as maple sugar bushes, and even knowledge regarding the sacred, craft production, and trade routes. It is highly probable that Late Woodland peoples demonstrated these types of differential access and control of resources.' <sup id="cite_ref-503" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-503">[503]</a></sup> 'Political organization in Late Woodland societies varied considerably across the eastern woodlands. In the north, inter- and intra-community settlement patterns, as well as a reasonable continuity between prehistoric and historic groups, suggest that Late Woodland peoples organized themselves around either the household or lineage in either band or tribal (middle-range) level societies. In general, societies with these types of organization make social and political decisions based on group consensus. Certain individuals or lineages are usually awarded higher status than others are, but this status is not inherited and is usually earned on the basis of size of lineage, personal prowess, age, sex [sic], and gender. In the southern portion of the eastern woodlands, many Late Woodland groups appear to have been organized around similar levels of complexity. However, a number of societies also appear to have made the transition to more complex levels of organizations such as chiefdoms, without reliance on maize a griculture and with little archaeological evidence of inherited status other than the construction of monumental architecture.

Conflict has been viewed as a consequence of increasing population density and trends toward sedentism or as a response to invasive populations. Certainly by 1100 B.P. there are numerous examples of fortified sites, changes in settlement location selection to defensible positions, and increases in the number of individuals who show evidence of violent death.

In the northern woodlands, larger specialized structures were constructed and apparently maintained for public ceremonies. Smaller circular or ovoid structures, presumably "sweat lodges," were constructed for personal or small group use. Some archaeologists have argued that northern woodland mound groups formed the center of annual ceremonies designed to bring people together to bury their dead. In the southern woodlands, numerous villages are laid out with a central plaza area that intimates public ceremonies were conducted in these areas.

It is clear from these lines of evidence that Late Woodland peoples were fond of naturalistic motifs and geometric designs. In addition to the above artistic expressions, people of the southern eastern woodlands also constructed elaborate effigy-shaped ceramic vessels, often using slips and paints to add a color dimension to their expression.' <sup id="cite_ref-509" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-509">[509]</a></sup> 'A great deal of evidence has been uncovered regarding rituals associated with death and the afterlife.

In the northern eastern woodlands, mounds, some of which were constructed in the form of animal effigies, were used to house the remains of anywhere between 1-50 individuals. Typically, elaborate grave goods do not accompany these burials; in fact, often there are no goods at all. In some cases, the mounds were constructed with what appears to be ritual forethought, considerable care being taken to layer the mound fill with soils of various colors.

Limestone bedrocks contained chert outcrops, which provided raw material for chipped-stone tools. The surrounding uplands of volcanic bedrock provided basalt and diabase for ground-stone tools. The main benefit of limestone is that it promotes the growth of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in beans, which were the Iroquoians' major source of fertilizer for maize. The earliest settlements were situated on easily tilled, al- though easily leached, glacial outwash sands.

The earliest farming villages were small-roughly 0.5 ha-and were dispersed in valleys across the region. Through time, villages coalesced and grew in size. Tribal clusters consisting of one to four villages formed and were distributed roughly every 50 km across the region, leaving hinterlands between that served as the tribes' hunting grounds.

Villages were nearly always fortified with a palisade line supported by an earth embankment with a ditch to the outside and with one or two gates. Longhouses were built inside the palisade and were arranged at random initially. Over time, longhouses became larger, more numerous, and packed tightly in parallel alignment in the direction of the prevailing winds in order to prevent fires from spreading from one house to another.

Cemeteries were generally placed immediately outside the village.' <sup id="cite_ref-518" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-518">[518]</a></sup> 'Longhouses were occupied by matrilineages and grew through time, presumably as lineages grew in size.

Longhouses varied in length even within the same village and varied in style in terms of the type of end-square or rounded-and the type of roof-pitched or arced. Longhouses were built of cedar posts covered with slabs of elm bark in the south and cedar bark in the north. Longhouses were uniformally 7 m wide, contained bunk lines along the walls and fire hearths down the center aisle, and were often divided into compart ments 4 m long. Two nuclear families would share a compartment and one fire hearth.

Confederacies of tribes that existed at Contact, for example the Huron in Ontario and the Five Nations in New York, numbered approximately 20,000 individuals each. The total population of all tribes in Ontario is estimated to have been 60,000 and that in New York 40,000-50,000. Population growth was largely through adoption of captives. Natural growth was limited by the fact that Iroquoian women could care for only one child at a time while tending the crops, and so practiced birth control through prolonged nursing and use of abortative herbs.' <sup id="cite_ref-520" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-520">[520]</a></sup> 'Analysis of carbon isotopes in human bones reveals that the Iroquoian diet consisted of at least 50 percent maize.

Dent corn was ground into flour and used for various breads, to which were added ground beans and dried berries.

Besides use for shelter, elm bark was used to build canoes. In a land too warm to support the paper birch tree, elm bark was used instead.

Combs and hairpins were carved from deer bone and antler. Beads of a variety of animal effigy forms were fashioned from imported marine shell; the duck form seems to have been most popular. Circular pendants, known as run tees, were carved from marine shell plates.

Deer hides may have been traded with the more populous horticultural groups to the south. Tobacco was grown by Iroquoians and was undoubtedly traded to surrounding nonhorticultural groups, as it was used for ritual purposes throughout North America. The Mohawk river valley in New York was the source of "Herkimer Diamonds," or quartz crystals, which had ritual significance and were traded by the Mohawk.

Beyond the woods edge was men's domain where they hunted, fished, traded, and conducted warfare. Related women cultivated crops together; men hunted and fished and brought the catch back to the longhouse of their wives. This basic division of labor was symbolized in the marriage ritual, by a gift of cornbread from the woman and of venison from the man. Men of each clan segment or moiety cleared the fields and built the village infrastructure, and women cultivated the crops. Children guarded the maize fields against pests, and the harvest chores were shared ceremoniously by everyone in the village. Old men made fishing nets; old women made mats, baskets, and clothing. Men flaked lithic projectile points; women are believed to have flaked their own scrapers and cutting tools. Women made pottery; men made ceramic tobacco pipes. There were no craft specialists, per se, although some of the lithic points and ceramic pots were very fine and were undoubtedly made by more skilled individuals. Specialized activity areas in longhouses, such as hidescraping and flint-knapping areas, have been identified archaeologically and probably represent communal task groups (as in sewing bees) rather than craft specialists.' <sup id="cite_ref-535" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-535">[535]</a></sup> 'Resources were controlled by clans according to egalitarean principles.

Matrilineages belonged to one or more-up to eight--clans that traced their ancestry to a common female. Where ancestry was forgotten, clans served as fictive kin groups and functioned to accommodate visitors of the same clan from outside villages traveling on trading expeditions. Clans maintained various medicine societies and maintained a set of names that were assigned to its members. Clans were organized into one of two moieties. Among the Five-Nations Iroquois, the Father or Older Brother moiety consisted of the Turtle clan and clans of various mammals, while the Female or Younger Brother moiety consisted of the Deer clan and clans of various birds. Moieties functioned primarily in the performance of the Condolence Ceremony, where the "clear-minded" moiety condoled the grieving and mourning moiety of the deceased.

Nuclear families were small (see Population above) and consisted ideally of three children. Two families would share one fire hearth and longhouse compartment, and each longhouse would contain 5 to 10 hearths and compartments. Children were raised by the maternal extended family (Fenton 1978: 312).

Next came the planting ceremony, which included group preparation of the fields. In June was the Strawberry Festival, when men stripped pliable elm bark for building houses and canoes. During the summer, there were three maizehoeing ceremonies. These were accompanied by the Thunder Rite, where the great spirit was pleaded to provide rain for the crops. In late summer was the Green Corn Ceremony, when the corn reached its milk stage and was available for feasting. The Harvest Ceremony was accompanied by husking bees where maize was
strung into long braids and hung from the longhouse rafters to dry. In the fall, families left the village, dispersing into the forest to hunt deer. Finally, at midwinter, the families returned to the village with their cured meat for the most important ceremony of all: the Midwinter Ceremony.

False face masks were carved out of live, standing basswood trees, and undoubtedly their form became more elaborate with the introduction of iron cutting tools during the Contact period. Cornhusk masks were woven out of cornhusks by members of the Husk Face Society and were worn at the Midwinter Ceremonies.

Collars of pots were often decorated with effigy forms, including human faces. A common motif in early Contract period pots was a human skeleton, which was often stylized as a simple rib cage and has often been misidentified as a corncob.

This zone contains limestone bedrock-based glacial tills and moraines, which supported nitrogen fixation by beans for maize. The number of frostfree days ranges from 180 along the great Lakes shores to less than 100 in the upper elevations of the highlands; 120 were required to grow eight-row northern flint maize. The east ends of lakes Erie and Ontario, as well as the east sides of the Finger lakes and Oneida lake, were subjected to lake-effect rains and tempering breezes, which attracted lroquoian horticulturalists. The region falls in the Carolinian biotic province consisting of oak-hickory-chestnut forests, which provided mast for whitetailed deer and turkey. Running east-west through the heart of the region are the Niagara and Onondaga escarpments, which provided chert for lithic tools. Rivers draining from the highlands into the Great lakes supported anadromous fish such as lake salmon, and the lower elevations contained vast wetlands, which hosted flocks of migratory waterfowl.' <sup id="cite_ref-562" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-562">[562]</a></sup> 'Villages ranged in size from 0.3 ha to 3 ha and generally increased in size over time. Villages shifted over time from lake and riverside locations into the uplands remote from canoe-navigable waterways (Hasenstab 1996; Ritchie 1969; Ritchie and Funk 1973). Some villages, particularly earlier ones, were situated near falls and portages along canoe routes and may have controlled trade (Hasenstab 1987). Villages were fortified with palisades, and later ones were placed in defensible situations. Longhouses inside the villages increased in length through time to reach mammoth proportions of up to 130 m (Snow 1995; Tuck 1971). Villages typically contained large roasting pits probably used for feasting; some of these contained cannibalized human bone (Tuck 1971). Villages were generally moved every 10-25 years for distances of approximately 3 km (Tuck 1971; White 1961; Wray and Shoff 1953), although some, particularly those of the Onondaga, remained occupied for periods of 80-100 years (Bradley 1987: 22; Tuck 1971: 58). Some tribes had villages with associated smaller villages nearby: in the Onondaga area, these are interpreted as waystations for groups being assimilated (Bradley 1987: 27), and in the Seneca area, they are interpreted as military camps occupied by warriors (Charles Wray, personal communication 1982).' <sup id="cite_ref-563" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-563">[563]</a></sup> 'The staple foods of the New York Iroquois were the so-called Three-Sisters crops: maize, beans, and squash (Parker 1968). The next most important food item was whitetail deer, which was taken chiefly by hunting with bow and arrow. On the plains of lake Ontario, vast grasslands or "oak openings" were maintained by annual burning in order to attract game. In the hardwood forests of the region, migrating flocks of passenger pigeons would come to roost and were captured with nets. Flocks of migratory waterfowl stopping over in the lowland wetlands were hunted, undoubtedly from canoes. Weirs were set up along the Seneca river and tributaries of the Finger lakes to capture migrating fish such as lake salmon. Freshwater mussel shells are ubiquitous on most village sites and were probably gathered by women and children to supplement game brought home by hunters. Trade was conducted to a limited extent during the prehistoric period; exports included the so-called "Herkimer Diamonds," or quartz crystals, from the Mohawk river valley and Onondaga chert from the Niagara and Onondaga escarpments.' <sup id="cite_ref-564" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-564">[564]</a></sup> 'Villages were organized within according to matrilineages, clans, and moieties (Morgan 1851; Snow 1994). Each longhouse was occupied by an extended family related along the female line, i.e., a matrilineage. These were organized into clans that traced their ancestry to a common female. Clans maintained various medicine societies and maintained a set of names that were assigned to its members. Clans were organized into one of two moieties. Among the Five-Nations Iroquois, the Father or Older Brother moiety consisted of the Turtle clan and clans of various mammals; the Female or Younger Brother moiety consisted of the Deer clan and clans of various birds. Moieties functioned primarily in the performance of the Condolence Ceremony, where the "clear-minded" moiety condoled the grieving and mourning moiety of the deceased. Moieties also were the basis of organization of communal work activities-such as house building-and of games, such as lacrosse. Traditionally, moieties were exogomous, that is, marriages were prohibited within the same moiety. Society was relatively egalitarian, although certain clan lineages held chief positions and were regarded as noble. Chiefs were appointed within these lineages by clan matrons. When they died, their survivors were condoled in a special condolence ceremony combined with a ceremony to "raise" a new chief in the clan to replace the deceased. All the clan chiefs of a village served on a council, and decisions were made by unanimous consensus. Warfare was controlled by specially appointed war chiefs. Warfare was endemic in the New York Iroquois area, and in most cases its goal was to take captives, especially women and children, to adopt into one's own village. Warfare intensified through the Late Woodland period, as evidenced by an increase in cannibalized human bone on sites, more formidable fortifications around villages, more defensible village locations, and the greater distance of villages from navigable waterways. Some time around 400 B.P., the Five Nations tribes (the Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, and Mohawk) formed a mutual nonaggression pact and defensive alliance against surrounding tribes. This was followed by the disappearance of the St. Lawrence Iroquois and the displacement of the Susquehannock Iroquoians a substantial distance down the Susquehanna river. Later in the early Contact period, the Erie and Wenro tribes in Western New York were defeated by the league as were ultimately the Huron.' <sup id="cite_ref-565" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-565">[565]</a></sup> 'The Iroquois creation myth makes reference to the "first times" when the people were divided into two groups living on either bank of a river; these symbolizing the two moieties of Iroquois society.

Shamans or medicine men and women were organized into medicine societies within clans. The False Face Society conducted dances to cure the ill, employing wooden masks of grotesque forms carved and worn by members of the society. These are believed to have their roots in the myth of the Stone Face being-stone carvings of which occur archaeologically on early Iroquois sites. The Husk Face Society was made up of medicine women who would cure the sick among themselves. Death of an individual was followed by the Condolence Ceremony in which the moiety of the deceased was condoled by the opposite moiety. The Iroquois believed that following death the soul left the body and began a journey to the "village of souls" in the sky world to the west. Many of the deceased, in Seneca cemeteries, for example, were buried facing west. Unlike the Ontario Iroquois who practiced ossuary burial, the Five Nations interred their dead in individual graves. Grave goods are rare in prehistoric burials but increase in the proto historic period as early European trade goods filter in. Tribes in the western part of New York were influenced by their Ontario neighbors and practiced ossuary burial (see the Ontario Iroquois subtradition).' <sup id="cite_ref-566" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-566">[566]</a></sup>
</p><p>eHRAF provides a general summary of Iroquois political and military history: 'The Iroquoian confederacy was organized sometime between 1400 and A.D. 1600 for the purpose of maintaining peaceful relations between the 5 constituent tribes. Subsequent to European contact relations within the confederacy were sometimes strained as each of the 5 tribes sought to expand and maintain its own interests in the developing fur trade. For the most part, however, the fur trade served to strengthen the confederacy because tribal interests often complemented one another and all gained from acting in concert. The League was skillful at playing French and English interests off against one another to its advantage and thereby was able to play a major role in the economic and political events of northeastern North America during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The Iroquois aggressively maintained and expanded their role in the fur trade and as a result periodically found themselves at war with their neighbors, such as the Huron, Petun, and the Neutral to the West and the Susquehannock to the south. Much of the fighting was done by the Seneca, the most powerful of the Iroquoian tribes. From 1667 to the 1680s the Iroquois maintained friendly relations with the French and during this time Jesuit missions were established among each of the 5 tribes.' <sup id="cite_ref-567" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-567">[567]</a></sup> 'However, Iroquois aggression and expansion eventually brought them into conflict with the French and, at the same time, into closer alliance with the English. In 1687, 1693 and 1696 French military expeditions raided and burned Iroquois villages and fields. During Queen Anne's War (1702-1713) the Iroquois allied with the English and at the War's end were acknowledged to be British subjects, though they continued to aggressively maintain and extend their middleman role between English traders at Fort Orange (Albany) and native groups farther west. The victory of the English over the French in North America in 1763 weakened the power of the confederacy by undermining the strategic economic and political position of the tribes and by promoting the rapid expansion of White settlement. When the American Revolution broke out in 1775 neither the League as a whole nor even the tribes individually were able to agree on a common course of action. Most of the Iroquois allied with the British and as a result during and after the Revolution were forced from their homelands. In the period following the American Revolution the members of the Iroquois tribes settled on reservations in western New York state, southern Quebec and southern Ontario, where many of their descendants remain today.' <sup id="cite_ref-568" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-568">[568]</a></sup>
</p><p>Note: The league was organized in multiple 'nations', clans and councils: 'THE POLITICAL ORGANIZATION of the Iroquois--the system by which decisions were made about problems affecting village, tribe, or confederacy --had three levels. The town or village itself decided local issues like the use of nearby hunting lands, the relocation of houses and cornfields, movement to another site, the acceptance or rejection of visitors, and the raising of war parties. There was a village chiefs' council, numbering up to twenty men, formally organized with a chairman and one or more representatives for each clan. These chiefs were influential men and women, who might be League sachems, warcaptains, warriors, or simply old men who were looked up to and consulted. The council generally met in the presence of the warriors and the women, and rarely diverged in its decisions from the popular consensus, or at least the majority view. This council met in the village's ceremonial longhouse, which usually was merely a large dwelling.' <sup id="cite_ref-569" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-569">[569]</a></sup> Female lineage elders played an important role on the local level: 'The primary local groups of Iroquois society were the extended household and the village. Each extended family lived in a long bark structure, some of which were from fifty to one hundred and fifty feet in length by sixty in breadth, known as longhouses. Throughout its length was a central passageway in which were located hearths at intervals of ten to twelve feet with each hearth being used by two conjugal families. On both sides of this central passageway were apartments each occupied by a simple family. The composition of the group inhabiting the longhouse appears to have been controlled by the matriarch of a lineage. Influential matriarchs who held a chiefly title tended to group their female relatives around them in the same longhouse.' <sup id="cite_ref-570" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-570">[570]</a></sup> Various political levels were validated by wampum beads: 'The longhouse owns “wampums” which validate its position as a ritual center but which are rarely brought out. Wampum occasionally  figures in the ritual, such as the string of wampum used in the rite of confession. But the significance of wampum generally is that because it is a valuable object, it is used to indicate the significance of the event, either by giving it as a commemoration of the event or as being shown in remembrance of the event. Wampum belts, for example, were given at treaties to indicate good faith in the making of the treaty, and might be brought out to remind others of the treaty. In and of itself, wampum is not sacred.' <sup id="cite_ref-571" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-571">[571]</a></sup> The central League Council dealt with commonn affairs, with tribal chiefs and councils (as well as the female elders of their respective lineages and more recently created non-hereditary positions) occupying an intermediary position: 'The Iroquois confederacy operated under a council of 50 sachems representing the five original tribes. When the Tuscarora joined the League in 1722, no new sachem positions were created for it. The council was a legislative, executive and judicial body that deliberated only on the external affairs of the confederacy, such as peace and war, and on matters common to the five constituent tribes. The council had no voice in the internal affairs of the separate tribes. Tribal representation on the council was unequally distributed among the 5 tribes although abuse of power was limited by the requirement of unanimity in all council decisions. Below the level of the League council were separate tribal councils concerned with the internal affairs of each tribe and each tribe's relations with external groups. The tribal council was composed of the sachems who represented the tribe on the League council. Sachem positions were hereditary within each tribe and belonged to particular matrisibs. The women of the matrisib nominated each new sachem, who was always a male, and had the power to recall or "dehorn" a chief who failed to represent the interests of his people. Theoretically, each sachem was equal to the others in power, but in practice those with better oratorial skills wielded greater influence. After the confederacy had been functioning for a period of time a new, nonhereditary office of Pine Tree Chief was created to provide local leadership and to act as advisors to the council sachems, although later they actually sat on the League council and equaled the sachems in power. Pine Tree Chiefs held their position for life and were chosen by the women of a matrisib on the basis of skill in warfare. Iroquois involvement in the fur trade and war with the French increased the importance and solidarity of the League council and thereby strengthened the confederacy. The strength of the confederacy continued to grow until the time of the American Revolution when Iroquois interests divided between alliances to the British and the American colonists.' <sup id="cite_ref-572" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-572">[572]</a></sup> 'A Chief was appointed by the oldest woman of the maternal family in which the title descended. Her descendants and those who were related clanwise were his constituents. The matron and the chief tended to reside in the same settlement, for when the Chief removed, the clan had no one to regard with confidence unless he returned for village councils. If the matron removed, local succession was in jeopardy.  The results of deliberations by the clan were taken from village councils to the council of the tribe. The ranking clan chiefs residing at a place were the cochiefs of that settlement. All eight of the Seneca chiefs are now concentrated at Tonawanda, but formerly the Seneca had at least four villages, and all the rest save the Oneida had each two or three principal towns with satellite settlements. The tribe thus spoke a common language, it comprised two or more settlements, it was governed by a common council of village chiefs who also represented constituent clans, and they governed a common territory adjacent to the towns. In time all clans were present in all villages, probably about in the same proportions as they are now. As any clan predominated in a settlement, members had to seek mates in the next village, or divide their own house in twain, thus distributing the clans again.' <sup id="cite_ref-573" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-573">[573]</a></sup> Tribes were composed of matrilineages: 'Matrilineages were organized into 15 matrisibs. Among the Cayuga, Onondaga, Seneca and Tuscarora the matrisibs were further organized into moieties. Among the Mohawk and the Oneida no moiety division was recognized. Descent was matrilineal.' <sup id="cite_ref-574" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-574">[574]</a></sup> The League Council initially met at Onondaga, but the council fire was extinguished and rekindled in various places during the tribulations of the colonial period: 'The council continued to be composed of hereditary chiefs, who together with the “war chiefs” from 1812 andthe Pine Tree chiefs numbered over 50. The Crown madeno attempt to interfere with the appointment or dismissalof chiefs (Weaver 1975). The chiefs met in the Onondagacouncil house, a log structure near Middleport, two orthree times a year to deliberate in traditional fashionmatters of community interest (Weaver 1963-1974). The Onondagas, known collectively as the firekeepers, actedas mediators in the proceedings according to traditionalcustom. However, the tribal seating plan differed fromthe traditional one in that the Mohawks and Senecasoccupied the positions east of the council fire, while theOneidas and Cayugas sat on the west, together with thedependent nations: Tuscaroras, Nanticokes, Delawares,and Tutelos. Although the dependent nations were tospeak through “their voice,” the Cayugas, in fact theyoften directly addressed the assembly of chiefs, andoperated quite independently, though not equaling theoriginal five nations in power or status.' <sup id="cite_ref-575" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-575">[575]</a></sup>  'Despite the efforts of the Onondagas at Onondaga tohave them returned to Onondaga, the council fire of theConfederacy and its wampum records remained at BuffaloCreek until after that reservation had been sold andCaptain Cold (“The League of the Iroquois: Its History,Politics, and Ritual,” fig. 11, this vol.), keeper of thecouncil fire and the wampum, had died.

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from military ♣ present ♥</b> The political organization distinguished between villages, tribes, and the common confederate level: 'THE POLITICAL ORGANIZATION of the Iroquois--the system by which decisions were made about problems affecting village, tribe, or confederacy --had three levels. The town or village itself decided local issues like the use of nearby hunting lands, the relocation of houses and cornfields, movement to another site, the acceptance or rejection of visitors, and the raising of war parties.

This council met in the village's ceremonial longhouse, which usually was merely a large dwelling.' <sup id="cite_ref-577" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-577">[577]</a></sup> Distinguished war-leaders were eligible for non-hereditary chieftainships: 'The powers and duties of the sachems and chiefs were entirely of a civil character, and confined, by their organic laws, to the affairs of peace. No sachem could go out to war in his official capacity, as a civil ruler. If disposed to take the war-path, he laid aside his civil office, for the time being, and became a common warrior. It becomes an important inquiry, therefore, to ascertain in whom the military power, was vested. The Iroquois had no distinct class of war-chiefs, raised up and set apart to command in  time of war; neither do the sachems or chiefs appear to have possessed the power of appointing such persons as they considered suitable to the post of command. All military operations were left entirely to private enterprise, and to the system of voluntary service, the sachems seeking rather to repress and restrain, than to encourage the martial ardor of the people. Their principal war-captains were to be found among he class called chiefs, many of whom were elected to this office in reward for their military achievements. The singular method of warfare among the Iroquois renders it extremely difficult to obtain a complete and satisfactory explanation of the manner in which their varlike operations were conducted. Their whole civil policy was averse to the concentration of power in the hands of any single individual, but inclined to the opposite principle of division among a number of equals; and this policy they carried into their military as well as through their civil organization. Small bands were, in the first instance, organized by  individual leaders, each of which, if they were afterwards united upon the same enterprise, continued under its own captain, and the whole force, as well as the conduct of the expedition, was under their joint management. They appointed no one of their number to absolute command, but the general direction was left open to the strongest will, or the most persuasive voice.' <sup id="cite_ref-578" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-578">[578]</a></sup> 'When the power of the Ho-de[unknown] -no-sau-nee   began to develop, under the new system of oligarchies within an oligarchy, there sprang up around the sachems a class of warriors, distinguished for enterprise upon the war-path, and eloquence in council, who demanded some participation in the administration of public affairs. The serious objections to the enlargement of the number of rulers, involving, as it did, changes in the framework of the government, for a long period enabled the sachems to resist the encroachment. In the progress of events, this class became too powerful to be withstood, and the sachems were compelled to raise them up in the subordinate station of chiefs. The title was purely elective, and the reward of merit. Unlike the sachemships, the name was not hereditary in the tribe or family of the individual, but terminated with the chief himself; unless subsequently bestowed by the tribe upon some other  person, to preserve it as one of their illustrious names. These chiefs were originally invested with very limited powers, their principal office being that of advisers and counsellors of the sachems. Having thus obtained a foothold in the government, this class, to the number of which there was no limit, gradually enlarged their influence, and from generation to generation drew nearer to an equality with the sachems themselves. By this innovation the government was liberalized, to the sensible diminution of the power of the sachems, which, at the institution of the League, was extremely arbitrary.' <sup id="cite_ref-579" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-579">[579]</a></sup> Warriors were represented in their own councils: 'Closely allied with the Council of Elders was the women's council who brought the matters up before the council. Lafitau maintained: Separate from both the women's and elder's councils was the warriors' council which sought to influence authority decisions of the council of elders because they were the soldiers or ‘police’ of the village. Their internal affairs idsally were limited to military raids, games,  and carrying out the military policy of the council of elders or League Council. In addition to the various councils, asseciations of men and women possibly existed for curing. Lafitau noted “I have been told that they have several sorts of private associations like fraternities” (Ibdd.:476). Fenton speculated that these associations were procursers of the “medicine societies” (Lafitau, 1724, 1:476). However, these associations seem to be the actual medicine societies and as such would have been village groups that criss-cross lineage, clan and moiety statuses.' <sup id="cite_ref-580" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-580">[580]</a></sup> Accordingly, some separation was present, although the material may more accurately reflect the pre-reservation period.</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from legislative ♣ absent ♥</b> There was no legislative in the sense of a separate institution. Councils combined legislative, executive and judicial duties: 'The Iroquois confederacy operated under a council of 50 sachems representing the five original tribes.

The council was a legislative, executive and judicial body that deliberated only on the external affairs of the confederacy, such as peace and war, and on matters common to the five constituent tribes.

The tribal council was composed of the sachems who represented the tribe on the League council. Sachem positions were hereditary within each tribe and belonged to particular matrisibs.

<dd> <b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from judiciary ♣ absent ♥</b> According to L.H. Morgan, there was no formal penal code. Chiefs and councils doubled as judicial authorities: 'Crimes and offences were so unfrequent under their social system, that the Iroquois can scarcely be said to have had a criminal code. Yet there were certain misdemeanors which fell under the judicial cognizance of the sachems, and were punished by them in proportion to their magnitude. Witchcraft was punishable with death. Any person could take the life of a witch when discovered in the act. If this was not done, a council was called, and the witch arraigned before it, in the presence of the accuser. A full confession, with a promise of amendment, secured a discharge. But if the accusation was denied, witnesses were called and examined concerning the circumstances of the case; and if they established the charge to the satisfaction of the council, which they rarely failed to do, condemnation followed, with a sentence of death. The witch was then delivered over to such executioners as volunteered for the purpose, and by them was led away to punishment. After the decision of the council, the relatives of the witch gave him up to his doom without a murmur.' <sup id="cite_ref-584" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-584">[584]</a></sup> But according to Lyford, there was an orally transmitted constitution validated by wampum beads: 'The League of the Iroquois was governed by a carefully worked out constitution that was transmitted orally from one generation to another by certain leaders (lords or sachems) whose business it was to learn and to recite the laws and regulations. For many generations these laws and regulations were recorded in a collection of wampum belts and strings, twenty-five of which are preserved today in the New York State Museum, whose director has been proclaimed “the keeper of the wampums.”' <sup id="cite_ref-585" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-585">[585]</a></sup> Council houses combined judicial, executive, and legislative with ceremonial functions, but were also residential: 'In 1818, Timothy Alden (1827:54-55) described a similar council house at Tonawanda. It was fifty feet long and twenty wide. On each side of it, longitudinally is a platform, a little more than one foot high and four feet wide, covered with furs, which furnishes a convenient place for sitting, lounging, and sleeping. A rail across the centre separates the males from the females, who are constant attendants and listen, with silence, diligence, and interest, to whatever is delivered in council. Over the platform is a kind of galley, five or six feet from the floor, which is loaded with peltry, corn, implements of hunting, and a variety of other articles. At each end of the building is a door, and near each door, within, was the council fire. . . . Over each fire several large kettles of soup were hanging and boiling. The smoke was conveyed away through apertures in the roof and did not annoy. The chiefs and others, as many as could be accommodated, in their appropriate grotesque habiliments, were seated on the platform, smoking calumets, of various forms, sizes, and materials, several of which were tendered to me in token of friendship. Profound silence pervaded the crowded assembly.' <sup id="cite_ref-586" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-586">[586]</a></sup> Accordingly, there were no separate judicial authorities.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Right to petition executive ♣ present ♥</b> Women did not usually speak at council meetings, but could influence the decision-making process in other ways: 'The literature stresses the “high position of women” in respect to their participation in dominantly male-oriented cultural activities, especially politics and religion. The political points are familiar and most of them can be traced to the symbolic extension of the Longhouse as the conceptual basis of the League. The extended family structure of the Longhouse, symbolized in the League, accounts for the function of the matrons to hold the chiefs' names in their clans and their consequent right to appoint and depose chiefs. Death feasts and mourning were the responsibility of the women. Women kept the White Wampum belts which signified the chiefly names. The ability of [Page 172] the women to influence decisions of the council both directly through their speaker and indirectly through the weight of public opinion is mentioned in the literature. Since unanimity was necessary for a decision to act, any proposal unpopular with the matrons could be hindered by their disapproval. Indirectly, too, it is stated that the women could hinder or actually prevent a war party which lacked their approval by not giving the supplies of dried corn and the moccasins which the warriors required. Village head-women are mentioned in myth, and though they may not actually have ruled villages, this concept reflects the power that women were thought to possess. The importance of clan matrons in deciding the fate of captives, whether they would be adopted to replace a lost clan member, or tortured as revenge for a death within the clan, is well known.' <sup id="cite_ref-587" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-587">[587]</a></sup> 'Allusion has been made to the fact that Iroquois women, however influential politically and socially, did not speak in their councils. Early writers take notice of this, and the custom continued. In 1791 Colonel Proctor attended a Seneca feast, where he saw a wooden statue before which they danced. “Under this statue were placed two chiefs, termed the women's speakers. . . . The old and the young women danced around in a circle,” etc. The same gentleman went to a council in Buffalo that year, to “hear what would be said by the women speaker, the young prince of the Turtle tribe (Red Jacket). . . . Being arrived, the first matter unusual that presented itself were the elders of the women seated near the chiefs.” Red Jacket gave their plea for peace.' <sup id="cite_ref-588" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-588">[588]</a></sup> 'If the women could not or would not always prevent war they often caused it to stop. At a conference at Niagara in 1767, the commissary “was informed that the old women of the Sinecas had stopt their young men from going to war.” They are credited with more power of this kind than they probably had, but they always claimed a share in public affairs. At a council in Albany in 1788, Good Peter, an Oneida chief, after speaking for the men, delivered the women's message. “You have heard our voice; we now entreat [Page 87] you to open your ears and hear a speech from our sisters, the governesses.' <sup id="cite_ref-589" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-589">[589]</a></sup> Women had their own councils: 'Closely allied with the Council of Elders was the women's council who brought the matters up before the council. Lafitau maintained: The women are always the first who should deliberate according to their principles on private or community matters. They hold their councils apart, and as a result of their decisions advise the chiefs on matters on the mat. (1724, 1:477) Separate from both the women's and elder's councils was the warriors' council which sought to influence authority decisions of the council of elders because they were the soldiers or ‘police’ of the village. Their internal affairs idsally were limited to military raids, games, [Page 25] and carrying out the military policy of the council of elders or League Council. In addition to the various councils, asseciations of men and women possibly existed for curing.

<p><b>♠ State-level administrators ♣ absent ♥</b>
</p><p><b>♠ Prestige of state-level bureaucracy ♣ absent ♥</b> Note: The political system of the league was not bureaucratic. Wallace provides a general summary: 'THE POLITICAL ORGANIZATION of the Iroquois--the system by which decisions were made about problems affecting village, tribe, or confederacy --had three levels. The town or village itself decided local issues like the use of nearby hunting lands, the relocation of houses and cornfields, movement to another site, the acceptance or rejection of visitors, and the raising of war parties. There was a village chiefs' council, numbering up to twenty men, formally organized with a chairman and one or more representatives for each clan. These chiefs were influential men and women, who might be League sachems, warcaptains, warriors, or simply old men who were looked up to and consulted. The council generally met in the presence of the warriors and the women, and rarely diverged in its decisions from the popular consensus, or at least the majority view. This council met in the village's ceremonial longhouse, which usually was merely a large dwelling.' <sup id="cite_ref-598" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-598">[598]</a></sup> Female lineage elders played an important role on the local level: 'The primary local groups of Iroquois society were the extended household and the village. Each extended family lived in a long bark structure, some of which were from fifty to one hundred and fifty feet in length by sixty in breadth, known as longhouses. Throughout its length was a central passageway in which were located hearths at intervals of ten to twelve feet with each hearth being used by two conjugal families. On both sides of this central passageway were apartments each occupied by a simple family. The composition of the group inhabiting the longhouse appears to have been controlled by the matriarch of a lineage. Influential matriarchs who held a chiefly title tended to group their female relatives around them in the same longhouse.' <sup id="cite_ref-599" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-599">[599]</a></sup> Various political levels were validated by wampum beads: 'The longhouse owns “wampums” which validate its position as a ritual center but which are rarely brought out. Wampum occasionally  figures in the ritual, such as the string of wampum used in the rite of confession. But the significance of wampum generally is that because it is a valuable object, it is used to indicate the significance of the event, either by giving it as a commemoration of the event or as being shown in remembrance of the event. Wampum belts, for example, were given at treaties to indicate good faith in the making of the treaty, and might be brought out to remind others of the treaty. In and of itself, wampum is not sacred.' <sup id="cite_ref-600" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-600">[600]</a></sup> The central League Council dealt with commonn affairs, with tribal chiefs and councils (as well as the female elders of their respective lineages and more recently created non-hereditary positions) occupying an intermediary position: 'The Iroquois confederacy operated under a council of 50 sachems representing the five original tribes. When the Tuscarora joined the League in 1722, no new sachem positions were created for it. The council was a legislative, executive and judicial body that deliberated only on the external affairs of the confederacy, such as peace and war, and on matters common to the five constituent tribes. The council had no voice in the internal affairs of the separate tribes. Tribal representation on the council was unequally distributed among the 5 tribes although abuse of power was limited by the requirement of unanimity in all council decisions. Below the level of the League council were separate tribal councils concerned with the internal affairs of each tribe and each tribe's relations with external groups. The tribal council was composed of the sachems who represented the tribe on the League council. Sachem positions were hereditary within each tribe and belonged to particular matrisibs. The women of the matrisib nominated each new sachem, who was always a male, and had the power to recall or "dehorn" a chief who failed to represent the interests of his people. Theoretically, each sachem was equal to the others in power, but in practice those with better oratorial skills wielded greater influence. After the confederacy had been functioning for a period of time a new, nonhereditary office of Pine Tree Chief was created to provide local leadership and to act as advisors to the council sachems, although later they actually sat on the League council and equaled the sachems in power. Pine Tree Chiefs held their position for life and were chosen by the women of a matrisib on the basis of skill in warfare. Iroquois involvement in the fur trade and war with the French increased the importance and solidarity of the League council and thereby strengthened the confederacy. The strength of the confederacy continued to grow until the time of the American Revolution when Iroquois interests divided between alliances to the British and the American colonists.' <sup id="cite_ref-601" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-601">[601]</a></sup> 'A Chief was appointed by the oldest woman of the maternal family in which the title descended. Her descendants and those who were related clanwise were his constituents. The matron and the chief tended to reside in the same settlement, for when the Chief removed, the clan had no one to regard with confidence unless he returned for village councils. If the matron removed, local succession was in jeopardy.  The results of deliberations by the clan were taken from village councils to the council of the tribe. The ranking clan chiefs residing at a place were the cochiefs of that settlement. All eight of the Seneca chiefs are now concentrated at Tonawanda, but formerly the Seneca had at least four villages, and all the rest save the Oneida had each two or three principal towns with satellite settlements. The tribe thus spoke a common language, it comprised two or more settlements, it was governed by a common council of village chiefs who also represented constituent clans, and they governed a common territory adjacent to the towns. In time all clans were present in all villages, probably about in the same proportions as they are now. As any clan predominated in a settlement, members had to seek mates in the next village, or divide their own house in twain, thus distributing the clans again.' <sup id="cite_ref-602" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-602">[602]</a></sup> Tribes were composed of matrilineages: 'Matrilineages were organized into 15 matrisibs. Among the Cayuga, Onondaga, Seneca and Tuscarora the matrisibs were further organized into moieties. Among the Mohawk and the Oneida no moiety division was recognized. Descent was matrilineal.' <sup id="cite_ref-603" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-603">[603]</a></sup> The League Council initially met at Onondaga, but the council fire was extinguished and rekindled in various places during the tribulations of the colonial period: 'The council continued to be composed of hereditary chiefs, who together with the “war chiefs” from 1812 andthe Pine Tree chiefs numbered over 50. The Crown madeno attempt to interfere with the appointment or dismissalof chiefs (Weaver 1975). The chiefs met in the Onondagacouncil house, a log structure near Middleport, two orthree times a year to deliberate in traditional fashionmatters of community interest (Weaver 1963-1974). The Onondagas, known collectively as the firekeepers, actedas mediators in the proceedings according to traditionalcustom. However, the tribal seating plan differed fromthe traditional one in that the Mohawks and Senecasoccupied the positions east of the council fire, while theOneidas and Cayugas sat on the west, together with thedependent nations: Tuscaroras, Nanticokes, Delawares,and Tutelos. Although the dependent nations were tospeak through “their voice,” the Cayugas, in fact theyoften directly addressed the assembly of chiefs, andoperated quite independently, though not equaling theoriginal five nations in power or status.' <sup id="cite_ref-604" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-604">[604]</a></sup>  'Despite the efforts of the Onondagas at Onondaga tohave them returned to Onondaga, the council fire of theConfederacy and its wampum records remained at BuffaloCreek until after that reservation had been sold andCaptain Cold (“The League of the Iroquois: Its History,Politics, and Ritual,” fig. 11, this vol.), keeper of thecouncil fire and the wampum, had died.

<p><b>♠ Number of regional administrative units ♣ ♥</b>
</p><p><b>♠ Local-level administrators ♣ absent ♥</b> Note: The political system of the league was not bureaucratic. Wallace provides a general summary: 'THE POLITICAL ORGANIZATION of the Iroquois--the system by which decisions were made about problems affecting village, tribe, or confederacy --had three levels. The town or village itself decided local issues like the use of nearby hunting lands, the relocation of houses and cornfields, movement to another site, the acceptance or rejection of visitors, and the raising of war parties. There was a village chiefs' council, numbering up to twenty men, formally organized with a chairman and one or more representatives for each clan. These chiefs were influential men and women, who might be League sachems, warcaptains, warriors, or simply old men who were looked up to and consulted. The council generally met in the presence of the warriors and the women, and rarely diverged in its decisions from the popular consensus, or at least the majority view. This council met in the village's ceremonial longhouse, which usually was merely a large dwelling.' <sup id="cite_ref-606" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-606">[606]</a></sup> Female lineage elders played an important role on the local level: 'The primary local groups of Iroquois society were the extended household and the village. Each extended family lived in a long bark structure, some of which were from fifty to one hundred and fifty feet in length by sixty in breadth, known as longhouses. Throughout its length was a central passageway in which were located hearths at intervals of ten to twelve feet with each hearth being used by two conjugal families. On both sides of this central passageway were apartments each occupied by a simple family. The composition of the group inhabiting the longhouse appears to have been controlled by the matriarch of a lineage. Influential matriarchs who held a chiefly title tended to group their female relatives around them in the same longhouse.' <sup id="cite_ref-607" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-607">[607]</a></sup> Various political levels were validated by wampum beads: 'The longhouse owns “wampums” which validate its position as a ritual center but which are rarely brought out. Wampum occasionally  figures in the ritual, such as the string of wampum used in the rite of confession. But the significance of wampum generally is that because it is a valuable object, it is used to indicate the significance of the event, either by giving it as a commemoration of the event or as being shown in remembrance of the event. Wampum belts, for example, were given at treaties to indicate good faith in the making of the treaty, and might be brought out to remind others of the treaty. In and of itself, wampum is not sacred.' <sup id="cite_ref-608" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-608">[608]</a></sup> The central League Council dealt with commonn affairs, with tribal chiefs and councils (as well as the female elders of their respective lineages and more recently created non-hereditary positions) occupying an intermediary position: 'The Iroquois confederacy operated under a council of 50 sachems representing the five original tribes. When the Tuscarora joined the League in 1722, no new sachem positions were created for it. The council was a legislative, executive and judicial body that deliberated only on the external affairs of the confederacy, such as peace and war, and on matters common to the five constituent tribes. The council had no voice in the internal affairs of the separate tribes. Tribal representation on the council was unequally distributed among the 5 tribes although abuse of power was limited by the requirement of unanimity in all council decisions. Below the level of the League council were separate tribal councils concerned with the internal affairs of each tribe and each tribe's relations with external groups. The tribal council was composed of the sachems who represented the tribe on the League council. Sachem positions were hereditary within each tribe and belonged to particular matrisibs. The women of the matrisib nominated each new sachem, who was always a male, and had the power to recall or "dehorn" a chief who failed to represent the interests of his people. Theoretically, each sachem was equal to the others in power, but in practice those with better oratorial skills wielded greater influence. After the confederacy had been functioning for a period of time a new, nonhereditary office of Pine Tree Chief was created to provide local leadership and to act as advisors to the council sachems, although later they actually sat on the League council and equaled the sachems in power. Pine Tree Chiefs held their position for life and were chosen by the women of a matrisib on the basis of skill in warfare. Iroquois involvement in the fur trade and war with the French increased the importance and solidarity of the League council and thereby strengthened the confederacy. The strength of the confederacy continued to grow until the time of the American Revolution when Iroquois interests divided between alliances to the British and the American colonists.' <sup id="cite_ref-609" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-609">[609]</a></sup> 'A Chief was appointed by the oldest woman of the maternal family in which the title descended. Her descendants and those who were related clanwise were his constituents. The matron and the chief tended to reside in the same settlement, for when the Chief removed, the clan had no one to regard with confidence unless he returned for village councils. If the matron removed, local succession was in jeopardy.  The results of deliberations by the clan were taken from village councils to the council of the tribe. The ranking clan chiefs residing at a place were the cochiefs of that settlement. All eight of the Seneca chiefs are now concentrated at Tonawanda, but formerly the Seneca had at least four villages, and all the rest save the Oneida had each two or three principal towns with satellite settlements. The tribe thus spoke a common language, it comprised two or more settlements, it was governed by a common council of village chiefs who also represented constituent clans, and they governed a common territory adjacent to the towns. In time all clans were present in all villages, probably about in the same proportions as they are now. As any clan predominated in a settlement, members had to seek mates in the next village, or divide their own house in twain, thus distributing the clans again.' <sup id="cite_ref-610" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-610">[610]</a></sup> Tribes were composed of matrilineages: 'Matrilineages were organized into 15 matrisibs. Among the Cayuga, Onondaga, Seneca and Tuscarora the matrisibs were further organized into moieties. Among the Mohawk and the Oneida no moiety division was recognized. Descent was matrilineal.' <sup id="cite_ref-611" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-611">[611]</a></sup> The League Council initially met at Onondaga, but the council fire was extinguished and rekindled in various places during the tribulations of the colonial period: 'The council continued to be composed of hereditary chiefs, who together with the “war chiefs” from 1812 andthe Pine Tree chiefs numbered over 50. The Crown madeno attempt to interfere with the appointment or dismissalof chiefs (Weaver 1975). The chiefs met in the Onondagacouncil house, a log structure near Middleport, two orthree times a year to deliberate in traditional fashionmatters of community interest (Weaver 1963-1974). The Onondagas, known collectively as the firekeepers, actedas mediators in the proceedings according to traditionalcustom. However, the tribal seating plan differed fromthe traditional one in that the Mohawks and Senecasoccupied the positions east of the council fire, while theOneidas and Cayugas sat on the west, together with thedependent nations: Tuscaroras, Nanticokes, Delawares,and Tutelos. Although the dependent nations were tospeak through “their voice,” the Cayugas, in fact theyoften directly addressed the assembly of chiefs, andoperated quite independently, though not equaling theoriginal five nations in power or status.' <sup id="cite_ref-612" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-612">[612]</a></sup>  'Despite the efforts of the Onondagas at Onondaga tohave them returned to Onondaga, the council fire of theConfederacy and its wampum records remained at BuffaloCreek until after that reservation had been sold andCaptain Cold (“The League of the Iroquois: Its History,Politics, and Ritual,” fig. 11, this vol.), keeper of thecouncil fire and the wampum, had died. In 1847 bothwere moved back to Onondaga (Clark 1849, 1:109, 124).However, a number of Onondagas (approximately 150)continued to live on the Seneca and Tuscarora Reservationsin western New York State, the largest number onthe Allegany Reservation (New York (State) Secretary ofState 1857:507; Fletcher 1888:551; New York (State)Legislature.

<p><b>♠ Multiple legal systems ♣ absent ♥</b> Note: According to L.H. Morgan, there was no formal penal code. Chiefs and councils doubled as judicial authorities: 'Crimes and offences were so unfrequent under their social system, that the Iroquois can scarcely be said to have had a criminal code. Yet there were certain misdemeanors which fell under the judicial cognizance of the sachems, and were punished by them in proportion to their magnitude. Witchcraft was punishable with death. Any person could take the life of a witch when discovered in the act. If this was not done, a council was called, and the witch arraigned before it, in the presence of the accuser. A full confession, with a promise of amendment, secured a discharge. But if the accusation was denied, witnesses were called and examined concerning the circumstances of the case; and if they established the charge to the satisfaction of the council, which they rarely failed to do, condemnation followed, with a sentence of death. The witch was then delivered over to such executioners as volunteered for the purpose, and by them was led away to punishment. After the decision of the council, the relatives of the witch gave him up to his doom without a murmur.' <sup id="cite_ref-614" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-614">[614]</a></sup> But according to Lyford, there was an orally transmitted constitution validated by wampum beads: 'The League of the Iroquois was governed by a carefully worked out constitution that was transmitted orally from one generation to another by certain leaders (lords or sachems) whose business it was to learn and to recite the laws and regulations. For many generations these laws and regulations were recorded in a collection of wampum belts and strings, twenty-five of which are preserved today in the New York State Museum, whose director has been proclaimed “the keeper of the wampums.”' <sup id="cite_ref-615" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-615">[615]</a></sup> Council houses combined judicial, executive, and legislative with ceremonial functions, but were also residential: 'In 1818, Timothy Alden (1827:54-55) described a similar council house at Tonawanda. It was fifty feet long and twenty wide. On each side of it, longitudinally is a platform, a little more than one foot high and four feet wide, covered with furs, which furnishes a convenient place for sitting, lounging, and sleeping. A rail across the centre separates the males from the females, who are constant attendants and listen, with silence, diligence, and interest, to whatever is delivered in council. Over the platform is a kind of galley, five or six feet from the floor, which is loaded with peltry, corn, implements of hunting, and a variety of other articles. At each end of the building is a door, and near each door, within, was the council fire. . . . Over each fire several large kettles of soup were hanging and boiling. The smoke was conveyed away through apertures in the roof and did not annoy. The chiefs and others, as many as could be accommodated, in their appropriate grotesque habiliments, were seated on the platform, smoking calumets, of various forms, sizes, and materials, several of which were tendered to me in token of friendship. Profound silence pervaded the crowded assembly.' <sup id="cite_ref-616" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-616">[616]</a></sup> Accordingly, some of the below variables may not be applicable to the Iroquois.

<p><b>♠ Private property (land) ♣ absent ♥</b> Iroquois society was organized in matrilineages: 'Matrilineages were organized into 15 matrisibs. Among the Cayuga, Onondaga, Seneca and Tuscarora the matrisibs were further organized into moieties. Among the Mohawk and the Oneida no moiety division was recognized. Descent was matrilineal. In modern times, the stress placed on patrilineal inheritance by Canadian authorities has undermined the traditional matrilineal system.' <sup id="cite_ref-621" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-621">[621]</a></sup> 'Traditional kinship terminology followed the Iroquoian pattern. In one's own and the first ascending and descending generations parallel relatives were classed with one's lineal relatives and cross relatives were referred to separately.' <sup id="cite_ref-622" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-622">[622]</a></sup> Property was held and transmitted by the matrilineage: 'Matrilineages were the property holding unit in traditional Iroquoian society.' <sup id="cite_ref-623" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-623">[623]</a></sup> 'In modern society every foot of ground and every chattel belongs to a person, natural or corporate, or to the state. In an Iroquois tribe there were owners of third class, the houses and clans.' <sup id="cite_ref-624" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-624">[624]</a></sup> 'Traditionally, property was inherited matrilineally. In the 1980s matrilineal inheritance continued to be practiced among Iroquois on reservations in the United States, but not so for those in Canada, where the government has enforced a patrilineal system of inheritance.' <sup id="cite_ref-625" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-625">[625]</a></sup> The same was true of titles: 'As the whole Iroquois system rested upon the tribes as an organic division of the people, it was very natural that the separate rights of each should be jealously guarded. Not the least remarkable among their institutions, was that which confined the transmission of all titles, rights and property in the [Page [facing p. 79]] [Page 80] female line to the exclusion of the male. It is strangely unlike the canons of descent adopted by civilized nations, but it secured several important objects. If the Deer tribe of the Cayugas, for example, received a sachemship at the original distribution of these offices, the descent of such title being limited to the female line, it could never pass out of the tribe. It thus became instrumental in giving to the tribe individuality. A still more marked result, and perhaps a leading object of this enactment was the perpetual disinheritance of the son. (57) Being of the tribe of his mother formed an impassable barrier against him; and he could neither succeed his father as a sachem, nor inherit from him even his medal, or his tomahawk. (103) The inheritance, for the protection of tribal rights, was thus directed from the lineal descendants of the sachem, to his brothers, or his sisters' children, or, under certain circumstances, to some individual of the tribe at large; each and all of whom were in his tribe, while his children, being in another tribe, as before remarked, were placed out of the line of succession.' <sup id="cite_ref-626" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-626">[626]</a></sup> 'Nations' owned priviledged access to natural resources in their territory: 'Seasonal return to hunting and fishing economy meant that Iroquois villages were abandoned periodically. From the harvest to midwinter, families went to the woods to hunt for meat, seeking hunting partners in settlements adjacent to hunting grounds. Villages were again evacuated in early spring: (1) a short removal to the nearby sugar bush for several weeks, (2) for a longer period in March and April to attend pigeon nestings, and (3) to nearby fishing sites. In all these activities a semblance of local organization was maintained. Village and tribal holdings in sugar bush, pigeon nesting sites, and fishing places formed a continuous territory with the farm and ordinary hunting lands of the village. Major pigeon nestings and longterm fall hunts were carried on at some remove from the village settlements and required the movement of persons from say Buffalo some 70 or 80 miles to south of Warren, Pa. (Fenton and Deardorff, 1943, p. 296 and map). Villages tended to move within rather narrow orbits, quite definitely within the above territory, moving to perhaps a day's walk from the old settlement, frequently the “old town” giving way to the “new town” as a gradual development of one out of the other. At earlier times the movements were more abrupt (Fenton, 1940). Use of hunting territory, fishing sites, berrying grounds, and medicinal plant stations were deemed local privileges belonging to the inhabitants of that place. Ultimately, such ownership rested in the tribe or “nation.” To this day the title of lands rests in the nation; nothing like the Algonquian type of individual hunting territories was known. A Cayuga hunter, however, was careful to leave the pelt in the Seneca nation's territory, vouchsafing a privilege which was not extended to alien tribes outside the League. Similarly the use of fields and cemeteries will redound to local inhabitants. To the extent that coresidents are related unilaterally, [Page 43] clan fields will adjoin; cemeteries will contain the bones of predominately one clan.' <sup id="cite_ref-627" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-627">[627]</a></sup> Land was thus generally held in common, but individuals retained usufruct rights in lands which they themselves had opened for cultivation: 'Property, both in amount and variety, was exceedingly limited; as would naturally be expected among a people living a hunter and semi-agricultural life, and making a mere subsistence the limit of their wants and of their ambition. But inconsiderable as it was in the aggregate, it was held, and subject to distribution, under fixed laws. Having neither currency nor trade, nor the love of gain, their property consisted merely of planting lots, orchards, houses, implements of the chase, weapons, articles of apparel, domestic utensils, personal ornaments, stores of grain, skins of animals, and those miscellaneous fabrics which the necessities of life led them to invent. The rights of property, of both husband and wife, were continued distinct during the existence of the marriage relation; the wife holding, and controlling her own, the same as her husband, and in case of separation, taking it with her. No individual could obtain the absolute title to land, as that was vested by the laws of the Iroquois in all the people; but he could reduce unoccupied lands to cultivation, to any extent he pleased; and so long as he continued to use them, his right to their enjoyment was protected and secured. He could also sell his improvements, or bequeath them to his wife or children. If the wife, either before or after marriage, inherited orchards, or planting lots, or reduced land to cultivation, she could dispose of them at her pleasure, and in case of her death they were inherited, together with her other effects, by her children. The rule of descent, on the death of the father, was different. His children, not being [Page 318] of his tribe, were out of the line of inheritance; for by their laws, property could not, by descent, pass out of the tribe. If he gave his planting lots, or any articles of property to his wife or children, in the presence of a witness, they were allowed to hold them. But if he made no disposition of his effects, they were handed over upon his decease, to the near relatives in his own tribe, who usually assigned to the family the house, and such other articles as they deemed advisable, and distributed the residue among themselves, as personal mementos of the deceased.' <sup id="cite_ref-628" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-628">[628]</a></sup> Individually held private property was limited to movables: 'The individual owned, to use a convenient measure, only that he could carry with him; his clothing and ornaments, the mat on which he slept, his weapons, his pipe, and his kettle. These and no more he could take with him when he emigrated, and they were buried with him when he died. As a member of the house, clan, or tribe, he had a special property in other chattels and in land so long as he was in possession and use thereof as a member of the community. But when his relation ended his rights ended also.' <sup id="cite_ref-629" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-629">[629]</a></sup> However, some differentiation of wealth was present: 'The distinction of rich and poor was known among the Iroquois, as applying both to the individual and to the house. [Page 274] Even in the same clan one house might be wealthy and the other poor. Property rnight be transferred by gift or purchase, by gambling, as a hire of labor, but rather as a fee than a wage, or in payment of damages for a tort.' <sup id="cite_ref-630" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-630">[630]</a></sup> Morgan speaks of cycles of wealth and poverty: 'The common right in food and other chattels tended naturally to waste and poverty, for no one had the right to reserve that which another might wish to use. This, rather than improvidence properly so called, was the reason why in the Indian household it was commonly either a feast or a famine.' <sup id="cite_ref-631" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-631">[631]</a></sup> Morgan provides a general summary of the property system: 'The tribe had its property also, -- its lands, tenements, and hereditaments. These included (1) the territories which it occupied, the boundaries being, as elsewhere mentioned, as definite as those of a modern state; and by ownership of the and is meant not merely sovereignty, but that the tribe was he actual and sole owner of the fee of the soil. An individual, a house, or a clan could acquire no right to land beyond the term of actual occupation. (2) Rights of toll from ersons passing through the public domain. (3) Rights of hunting, fishing, and trading in any new countries discovered by a citizen. (4) The tribe had also a public treasury, conaining not only archives, records, and maps, but also personal [Page 273] property of all kinds, even including slaves, and usually it owned a council house.' <sup id="cite_ref-632" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-632">[632]</a></sup> 'Expenses of war (but a comparatively small portion of these), of public gifts, and of the entertainment of ambassadors were among the charges which fell upon the public treasury.' <sup id="cite_ref-633" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-633">[633]</a></sup> 'Everything else belonged to the clan or to the house, between which, as often, it is not easy to discriminate in all details. The house owned the communal dwelling, the chattels of general use that it contained, and all that might be brought into it as trophies of war or the chase or the product of agriculture. In brief, the product of the labor of a member of the house belonged to the house; and as a curious illustration of this a newly discovered cure for disease was the property of the house.' <sup id="cite_ref-634" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-634">[634]</a></sup> 'The clan owned the lives of its members; these lives it might itself take, or if any one else took them the right to compensation belonged to the clan. As a member of the clan or household an individual had the right to a place in the dwelling, to a share in its food supply, and to the exclusive possession of a field. When he died or emigrated the clan was his heir, or, more accurately, his administrator.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Usufruct ♣ present ♥</b> 'Nations' owned priviledged access to natural resources in their territory: 'Seasonal return to hunting and fishing economy meant that Iroquois villages were abandoned periodically. From the harvest to midwinter, families went to the woods to hunt for meat, seeking hunting partners in settlements adjacent to hunting grounds. Villages were again evacuated in early spring: (1) a short removal to the nearby sugar bush for several weeks, (2) for a longer period in March and April to attend pigeon nestings, and (3) to nearby fishing sites. In all these activities a semblance of local organization was maintained. Village and tribal holdings in sugar bush, pigeon nesting sites, and fishing places formed a continuous territory with the farm and ordinary hunting lands of the village. Major pigeon nestings and longterm fall hunts were carried on at some remove from the village settlements and required the movement of persons from say Buffalo some 70 or 80 miles to south of Warren, Pa. (Fenton and Deardorff, 1943, p. 296 and map). Villages tended to move within rather narrow orbits, quite definitely within the above territory, moving to perhaps a day's walk from the old settlement, frequently the “old town” giving way to the “new town” as a gradual development of one out of the other. At earlier times the movements were more abrupt (Fenton, 1940). Use of hunting territory, fishing sites, berrying grounds, and medicinal plant stations were deemed local privileges belonging to the inhabitants of that place. Ultimately, such ownership rested in the tribe or “nation.” To this day the title of lands rests in the nation; nothing like the Algonquian type of individual hunting territories was known. A Cayuga hunter, however, was careful to leave the pelt in the Seneca nation's territory, vouchsafing a privilege which was not extended to alien tribes outside the League. Similarly the use of fields and cemeteries will redound to local inhabitants. To the extent that coresidents are related unilaterally, [Page 43] clan fields will adjoin; cemeteries will contain the bones of predominately one clan.' <sup id="cite_ref-638" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-638">[638]</a></sup> Land was thus generally held in common, but individuals retained usufruct rights in lands which they themselves had opened for cultivation: 'Property, both in amount and variety, was exceedingly limited; as would naturally be expected among a people living a hunter and semi-agricultural life, and making a mere subsistence the limit of their wants and of their ambition. But inconsiderable as it was in the aggregate, it was held, and subject to distribution, under fixed laws. Having neither currency nor trade, nor the love of gain, their property consisted merely of planting lots, orchards, houses, implements of the chase, weapons, articles of apparel, domestic utensils, personal ornaments, stores of grain, skins of animals, and those miscellaneous fabrics which the necessities of life led them to invent. The rights of property, of both husband and wife, were continued distinct during the existence of the marriage relation; the wife holding, and controlling her own, the same as her husband, and in case of separation, taking it with her. No individual could obtain the absolute title to land, as that was vested by the laws of the Iroquois in all the people; but he could reduce unoccupied lands to cultivation, to any extent he pleased; and so long as he continued to use them, his right to their enjoyment was protected and secured. He could also sell his improvements, or bequeath them to his wife or children. If the wife, either before or after marriage, inherited orchards, or planting lots, or reduced land to cultivation, she could dispose of them at her pleasure, and in case of her death they were inherited, together with her other effects, by her children. The rule of descent, on the death of the father, was different. His children, not being [Page 318] of his tribe, were out of the line of inheritance; for by their laws, property could not, by descent, pass out of the tribe. If he gave his planting lots, or any articles of property to his wife or children, in the presence of a witness, they were allowed to hold them. But if he made no disposition of his effects, they were handed over upon his decease, to the near relatives in his own tribe, who usually assigned to the family the house, and such other articles as they deemed advisable, and distributed the residue among themselves, as personal mementos of the deceased.' <sup id="cite_ref-639" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-639">[639]</a></sup></dd>

If the Deer tribe of the Cayugas, for example, received a sachemship at the original distribution of these offices, the descent of such title being limited to the female line, it could never pass out of the tribe. It thus became instrumental in giving to the tribe individuality. A still more marked result, and perhaps a leading object of this enactment was the perpetual disinheritance of the son.

<p><b>♠ Other property ownership ♣ present ♥</b> Many goods were produced in the community: 'The Iroquois knew how to bend and shape wood when green or after steaming. House frames, pack frames, snowshoes, toboggans, basket rims, lacrosse sticks and other wood products were made using these techniques. Rope was made from the inner bark of hickory, basswood and slippery elm and burden straps and prisoner ties were made from the braided fibers of nettle, milkweed and hemp. Pipes of fired clay were among the many types of items manufactured by the Iroquois. The Iroquois are known for making ash and maple splint baskets, although this craft may be of European origin.' <sup id="cite_ref-647" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-647">[647]</a></sup> But trade was important: 'Long before European contact the Iroquois were involved in an intricate trade network with other native groups (see cultural relations above). Clay pipes were an important trade item that reached other native groups all along the east coast of North America. The aggressive behavior the Iroquois exhibited towards their neighbors during the fur trade period has been interpreted by some as the result of their aim to protect and expand their middleman role. Others have suggested that the aggressive behavior of the Iroquois tribes was related to the scarcity of furs in their own territory and the resulting difficulty in obtaining European trade goods. According to this theory, the Iroquois warred primarily to obtain the trade goods of their neighbors in closer contact with Europeans. After the center of fur trading activities had moved farther west, the Iroquois continued to play an important role as voyageurs and trappers.' <sup id="cite_ref-648" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-648">[648]</a></sup> Individually held private property was limited to movables: 'The individual owned, to use a convenient measure, only that he could carry with him; his clothing and ornaments, the mat on which he slept, his weapons, his pipe, and his kettle.

<dd><b>♠ patrilineal inheritance ♣ absent ♥</b> Patrilineal inheritance of private property within nuclear families only became common in the reservation period: 'With the increase of trade and other changed conditions of life which ensued upon the coming of the whites, the desire for private property and the extent of it increased, as came to pass at an earlier date among our own ancestors.' <sup id="cite_ref-650" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-650">[650]</a></sup> 'Contemporary Iroquois society has been characterized by single residences of nuclear families. On marriage the young couple moves in with whichever set of parents has room and seeks a separate, or neolocal residence as soon as they are able to build a house on adjacent land. Data from Allegany and Tonawanda, checked by field work at Six Nations, show a tendency for nuclear families to aggregate into clusters of two or three related families. Sons or daughters occupy adjacent land. Within the community there is no consistent pattern of either matrilocal or patrilocal residence. If anything, the latter prevails in the accounts of marriages participated in by older informants whose mothers made the matches. The reason, I believe, lies in the newly adopted pattern of rural residence. Farms at first were transmitted matrilineally, but as holdings increased and White business methods were adopted, inheritance, like English names, went from father to sons. Although New York Agency has never disturbed enrollment of band or tribal members through the mothers, according to Iroquois custom law, in Canada the dominant culture has enforced double descent by requiring that band members be enrolled with the fathers, with the result that “citizenship” in the Six Nations, inheritance, and residence after marriage have been displaced to the male line. Internally, the Grand River Iroquois cling to descent and succession through the mothers.

A lineage was compesed of the male and female descendants of a woman, the descendants of her fomale descendants and so on (Goldenweiser, 1913:467). Lineage offices such as chiefa, deputy chiefs, runners and keepers of secret medicine were invested natrilineally, as were the six ceremonial clan officers. Individuals could not marry within one's own lineage or one's father's matrilineage. This exegamous principle was extended to one's own tribe's clan members who were fictive brothers and sistors.' <sup id="cite_ref-666" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-666">[666]</a></sup> Matrilineal family groups formed the basic social unit: 'The basic economic unit consisted of matrilineally extended family groups of women, their spouses, and their children. Each extended family group occupied a longhouse within which individual nuclear families occupied designated sections and shared common hearths. Each longhouse was under the control and direction of the elder women in the extended family group.' <sup id="cite_ref-667" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-667">[667]</a></sup> Polygyny had been practiced in the past according to some sources, but was abandoned in the 18th century: 'At one time marriages were a matter of individual choice, however, in the historic period the matrilineage and particularly the mother played an increasingly important role in the arrangement of marriages. Post-marital residence was matrilocal. Polygyny was practiced, but by the late eighteenth century had entirely disappeared. Divorce was possible and when it occurred the mother retained full control over her children.' <sup id="cite_ref-668" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-668">[668]</a></sup> 'I do not now remember any instance of polygamy among the Iroquois, though it was common among other races. Marriages could be dissolved at pleasure as they yet are, but in early days this seems to have been rarely done. Informal as Indian marriages usually were, there were some points more definitely observed by the Iroquois. Among the Mohawks Gakwarinna was the portion of the woman who gets married; Gakwarinnionton the ceremony of carrying her into the cabin at this time. For the time being, at least, she then had reserved rights. The union was arranged by mutual friends, and wife and husband lodged together at his home. During the day they were with their respective relatives, the husband not daring to enter his wife's cabin until she had children. At Onondaga, in 1657, it was observed that for the time being “the only community of goods there is between the one and the other is that the husband gives all the fruits of the chase to his wife, who renders him some services in recompense, and is obliged to cultivate his fields and make his harvest.”' <sup id="cite_ref-669" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-669">[669]</a></sup> Morgan claims that polygamy was forbidden, but divorce was possible, at least in principle:  'In intimate connection with the subject of marriage, is that of divorce. Polygamy was forbidden among the Iroquois, and never became a practice; (99) but the right to put away the wife, or of voluntary separation, was allowed to all. (100) The mothers of the married pair were responsible for their concord and harmony. If differences arose between them, it became their duty to effect a reconciliation, and by advice and counsel, to guard against a repetition of the difficulty. But if disturbances continued to follow reconciliations, and their dispositions were found to be too incongruous for domestic peace, a separation followed, either by mutual consent or the absolute refusal of one of the parties longer to recognize the marriage relation. As such a rupture in ancient times was regarded as discreditable to the parties, and brought them under [Page 316] the pressure of public censure, they were then unfrequent. In later days, however, the inviolability of the nuptial contract was less sacredly regarded, and the most frivolous reasons, or the caprice of the moment, were sufficient for breaking the marriage tie.' <sup id="cite_ref-670" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-670">[670]</a></sup> Clans were exogamous, and marriages also served to establish political alliances: 'Marriage was arranged by parents who gave seriousconsideration to the rules of clan exogamy as well as tothe social prestige and economic conditions of the families [Page [p.486]] oncerned. Married couples were expected to staytogether for life; divorce and infidelity, being seriousoffenses against the church, led to expulsion and socialostracism.' <sup id="cite_ref-671" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-671">[671]</a></sup> 'Men and women of the same clan might not marry, all these being esteemed near relations. For a long time clan burial prevailed, so that husband and wife were not interred together but in the grounds of their respective clans. The children were of the mother's clan and nation. Thus the noted Logan was a Cayuga because his mother was one, though his father was a distinguished Oneida chief. This feature of Iroquois life is a great bar to the division of their lands in severalty. Marriage into another clan or nation might bring personal advantages to a man if he desired them. Two of the leading framers of the Iroquois League were reputed Onondagas by birth, but Dekanawidah or his father and Hiawatha married Mohawk wives and became chiefs of that nation. In 1637 a young Seneca was displeased because his people had made peace with the Hurons. He“married among the Onondagas, in order always to have liberty to bear arms against them.”' <sup id="cite_ref-672" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-672">[672]</a></sup> 'The husband and wife were never of the same tribe, as has been elsewhere more fully explained; and the children were of the tribe of their mother. No right in the father to the custody of their persons, or to their nurture, was recognized. As, after separation, he gave himself no farther trouble concerning them, nor interested himself in their future welfare, they became estranged as well as separated. Parental affection was much weaker, as is usually the fact, on the part of the father than on that of the mother. The Indian father seldom caressed his children, or by any outward acts manifested the least solicitude for their welfare; but when his sons grew up to maturity, he became more attached to them, making them his companions in the hunt and upon the war-path. The care of their infancy and childhood was intrusted to the watchful affection of the mother alone.' <sup id="cite_ref-673" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-673">[673]</a></sup> 'Men might change their nationality in order to build up a nation or clan. This is sometimes done now by both men and women. In the Relation for 1645 it appears that nearly all the Oneida men were [Page 85] at one time slain by the Hurons. The Oneidas had made peace with the Mohawks, and sent to them “for some men to be married to the girls and women who had remained without husbands, that the nation should not perish. This is why the Iroquois name that village their child.”' <sup id="cite_ref-674" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-674">[674]</a></sup> Marriage ceremonies integrated the respective matrilineages: 'The Iroquois marriage ceremony was an alliance that entailed two elemontary economic relations. At the level of village integration, the ceremony established an association relationship in which the village corporate unit, the women's mutual aid society, cooperated with the individual lineages in an economic endeaver of procuring wood for the husband's lineage, in return for a feast given by the wife's lineage tormed the marriage wood ceremony (Lafitau, 1724, 1:576-577). The ceremony was significant because the women's mutual aid society, the main agricultural cooporative group, cooperated to advance the individual matrilineage's goals of establishing an alliance.' <sup id="cite_ref-675" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-675">[675]</a></sup> 'The second economic relationship entailed in a marriage ceromony [Page 13] was an exchange of goods and services between matrilineages. In return for the daughter-in-law's agricultural and wood gathering services, the husband contributed to his wife's lineage his entire first year's hunt, and in subsequent years, a fair share of his hunt (Lafitau, 1724, 2). Thus, the marriage ceremony established symbelic relations between groups that did the labor and these who controlled the natural resources to increase production.' <sup id="cite_ref-676" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-676">[676]</a></sup> 'Another significant integration was feasting. Lafitau (1724, 2) maintained that the village must threw a feast to entice warriers to clear the fields, and that individuals threw feasts to increase prestige. Feasts occured after calondar rituals, burials, and ceremonies honering the dead. Indeed, the support of the women's aid society was accomplished by a feast after the marriage wood ceremony. Feasting was a redistributive mechanism that cemented productive relations, as well as an integral part of the prestige and belief system, and as such will be examined in a subsequent section. In recapitulation, two complomentary principles deminated Iroquois productive organization; they were alliance and exchange. Within the village economy existed ceremonies which, at crucial times, such as the Mid-winter feast and harvest, united the labor force in accordance with sexual productive roles. At another level of organization, individual matrilineages through marriage alliances established produce and service exchanges in order to increase their productivity.' <sup id="cite_ref-677" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-677">[677]</a></sup> Morgan writes that marriages were typically arranged by the matrilineage: 'In this connection, the marriage customs of the Iroquois naturally suggest themselves. They exhibit novel, if not distinctive features. Marriage was not founded upon the affections, which constitute the only legitimate basis of this relation in civilized society, but was regulated exclusively as a matter of physical necessity. It was not even a contract between the parties to be married, but substantially between their mothers, acting oftentimes under the suggestions of the matrons and wise-men of the tribes to which the parties respectively belonged. In a general sense, therefore, the subject of marriage was under the supervision of the older members of each tribe; but practically, it was under maternal control. With the improvement and elevation of the race, changes were gradually introduced in relation to the marriageable age, and the disparity of age between the sexes. In ancient times, the young warrior was always [Page 312] united to a woman several years his senior, on the supposition that he needed a companion experienced in the affairs of life. The period was also deferred on his part until twenty-five that he might first become inured to the hardships of the war-path and of the chase, before his freedom was curtailed and his responsibilities were increased by the cares of a family, light as these cares seem to have been under their social system. Thus, it often happened that the young warrior at twenty-five was married to a woman of forty, and oftentimes a widow; while the widower at sixty was joined to the maiden at twenty. But these were their primitive customs; the ages of the parties afterwards drew nearer to an equality, and the marriageable age was, in time reduced to twenty, and even below it.' <sup id="cite_ref-678" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-678">[678]</a></sup> 'When the mother considered her son of a suitable age for marriage, she looked about her for a maiden, who, from report or acquaintance, she judged would accord with him in disposition and temperament. A negotiation between the mothers ensued, and a conclusion was speedily reached. Sometimes the near relatives and the elderly persons of the tribes to which each belonged were consulted; but their opinions were of no avail, independently of the wishes of the mothers themselves. Not the least singular feature of the transaction was the entire ignorance in which the parties remained of the pending negotiation; the first intimation they received being the announcement of their marriage, without, perhaps, ever having known or seen each other. Remonstrance or objection on their part was never attempted; they received each other as the gift of their parents. As obedience to [Page 313] them in all their requirements was inculcated as a paramount duty, and disobedience was followed by disownment, the operative force of custom, in addition to these motives, was sufficient to secure acquiescence. The Indian father never troubled himself concerning the marriage of his children. To interfere would have been an invasion of female immunities; and these, whatever they were, were as sacredly regarded by him, as he was inflexible in enforcing respect for his own.' <sup id="cite_ref-679" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-679">[679]</a></sup> 'When the fact of marriage had been communicated to the parties, a simple ceremonial completed the transaction. On the day following the announcement, the maiden was conducted by her mother, accompanied by a few female friends, to the home of her intended husband. She carried in her hand a few cakes of unleavened corn bread, which she presented on entering the house, to her mother-in-law, as an earnest of her usefulness and of her skill in the domestic arts. After receiving it, the mother of the young warrior returned a present of venison, or other fruit of the chase, to the mother of the bride, as an earnest of his ability to provide for his household. This exchange of presents ratified and concluded the contract, which bound the new pair together in the marriage relation. Thus simple was the formation of the nuptial bond among our primitive inhabitants.' <sup id="cite_ref-680" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-680">[680]</a></sup> Wives and children had obligations to their husband's/father's matrilineage: 'The Iroquois traced descent through the female line of lineage “Ohwatjira”. A man's children belonged to his wife's ledge not his own. However, the wife and her lineage had affinial obligations to her husband and his lineage. First, the son had to supply his “akateni”, i.e., [Page 18] father's maternal kinsmen's lineage, with suitable captives to replace their dead members. Second, the son had to support his akatoni in blood vendettas. Third, the matron of one's akatoni lineage could control the war activities of the “brothers sons” by either demanding that a raid take place or by prohibiting one. The akatoni lineage had reoiprecal obligations to the “Ohwatjira”, mother's kinsmen. Fourth, the akatoni had to perform the burial service and prepare the body of the “wives”, “sons” or “daughters” of other lineages at the common burial, Feast of the Dead and General Feast of the Dead. Fifth, limited rules of exogamy applied to one's closest akatoni (Lafitau, 1724, 1:559). Sixth, the husband had reciprecal duties in the alliance as he supplied his wife's lineage with produce. Lafitau (1724, 1:580) observed that during the first year of marriage all the husband's hunt went to his wife's household.' <sup id="cite_ref-681" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-681">[681]</a></sup> 'Although the main characteristics of the roles of the spouses entailed both equality and devetion, the alliance was brittle. Lafitau (1724, 1:581) maintained that diverce was frequent. A century lator, Jameson (1825) argued: Diverces are common and for trivial reasons. The husband may abandon the wife or the wife may abandon the husband at will. (Fenton, 1969:125). Despite the fact that diverce ruptured the alliance, certain akatoni [Page 21] obligations still remained such as procuring captives, exogamy and support in vendettas (Basehart, 1952:42).' <sup id="cite_ref-682" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-682">[682]</a></sup> 'A wife had many obligations to the husband's maternal household such as securing firewood and cultivating their gardon. In doing these tasks she was under her mother-in-law's authority. Iroquois residence was shifting matrilecal to patrilocal type, the spouse making periodic visits to the different households (J.R., 43:265). Consequently, when the wife was in her husband's ledge she was subservient to his mother. The husband was subservient to his mother-in-law when in her household. He was not permitted even to speak to his wife's parents until the birth of his first child. The mother-in-law regulated the husband's war efforts. She could force him into blood vendettas or stop his raiding. As stated previously, Wallace (1966) argued that mothers sometimes attempted to force divorces by turning their daughters against their husbands.' <sup id="cite_ref-683" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-683">[683]</a></sup> Taboos also applied to intermarriage between certain tribes: 'All the institutions of the Iroquois have regard to the division of the people into tribes. (54) Originally with reference to marriage, the Wolf, Bear, Beaver, and Turtle tribes, being brothers to each other, were not allowed to intermarry. The four opposite tribes, being also brothers to each other, were likewise prohibited from intermarrying. Either of the first four tribes, however, could intermarry with either of the last four, the relation between them being that of cousins. Thus Hawk could intermarry with Bear or Beaver, Heron with Turtle; but not Beaver and Turtle, nor Deer and Deer. Whoever violated these laws of marriage incurred the deepest detestation and disgrace. In process of time, however, the rigor of the system was relaxed, until finally the prohibition was confined to the tribe of the individual, which, among the residue of the Iroquois, is still religiously observed. They can now marry into any tribe but their own. Under the original as well as modern regulation, the husband and wife were of different tribes. The children always followed the tribe of the mother.' <sup id="cite_ref-684" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-684">[684]</a></sup> But according to Campisi, intraclan marriages also occurred: 'Much of the traditional Oneida kinship system remainedin operation in Canada during the nineteenthcentury. The strongest ties existed between a mother and her daughter; of next importance were those with grandparents,particularly those on the mother's side. Whileband membership was traced bilaterally to an ancestorwho had contributed to the purchase of land, membershipin clans was determined through the mother's side.Marriages were arranged by the parents, usually thefather of the bridegroom. Intraclan marriages were common,and although subject to criticism, no sanctions werebrought to bear on the couples. It was commonlybelieved that intraclan marriages resulted in weak, deformed,or mentally deficient offspring. However, thetendency for intraclan marriage was a natural outgrowthof the community attitude against marrying out and the relatively small Oneida population from which to selectmates (Ricciardelli 1966:186-189).' <sup id="cite_ref-685" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-685">[685]</a></sup> We have assumed that monogamy was the norm. We have to ascertain how common polygyny was prior to its disappearance: whether it was widespread or only limited to chiefs and other prominent figures. Morgan's comments on the matter are cryptic and influenced by Victorian theorizing, so their usefulness might be limited: 'Syndyasmian Marriage (Greek Term). This was the condition of the Iroquois and of most of the tribes of North America at the time of the discovery. It formed a transition stage between the Punaluan and Monogamian families, and to the outward observer was a pairing dissoluble at the will of either party, and even when not dissolved importing no very rigid conjugal fidelity. If Morgan's views, as to the history of marriage, are correct, this infidelity was not properly so called, but was merely a survival of the Punaluan form of marriage. In the Syndyasmian stage, then, each man had one chief wife and each woman one chief husband, but each was still espoused to the entire group. Some early observers report this state of affairs as simple licentiousness, others as polygamy or polyandry.' <sup id="cite_ref-686" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-686">[686]</a></sup> 'The reminiscence of group marriage, no doubt, had its share in the interest and control of the clan in the marriage of its members. When a girl took a husband, it was admitting a new member to the marriage group.' <sup id="cite_ref-687" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-687">[687]</a></sup> 'From Syndyasmian marriage the road branches, the settled agricultural peoples moving usually towards monogamy, the wandering tribes towards the patriarchal state and its concomitant polygamy. Marriage, to the modern mind, connotes one of these forms. It was once commonly supposed that polygamy was the earlier form, but the researches of Morgan and others would mark it as simply a late offshoot from the main stem which ends in Monogamy.' <sup id="cite_ref-688" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-688">[688]</a></sup></dd>

Among the Cayuga, Onondaga, Seneca and Tuscarora the matrisibs were further organized into moieties. Among the Mohawk and the Oneida no moiety division was recognized. Descent was matrilineal. In modern times, the stress placed on patrilineal inheritance by Canadian authorities has undermined the traditional matrilineal system.' <sup id="cite_ref-689" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-689">[689]</a></sup> 'Traditional kinship terminology followed the Iroquoian pattern.

In the 1980s matrilineal inheritance continued to be practiced among Iroquois on reservations in the United States, but not so for those in Canada, where the government has enforced a patrilineal system of inheritance.' <sup id="cite_ref-692" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-692">[692]</a></sup> Matrilineal/matrilocal family groups formed the basic socio-economic units of Iroquois society: 'The basic economic unit consisted of matrilineally extended family groups of women, their spouses, and their children. Each extended family group occupied a longhouse within which individual nuclear families occupied designated sections and shared common hearths. Each longhouse was under the control and direction of the elder women in the extended family group.' <sup id="cite_ref-693" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-693">[693]</a></sup> 'Charlevoix said, “Among the Iroquois the woman never leaves her cabin, she being deemed the mistress, or at least the heiress of it; in other nations she goes at the expiration of a year or two after her marriage to live with her mother-in-law.” This must be understood with some reservation, but in all marriages the woman was the principal person concerned, the one after whom the cabin was usually named.' <sup id="cite_ref-694" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-694">[694]</a></sup> 'In the old days the extended household, matrilocal among the Mohawks, gave the woman the utmost in security. There were no discontinuities in her upbringing. Desired as the one to carry on the clan and its prerogatives, and through her children, to keep up the strength of numbers of the clan; the girl was as fondly and permissively treated as the boy. Children were not punished; they participated in activities as soon as they were able, were not disciplined in any harsh physical fashion, nor weaned too young. Surrogate mothers were always available, and in the extended household there was no chance for isolation or neglect of the child. In the matrilocal household the relatives first to have contact with the girl would always be in closest relationship to her; she would not have to learn other clan affiliations or restrictions, nor other relationship terms. As she grew older, she would assist her mother in household tasks and in the care of younger siblings; work in the fields with the cooperative women's group; and learn the feminine crafts and techniques from her mother and maternal relatives. Sometime after adolescence her marriage would be arranged by her mother and the mother of a suitable man. Marriage would not change her residence, her name, or her place in the clan. The older women, especially the mothers of the spouses, were the ones responsible for the success of the marriage and would do their best to keep it going. But if their efforts failed, a broken marriage worked little hardship on the wife or young child. Another spouse might be brought into the maternal group, and the child's support was the concern of the maternal line, and his name and inheritance came from his mother's brother.' <sup id="cite_ref-695" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-695">[695]</a></sup> Labour was divided along gender lines: 'Traditionally, men hunted and fished, built houses, cleared fields for planting, and were responsible for trade and warfare. In addition, men had the more visible roles in tribal and confederacy politics. Farming was the responsibility of women, whose work also included gathering wild foods, rearing children, preparing food, and making clothing and baskets and other utensils.' <sup id="cite_ref-696" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-696">[696]</a></sup> 'Iroquois society distinguished between male and female productive roles. The women's role was agricultural. The mythology has the female as mother earth. Agricultural produce was depicted as the Three Sisters, the beans, squash and corn (Fenton,1962). The male role centered around hunting and warfare. The Sapling mythology depicts the male hare as a [Page 14] combatant and expert huntor (Hewitt, 1928).' <sup id="cite_ref-697" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-697">[697]</a></sup> 'Males keenly felt that the agricultural and hunting roles should reflect a sexual division, Jacob Jameson reported:Formerly it was considered disgraceful among the six nations for the man to labor...women were in the habit of doing all the necessary labor, viz. furnishing wood, dressing moat, moving equipage and camps. (Jameson, 1821-1825, as quoted in Fonten, 1969:126) Stone (1838, 1:23) stated that Joseph Brant quit bearding school because of the taunts he received from his Iroquois peers for doing women's work, i.e., field labor. Lafitau's description of the degree of distinctness in the roles of males and females illustrated the attitude men had towards women's tasks: In general, men would feel demeaned if they touched this task (i.e., harvesting and cultivating) demeaning themselves if they even barely touched this task or anything else that is set aside as women's work. (1724, 2:79)' <sup id="cite_ref-698" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-698">[698]</a></sup> Women could play important ceremonial roles and female productive activities were celebrated in the festival cycle: 'Religion was a shared activity, though I have called it male-oriented, for the men took the more active part in rituals, prayers, dancing, and singing, and figure as principals in most of the myths. However, there were as many women Keepers of the Faith as men, and these officials, appointed for life, had not only the care and preparation of the feast as their duties, but other responsibilities as well--conferring on the times of festivals, presenting the corn for examination for setting the date of the Green Corn ceremonial, etc. The women were more retiring than the men in making public confessions and it was only a rarely aggressive woman who participated in the dream interpretations. There were women's dances and women joined in the singing, but they requested men singers and drummers to lead the singing for them.' <sup id="cite_ref-699" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-699">[699]</a></sup> 'Women's activities, rather than men's, are celebrated in the ceremonial cycle. There are no festivals to celebrate hunting or war, though they probably existed in the past. All the ceremonies, with the exception of the Midwinter Ceremonial, are thanksgiving for the fertility of the earth, especially for the crops which are women's chief concern. The “Three Sisters,” corn, beans, and squash, also called “Our Mothers” and “Our Supporters” are honored the most. Female virtues of food-providing and the natural fertility and bounty of nature are the qualities most respected and revered.' <sup id="cite_ref-700" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-700">[700]</a></sup> While men held formal leadership titles, women nominated candidates and 'dethroned' titleholders if necessary: 'Degrees of inequality were perpetuated through offices on the basis of sex and membership in a matrilineage. Women controlled the offices of matron and they nominated men of a select number of lineages to become a deputy chief, runner, pine tree chief, council interpreter, magistrate, gamewarden, school trustee, pathmaster or public works superintendent. Within the Longhouse sects three males and three females of each clan held the position of faithkeeper. Women held offices in the Dark Dance and the Death Feast societies and consituted the majority of the membership (Goldenwoiser, 1913:469).' <sup id="cite_ref-701" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-701">[701]</a></sup> 'Tribal representation on the council was unequally distributed among the 5 tribes although abuse of power was limited by the requirement of unanimity in all council decisions. Below the level of the League council were separate tribal councils concerned with the internal affairs of each tribe and each tribe's relations with external groups. The tribal council was composed of the sachems who represented the tribe on the League council. Sachem positions were hereditary within each tribe and belonged to particular matrisibs. The women of the matrisib nominated each new sachem, who was always a male, and had the power to recall or "dehorn" a chief who failed to represent the interests of his people. Theoretically, each sachem was equal to the others in power, but in practice those with better oratorial skills wielded greater influence. After the confederacy had been functioning for a period of time a new, nonhereditary office of Pine Tree Chief was created to provide local leadership and to act as advisors to the council sachems, although later they actually sat on the League council and equaled the sachems in power. Pine Tree Chiefs held their position for life and were chosen by the women of a matrisib on the basis of skill in warfare.' <sup id="cite_ref-702" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-702">[702]</a></sup> Women did not usually speak at council meetings, but could influence the decision-making process in other ways: 'The literature stresses the “high position of women” in respect to their participation in dominantly male-oriented cultural activities, especially politics and religion. The political points are familiar and most of them can be traced to the symbolic extension of the Longhouse as the conceptual basis of the League. The extended family structure of the Longhouse, symbolized in the League, accounts for the function of the matrons to hold the chiefs' names in their clans and their consequent right to appoint and depose chiefs. Death feasts and mourning were the responsibility of the women. Women kept the White Wampum belts which signified the chiefly names. The ability of [Page 172] the women to influence decisions of the council both directly through their speaker and indirectly through the weight of public opinion is mentioned in the literature. Since unanimity was necessary for a decision to act, any proposal unpopular with the matrons could be hindered by their disapproval. Indirectly, too, it is stated that the women could hinder or actually prevent a war party which lacked their approval by not giving the supplies of dried corn and the moccasins which the warriors required. Village head-women are mentioned in myth, and though they may not actually have ruled villages, this concept reflects the power that women were thought to possess. The importance of clan matrons in deciding the fate of captives, whether they would be adopted to replace a lost clan member, or tortured as revenge for a death within the clan, is well known.' <sup id="cite_ref-703" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-703">[703]</a></sup> 'Allusion has been made to the fact that Iroquois women, however influential politically and socially, did not speak in their councils. Early writers take notice of this, and the custom continued. In 1791 Colonel Proctor attended a Seneca feast, where he saw a wooden statue before which they danced. “Under this statue were placed two chiefs, termed the women's speakers. . . . The old and the young women danced around in a circle,” etc. The same gentleman went to a council in Buffalo that year, to “hear what would be said by the women speaker, the young prince of the Turtle tribe (Red Jacket). . . . Being arrived, the first matter unusual that presented itself were the elders of the women seated near the chiefs.” Red Jacket gave their plea for peace.' <sup id="cite_ref-704" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-704">[704]</a></sup> 'If the women could not or would not always prevent war they often caused it to stop. At a conference at Niagara in 1767, the commissary “was informed that the old women of the Sinecas had stopt their young men from going to war.” They are credited with more power of this kind than they probably had, but they always claimed a share in public affairs. At a council in Albany in 1788, Good Peter, an Oneida chief, after speaking for the men, delivered the women's message. “You have heard our voice; we now entreat [Page 87] you to open your ears and hear a speech from our sisters, the governesses.' <sup id="cite_ref-705" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-705">[705]</a></sup> Women had their own councils: 'Closely allied with the Council of Elders was the women's council who brought the matters up before the council. Lafitau maintained: The women are always the first who should deliberate according to their principles on private or community matters. They hold their councils apart, and as a result of their decisions advise the chiefs on matters on the mat. (1724, 1:477) Separate from both the women's and elder's councils was the warriors' council which sought to influence authority decisions of the council of elders because they were the soldiers or ‘police’ of the village. Their internal affairs idsally were limited to military raids, games, [Page 25] and carrying out the military policy of the council of elders or League Council. In addition to the various councils, asseciations of men and women possibly existed for curing. Lafitau noted “I have been told that they have several sorts of private associations like fraternities” (Ibdd.:476). Fenton speculated that these associations were procursers of the “medicine societies” (Lafitau, 1724, 1:476). However, these associations seem to be the actual medicine societies and as such would have been village groups that criss-cross lineage, clan and moiety statuses.' <sup id="cite_ref-706" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-706">[706]</a></sup> It appears that the 17th century saw at least one female ambassador: 'One woman of rank has been mentioned, and in the Relation for 1656 another several times appears. Teotonharason was an Onondaga woman who went with the ambassadors to Quebec, and was highly esteemed for her nobleness and wealth. She may have been the one mentioned in the Relation for 1671. “It was one of these principal persons who formerly first brought the Iroquois of Onondaga, and then the other nations, to make peace with the French. She descended to Quebec for this purpose, accompanied by some of her slaves.” The influence of the Iroquois women was of great use to the missionaries. In the Relation for 1657 we read, “The women having much authority among these people, their virtue produces as much fruit as anything else, and their example finds as many more imitators.”' <sup id="cite_ref-707" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-707">[707]</a></sup> But the sources disagree about just how powerful women were: 'Lafitau said, “There is nothing more real than this superiority of the women. It is they who constitute the tribe, keep up the genealogical tree and the order of inheritance, and perpetuate the family. They possess all real authority; own the land and the fields, and their harvests; they are the soul of all councils, the arbiters of peace and war; they have care of the public treasury; slaves are given to them; they arrange marriages; the children belong to them, and to them and their blood is confined the line of descent and the order of inheritance.” He believed that the council simply aided women in matters in which it was not becoming for them to act.'  <sup id="cite_ref-708" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-708">[708]</a></sup> 'Charlevoix expresses a much more moderate opinion. In speaking of the right of the Huron women to name counsellors, who were sometimes women, he adds, “The women have the chief authority amongst all the nations of the Huron language, if we except the Iroquois canton of Oneida, in which it is in both sexes alternately. But if this be their lawful constitution, their practice is seldom agreeable to it. In fact, the men never tell the women anything they would have to be kept secret; and rarely any affair of consequence is communicated to them, though all is done in their name, and the chiefs are no more than their lieutenants.” He mentioned an instance to show “that the real authority of the women is very small. I have been assured, however, that they always deliberate first on whatever is proposed in council, and that they afterwards give the result of this to the chiefs, who report it as a matter of form. On some occasions the women have an orator, who speaks in their name, or rather acts as their interpreter.”' <sup id="cite_ref-709" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-709">[709]</a></sup> While women were prominent and not subjected to men, the data point to gender complementarity rather than gender equality. As women could not hold chiefly titles, wer have decided to code for legal and ideological differentiation of the sexes, despite the importance of women in Iroquois society.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Social class ♣ present ♥</b> Iroquois society was organized in matrilineages rather than social classes: 'Matrilineages were organized into 15 matrisibs. Among the Cayuga, Onondaga, Seneca and Tuscarora the matrisibs were further organized into moieties. Among the Mohawk and the Oneida no moiety division was recognized. Descent was matrilineal. In modern times, the stress placed on patrilineal inheritance by Canadian authorities has undermined the traditional matrilineal system.' <sup id="cite_ref-710" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-710">[710]</a></sup> 'Traditional kinship terminology followed the Iroquoian pattern. In one's own and the first ascending and descending generations parallel relatives were classed with one's lineal relatives and cross relatives were referred to separately.' <sup id="cite_ref-711" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-711">[711]</a></sup> Matrilineages held and transmitted property in land: 'Matrilineages were the property holding unit in traditional Iroquoian society.' <sup id="cite_ref-712" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-712">[712]</a></sup> 'Traditionally, property was inherited matrilineally. In the 1980s matrilineal inheritance continued to be practiced among Iroquois on reservations in the United States, but not so for those in Canada, where the government has enforced a patrilineal system of inheritance.' <sup id="cite_ref-713" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-713">[713]</a></sup> Matrilineal/matrilocal family groups formed the basic socio-economic units: 'The basic economic unit consisted of matrilineally extended family groups of women, their spouses, and their children. Each extended family group occupied a longhouse within which individual nuclear families occupied designated sections and shared common hearths. Each longhouse was under the control and direction of the elder women in the extended family group.' <sup id="cite_ref-714" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-714">[714]</a></sup> 'The members of matrisibs cooperated in economic activities and were obligated to avenge the death or injury of any other member. Moieties had reciprocal and complementary ceremonial functions and competed against one another in games. Matrisibs cut across tribal boundaries so that members were found in each tribe and village and often within each longhouse.' <sup id="cite_ref-715" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-715">[715]</a></sup> Member nations were organized in a joint league council, with chiefly titles being transmitted within particular matrilineages: 'The Iroquois confederacy operated under a council of 50 sachems representing the five original tribes. When the Tuscarora joined the League in 1722, no new sachem positions were created for it. The council was a legislative, executive and judicial body that deliberated only on the external affairs of the confederacy, such as peace and war, and on matters common to the five constituent tribes. The council had no voice in the internal affairs of the separate tribes.' <sup id="cite_ref-716" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-716">[716]</a></sup> 'Tribal representation on the council was unequally distributed among the 5 tribes although abuse of power was limited by the requirement of unanimity in all council decisions. Below the level of the League council were separate tribal councils concerned with the internal affairs of each tribe and each tribe's relations with external groups. The tribal council was composed of the sachems who represented the tribe on the League council. Sachem positions were hereditary within each tribe and belonged to particular matrisibs. The women of the matrisib nominated each new sachem, who was always a male, and had the power to recall or "dehorn" a chief who failed to represent the interests of his people. Theoretically, each sachem was equal to the others in power, but in practice those with better oratorial skills wielded greater influence. After the confederacy had been functioning for a period of time a new, nonhereditary office of Pine Tree Chief was created to provide local leadership and to act as advisors to the council sachems, although later they actually sat on the League council and equaled the sachems in power. Pine Tree Chiefs held their position for life and were chosen by the women of a matrisib on the basis of skill in warfare.' <sup id="cite_ref-717" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-717">[717]</a></sup> The league remained a coherent body until the American Revolution: 'Iroquois involvement in the fur trade and war with the French increased the importance and solidarity of the League council and thereby strengthened the confederacy. The strength of the confederacy continued to grow until the time of the American Revolution when Iroquois interests divided between alliances to the British and the American colonists.' <sup id="cite_ref-718" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-718">[718]</a></sup> Chiefly lineages were more prominent as their matrisibs and matrons could nominate titleholders: 'Now the importance of the maternal family is political, as Goldenweiser indicated, and politics are local business. In precisely those local groups where the system of life chiefs survives (Tonawanda, Onondaga, Tuscarora, Six Nations), the distinction is made between chiefly lineages and the clan. Controversies rage as to which lineage in a clan possesses a title and whether the clan mother is the oldest woman of the chiefly lineage or the oldest woman of the clan (Tonawanda Turtles in National Gypsum Co. case). If the local titlebearing lineage lacks a likely candidate for chiefship, the matron loans her title to the matron of another lineage who installs her son, or sister's son, etc., and the second lineage after a generation or so claims the title, or swears that it belongs to the whole clan. Similarly, a title may pass from one community to another, or to another clan in the same phratry. In the two communities of the Seneca Nation--Allegany and Cattaraugus--which adopted the elective system of Councilors after Buffalo Creek, the practical distinction between maternal family and clan has blurred. The same process has been going on since 1924 at Six Nations, including the Canadian Delaware.' <sup id="cite_ref-719" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-719">[719]</a></sup> 'A Chief was appointed by the oldest woman of the maternal family in which the title descended. Her descendants and those who were related clanwise were his constituents. The matron and the chief tended to reside in the same settlement, for when the Chief removed, the clan had no one to regard with confidence unless he returned for village councils. If the matron removed, local succession was in jeopardy. [Page 51] The results of deliberations by the clan were taken from village councils to the council of the tribe. The ranking clan chiefs residing at a place were the cochiefs of that settlement. All eight of the Seneca chiefs are now concentrated at Tonawanda, but formerly the Seneca had at least four villages, and all the rest save the Oneida had each two or three principal towns with satellite settlements. The tribe thus spoke a common language, it comprised two or more settlements, it was governed by a common council of village chiefs who also represented constituent clans, and they governed a common territory adjacent to the towns. In time all clans were present in all villages, probably about in the same proportions as they are now. As any clan predominated in a settlement, members had to seek mates in the next village, or divide their own house in twain, thus distributing the clans again.' <sup id="cite_ref-720" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-720">[720]</a></sup> Beauchamp speaks of an Iroquois 'nobility', by which he might mean chiefly lineages: 'If they had no great prominence in magical arts at an early day it was not because they were undervalued. They might belong to the Iroquois Agoianders, or nobility. In 1671 a Christian Mohawk woman left her country to live in Canada. On this her family “degraded her from the nobility, in an assembly of the chiefs of the town, and took away the name and title of Oiander, that is to say, esteemed, a quality which they much esteem and which she had inherited from her ancestors, and deserved by her own good spirit, her prudence and wise conduct, and at the same time they installed another in her place. These women are much respected; they hold council, and the Ancients complete no affair of consequence without their advice.”' <sup id="cite_ref-721" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-721">[721]</a></sup> Prisoners of war were enslaved: 'To us slavery is a relic of barbarism, yet for the Onondagas it was a step forward when they perceived the wisdom of sparing captives that they might have slaves to work their fields.' <sup id="cite_ref-722" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-722">[722]</a></sup> 'As in civilized communities, there was a division of work between men and women, and the women's work was often assigned to men who had become slaves of the Iroquois. They had lost their rank as warriors, unless adopted by some family or clan.'<sup id="cite_ref-723" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-723">[723]</a></sup> Some remained servants, but others were adopted into Iroquois society and could acquire titles: 'Colden said the Iroquois had no slaves, but they not only frequently appear but are classified in the Relation for 1657. There were three kinds. The first were admitted into families, and sometimes became chiefs, though still considered slaves. The second were given to the richer Indians, and had food and shelter, but nothing more. The third were young women and girls, continually exposed to every danger. Often, however, they were saved from death to become wives. As slaves the treatment of these girls depended on the temper of their mistress, and this was often cruel. In 1656 an Erie girl displeased her Onondaga mistress, who hired a young man to kill her. The life of the slave was absolutely in the power of the owner.' <sup id="cite_ref-724" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-724">[724]</a></sup> 'Throughout the contact period until the American Revolution the Iroquois maintained their aboriginal corporate structurs. Although disease and warfare such as the Beaver Wars of 1748-1780 and the French and Indian War of 1754 had taken their toll in reducing the Iroquois, they, by adopting captives, replenished their population. Fenton noted: By the end of the seventeenth century the adopted or their offspring outnumbered the Iroquois proper. They became thoroughly acculturated and acted more like the Iroquois than the Iroquois themselves. Chieftenship titles were even conforred on adoptees. The rejuvenating power of the People of the Longhouse amazed everyone who wrote about them. (1971:143)' <sup id="cite_ref-725" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-725">[725]</a></sup> Morgan describes the process of adoption: 'THE statements in the text, while of course not made on personal observation, are, in the main, correct. The reason prisoners were not exchanged was that after they had been adopted they were Iroquois, and to surrender them would be to give up an Iroquois to a strange nation. Individuals who had not been adopted might be and often were given up, or rescued by their countrymen. An adopted prisoner was usually taken in place of some member of a household who had recently died, and might be tortured and burnt, or saved alive, at the discretion of the house which owned him. From this point of view it was better to be adopted in place of one who had died by disease or accident than in place of one killed in battle. The adopted citizens [Page p278] were for a long time subject to suspicion and in danger of their lives; any untoward event, physical disability of the captive, or the mere caprice of their owners being enough to order them out to be burnt. Most of these were treated as slaves, but their position, particularly if of Iroquoian stock, would gradually improve, and in the second generation no difference would remain between slaves and masters. An interesting and fortunate case of adoption is that of the Jesuit Milet taken prisoner by the Onondagas in 1689. He had previously been among the Oneidas as a missionary, and was given to them, they being represented in the war party. For some weeks he remained in the town, well treated but his fate undetermined. Then a council was held to decide the cases of Milet and three other Frenchmen. Two of the others were burned, but Milet was claimed by both the Bear and Tortoise clans, who finally turned him over to the Wolf clan in which he had friends. “Through the influence of the chief women,” says Milet, “they showed me the friendliness of giving me in the place of a sachem who had died long before of disease, rather than of one killed in the attack on the French.” This sachem was Hodashateh, the first Sachem of the Oneidas, and Milet, accordingly, succeeded to the Sachemship and was soon in good standing as a member of the council. (Letter of Milet, 64 F. R., 90, 100.)' <sup id="cite_ref-726" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-726">[726]</a></sup>  High-ranking individuals tended to have more servants: 'It must be remembered that all were not equally rich, nor did all women rank alike. Some were brought up delicately. In the Relation for 1670 we have an account of the recent death of a young Seneca woman of high rank who had been baptized. To the comforting words of the missionary the mother replied, “Thou wast not acquainted with her; she was mistress here, and commanded more than twenty slaves who are still with me. She knew not what it was to go to the forest to bring in wood, or to the river there to draw up water. She was not able to trouble herself with all that which concerns housekeeping. Now I doubt not but that being now the only one of our family in Paradise, she may have much trouble to accustom herself to it; for she will be obliged to do her cooking herself, to go to the wood and the water, and to prepare all with her own hands for eating and drinking.” If only one of her slaves could go to the same place it would be all right.' <sup id="cite_ref-727" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-727">[727]</a></sup> But social classes in our sense of the term were absent: 'The lack of social classes is also considered to be characteristically Indian. No individual is considered socially superior to any other. Whatever prestige is to be gained is achieved by living up to the previously mentioned behavioral ideals of generosity, patience, willingness to help, self-control, etc. Indians who try to claim rank are derisively chided or talked about.' <sup id="cite_ref-728" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-728">[728]</a></sup> But given how rights to hereditary titles were restricted to chiefly matrilineages, it seems justified to code for social differentiation of legal rights. This is open to review.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Ethnicity or race ♣ absent ♥</b> The league received tribute from subject peoples who were ideologically inferior: 'Up to 1693 the Iroquois also used wampum as money, either in strings or loose. It served as currency between the Indians and the Dutch and English colonists. Enormous quantities were used to pay the tribute demanded from the Iroquois by other Indian tribes.' <sup id="cite_ref-729" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-729">[729]</a></sup> 'Hale (1965:88-89) has summarized the principles and methods used by the Iroquois in attempting to establish universal peace. The League's primary goal was the voluntary admittance of all nations and tribes. However admirable this project was, the realities of life quickly demonstrated a great void between ideology and execution. Nevertheless, some [Page 52] Nanticokes, Tuteloes, a band of Delawares, and the Tuscarora were ultimately admitted to the League. If a nation did not ask outright to join the League, the Iroquois then sought to accomplish the same end by suggesting a treaty of alliance. Should subtle hints of this nature fail to bring the desired response the third alternative was to declare war. If the unfortunate nation capitulated early, it was at once spared and usually allowed to retain its territory and most of its property. The people were required to acknowledge the Iroquois as their superior, to pay a modest tribute in wampum and furs, and refrain from any further war activity. When all else failed, the Iroquois did not hesitate to totally annihilate whole tribes. “But,” Hale (1965:95) points out, the Iroquois never for a moment forgot the principles which lay at the foundation of their League, and which taught them to “strengthen their house” by converting enemies into friends. On the instant that resistance ceased, slaughter ceased with it. The warriors who were willing to unite their fortunes with the Confederates were at once welcomed among them. Some were adopted into the families of those who had lost children or brothers. Others had lands allotted to them, on which they were allowed to live by themselves, under their own chiefs and their native laws, until in two or three generations, by friendly intercourse, frequent intermarriages, and community of interests, they became gradually absorbed into the society about them.' <sup id="cite_ref-730" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-730">[730]</a></sup> 'If we examine the conditions under which European-Iroquois contacts took place it may be possible to suggest the factors which were responsible for the League's losing its independent status. At the outset we can dismiss the consideration that the League may have failed to comprehend fully the significance of sovereignty. As a confederate body to which member nations had delegated control of external affairs, the League was practiced in dealing with self-governing Indian groups. As conquerors of many neighboring tribes from which they collected tribute they inevitably learned the distinction between an independent and a subject people. The English were assisted in their relations with Amerind groups by possessing an apperceptive background for contact which the Iroquois lacked. Earlier voyages had acquainted them with the existence of other races and cultures and provided an opportunity for appraising their position in relation to other societies. The Six Nations, not possessing this experience, were relatively unprepared for the appearance of Europeans.' <sup id="cite_ref-731" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-731">[731]</a></sup> The Delaware paid tribute to the league: 'In 1712, when the Delaware got ready to carry their annual tribute to Onondaga, they sent for the Governor of Pennsylvania and laid out on the floor 32 belts of wampum in which various figures had been wrought by their women, and a large calumet which they said had been given to them a generation previously when they submitted to the Five Nations, who had told them to show it whenever they came to a new place and on returning to Onondaga as symbolic of their friendship and subjection to the Five Nations. The calumet, which attracted some attention and is variously described in the records, had “a stone head, a wooden or cane shaft, and feathers fixt to it like wings, with other ornaments” (Provincial Council of Pa., Minutes, 1852, vol. 2, p. 546; Hanna, 1911, vol. 1, pp. 101-102 [slightly different]; Weslager, 1944, p. 383).' <sup id="cite_ref-732" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-732">[732]</a></sup> It seems the Mohawk also collected tribute independently of the league: 'The Mohawks were receivers of tribute from subjugated nations. This hereditary privilege must be placed upon the same footing with the preceding. It may, perhaps, indicate that the nations upon their borders were in subjection.' <sup id="cite_ref-733" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-733">[733]</a></sup> The individual member nations fulfilled specific roles within the league, but on the ideological levl they were considere equals: 'Theoretically, the tribes of the Confederacy enjoyed equality within the structure of the League. The special prerogatives held by certain tribes were the result of accidents of location, and numerical differences in the tribes at the time of the formation of the Confederacy. The four (or three) brothers side or moiety were elder brothers of the three (or two) brothers moiety. The Mohawk of the elder brother side were referred to or, as it may be rendered, the shield.” The special prerogative of this tribe was the right to collect tribute from subject tribes. The Seneca, also of this moiety, were the guardians of the “western door” because of their geographical position along the western boundary of the Confederacy, and were known as those “who threw out the snake.” That is, it was their duty to dispose of any matters harmful to the League. In addition to this [Page 39] privilege, the Seneca were further honored by being assigned the two hereditary war chiefships of the League. The most important honors belonged to the third tribe of this moiety, the Onondaga. They were the Firekeeepers of the Confederacy and one of their chiefs was the custodian of the Council wampum. No particular prerogatives belonged to the two tribes of the younger brother moiety; the Oneida who were known as the Great Tree, and the Cayuga whose national epithet was the Great Pipe.' <sup id="cite_ref-734" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-734">[734]</a></sup> Accordingly, we have assumed that no 'ethnic stratification' existed among individuals whose nations had full membership status.</dd></dl>

An individual, a house, or a clan could acquire no right to land beyond the term of actual occupation. (2) Rights of toll from ersons passing through the public domain. (3) Rights of hunting, fishing, and trading in any new countries discovered by a citizen. (4) The tribe had also a public treasury, conaining not only archives, records, and maps, but also personal [Page 273] property of all kinds, even including slaves, and usually it owned a council house.' <sup id="cite_ref-739" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-739">[739]</a></sup> 'Expenses of war (but a comparatively small portion of these), of public gifts, and of the entertainment of ambassadors were among the charges which fell upon the public treasury.' <sup id="cite_ref-740" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-740">[740]</a></sup> 'Everything else belonged to the clan or to the house, between which, as often, it is not easy to discriminate in all details.

In brief, the product of the labor of a member of the house belonged to the house; and as a curious illustration of this a newly discovered cure for disease was the property of the house.' <sup id="cite_ref-741" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-741">[741]</a></sup> 'The clan owned the lives of its members; these lives it might itself take, or if any one else took them the right to compensation belonged to the clan. As a member of the clan or household an individual had the right to a place in the dwelling, to a share in its food supply, and to the exclusive possession of a field. When he died or emigrated the clan was his heir, or, more accurately, his administrator. All property which by law he might not take with him, he might distribute before his departure; but if he failed to do so it was distributed by the clan, usually to his nearest relatives. If an apartment or a planting lot were abandoned, it reverted to the general stock, and might with the approval of the clan or house be occupied by another.' <sup id="cite_ref-742" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-742">[742]</a></sup> Individually held private property was largely restricted to movables, which could be owned by both men and women: 'The individual owned, to use a convenient measure, only that he could carry with him; his clothing and ornaments, the mat on which he slept, his weapons, his pipe, and his kettle. These and no more he could take with him when he emigrated, and they were buried with him when he died.

The tribal council was composed of the sachems who represented the tribe on the League council. Sachem positions were hereditary within each tribe and belonged to particular matrisibs. The women of the matrisib nominated each new sachem, who was always a male, and had the power to recall or "dehorn" a chief who failed to represent the interests of his people. Theoretically, each sachem was equal to the others in power, but in practice those with better oratorial skills wielded greater influence. After the confederacy had been functioning for a period of time a new, nonhereditary office of Pine Tree Chief was created to provide local leadership and to act as advisors to the council sachems, although later they actually sat on the League council and equaled the sachems in power. Pine Tree Chiefs held their position for life and were chosen by the women of a matrisib on the basis of skill in warfare.' <sup id="cite_ref-752" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-752">[752]</a></sup> The league remained a coherent body until the American Revolution: 'Iroquois involvement in the fur trade and war with the French increased the importance and solidarity of the League council and thereby strengthened the confederacy. The strength of the confederacy continued to grow until the time of the American Revolution when Iroquois interests divided between alliances to the British and the American colonists.' <sup id="cite_ref-753" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-753">[753]</a></sup> 'Nations' owned priviledged access to natural resources in their territory: 'Seasonal return to hunting and fishing economy meant that Iroquois villages were abandoned periodically. From the harvest to midwinter, families went to the woods to hunt for meat, seeking hunting partners in settlements adjacent to hunting grounds. Villages were again evacuated in early spring: (1) a short removal to the nearby sugar bush for several weeks, (2) for a longer period in March and April to attend pigeon nestings, and (3) to nearby fishing sites. In all these activities a semblance of local organization was maintained. Village and tribal holdings in sugar bush, pigeon nesting sites, and fishing places formed a continuous territory with the farm and ordinary hunting lands of the village. Major pigeon nestings and longterm fall hunts were carried on at some remove from the village settlements and required the movement of persons from say Buffalo some 70 or 80 miles to south of Warren, Pa. (Fenton and Deardorff, 1943, p. 296 and map). Villages tended to move within rather narrow orbits, quite definitely within the above territory, moving to perhaps a day's walk from the old settlement, frequently the “old town” giving way to the “new town” as a gradual development of one out of the other. At earlier times the movements were more abrupt (Fenton, 1940). Use of hunting territory, fishing sites, berrying grounds, and medicinal plant stations were deemed local privileges belonging to the inhabitants of that place. Ultimately, such ownership rested in the tribe or “nation.” To this day the title of lands rests in the nation; nothing like the Algonquian type of individual hunting territories was known. A Cayuga hunter, however, was careful to leave the pelt in the Seneca nation's territory, vouchsafing a privilege which was not extended to alien tribes outside the League. Similarly the use of fields and cemeteries will redound to local inhabitants. To the extent that coresidents are related unilaterally, [Page 43] clan fields will adjoin; cemeteries will contain the bones of predominately one clan.' <sup id="cite_ref-754" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-754">[754]</a></sup> Land was thus generally held in common, but individuals retained usufruct rights in lands which they themselves had opened for cultivation: 'Property, both in amount and variety, was exceedingly limited; as would naturally be expected among a people living a hunter and semi-agricultural life, and making a mere subsistence the limit of their wants and of their ambition. But inconsiderable as it was in the aggregate, it was held, and subject to distribution, under fixed laws. Having neither currency nor trade, nor the love of gain, their property consisted merely of planting lots, orchards, houses, implements of the chase, weapons, articles of apparel, domestic utensils, personal ornaments, stores of grain, skins of animals, and those miscellaneous fabrics which the necessities of life led them to invent. The rights of property, of both husband and wife, were continued distinct during the existence of the marriage relation; the wife holding, and controlling her own, the same as her husband, and in case of separation, taking it with her. No individual could obtain the absolute title to land, as that was vested by the laws of the Iroquois in all the people; but he could reduce unoccupied lands to cultivation, to any extent he pleased; and so long as he continued to use them, his right to their enjoyment was protected and secured. He could also sell his improvements, or bequeath them to his wife or children. If the wife, either before or after marriage, inherited orchards, or planting lots, or reduced land to cultivation, she could dispose of them at her pleasure, and in case of her death they were inherited, together with her other effects, by her children. The rule of descent, on the death of the father, was different. His children, not being [Page 318] of his tribe, were out of the line of inheritance; for by their laws, property could not, by descent, pass out of the tribe. If he gave his planting lots, or any articles of property to his wife or children, in the presence of a witness, they were allowed to hold them. But if he made no disposition of his effects, they were handed over upon his decease, to the near relatives in his own tribe, who usually assigned to the family the house, and such other articles as they deemed advisable, and distributed the residue among themselves, as personal mementos of the deceased.' <sup id="cite_ref-755" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-755">[755]</a></sup> Individually held private property was limited to movables: 'The individual owned, to use a convenient measure, only that he could carry with him; his clothing and ornaments, the mat on which he slept, his weapons, his pipe, and his kettle. These and no more he could take with him when he emigrated, and they were buried with him when he died. As a member of the house, clan, or tribe, he had a special property in other chattels and in land so long as he was in possession and use thereof as a member of the community. But when his relation ended his rights ended also.' <sup id="cite_ref-756" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-756">[756]</a></sup> Beauchamp speaks of an Iroquois 'nobility', by which he might mean chiefly lineages: 'If they had no great prominence in magical arts at an early day it was not because they were undervalued. They might belong to the Iroquois Agoianders, or nobility. In 1671 a Christian Mohawk woman left her country to live in Canada. On this her family “degraded her from the nobility, in an assembly of the chiefs of the town, and took away the name and title of Oiander, that is to say, esteemed, a quality which they much esteem and which she had inherited from her ancestors, and deserved by her own good spirit, her prudence and wise conduct, and at the same time they installed another in her place. These women are much respected; they hold council, and the Ancients complete no affair of consequence without their advice.”' <sup id="cite_ref-757" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-757">[757]</a></sup> High-ranking individuals tended to have more servants: 'It must be remembered that all were not equally rich, nor did all women rank alike. Some were brought up delicately. In the Relation for 1670 we have an account of the recent death of a young Seneca woman of high rank who had been baptized. To the comforting words of the missionary the mother replied, “Thou wast not acquainted with her; she was mistress here, and commanded more than twenty slaves who are still with me. She knew not what it was to go to the forest to bring in wood, or to the river there to draw up water. She was not able to trouble herself with all that which concerns housekeeping. Now I doubt not but that being now the only one of our family in Paradise, she may have much trouble to accustom herself to it; for she will be obliged to do her cooking herself, to go to the wood and the water, and to prepare all with her own hands for eating and drinking.” If only one of her slaves could go to the same place it would be all right.' <sup id="cite_ref-758" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-758">[758]</a></sup> Accordingly, some differentiation of wealth was present: 'The distinction of rich and poor was known among the Iroquois, as applying both to the individual and to the house. [Page 274] Even in the same clan one house might be wealthy and the other poor. Property rnight be transferred by gift or purchase, by gambling, as a hire of labor, but rather as a fee than a wage, or in payment of damages for a tort.' <sup id="cite_ref-759" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-759">[759]</a></sup> But social classes in our sense of the term were absent: 'The lack of social classes is also considered to be characteristically Indian. No individual is considered socially superior to any other. Whatever prestige is to be gained is achieved by living up to the previously mentioned behavioral ideals of generosity, patience, willingness to help, self-control, etc. Indians who try to claim rank are derisively chided or talked about.' <sup id="cite_ref-760" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-760">[760]</a></sup> Morgan provides a general summary of the property system: 'The tribe had its property also, -- its lands, tenements, and hereditaments. These included (1) the territories which it occupied, the boundaries being, as elsewhere mentioned, as definite as those of a modern state; and by ownership of the and is meant not merely sovereignty, but that the tribe was he actual and sole owner of the fee of the soil. An individual, a house, or a clan could acquire no right to land beyond the term of actual occupation. (2) Rights of toll from ersons passing through the public domain. (3) Rights of hunting, fishing, and trading in any new countries discovered by a citizen. (4) The tribe had also a public treasury, conaining not only archives, records, and maps, but also personal [Page 273] property of all kinds, even including slaves, and usually it owned a council house.' <sup id="cite_ref-761" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-761">[761]</a></sup> 'Expenses of war (but a comparatively small portion of these), of public gifts, and of the entertainment of ambassadors were among the charges which fell upon the public treasury.' <sup id="cite_ref-762" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-762">[762]</a></sup> 'Everything else belonged to the clan or to the house, between which, as often, it is not easy to discriminate in all details. The house owned the communal dwelling, the chattels of general use that it contained, and all that might be brought into it as trophies of war or the chase or the product of agriculture. In brief, the product of the labor of a member of the house belonged to the house; and as a curious illustration of this a newly discovered cure for disease was the property of the house.' <sup id="cite_ref-763" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-763">[763]</a></sup> 'The clan owned the lives of its members; these lives it might itself take, or if any one else took them the right to compensation belonged to the clan. As a member of the clan or household an individual had the right to a place in the dwelling, to a share in its food supply, and to the exclusive possession of a field. When he died or emigrated the clan was his heir, or, more accurately, his administrator. All property which by law he might not take with him, he might distribute before his departure; but if he failed to do so it was distributed by the clan, usually to his nearest relatives. If an apartment or a planting lot were abandoned, it reverted to the general stock, and might with the approval of the clan or house be occupied by another.' <sup id="cite_ref-764" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-764">[764]</a></sup> 'By the use of the pronoun “he” it is by no means intended to exclude the female. A woman might have her individual property, her ornaments, or her field, but for obvious reasons the man, who was a stranger and sojourner in the dwelling where he abode, would accumulate more separate estate than the woman who was of it.' <sup id="cite_ref-765" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-765">[765]</a></sup> While some differentiation of wealth was present and most land was held by matrilineages, everyone could own property in movables.</dd></dl>

It served as currency between the Indians and the Dutch and English colonists. Enormous quantities were used to pay the tribute demanded from the Iroquois by other Indian tribes.' <sup id="cite_ref-766" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-766">[766]</a></sup> 'Hale (1965:88-89) has summarized the principles and methods used by the Iroquois in attempting to establish universal peace. The League's primary goal was the voluntary admittance of all nations and tribes. However admirable this project was, the realities of life quickly demonstrated a great void between ideology and execution. Nevertheless, some [Page 52] Nanticokes, Tuteloes, a band of Delawares, and the Tuscarora were ultimately admitted to the League. If a nation did not ask outright to join the League, the Iroquois then sought to accomplish the same end by suggesting a treaty of alliance. Should subtle hints of this nature fail to bring the desired response the third alternative was to declare war. If the unfortunate nation capitulated early, it was at once spared and usually allowed to retain its territory and most of its property. The people were required to acknowledge the Iroquois as their superior, to pay a modest tribute in wampum and furs, and refrain from any further war activity. When all else failed, the Iroquois did not hesitate to totally annihilate whole tribes. “But,” Hale (1965:95) points out, the Iroquois never for a moment forgot the principles which lay at the foundation of their League, and which taught them to “strengthen their house” by converting enemies into friends. On the instant that resistance ceased, slaughter ceased with it. The warriors who were willing to unite their fortunes with the Confederates were at once welcomed among them. Some were adopted into the families of those who had lost children or brothers. Others had lands allotted to them, on which they were allowed to live by themselves, under their own chiefs and their native laws, until in two or three generations, by friendly intercourse, frequent intermarriages, and community of interests, they became gradually absorbed into the society about them.' <sup id="cite_ref-767" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-767">[767]</a></sup> 'If we examine the conditions under which European-Iroquois contacts took place it may be possible to suggest the factors which were responsible for the League's losing its independent status. At the outset we can dismiss the consideration that the League may have failed to comprehend fully the significance of sovereignty. As a confederate body to which member nations had delegated control of external affairs, the League was practiced in dealing with self-governing Indian groups. As conquerors of many neighboring tribes from which they collected tribute they inevitably learned the distinction between an independent and a subject people. The English were assisted in their relations with Amerind groups by possessing an apperceptive background for contact which the Iroquois lacked. Earlier voyages had acquainted them with the existence of other races and cultures and provided an opportunity for appraising their position in relation to other societies. The Six Nations, not possessing this experience, were relatively unprepared for the appearance of Europeans.' <sup id="cite_ref-768" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-768">[768]</a></sup> The Delaware paid tribute to the league: 'In 1712, when the Delaware got ready to carry their annual tribute to Onondaga, they sent for the Governor of Pennsylvania and laid out on the floor 32 belts of wampum in which various figures had been wrought by their women, and a large calumet which they said had been given to them a generation previously when they submitted to the Five Nations, who had told them to show it whenever they came to a new place and on returning to Onondaga as symbolic of their friendship and subjection to the Five Nations. The calumet, which attracted some attention and is variously described in the records, had “a stone head, a wooden or cane shaft, and feathers fixt to it like wings, with other ornaments” (Provincial Council of Pa., Minutes, 1852, vol. 2, p. 546; Hanna, 1911, vol. 1, pp. 101-102 [slightly different]; Weslager, 1944, p. 383).' <sup id="cite_ref-769" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-769">[769]</a></sup> It seems the Mohawk also collected tribute independently of the league: 'The Mohawks were receivers of tribute from subjugated nations. This hereditary privilege must be placed upon the same footing with the preceding. It may, perhaps, indicate that the nations upon their borders were in subjection.' <sup id="cite_ref-770" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-770">[770]</a></sup> The individual member nations fulfilled specific roles within the league, but on the ideological levl they were considere equals: 'Theoretically, the tribes of the Confederacy enjoyed equality within the structure of the League. The special prerogatives held by certain tribes were the result of accidents of location, and numerical differences in the tribes at the time of the formation of the Confederacy. The four (or three) brothers side or moiety were elder brothers of the three (or two) brothers moiety. The Mohawk of the elder brother side were referred to or, as it may be rendered, the shield.” The special prerogative of this tribe was the right to collect tribute from subject tribes. The Seneca, also of this moiety, were the guardians of the “western door” because of their geographical position along the western boundary of the Confederacy, and were known as those “who threw out the snake.” That is, it was their duty to dispose of any matters harmful to the League. In addition to this [Page 39] privilege, the Seneca were further honored by being assigned the two hereditary war chiefships of the League. The most important honors belonged to the third tribe of this moiety, the Onondaga. They were the Firekeeepers of the Confederacy and one of their chiefs was the custodian of the Council wampum. No particular prerogatives belonged to the two tribes of the younger brother moiety; the Oneida who were known as the Great Tree, and the Cayuga whose national epithet was the Great Pipe.' <sup id="cite_ref-771" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-771">[771]</a></sup> Accordingly, we have assumed that no 'ethnic stratification' existed among individuals whose nations had full membership status. Accordingly, we have assumed that all individuals whose nations had full membership status could own property.</dd></dl>

<dd> <b>♠ elite status is selected ♣ absent ♥</b></dd>
<dd> <b>♠ formal system of hereditary social status ♣ absent ♥</b> Iroquois society was organized in matrilineages rather than social classes: 'Matrilineages were organized into 15 matrisibs. Among the Cayuga, Onondaga, Seneca and Tuscarora the matrisibs were further organized into moieties. Among the Mohawk and the Oneida no moiety division was recognized. Descent was matrilineal. In modern times, the stress placed on patrilineal inheritance by Canadian authorities has undermined the traditional matrilineal system.' <sup id="cite_ref-772" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-772">[772]</a></sup> 'Traditional kinship terminology followed the Iroquoian pattern. In one's own and the first ascending and descending generations parallel relatives were classed with one's lineal relatives and cross relatives were referred to separately.' <sup id="cite_ref-773" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-773">[773]</a></sup> Matrilineages held and transmitted property in land: 'Matrilineages were the property holding unit in traditional Iroquoian society.' <sup id="cite_ref-774" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-774">[774]</a></sup> 'Traditionally, property was inherited matrilineally. In the 1980s matrilineal inheritance continued to be practiced among Iroquois on reservations in the United States, but not so for those in Canada, where the government has enforced a patrilineal system of inheritance.' <sup id="cite_ref-775" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-775">[775]</a></sup> Matrilineal/matrilocal family groups formed the basic socio-economic units: 'The basic economic unit consisted of matrilineally extended family groups of women, their spouses, and their children. Each extended family group occupied a longhouse within which individual nuclear families occupied designated sections and shared common hearths. Each longhouse was under the control and direction of the elder women in the extended family group.' <sup id="cite_ref-776" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-776">[776]</a></sup> 'The members of matrisibs cooperated in economic activities and were obligated to avenge the death or injury of any other member. Moieties had reciprocal and complementary ceremonial functions and competed against one another in games. Matrisibs cut across tribal boundaries so that members were found in each tribe and village and often within each longhouse.' <sup id="cite_ref-777" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-777">[777]</a></sup> Member nations were organized in a joint league council, with chiefly titles being transmitted within particular matrilineages: 'The Iroquois confederacy operated under a council of 50 sachems representing the five original tribes. When the Tuscarora joined the League in 1722, no new sachem positions were created for it. The council was a legislative, executive and judicial body that deliberated only on the external affairs of the confederacy, such as peace and war, and on matters common to the five constituent tribes. The council had no voice in the internal affairs of the separate tribes.' <sup id="cite_ref-778" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-778">[778]</a></sup> 'Tribal representation on the council was unequally distributed among the 5 tribes although abuse of power was limited by the requirement of unanimity in all council decisions.

Pine Tree Chiefs held their position for life and were chosen by the women of a matrisib on the basis of skill in warfare.' <sup id="cite_ref-779" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-779">[779]</a></sup> The league remained a coherent body until the American Revolution: 'Iroquois involvement in the fur trade and war with the French increased the importance and solidarity of the League council and thereby strengthened the confederacy. The strength of the confederacy continued to grow until the time of the American Revolution when Iroquois interests divided between alliances to the British and the American colonists.' <sup id="cite_ref-780" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-780">[780]</a></sup> Chiefly lineages were more prominent as their matrisibs and matrons could nominate titleholders: 'Now the importance of the maternal family is political, as Goldenweiser indicated, and politics are local business. In precisely those local groups where the system of life chiefs survives (Tonawanda, Onondaga, Tuscarora, Six Nations), the distinction is made between chiefly lineages and the clan. Controversies rage as to which lineage in a clan possesses a title and whether the clan mother is the oldest woman of the chiefly lineage or the oldest woman of the clan (Tonawanda Turtles in National Gypsum Co. case). If the local titlebearing lineage lacks a likely candidate for chiefship, the matron loans her title to the matron of another lineage who installs her son, or sister's son, etc., and the second lineage after a generation or so claims the title, or swears that it belongs to the whole clan. Similarly, a title may pass from one community to another, or to another clan in the same phratry. In the two communities of the Seneca Nation--Allegany and Cattaraugus--which adopted the elective system of Councilors after Buffalo Creek, the practical distinction between maternal family and clan has blurred. The same process has been going on since 1924 at Six Nations, including the Canadian Delaware.' <sup id="cite_ref-781" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-781">[781]</a></sup> 'A Chief was appointed by the oldest woman of the maternal family in which the title descended. Her descendants and those who were related clanwise were his constituents. The matron and the chief tended to reside in the same settlement, for when the Chief removed, the clan had no one to regard with confidence unless he returned for village councils. If the matron removed, local succession was in jeopardy. [Page 51] The results of deliberations by the clan were taken from village councils to the council of the tribe. The ranking clan chiefs residing at a place were the cochiefs of that settlement. All eight of the Seneca chiefs are now concentrated at Tonawanda, but formerly the Seneca had at least four villages, and all the rest save the Oneida had each two or three principal towns with satellite settlements. The tribe thus spoke a common language, it comprised two or more settlements, it was governed by a common council of village chiefs who also represented constituent clans, and they governed a common territory adjacent to the towns. In time all clans were present in all villages, probably about in the same proportions as they are now. As any clan predominated in a settlement, members had to seek mates in the next village, or divide their own house in twain, thus distributing the clans again.' <sup id="cite_ref-782" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-782">[782]</a></sup> Beauchamp speaks of an Iroquois 'nobility', by which he might mean chiefly lineages: 'If they had no great prominence in magical arts at an early day it was not because they were undervalued.

These women are much respected; they hold council, and the Ancients complete no affair of consequence without their advice.”' <sup id="cite_ref-783" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-783">[783]</a></sup> Prisoners of war were enslaved: 'To us slavery is a relic of barbarism, yet for the Onondagas it was a step forward when they perceived the wisdom of sparing captives that they might have slaves to work their fields.' <sup id="cite_ref-784" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-784">[784]</a></sup> 'As in civilized communities, there was a division of work between men and women, and the women's work was often assigned to men who had become slaves of the Iroquois. They had lost their rank as warriors, unless adopted by some family or clan.'<sup id="cite_ref-785" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-785">[785]</a></sup> Some remained servants, but others were adopted into Iroquois society and could acquire titles: 'Colden said the Iroquois had no slaves, but they not only frequently appear but are classified in the Relation for 1657. There were three kinds. The first were admitted into families, and sometimes became chiefs, though still considered slaves. The second were given to the richer Indians, and had food and shelter, but nothing more. The third were young women and girls, continually exposed to every danger. Often, however, they were saved from death to become wives. As slaves the treatment of these girls depended on the temper of their mistress, and this was often cruel. In 1656 an Erie girl displeased her Onondaga mistress, who hired a young man to kill her. The life of the slave was absolutely in the power of the owner.' <sup id="cite_ref-786" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-786">[786]</a></sup> 'Throughout the contact period until the American Revolution the Iroquois maintained their aboriginal corporate structurs. Although disease and warfare such as the Beaver Wars of 1748-1780 and the French and Indian War of 1754 had taken their toll in reducing the Iroquois, they, by adopting captives, replenished their population. Fenton noted: By the end of the seventeenth century the adopted or their offspring outnumbered the Iroquois proper. They became thoroughly acculturated and acted more like the Iroquois than the Iroquois themselves. Chieftenship titles were even conforred on adoptees. The rejuvenating power of the People of the Longhouse amazed everyone who wrote about them. (1971:143)' <sup id="cite_ref-787" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-787">[787]</a></sup> Morgan describes the process of adoption: 'THE statements in the text, while of course not made on personal observation, are, in the main, correct. The reason prisoners were not exchanged was that after they had been adopted they were Iroquois, and to surrender them would be to give up an Iroquois to a strange nation. Individuals who had not been adopted might be and often were given up, or rescued by their countrymen. An adopted prisoner was usually taken in place of some member of a household who had recently died, and might be tortured and burnt, or saved alive, at the discretion of the house which owned him. From this point of view it was better to be adopted in place of one who had died by disease or accident than in place of one killed in battle. The adopted citizens [Page p278] were for a long time subject to suspicion and in danger of their lives; any untoward event, physical disability of the captive, or the mere caprice of their owners being enough to order them out to be burnt. Most of these were treated as slaves, but their position, particularly if of Iroquoian stock, would gradually improve, and in the second generation no difference would remain between slaves and masters. An interesting and fortunate case of adoption is that of the Jesuit Milet taken prisoner by the Onondagas in 1689.

<p><b>♠ social mobility ♣ present ♥</b> Iroquois society was organized in matrilineages rather than social classes: 'Matrilineages were organized into 15 matrisibs. Among the Cayuga, Onondaga, Seneca and Tuscarora the matrisibs were further organized into moieties. Among the Mohawk and the Oneida no moiety division was recognized. Descent was matrilineal. In modern times, the stress placed on patrilineal inheritance by Canadian authorities has undermined the traditional matrilineal system.' <sup id="cite_ref-791" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-791">[791]</a></sup> 'Traditional kinship terminology followed the Iroquoian pattern. In one's own and the first ascending and descending generations parallel relatives were classed with one's lineal relatives and cross relatives were referred to separately.' <sup id="cite_ref-792" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-792">[792]</a></sup> Matrilineages held and transmitted property in land: 'Matrilineages were the property holding unit in traditional Iroquoian society.' <sup id="cite_ref-793" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-793">[793]</a></sup> 'Traditionally, property was inherited matrilineally. In the 1980s matrilineal inheritance continued to be practiced among Iroquois on reservations in the United States, but not so for those in Canada, where the government has enforced a patrilineal system of inheritance.' <sup id="cite_ref-794" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-794">[794]</a></sup> Matrilineal/matrilocal family groups formed the basic socio-economic units: 'The basic economic unit consisted of matrilineally extended family groups of women, their spouses, and their children. Each extended family group occupied a longhouse within which individual nuclear families occupied designated sections and shared common hearths. Each longhouse was under the control and direction of the elder women in the extended family group.' <sup id="cite_ref-795" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-795">[795]</a></sup> 'The members of matrisibs cooperated in economic activities and were obligated to avenge the death or injury of any other member. Moieties had reciprocal and complementary ceremonial functions and competed against one another in games. Matrisibs cut across tribal boundaries so that members were found in each tribe and village and often within each longhouse.' <sup id="cite_ref-796" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-796">[796]</a></sup> Member nations were organized in a joint league council, with chiefly titles being transmitted within particular matrilineages: 'The Iroquois confederacy operated under a council of 50 sachems representing the five original tribes. When the Tuscarora joined the League in 1722, no new sachem positions were created for it. The council was a legislative, executive and judicial body that deliberated only on the external affairs of the confederacy, such as peace and war, and on matters common to the five constituent tribes. The council had no voice in the internal affairs of the separate tribes.' <sup id="cite_ref-797" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-797">[797]</a></sup> 'Tribal representation on the council was unequally distributed among the 5 tribes although abuse of power was limited by the requirement of unanimity in all council decisions. Below the level of the League council were separate tribal councils concerned with the internal affairs of each tribe and each tribe's relations with external groups. The tribal council was composed of the sachems who represented the tribe on the League council. Sachem positions were hereditary within each tribe and belonged to particular matrisibs. The women of the matrisib nominated each new sachem, who was always a male, and had the power to recall or "dehorn" a chief who failed to represent the interests of his people. Theoretically, each sachem was equal to the others in power, but in practice those with better oratorial skills wielded greater influence. After the confederacy had been functioning for a period of time a new, nonhereditary office of Pine Tree Chief was created to provide local leadership and to act as advisors to the council sachems, although later they actually sat on the League council and equaled the sachems in power. Pine Tree Chiefs held their position for life and were chosen by the women of a matrisib on the basis of skill in warfare.' <sup id="cite_ref-798" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-798">[798]</a></sup> The league remained a coherent body until the American Revolution: 'Iroquois involvement in the fur trade and war with the French increased the importance and solidarity of the League council and thereby strengthened the confederacy. The strength of the confederacy continued to grow until the time of the American Revolution when Iroquois interests divided between alliances to the British and the American colonists.' <sup id="cite_ref-799" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-799">[799]</a></sup> Chiefly lineages were more prominent as their matrisibs and matrons could nominate titleholders: 'Now the importance of the maternal family is political, as Goldenweiser indicated, and politics are local business. In precisely those local groups where the system of life chiefs survives (Tonawanda, Onondaga, Tuscarora, Six Nations), the distinction is made between chiefly lineages and the clan. Controversies rage as to which lineage in a clan possesses a title and whether the clan mother is the oldest woman of the chiefly lineage or the oldest woman of the clan (Tonawanda Turtles in National Gypsum Co. case). If the local titlebearing lineage lacks a likely candidate for chiefship, the matron loans her title to the matron of another lineage who installs her son, or sister's son, etc., and the second lineage after a generation or so claims the title, or swears that it belongs to the whole clan. Similarly, a title may pass from one community to another, or to another clan in the same phratry. In the two communities of the Seneca Nation--Allegany and Cattaraugus--which adopted the elective system of Councilors after Buffalo Creek, the practical distinction between maternal family and clan has blurred. The same process has been going on since 1924 at Six Nations, including the Canadian Delaware.' <sup id="cite_ref-800" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-800">[800]</a></sup> 'A Chief was appointed by the oldest woman of the maternal family in which the title descended. Her descendants and those who were related clanwise were his constituents. The matron and the chief tended to reside in the same settlement, for when the Chief removed, the clan had no one to regard with confidence unless he returned for village councils. If the matron removed, local succession was in jeopardy. [Page 51] The results of deliberations by the clan were taken from village councils to the council of the tribe. The ranking clan chiefs residing at a place were the cochiefs of that settlement. All eight of the Seneca chiefs are now concentrated at Tonawanda, but formerly the Seneca had at least four villages, and all the rest save the Oneida had each two or three principal towns with satellite settlements. The tribe thus spoke a common language, it comprised two or more settlements, it was governed by a common council of village chiefs who also represented constituent clans, and they governed a common territory adjacent to the towns. In time all clans were present in all villages, probably about in the same proportions as they are now. As any clan predominated in a settlement, members had to seek mates in the next village, or divide their own house in twain, thus distributing the clans again.' <sup id="cite_ref-801" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-801">[801]</a></sup> Beauchamp speaks of an Iroquois 'nobility', by which he might mean chiefly lineages: 'If they had no great prominence in magical arts at an early day it was not because they were undervalued. They might belong to the Iroquois Agoianders, or nobility. In 1671 a Christian Mohawk woman left her country to live in Canada. On this her family “degraded her from the nobility, in an assembly of the chiefs of the town, and took away the name and title of Oiander, that is to say, esteemed, a quality which they much esteem and which she had inherited from her ancestors, and deserved by her own good spirit, her prudence and wise conduct, and at the same time they installed another in her place. These women are much respected; they hold council, and the Ancients complete no affair of consequence without their advice.”' <sup id="cite_ref-802" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-802">[802]</a></sup> Prisoners of war were enslaved: 'To us slavery is a relic of barbarism, yet for the Onondagas it was a step forward when they perceived the wisdom of sparing captives that they might have slaves to work their fields.' <sup id="cite_ref-803" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-803">[803]</a></sup> 'As in civilized communities, there was a division of work between men and women, and the women's work was often assigned to men who had become slaves of the Iroquois. They had lost their rank as warriors, unless adopted by some family or clan.'<sup id="cite_ref-804" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-804">[804]</a></sup> Some remained servants, but others were adopted into Iroquois society and could acquire titles: 'Colden said the Iroquois had no slaves, but they not only frequently appear but are classified in the Relation for 1657. There were three kinds. The first were admitted into families, and sometimes became chiefs, though still considered slaves. The second were given to the richer Indians, and had food and shelter, but nothing more. The third were young women and girls, continually exposed to every danger. Often, however, they were saved from death to become wives. As slaves the treatment of these girls depended on the temper of their mistress, and this was often cruel. In 1656 an Erie girl displeased her Onondaga mistress, who hired a young man to kill her. The life of the slave was absolutely in the power of the owner.' <sup id="cite_ref-805" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-805">[805]</a></sup> 'Throughout the contact period until the American Revolution the Iroquois maintained their aboriginal corporate structurs. Although disease and warfare such as the Beaver Wars of 1748-1780 and the French and Indian War of 1754 had taken their toll in reducing the Iroquois, they, by adopting captives, replenished their population. Fenton noted: By the end of the seventeenth century the adopted or their offspring outnumbered the Iroquois proper. They became thoroughly acculturated and acted more like the Iroquois than the Iroquois themselves. Chieftenship titles were even conforred on adoptees. The rejuvenating power of the People of the Longhouse amazed everyone who wrote about them. (1971:143)' <sup id="cite_ref-806" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-806">[806]</a></sup> Morgan describes the process of adoption: 'THE statements in the text, while of course not made on personal observation, are, in the main, correct. The reason prisoners were not exchanged was that after they had been adopted they were Iroquois, and to surrender them would be to give up an Iroquois to a strange nation. Individuals who had not been adopted might be and often were given up, or rescued by their countrymen. An adopted prisoner was usually taken in place of some member of a household who had recently died, and might be tortured and burnt, or saved alive, at the discretion of the house which owned him. From this point of view it was better to be adopted in place of one who had died by disease or accident than in place of one killed in battle. The adopted citizens [Page p278] were for a long time subject to suspicion and in danger of their lives; any untoward event, physical disability of the captive, or the mere caprice of their owners being enough to order them out to be burnt. Most of these were treated as slaves, but their position, particularly if of Iroquoian stock, would gradually improve, and in the second generation no difference would remain between slaves and masters. An interesting and fortunate case of adoption is that of the Jesuit Milet taken prisoner by the Onondagas in 1689. He had previously been among the Oneidas as a missionary, and was given to them, they being represented in the war party. For some weeks he remained in the town, well treated but his fate undetermined. Then a council was held to decide the cases of Milet and three other Frenchmen. Two of the others were burned, but Milet was claimed by both the Bear and Tortoise clans, who finally turned him over to the Wolf clan in which he had friends. “Through the influence of the chief women,” says Milet, “they showed me the friendliness of giving me in the place of a sachem who had died long before of disease, rather than of one killed in the attack on the French.” This sachem was Hodashateh, the first Sachem of the Oneidas, and Milet, accordingly, succeeded to the Sachemship and was soon in good standing as a member of the council.

<dl><dd> <b>♠ recruitment of chief executive ♣ ♥</b> There was no single chief executive: 'THE POLITICAL ORGANIZATION of the Iroquois--the system by which decisions were made about problems affecting village, tribe, or confederacy --had three levels. The town or village itself decided local issues like the use of nearby hunting lands, the relocation of houses and cornfields, movement to another site, the acceptance or rejection of visitors, and the raising of war parties. There was a village chiefs' council, numbering up to twenty men, formally organized with a chairman and one or more representatives for each clan. These chiefs were influential men and women, who might be League sachems, warcaptains, warriors, or simply old men who were looked up to and consulted. The council generally met in the presence of the warriors and the women, and rarely diverged in its decisions from the popular consensus, or at least the majority view. This council met in the village's ceremonial longhouse, which usually was merely a large dwelling.' <sup id="cite_ref-810" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-810">[810]</a></sup> Female lineage elders played an important role on the local level: 'The primary local groups of Iroquois society were the extended household and the village. Each extended family lived in a long bark structure, some of which were from fifty to one hundred and fifty feet in length by sixty in breadth, known as longhouses. Throughout its length was a central passageway in which were located hearths at intervals of ten to twelve feet with each hearth being used by two conjugal families. On both sides of this central passageway were apartments each occupied by a simple family. The composition of the group inhabiting the longhouse appears to have been controlled by the matriarch of a lineage. Influential matriarchs who held a chiefly title tended to group their female relatives around them in the same longhouse.' <sup id="cite_ref-811" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-811">[811]</a></sup> Various political levels were validated by wampum beads: 'The longhouse owns “wampums” which validate its position as a ritual center but which are rarely brought out. Wampum occasionally  figures in the ritual, such as the string of wampum used in the rite of confession. But the significance of wampum generally is that because it is a valuable object, it is used to indicate the significance of the event, either by giving it as a commemoration of the event or as being shown in remembrance of the event. Wampum belts, for example, were given at treaties to indicate good faith in the making of the treaty, and might be brought out to remind others of the treaty. In and of itself, wampum is not sacred.' <sup id="cite_ref-812" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-812">[812]</a></sup> The central League Council dealt with commonn affairs, with tribal chiefs and councils (as well as the female elders of their respective lineages and more recently created non-hereditary positions) occupying an intermediary position: 'The Iroquois confederacy operated under a council of 50 sachems representing the five original tribes. When the Tuscarora joined the League in 1722, no new sachem positions were created for it. The council was a legislative, executive and judicial body that deliberated only on the external affairs of the confederacy, such as peace and war, and on matters common to the five constituent tribes.

The Crown madeno attempt to interfere with the appointment or dismissalof chiefs (Weaver 1975). The chiefs met in the Onondagacouncil house, a log structure near Middleport, two orthree times a year to deliberate in traditional fashionmatters of community interest (Weaver 1963-1974). The Onondagas, known collectively as the firekeepers, actedas mediators in the proceedings according to traditionalcustom. However, the tribal seating plan differed fromthe traditional one in that the Mohawks and Senecasoccupied the positions east of the council fire, while theOneidas and Cayugas sat on the west, together with thedependent nations: Tuscaroras, Nanticokes, Delawares,and Tutelos.

<p><b>♠ occupational mobility ♣ absent ♥</b> 'Traditionally, the Iroquois were farmers and hunters who practiced a slash-and-burn form of horticulture. In addition, they fished and gathered berries, plants, and roots. Before the arrival of Europeans the primary weapons were bows and arrows, stone axes and knives and blowguns, however, by the late seventeenth century European trade goods had almost completely replaced the traditional weapons and tools. The principal crops were maize, beans, and squash which, in addition, were prominent in ceremonial activities. In good years surplus crops were dried and stored for future use. After the harvest of crops in the late summer, the seasonal round included fall hunting that lasted until the winter solstice, early spring fishing and hunting of passenger pigeons, and then spring and summer clearing and planting of fields.' <sup id="cite_ref-818" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-818">[818]</a></sup> Labour was divided according to age and gender: 'Traditionally, men hunted and fished, built houses, cleared fields for planting, and were responsible for trade and warfare. In addition, men had the more visible roles in tribal and confederacy politics. Farming was the responsibility of women, whose work also included gathering wild foods, rearing children, preparing food, and making clothing and baskets and other utensils.' <sup id="cite_ref-819" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-819">[819]</a></sup> 'Economically, the maintenance of the household was a joint undertaking, but the women had the chief responsibility in the care of the fields and the raising of the staple foods. Men and women cooperated in the clearing of new fields, after that the women's group took over. Men's hunting added an important relish to the diet. A good meatprovider was considered the best husband. But hunting was more a prestige and recreation point, than a necessity. Village sites were  changed when the fields near them were exhausted--every 15 or 20 years with this type of horticulture--rather than when the district had been hunted out. Conflicts with pioneers occurred more often over the decimation of the game animals, due to the clearing and planting of large numbers of acres, rather than over the scarcity of arable land. But in this case one must remember that it was the Iroquois men with their developed war patterns who came in contact with the pioneers.' <sup id="cite_ref-820" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-820">[820]</a></sup> Many goods were produced in the community: 'The Iroquois knew how to bend and shape wood when green or after steaming. House frames, pack frames, snowshoes, toboggans, basket rims, lacrosse sticks and other wood products were made using these techniques. Rope was made from the inner bark of hickory, basswood and slippery elm and burden straps and prisoner ties were made from the braided fibers of nettle, milkweed and hemp. Pipes of fired clay were among the many types of items manufactured by the Iroquois. The Iroquois are known for making ash and maple splint baskets, although this craft may be of European origin.' <sup id="cite_ref-821" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-821">[821]</a></sup> But trade was also important: 'Long before European contact the Iroquois were involved in an intricate trade network with other native groups (see cultural relations above). Clay pipes were an important trade item that reached other native groups all along the east coast of North America. The aggressive behavior the Iroquois exhibited towards their neighbors during the fur trade period has been interpreted by some as the result of their aim to protect and expand their middleman role. Others have suggested that the aggressive behavior of the Iroquois tribes was related to the scarcity of furs in their own territory and the resulting difficulty in obtaining European trade goods. According to this theory, the Iroquois warred primarily to obtain the trade goods of their neighbors in closer contact with Europeans. After the center of fur trading activities had moved farther west, the Iroquois continued to play an important role as voyageurs and trappers.' <sup id="cite_ref-822" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-822">[822]</a></sup> This suggests that occupational mobility was absent in the pre-colonial and early colonial periods.

Most of these were treated as slaves, but their position, particularly if of Iroquoian stock, would gradually improve, and in the second generation no difference would remain between slaves and masters. An interesting and fortunate case of adoption is that of the Jesuit Milet taken prisoner by the Onondagas in 1689. He had previously been among the Oneidas as a missionary, and was given to them, they being represented in the war party. For some weeks he remained in the town, well treated but his fate undetermined. Then a council was held to decide the cases of Milet and three other Frenchmen. Two of the others were burned, but Milet was claimed by both the Bear and Tortoise clans, who finally turned him over to the Wolf clan in which he had friends. “Through the influence of the chief women,” says Milet, “they showed me the friendliness of giving me in the place of a sachem who had died long before of disease, rather than of one killed in the attack on the French.” This sachem was Hodashateh, the first Sachem of the Oneidas, and Milet, accordingly, succeeded to the Sachemship and was soon in good standing as a member of the council.

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Prisoners ♣ present ♥</b> According to Waugh, some prisoners of war were subject to ceremonial cannibalism: 'Ceremonial cannibalism was evidently quite a common practice, the offering in this way of prisoners captured in war being considered particularly acceptable. In some instances, according to the Relations, the Sun was thought to be offended and to withhold his favour because they had been remiss in torturing and eating prisoners. Portions of the latter, such as the heart, the lips, and other parts were apparently eaten from a belief in sympathetic magic, or the ability to acquire the bravery or other virtues of an enemy.' <sup id="cite_ref-835" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-835">[835]</a></sup> 'The torturing of captive warriors was a common practice among the Hurons and Iroquois, although the latter were, purportedly, the more vicious. The Iroquois massacre of Algonquin and Huron villages was portrayed in all of its bloody detail by dismayed and disappointed Jesuits (J.R. 10:226-228; 54:74; 30:236-240). Cannabalism was especially unnerving to the French. This practice was not limited to eating the heart of a courageous captive. In one village, after the Iroquois had tied up the women and children, they set about devouring the slain Huron men. . . . They dismember those whom they have just massacred, cut them in pieces, and throw the feet, legs, arms, and heads into the stew, which they set boiling with so much joy, that the poor captives who remain alive are heartbroken.' <sup id="cite_ref-836" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-836">[836]</a></sup> Cannibalism and scalp-taking could be considered as a symbolic adoption: 'The equilibrium-maintaining function of Iroquois warfare requires some amplification. Certainly the Iroquois were not unique among Indian tribes, or even primitive peoples generally, in the importance of kinship in establishing the individual's social rights and obligations and in defining his image in his own eyes and the eyes of others. Such discipline and security as the individual enjoyed tended to be provided by his family (and by “family” we mean not merely the immediate household but the various and widely ramifying connections of the kinship system). In such a setting an injury to an Iroquois Indian's relatives became doubly significant, not only because it disturbed the integrity of the group with which he was identified, but also because the affected individuals could not depend upon obtaining redress through police and courts. It was thus a matter of honor for kinfolk to protect one another and, if necessary, to avenge injuries. In the case of a killing, the most immediately affected parties might well be women--mother, sisters, and wife of the lost person--who could demand either the torture and death of the offender or the adoption of a captive to take the departed person's place. (In a fundamental sense, even the dead offender was adopted, since the scalp torn from the slain foe was often ritually adopted into the bereaved family, and the bodies of captives who had been tortured to death were sometimes eaten ceremonially.) While women could hold the initiative in demanding redress and could determine the fate of captives, men were responsible for risking their lives to bring back scalps or prisoners. Joining a war party thereby became a test of manhood, conducted under the watchful eyes of bereaved women, and failure to participate in the revenge process would prejudice the reluctant youth's standing in the eyes of his own family and the community generally.' <sup id="cite_ref-837" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-837">[837]</a></sup> 'Many prisoners were, however, consigned to torture, particularly during the seventeenth century; the manifest horror of the more civilized Europeans at the sight of tortures little different from those they deplored in their own societies was doubtless responsible in part for the lapsing of the torture complex during the eighteenth century. Torture was a ritual and followed a formal, predictable course, in which the victim and his tormentors were expected to play traditionally respectable roles. The victim (usually a man, occasionally a woman, rarely a child) was expected to show composure and hardihood; weaklings who were unable to perform the role, who broke down, wept, and cried for mercy, were sometimes dispatched in disgust with a quick hatchet-blow. While undoubtedly unconscious meanings, various according to the participant and spectator, attached to the torture ritual, many of the tormentors consciously were not anxious to see transports of agony and emotional collapse, but rather the reverse: they wanted to see a stouthearted man with unconquerable self-control, maintaining defiance and self-respect to the bitter end, and the torture was a test of these qualities. Since the victim was in many cases eaten afterward and had in some cases been previously [Page ( 104 )] adopted, he was in a very real sense being incorporated by a family and a community, and becoming a part of them, and a show of strength on his part was gratifying to those who identified with him.' <sup id="cite_ref-838" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-838">[838]</a></sup> Some captive women were also burnt and eaten: 'Mr. Horatio Hale rather strangely says in his “Iroquois Book of Rites,” page 97, “The Iroquois never burnt women at the stake,” and considers this but an occasional death for their male prisoners. He looked at their character through his own benevolent eyes. The [Page 84] instances of their both burning and eating women in the seventeenth century are so many that it is hardly worth while to discuss this. Four Andastes women were burned at Oneida alone in 1668, and another was burned and eaten at Cayuga the same year. Jogues' account of the burning and eating of a female prisoner in sacrifice, by the Mohawks, is well known. She was first burned all over the body, then thrown into a great fire, taken out in due season, and then “her body was cut up, sent to the various villages and devoured.” Similar things were common.' <sup id="cite_ref-839" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-839">[839]</a></sup> Fenton's comments seem to suggest that ceremonial cannibalism was discontinued at some point in the 18th century: 'Feasts on an animal head echo an earlier ceremonial cannibalism. The Huron, Mohawk, and Oneida tribes held feasts where the head, frequently the head of an enemy captive after torture, went into the kettle and then as a choice morsel went first to the chiefs. In the war feast the head, often a dog's head cooked in the soup, was presented to the captain who carried it in his hands inciting others to enlist. By [Page 107] the middle of the eighteenth century, the accounts refer to whole hogs being boiled in the corn soup and warriors successively danced with the hog's head in their hands. Thus, pork replaced the dog as the war feast food, and later it supplanted the bear and venison in all feasts, until today the pig's head is the ceremonial head, the pièce de résistance. Aside from the disappearance of the game animals, it is easy to understand the rapid introduction of pork as a ceremonial food, because the modern Iroquois have an almost insatiable appetite for fresh pork. The present use of the hog's head, nevertheless, evokes the same symbolisms involved in the ancient manipulation of a human or dog's head. On certain occasions, an individual may pick up the head and march toward the women's end of the longhouse, chanting a personal song, praising the exploits of his ancestors, or ridiculing his father's clansman's daughter. In all the medicine feasts, requiring the use of a head, except at Tonawanda and Onondaga where chicken is cooked for Eagle Dance, the head man or woman passes the head first to the ritual sponsor, who occupies the position of the ancient war leader, and after him among the singers, dancers, speakers, and other functionaries (Thwaites, 1896-1901, Jesuit Relations, vol. 10, pp. 181, 183, 229; vol. 50, p. 63; Megapolensis, 1792, p. 522; Lafitau, 1724, vol. 2, pp. 189-191; Colden, 1902, vol. 1, p. xxii; Beauchamp, 1916, p. 89; Zeisberger, 1910, pp. 102-103, 139-140; Loskiel, 1794, p. 146).' <sup id="cite_ref-840" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-840">[840]</a></sup> Writing about wars in the 18th century, he mentions torture and scalp-taking, but no cannibalism: 'Throughout the first half of the eighteenth century the Iroquois were at war with the “Flathead” or Catawba in Carolina, a cause in which their young men gained prestige by taking scalps and bringing home prisoners to replenish losses of manpower, although many Catawba were tortured. French agents among the Five Nations greatly aided and abetted these campaigns to the great distress of the English colonists who suffered depredations along the Warriors' Path, which roughly followed the fall line east of the mountains from Pennsylvania to Carolina. British policy was to secure these Indians against the French, and the colonial governors were instructed to make peace between the warring tribes. As early as 1741, the Cherokee and Catawba agreed to consider a peace settlement which the Six Nations offered through the good offices of the Governors of New York and Carolina. The Cherokee sent some beads, a pipe, an eagle's tail, and a white flag which they had taken from the French. The Catawba sent a wampum belt, a pipe of peace, and tobacco. The belt which the Iroquois had sent was to be kept in one of the principal Cherokee towns (O'Callaghan, 1855, vol. 6, pp. 208, 210-211). The Creek also told the Carolina authorities that they desired peace, but the Catawba ended by refusing all such propositions and calling the Cherokee “Old Women” (Milling, 1940, p. 243).

</p><p><b>♠ Description of the Normative Ideology ♣ ♥</b> eHRAF provides the following general summary: 'The supernatural world of the Iroquois included numerous deities, the most important of which was Great Spirit, who was responsible for the creation of men, the plants and, animals and the forces of good in nature. The Iroquois believed that Great Spirit indirectly guided the lives of ordinary men. Other important deities were Thunderer and the Three Sisters, the spirits of Maize, Beans and Squash. Opposing the Great Spirit and the other forces of good were Evil Spirit and other lesser spirits responsible for disease and other misfortune. In the Iroquois view ordinary humans could not communicate directly with Great Spirit, but could do so indirectly by burning tobacco, which carried their prayers to the lesser spirits of good. The Iroquois regarded dreams as important supernatural signs and serious attention was given to interpreting dreams. It was believed that dreams expressed the desire of the soul and as a result the fulfillment of a dream was of paramount importance to the individual.' <sup id="cite_ref-849" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-849">[849]</a></sup> 'Full time religious specialists were absent, however, there were part-time male and female specialists known as Keepers of the Faith whose primary responsibilities were to arrange and conduct the main religious ceremonies. Keepers of the Faith were appointed by matrisib elders and were accorded considerable prestige.' <sup id="cite_ref-850" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-850">[850]</a></sup> 'Religious ceremonies were tribal affairs concerned primarily with farming, curing illness and thanksgiving. In the sequence of occurrence, the 6 major ceremonies were the Maple, Planting, Strawberry, Green Maize, Harvest and Mid-Winter or New Year's festivals. The first 5 festivals in this sequence involved public confessions followed by group ceremonies which included speeches by the Keepers of the Faith, tobacco offerings and prayer. The New Year's festival was usually held in early February and was marked by dream interpretations and the sacrifice of a white dog offered to purge the people of evil.' <sup id="cite_ref-851" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-851">[851]</a></sup> There were multiple kinds of shamanism: 'Let us summarize, then, what we have just covered. We have seen that there are two types of the “shamanism” in Iroquoia. The first is a descendant of or at least a variation on pure or classical shamanism. In this category are the shamanistic specialists of traditional Huron-Iroquois culture and the diffuse shamanism shared by those who possess guardian spirits. In this category also would be the dream-vision complex where the ordinary person without a guardian spirit is involved. After Handsome Lake, who, we have argued, is the last and possibly only classical Iroquoian shaman, this tradition continued in the dreams of the ill or those seeking friendship and in the “fortuneteller.” The “faithkeepers” and other leaders of the Handsome Lake Religion are holders of an institutional and hierarchical office associated with an organized religion which includes non-shamanistic elements. The second branch of shamanism is manifested in the medicine societies or shamanistic societies that share with traditional shamanism the concern with health and usually the patronage of a tutelary animal spirit. They may well have arisen with the larger socio-political organizations such [Page 260] as the League of the Iroquois. At any rate they are associated with a more sedentary way of life.' <sup id="cite_ref-852" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-852">[852]</a></sup> Some Seneca communities were in contact with Jesuit missionaries: 'They were living in these more northerly locations in the second half of the seventeenth century when the Jesuits visited their villages and established missions insome of them. The first such recorded visit was by Father Pierre Joseph Marie Chaumonot in 1656. He reported that the Senecas had two large villages in addition to a number of smaller ones and that Gandagan (Gandagaro, the large eastern village) was the principal Seneca village(that is, the Seneca “capital”). He also found one villagecomposed largely of Hurons, which he called Saint Michel because most of these Hurons came from thevillage of Scanonaenrat (the village of the Tahontaenrat tribe of the Huron League) where the Jesuits once had a mission called Saint Michel (JR 44:20, 52:53-55). It was said that there were adopted captives from as many as 11 nations living among the Seneca at this time (JR 43:265).' <sup id="cite_ref-853" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-853">[853]</a></sup> 'The Jesuits returned in 1668 to establish a permanent mission among the Seneca, and from their accounts as well as those by Galinée in 1669 (1903:23-25, 81),Greenhalgh in 1677 (O'Callaghan 1849-1851, 1:13-14),and Denonville in 1687 (NYCD 9:365-367), it is evident that in the period 1668-1687 the Senecas still had two large villages, each with 100 or more houses and twosmaller ones of from 20 to 30 houses each. The Jesuits established missions in three of these villages--a mission they called La Conception in the large village of the western Seneca, one they called Saint Jacques in the large village of the eastern Seneca, and a third at Saint Michel,located a few miles south of Saint Jacques (JR 54:79-85,115, 55:79, 56:59, 57:27, 191-195, 58:229, 223, 237). They did not establish a mission in the smaller village of the western Seneca.' <sup id="cite_ref-854" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-854">[854]</a></sup> 'There is some evidence that in the early part of the1670s these villages were moved. The village known tothe Jesuits as Saint Michel or Gandougaraé burned in [Page 506] 1670 and consequently had to be rebuilt (JR 55:79,57:190-191). The large western village was named Gandachioragonin the early years of the 1670s (JR 54:81,115, 121, 55:79, 56:59), but its name was given as Tiotohattan in 1677 (O'Callaghan 1849-1851, 1:13) andas Totiakton in 1687 (NYCD 9:366)--an apparent change of the name of this village that might indicate achange in its location. The large village of the eastern Seneca may have also moved as Galinée reported it was palisaded in 1669, but Greenhalgh said it was not in 1677 (Galinée 1903:23; O'Callaghan 1849-1851, 1:13). The lack of a palisade suggests that it had been moved after the defeat of the Susquehannocks, which made fortifications less necessary.' <sup id="cite_ref-855" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-855">[855]</a></sup> 'In 1653 the Upper Iroquois, engaged in a war with theErie, decided to make peace with the French and sent a delegation to Montreal for that purpose (JR 41:51,81-83). Although the Senecas did not accompany this delegation, they had earlier planned to try to get the Cayugas, who did go, to join with them in such anendeavor (JR 40:163). The following year at a council with Father Simon Le Moyne at Onondaga, they again expressed approval of this peace (JR 41:101). Consequently,in 1656, after the Jesuits had established their mission of Sainte Marie in Onondaga country, Father Chaumonot visited the Senecas (JR 43:307, 44:21-27).But both the peace and the Jesuit mission lasted only a short time. In 1658 the Jesuits were forced to abandon Sainte Marie, and it was not until 1668 that the Jesuits returned to begin again their mission to the Senecas (JR52:53).' <sup id="cite_ref-856" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-856">[856]</a></sup> 'After peace had been established, the Jesuits returned to continue their endeavors among the Senecas, but their effort was short-lived. Of more importance, were the activites of the interpreter and the trader, Louis-Thomas Chabert de Joncaire, who had as a youth been a captive among the Senecas, and his son, Daniel. During King William's War, Joncaire worked to keep the Senecas in the French interest, and after the war ended he developed the fur trade at Niagara, building a trading post there. The French later built a fort at Niagara to control this important passage between Lakes Erie and Ontario and so the western fur trade. Thus, in the second quarter of the eighteenth century, while the English were developing their trade at Oswego, the French were developing theirs at Niagara and increasing their influence among the western Seneca.' <sup id="cite_ref-857" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-857">[857]</a></sup> The same was true of the Onondaga: 'As did other Northern Iroquoians, the Onondagasrelocated their villages after the land that could becleared nearby became exhausted and the firewood that could be collected in the vicinity became scarce. Althoughthey moved their villages every decade or two, theOnondagas usually had only two villages at any one time:a large village that also served as the capital of theLeague, as the meetings of its chiefs were held there, anda much smaller village (Tuck 1971). The Jesuits did notestablish a mission in this smaller village, a circumstance that probably accounts for their failure to mention it.However, it was noted in a 1677 report that the largeOnondaga village contained about 140 houses and the small village then located about two miles away hadabout 24 houses (O'Callaghan 1849-1851, 1:12). A fewyears later, the large Onondaga village was moved and rebuilt, and when Father Jean de Lamberville arrived atOnondaga in 1681, he found its inhabitants in the processof transporting their crops and other belongings from theold village where they had lived for 19 years to the newone two leagues away (JR 62:55-57) on the east side ofButternut Creek one mile south of the present village ofJamesville (fig. 2) (Tuck 1971:188-189).' <sup id="cite_ref-858" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-858">[858]</a></sup> 'After the war with the Eries began the Upper Iroquois,preferring not to wage war on two fronts, decided tomake peace with the French. By establishing peace withthe French the Upper Iroquois also hoped to freethemselves from the regulations the Mohawks had imposedon their trading with Albany and so their dependenceon them (JR 44:151). Consequently in 1653, anOnondaga delegation went to Montreal for that purpose(JR 41:51, 81-83), and the following year Father SimonLe Moyne visited Onondaga (JR 41:91-129). Disturbedby this threat to their control of the trade betweenIroquois and Europeans, the Mohawks attacked the party taking Le Moyne back to Montreal. They capturedLe Moyne, letting him go only after the Onondagasconvinced them to do so (JR 41:199-201). The following year, although Le Moyne went on an embassy to theMohawks, the Onondagas sent a delegation representingthe Upper Iroquois to confirm peace with the French (JR 42:49); and two Jesuits, Pierre Joseph Marie Chaumonotand Claude Dablon, went to Onondaga to establish amission there. For the permanent mission, they chose a site that was near Onondaga Lake and between four andfive leagues from the principal Onondaga village (JR42:61-97, 43:161). In 1656 a number of Frenchmen including other Jesuits came to construct this mission,called Sainte Marie at Gannentaha (Onondaga Lake) JR42:215, 43:133-135, 44:185-187). The Onondaga name is [Page 493] kan[unknown] ntà[unknown] ha[unknown]&nbsp;? ‘place on the hill’. The intention of theJesuits was to build a mission establishment similar to the one they had earlier had among the Hurons, also calledSainte Marie, which had been abandoned in 1649 when,faced with defeat at the hands of the Iroquois, the Huronsand French had fled the country (JR 42:53). But after theEries had been defeated by the Senecas, antagonism tothe French grew, and on the night of March 20, 1658, theFrench abandoned the mission having learned the Onondagas were planning to destroy it (JR 44:153-183,213-217).' <sup id="cite_ref-859" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-859">[859]</a></sup> 'There continued to be a pro-French faction at Onondaga,and in 1661 the Jesuits were invited to return there.Consequently, Le Moyne went to Onondaga where he spent the winter (JR 46:225-245, 47:67-115, 174-199).The following year the western Iroquois, still engaged ina war with the Susquehannocks and ravaged by a smallpox epidemic, planned to enlist the aid of theFrench, but a false report of thousands of soldiers beingsent from France for the purpose of destroying the Iroquois thwarted the effort (JR 48:77-83). In spring1664 Onondagas still divided into a pro- and an anti-Frenchfaction led an Iroquois embassy to seek peacewith the French, but the embassy was attacked by theAlgonquins, and those not killed or taken prisoner tookflight (JR 49:137-147). The efforts of those Onondagasattempting to restore friendly relations with the French inthe years following the abandonment of the mission tothe Onondagas at Gannentaha in 1658 were alsothwarted by other Iroquois, particularly the Mohawks,who were opposed to such an alliance. However, afterAlexandre de Prouville de Tracy's expedition had succeededin burning the Mohawk villages in 1666, theMohawks and other Iroquois concluded a peace with theFrench, and not long after the mission of Saint JeanBaptiste was established at Onondaga (JR 51:237-239).' <sup id="cite_ref-860" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-860">[860]</a></sup> 'The peace concluded with the French did not meanthat the Onondaga ceased to trade with the Dutch tradersat Albany, now British territory. Rather they continuedto go to Albany for that purpose (JR 53:229), the peacepermitting them to trade there as well as with the Frenchand leaving them free to pursue their war with theSusquehannocks--a war that was proving to be both longand costly. In 1669 the Jesuits reported that nearly all theOnondaga warriors had been killed in this war (JR54:111), perhaps an exaggeration but nevertheless areport that suggests the Onondaga war with the Susquehannockswas taking a heavy toll.' <sup id="cite_ref-861" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-861">[861]</a></sup> 'After the war with the Susquehannocks ended in 1675the Iroquois, particularly the Seneca and Cayuga, becamemore hostile to the French, but the Mohawks initially opposed an open conflict with the French as anumber of Mohawks had settled on the Saint Lawrence(see “Mohawk,” this vol.). Those who had remained inthe Mohawk Valley were reluctant to engage in a warwith their relatives (JR 62:255). But the growing antagonismof the Iroquois toward the French led the Jesuits towithdraw most of their missionaries in the early 1680s. However, they remained at Onondaga until 1687, whenJacques Ren’ de Brisay, marquis de Denonville led anexpedition down the Saint Lawrence to attack the Seneca,making impossible continued friendship between theJesuits and the Onondagas.' <sup id="cite_ref-862" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-862">[862]</a></sup> 'After the war had ended and the Iroquois had establishedpeace with both the French and English, theOnondagas remained as they had been earlier, about equally divided into pro-English and pro-French factions(NYCD 4:689, 998). After the establishment of peacewith the French in 1701, the French Jesuits returned toOnondaga, but they were forced to leave in 1709 andtheir mission house and chapel were burned (NYCD4:917-920, 9:829, 836, 838). In 1710 the English wereasked to come and build a fort at Onondaga (Wraxall1915:69, 76; NYCD 5:218). Subsequently, tensions betweenthe French and the Onondagas apparently eased,for in 1711 the French built a blockhouse at Onondaga.However, the English arrived and pulled it down (NYCD5:243-244, 248-249; Wraxall 1915:81-87). The Frenchagain attempted in 1715 to build a fort at Onondaga (Wraxall 1915:104-105) but were unsuccessful in doingso. The English were equally unsuccessful (Lydekker1938:43), and the set of communion plate Queen Annehad made for “her Indian Chappel of the Onondawgus”similar to that she had had made for the Mohawks in1712 remained in Albany at Saint Peter's Church (Clark1849, 1:214-215). Instead, the English built a tradingpost at Oswego in 1725 to attract the fur trade from thewest. It became one of the most important trading centersin the Northeast.' <sup id="cite_ref-863" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-863">[863]</a></sup> However, most Iroquois continued to adhere to the native religion. Accordingly, we have coded for them rather than converts to Catholicism.

<p><b>♠ Rulers are legitimated by gods ♣ absent ♥</b> 'THE POLITICAL ORGANIZATION of the Iroquois--the system by which decisions were made about problems affecting village, tribe, or confederacy --had three levels. The town or village itself decided local issues like the use of nearby hunting lands, the relocation of houses and cornfields, movement to another site, the acceptance or rejection of visitors, and the raising of war parties. There was a village chiefs' council, numbering up to twenty men, formally organized with a chairman and one or more representatives for each clan. These chiefs were influential men and women, who might be League sachems, warcaptains, warriors, or simply old men who were looked up to and consulted. The council generally met in the presence of the warriors and the women, and rarely diverged in its decisions from the popular consensus, or at least the majority view. This council met in the village's ceremonial longhouse, which usually was merely a large dwelling.' <sup id="cite_ref-864" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-864">[864]</a></sup> Female lineage elders played an important role on the local level: 'The primary local groups of Iroquois society were the extended household and the village. Each extended family lived in a long bark structure, some of which were from fifty to one hundred and fifty feet in length by sixty in breadth, known as longhouses. Throughout its length was a central passageway in which were located hearths at intervals of ten to twelve feet with each hearth being used by two conjugal families. On both sides of this central passageway were apartments each occupied by a simple family. The composition of the group inhabiting the longhouse appears to have been controlled by the matriarch of a lineage. Influential matriarchs who held a chiefly title tended to group their female relatives around them in the same longhouse.' <sup id="cite_ref-865" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-865">[865]</a></sup> Various political levels were validated by wampum beads: 'The longhouse owns “wampums” which validate its position as a ritual center but which are rarely brought out. Wampum occasionally  figures in the ritual, such as the string of wampum used in the rite of confession. But the significance of wampum generally is that because it is a valuable object, it is used to indicate the significance of the event, either by giving it as a commemoration of the event or as being shown in remembrance of the event. Wampum belts, for example, were given at treaties to indicate good faith in the making of the treaty, and might be brought out to remind others of the treaty. In and of itself, wampum is not sacred.' <sup id="cite_ref-866" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-866">[866]</a></sup> The central League Council dealt with commonn affairs, with tribal chiefs and councils (as well as the female elders of their respective lineages and more recently created non-hereditary positions) occupying an intermediary position: 'The Iroquois confederacy operated under a council of 50 sachems representing the five original tribes. When the Tuscarora joined the League in 1722, no new sachem positions were created for it. The council was a legislative, executive and judicial body that deliberated only on the external affairs of the confederacy, such as peace and war, and on matters common to the five constituent tribes. The council had no voice in the internal affairs of the separate tribes. Tribal representation on the council was unequally distributed among the 5 tribes although abuse of power was limited by the requirement of unanimity in all council decisions. Below the level of the League council were separate tribal councils concerned with the internal affairs of each tribe and each tribe's relations with external groups. The tribal council was composed of the sachems who represented the tribe on the League council. Sachem positions were hereditary within each tribe and belonged to particular matrisibs. The women of the matrisib nominated each new sachem, who was always a male, and had the power to recall or "dehorn" a chief who failed to represent the interests of his people. Theoretically, each sachem was equal to the others in power, but in practice those with better oratorial skills wielded greater influence. After the confederacy had been functioning for a period of time a new, nonhereditary office of Pine Tree Chief was created to provide local leadership and to act as advisors to the council sachems, although later they actually sat on the League council and equaled the sachems in power. Pine Tree Chiefs held their position for life and were chosen by the women of a matrisib on the basis of skill in warfare. Iroquois involvement in the fur trade and war with the French increased the importance and solidarity of the League council and thereby strengthened the confederacy. The strength of the confederacy continued to grow until the time of the American Revolution when Iroquois interests divided between alliances to the British and the American colonists.' <sup id="cite_ref-867" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-867">[867]</a></sup> 'A Chief was appointed by the oldest woman of the maternal family in which the title descended. Her descendants and those who were related clanwise were his constituents. The matron and the chief tended to reside in the same settlement, for when the Chief removed, the clan had no one to regard with confidence unless he returned for village councils. If the matron removed, local succession was in jeopardy.  The results of deliberations by the clan were taken from village councils to the council of the tribe. The ranking clan chiefs residing at a place were the cochiefs of that settlement. All eight of the Seneca chiefs are now concentrated at Tonawanda, but formerly the Seneca had at least four villages, and all the rest save the Oneida had each two or three principal towns with satellite settlements. The tribe thus spoke a common language, it comprised two or more settlements, it was governed by a common council of village chiefs who also represented constituent clans, and they governed a common territory adjacent to the towns. In time all clans were present in all villages, probably about in the same proportions as they are now. As any clan predominated in a settlement, members had to seek mates in the next village, or divide their own house in twain, thus distributing the clans again.' <sup id="cite_ref-868" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-868">[868]</a></sup> Tribes were composed of matrilineages: 'Matrilineages were organized into 15 matrisibs. Among the Cayuga, Onondaga, Seneca and Tuscarora the matrisibs were further organized into moieties. Among the Mohawk and the Oneida no moiety division was recognized. Descent was matrilineal.' <sup id="cite_ref-869" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-869">[869]</a></sup> The League Council initially met at Onondaga, but the council fire was extinguished and rekindled in various places during the tribulations of the colonial period: 'The council continued to be composed of hereditary chiefs, who together with the “war chiefs” from 1812 andthe Pine Tree chiefs numbered over 50. The Crown madeno attempt to interfere with the appointment or dismissalof chiefs (Weaver 1975). The chiefs met in the Onondagacouncil house, a log structure near Middleport, two orthree times a year to deliberate in traditional fashionmatters of community interest (Weaver 1963-1974). The Onondagas, known collectively as the firekeepers, actedas mediators in the proceedings according to traditionalcustom. However, the tribal seating plan differed fromthe traditional one in that the Mohawks and Senecasoccupied the positions east of the council fire, while theOneidas and Cayugas sat on the west, together with thedependent nations: Tuscaroras, Nanticokes, Delawares,and Tutelos. Although the dependent nations were tospeak through “their voice,” the Cayugas, in fact theyoften directly addressed the assembly of chiefs, andoperated quite independently, though not equaling theoriginal five nations in power or status.' <sup id="cite_ref-870" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-870">[870]</a></sup>  'Despite the efforts of the Onondagas at Onondaga tohave them returned to Onondaga, the council fire of theConfederacy and its wampum records remained at BuffaloCreek until after that reservation had been sold andCaptain Cold (“The League of the Iroquois: Its History,Politics, and Ritual,” fig. 11, this vol.), keeper of thecouncil fire and the wampum, had died.

The strength of the confederacy continued to grow until the time of the American Revolution when Iroquois interests divided between alliances to the British and the American colonists.' <sup id="cite_ref-880" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-880">[880]</a></sup> Chiefly lineages were more prominent as their matrisibs and matrons could nominate titleholders: 'Now the importance of the maternal family is political, as Goldenweiser indicated, and politics are local business. In precisely those local groups where the system of life chiefs survives (Tonawanda, Onondaga, Tuscarora, Six Nations), the distinction is made between chiefly lineages and the clan. Controversies rage as to which lineage in a clan possesses a title and whether the clan mother is the oldest woman of the chiefly lineage or the oldest woman of the clan (Tonawanda Turtles in National Gypsum Co. case). If the local titlebearing lineage lacks a likely candidate for chiefship, the matron loans her title to the matron of another lineage who installs her son, or sister's son, etc., and the second lineage after a generation or so claims the title, or swears that it belongs to the whole clan. Similarly, a title may pass from one community to another, or to another clan in the same phratry. In the two communities of the Seneca Nation--Allegany and Cattaraugus--which adopted the elective system of Councilors after Buffalo Creek, the practical distinction between maternal family and clan has blurred. The same process has been going on since 1924 at Six Nations, including the Canadian Delaware.' <sup id="cite_ref-881" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-881">[881]</a></sup> 'A Chief was appointed by the oldest woman of the maternal family in which the title descended. Her descendants and those who were related clanwise were his constituents. The matron and the chief tended to reside in the same settlement, for when the Chief removed, the clan had no one to regard with confidence unless he returned for village councils. If the matron removed, local succession was in jeopardy. [Page 51] The results of deliberations by the clan were taken from village councils to the council of the tribe. The ranking clan chiefs residing at a place were the cochiefs of that settlement. All eight of the Seneca chiefs are now concentrated at Tonawanda, but formerly the Seneca had at least four villages, and all the rest save the Oneida had each two or three principal towns with satellite settlements. The tribe thus spoke a common language, it comprised two or more settlements, it was governed by a common council of village chiefs who also represented constituent clans, and they governed a common territory adjacent to the towns. In time all clans were present in all villages, probably about in the same proportions as they are now. As any clan predominated in a settlement, members had to seek mates in the next village, or divide their own house in twain, thus distributing the clans again.' <sup id="cite_ref-882" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-882">[882]</a></sup> Beauchamp speaks of an Iroquois 'nobility', by which he might mean chiefly lineages: 'If they had no great prominence in magical arts at an early day it was not because they were undervalued. They might belong to the Iroquois Agoianders, or nobility. In 1671 a Christian Mohawk woman left her country to live in Canada. On this her family “degraded her from the nobility, in an assembly of the chiefs of the town, and took away the name and title of Oiander, that is to say, esteemed, a quality which they much esteem and which she had inherited from her ancestors, and deserved by her own good spirit, her prudence and wise conduct, and at the same time they installed another in her place. These women are much respected; they hold council, and the Ancients complete no affair of consequence without their advice.”' <sup id="cite_ref-883" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-883">[883]</a></sup> Prisoners of war were enslaved: 'To us slavery is a relic of barbarism, yet for the Onondagas it was a step forward when they perceived the wisdom of sparing captives that they might have slaves to work their fields.' <sup id="cite_ref-884" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-884">[884]</a></sup> 'As in civilized communities, there was a division of work between men and women, and the women's work was often assigned to men who had become slaves of the Iroquois. They had lost their rank as warriors, unless adopted by some family or clan.'<sup id="cite_ref-885" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-885">[885]</a></sup> Some remained servants, but others were adopted into Iroquois society and could acquire titles: 'Colden said the Iroquois had no slaves, but they not only frequently appear but are classified in the Relation for 1657. There were three kinds. The first were admitted into families, and sometimes became chiefs, though still considered slaves. The second were given to the richer Indians, and had food and shelter, but nothing more. The third were young women and girls, continually exposed to every danger. Often, however, they were saved from death to become wives. As slaves the treatment of these girls depended on the temper of their mistress, and this was often cruel. In 1656 an Erie girl displeased her Onondaga mistress, who hired a young man to kill her. The life of the slave was absolutely in the power of the owner.' <sup id="cite_ref-886" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-886">[886]</a></sup> 'Throughout the contact period until the American Revolution the Iroquois maintained their aboriginal corporate structurs. Although disease and warfare such as the Beaver Wars of 1748-1780 and the French and Indian War of 1754 had taken their toll in reducing the Iroquois, they, by adopting captives, replenished their population. Fenton noted: By the end of the seventeenth century the adopted or their offspring outnumbered the Iroquois proper. They became thoroughly acculturated and acted more like the Iroquois than the Iroquois themselves. Chieftenship titles were even conforred on adoptees. The rejuvenating power of the People of the Longhouse amazed everyone who wrote about them. (1971:143)' <sup id="cite_ref-887" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-887">[887]</a></sup> Morgan describes the process of adoption: 'THE statements in the text, while of course not made on personal observation, are, in the main, correct. The reason prisoners were not exchanged was that after they had been adopted they were Iroquois, and to surrender them would be to give up an Iroquois to a strange nation. Individuals who had not been adopted might be and often were given up, or rescued by their countrymen. An adopted prisoner was usually taken in place of some member of a household who had recently died, and might be tortured and burnt, or saved alive, at the discretion of the house which owned him. From this point of view it was better to be adopted in place of one who had died by disease or accident than in place of one killed in battle. The adopted citizens [Page p278] were for a long time subject to suspicion and in danger of their lives; any untoward event, physical disability of the captive, or the mere caprice of their owners being enough to order them out to be burnt. Most of these were treated as slaves, but their position, particularly if of Iroquoian stock, would gradually improve, and in the second generation no difference would remain between slaves and masters. An interesting and fortunate case of adoption is that of the Jesuit Milet taken prisoner by the Onondagas in 1689. He had previously been among the Oneidas as a missionary, and was given to them, they being represented in the war party. For some weeks he remained in the town, well treated but his fate undetermined. Then a council was held to decide the cases of Milet and three other Frenchmen. Two of the others were burned, but Milet was claimed by both the Bear and Tortoise clans, who finally turned him over to the Wolf clan in which he had friends. “Through the influence of the chief women,” says Milet, “they showed me the friendliness of giving me in the place of a sachem who had died long before of disease, rather than of one killed in the attack on the French.” This sachem was Hodashateh, the first Sachem of the Oneidas, and Milet, accordingly, succeeded to the Sachemship and was soon in good standing as a member of the council. (Letter of Milet, 64 F. R., 90, 100.)' <sup id="cite_ref-888" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-888">[888]</a></sup>  High-ranking individuals tended to have more servants: 'It must be remembered that all were not equally rich, nor did all women rank alike. Some were brought up delicately. In the Relation for 1670 we have an account of the recent death of a young Seneca woman of high rank who had been baptized. To the comforting words of the missionary the mother replied, “Thou wast not acquainted with her; she was mistress here, and commanded more than twenty slaves who are still with me. She knew not what it was to go to the forest to bring in wood, or to the river there to draw up water. She was not able to trouble herself with all that which concerns housekeeping. Now I doubt not but that being now the only one of our family in Paradise, she may have much trouble to accustom herself to it; for she will be obliged to do her cooking herself, to go to the wood and the water, and to prepare all with her own hands for eating and drinking.” If only one of her slaves could go to the same place it would be all right.' <sup id="cite_ref-889" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-889">[889]</a></sup> But social classes in our sense of the term were absent: 'The lack of social classes is also considered to be characteristically Indian. No individual is considered socially superior to any other. Whatever prestige is to be gained is achieved by living up to the previously mentioned behavioral ideals of generosity, patience, willingness to help, self-control, etc. Indians who try to claim rank are derisively chided or talked about.' <sup id="cite_ref-890" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-890">[890]</a></sup> We have decided to code for the more egalitarian option.</dd>

There were no discontinuities in her upbringing. Desired as the one to carry on the clan and its prerogatives, and through her children, to keep up the strength of numbers of the clan; the girl was as fondly and permissively treated as the boy. Children were not punished; they participated in activities as soon as they were able, were not disciplined in any harsh physical fashion, nor weaned too young. Surrogate mothers were always available, and in the extended household there was no chance for isolation or neglect of the child. In the matrilocal household the relatives first to have contact with the girl would always be in closest relationship to her; she would not have to learn other clan affiliations or restrictions, nor other relationship terms. As she grew older, she would assist her mother in household tasks and in the care of younger siblings; work in the fields with the cooperative women's group; and learn the feminine crafts and techniques from her mother and maternal relatives. Sometime after adolescence her marriage would be arranged by her mother and the mother of a suitable man. Marriage would not change her residence, her name, or her place in the clan. The older women, especially the mothers of the spouses, were the ones responsible for the success of the marriage and would do their best to keep it going. But if their efforts failed, a broken marriage worked little hardship on the wife or young child. Another spouse might be brought into the maternal group, and the child's support was the concern of the maternal line, and his name and inheritance came from his mother's brother.' <sup id="cite_ref-909" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-909">[909]</a></sup> Labour was divided along gender lines: 'Traditionally, men hunted and fished, built houses, cleared fields for planting, and were responsible for trade and warfare. In addition, men had the more visible roles in tribal and confederacy politics. Farming was the responsibility of women, whose work also included gathering wild foods, rearing children, preparing food, and making clothing and baskets and other utensils.' <sup id="cite_ref-910" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-910">[910]</a></sup> 'Iroquois society distinguished between male and female productive roles. The women's role was agricultural. The mythology has the female as mother earth. Agricultural produce was depicted as the Three Sisters, the beans, squash and corn (Fenton,1962). The male role centered around hunting and warfare.

(Jameson, 1821-1825, as quoted in Fonten, 1969:126) Stone (1838, 1:23) stated that Joseph Brant quit bearding school because of the taunts he received from his Iroquois peers for doing women's work, i.e., field labor. Lafitau's description of the degree of distinctness in the roles of males and females illustrated the attitude men had towards women's tasks: In general, men would feel demeaned if they touched this task (i.e., harvesting and cultivating) demeaning themselves if they even barely touched this task or anything else that is set aside as women's work. (1724, 2:79)' <sup id="cite_ref-912" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-912">[912]</a></sup> Women could play important ceremonial roles and female productive activities were celebrated in the festival cycle: 'Religion was a shared activity, though I have called it male-oriented, for the men took the more active part in rituals, prayers, dancing, and singing, and figure as principals in most of the myths. However, there were as many women Keepers of the Faith as men, and these officials, appointed for life, had not only the care and preparation of the feast as their duties, but other responsibilities as well--conferring on the times of festivals, presenting the corn for examination for setting the date of the Green Corn ceremonial, etc. The women were more retiring than the men in making public confessions and it was only a rarely aggressive woman who participated in the dream interpretations. There were women's dances and women joined in the singing, but they requested men singers and drummers to lead the singing for them.' <sup id="cite_ref-913" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-913">[913]</a></sup> 'Women's activities, rather than men's, are celebrated in the ceremonial cycle. There are no festivals to celebrate hunting or war, though they probably existed in the past. All the ceremonies, with the exception of the Midwinter Ceremonial, are thanksgiving for the fertility of the earth, especially for the crops which are women's chief concern. The “Three Sisters,” corn, beans, and squash, also called “Our Mothers” and “Our Supporters” are honored the most. Female virtues of food-providing and the natural fertility and bounty of nature are the qualities most respected and revered.' <sup id="cite_ref-914" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-914">[914]</a></sup> While men held formal leadership titles, women nominated candidates and 'dethroned' titleholders if necessary: 'Degrees of inequality were perpetuated through offices on the basis of sex and membership in a matrilineage. Women controlled the offices of matron and they nominated men of a select number of lineages to become a deputy chief, runner, pine tree chief, council interpreter, magistrate, gamewarden, school trustee, pathmaster or public works superintendent. Within the Longhouse sects three males and three females of each clan held the position of faithkeeper. Women held offices in the Dark Dance and the Death Feast societies and consituted the majority of the membership (Goldenwoiser, 1913:469).' <sup id="cite_ref-915" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-915">[915]</a></sup> 'Tribal representation on the council was unequally distributed among the 5 tribes although abuse of power was limited by the requirement of unanimity in all council decisions. Below the level of the League council were separate tribal councils concerned with the internal affairs of each tribe and each tribe's relations with external groups. The tribal council was composed of the sachems who represented the tribe on the League council. Sachem positions were hereditary within each tribe and belonged to particular matrisibs. The women of the matrisib nominated each new sachem, who was always a male, and had the power to recall or "dehorn" a chief who failed to represent the interests of his people. Theoretically, each sachem was equal to the others in power, but in practice those with better oratorial skills wielded greater influence. After the confederacy had been functioning for a period of time a new, nonhereditary office of Pine Tree Chief was created to provide local leadership and to act as advisors to the council sachems, although later they actually sat on the League council and equaled the sachems in power. Pine Tree Chiefs held their position for life and were chosen by the women of a matrisib on the basis of skill in warfare.' <sup id="cite_ref-916" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-916">[916]</a></sup> Women did not usually speak at council meetings, but could influence the decision-making process in other ways: 'The literature stresses the “high position of women” in respect to their participation in dominantly male-oriented cultural activities, especially politics and religion. The political points are familiar and most of them can be traced to the symbolic extension of the Longhouse as the conceptual basis of the League. The extended family structure of the Longhouse, symbolized in the League, accounts for the function of the matrons to hold the chiefs' names in their clans and their consequent right to appoint and depose chiefs. Death feasts and mourning were the responsibility of the women. Women kept the White Wampum belts which signified the chiefly names. The ability of [Page 172] the women to influence decisions of the council both directly through their speaker and indirectly through the weight of public opinion is mentioned in the literature. Since unanimity was necessary for a decision to act, any proposal unpopular with the matrons could be hindered by their disapproval. Indirectly, too, it is stated that the women could hinder or actually prevent a war party which lacked their approval by not giving the supplies of dried corn and the moccasins which the warriors required. Village head-women are mentioned in myth, and though they may not actually have ruled villages, this concept reflects the power that women were thought to possess. The importance of clan matrons in deciding the fate of captives, whether they would be adopted to replace a lost clan member, or tortured as revenge for a death within the clan, is well known.' <sup id="cite_ref-917" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-917">[917]</a></sup> 'Allusion has been made to the fact that Iroquois women, however influential politically and socially, did not speak in their councils. Early writers take notice of this, and the custom continued. In 1791 Colonel Proctor attended a Seneca feast, where he saw a wooden statue before which they danced. “Under this statue were placed two chiefs, termed the women's speakers. . . . The old and the young women danced around in a circle,” etc. The same gentleman went to a council in Buffalo that year, to “hear what would be said by the women speaker, the young prince of the Turtle tribe (Red Jacket). . . . Being arrived, the first matter unusual that presented itself were the elders of the women seated near the chiefs.” Red Jacket gave their plea for peace.' <sup id="cite_ref-918" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-918">[918]</a></sup> 'If the women could not or would not always prevent war they often caused it to stop. At a conference at Niagara in 1767, the commissary “was informed that the old women of the Sinecas had stopt their young men from going to war.” They are credited with more power of this kind than they probably had, but they always claimed a share in public affairs. At a council in Albany in 1788, Good Peter, an Oneida chief, after speaking for the men, delivered the women's message. “You have heard our voice; we now entreat [Page 87] you to open your ears and hear a speech from our sisters, the governesses.' <sup id="cite_ref-919" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-919">[919]</a></sup> Women had their own councils: 'Closely allied with the Council of Elders was the women's council who brought the matters up before the council. Lafitau maintained: The women are always the first who should deliberate according to their principles on private or community matters. They hold their councils apart, and as a result of their decisions advise the chiefs on matters on the mat. (1724, 1:477) Separate from both the women's and elder's councils was the warriors' council which sought to influence authority decisions of the council of elders because they were the soldiers or ‘police’ of the village. Their internal affairs idsally were limited to military raids, games, [Page 25] and carrying out the military policy of the council of elders or League Council. In addition to the various councils, asseciations of men and women possibly existed for curing. Lafitau noted “I have been told that they have several sorts of private associations like fraternities” (Ibdd.:476). Fenton speculated that these associations were procursers of the “medicine societies” (Lafitau, 1724, 1:476). However, these associations seem to be the actual medicine societies and as such would have been village groups that criss-cross lineage, clan and moiety statuses.' <sup id="cite_ref-920" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-920">[920]</a></sup> It appears that the 17th century saw at least one female ambassador: 'One woman of rank has been mentioned, and in the Relation for 1656 another several times appears. Teotonharason was an Onondaga woman who went with the ambassadors to Quebec, and was highly esteemed for her nobleness and wealth. She may have been the one mentioned in the Relation for 1671. “It was one of these principal persons who formerly first brought the Iroquois of Onondaga, and then the other nations, to make peace with the French. She descended to Quebec for this purpose, accompanied by some of her slaves.” The influence of the Iroquois women was of great use to the missionaries. In the Relation for 1657 we read, “The women having much authority among these people, their virtue produces as much fruit as anything else, and their example finds as many more imitators.”' <sup id="cite_ref-921" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-921">[921]</a></sup> But the sources disagree about just how powerful women were: 'Lafitau said, “There is nothing more real than this superiority of the women. It is they who constitute the tribe, keep up the genealogical tree and the order of inheritance, and perpetuate the family. They possess all real authority; own the land and the fields, and their harvests; they are the soul of all councils, the arbiters of peace and war; they have care of the public treasury; slaves are given to them; they arrange marriages; the children belong to them, and to them and their blood is confined the line of descent and the order of inheritance.” He believed that the council simply aided women in matters in which it was not becoming for them to act.'  <sup id="cite_ref-922" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-922">[922]</a></sup> 'Charlevoix expresses a much more moderate opinion. In speaking of the right of the Huron women to name counsellors, who were sometimes women, he adds, “The women have the chief authority amongst all the nations of the Huron language, if we except the Iroquois canton of Oneida, in which it is in both sexes alternately. But if this be their lawful constitution, their practice is seldom agreeable to it. In fact, the men never tell the women anything they would have to be kept secret; and rarely any affair of consequence is communicated to them, though all is done in their name, and the chiefs are no more than their lieutenants.” He mentioned an instance to show “that the real authority of the women is very small. I have been assured, however, that they always deliberate first on whatever is proposed in council, and that they afterwards give the result of this to the chiefs, who report it as a matter of form. On some occasions the women have an orator, who speaks in their name, or rather acts as their interpreter.”' <sup id="cite_ref-923" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-923">[923]</a></sup> While women were prominent and not subjected to men, the data point to gender complementarity rather than gender equality. As women could not hold chiefly titles, wer have decided to code for legal and ideological differentiation of the sexes, despite the importance of women in Iroquois society.</dd>

Among the Cayuga, Onondaga, Seneca and Tuscarora the matrisibs were further organized into moieties. Among the Mohawk and the Oneida no moiety division was recognized. Descent was matrilineal. In modern times, the stress placed on patrilineal inheritance by Canadian authorities has undermined the traditional matrilineal system.' <sup id="cite_ref-924" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-924">[924]</a></sup> 'Traditional kinship terminology followed the Iroquoian pattern. In one's own and the first ascending and descending generations parallel relatives were classed with one's lineal relatives and cross relatives were referred to separately.' <sup id="cite_ref-925" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-925">[925]</a></sup> 'Roles established by age, classificatory kinhip position determined the makeup of kinship groupings. A lineage was compesed of the male and female descendants of a woman, the descendants of her fomale descendants and so on (Goldenweiser, 1913:467). Lineage offices such as chiefa, deputy chiefs, runners and keepers of secret medicine were invested natrilineally, as were the six ceremonial clan officers. Individuals could not marry within one's own lineage or one's father's matrilineage. This exegamous principle was extended to one's own tribe's clan members who were fictive brothers and sistors.' <sup id="cite_ref-926" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-926">[926]</a></sup> Matrilineal family groups formed the basic social unit: 'The basic economic unit consisted of matrilineally extended family groups of women, their spouses, and their children. Each extended family group occupied a longhouse within which individual nuclear families occupied designated sections and shared common hearths. Each longhouse was under the control and direction of the elder women in the extended family group.' <sup id="cite_ref-927" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-927">[927]</a></sup> Polygyny had been practiced in the past according to some sources, but was abandoned in the 18th century: 'At one time marriages were a matter of individual choice, however, in the historic period the matrilineage and particularly the mother played an increasingly important role in the arrangement of marriages. Post-marital residence was matrilocal. Polygyny was practiced, but by the late eighteenth century had entirely disappeared. Divorce was possible and when it occurred the mother retained full control over her children.' <sup id="cite_ref-928" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-928">[928]</a></sup> 'I do not now remember any instance of polygamy among the Iroquois, though it was common among other races. Marriages could be dissolved at pleasure as they yet are, but in early days this seems to have been rarely done. Informal as Indian marriages usually were, there were some points more definitely observed by the Iroquois. Among the Mohawks Gakwarinna was the portion of the woman who gets married; Gakwarinnionton the ceremony of carrying her into the cabin at this time. For the time being, at least, she then had reserved rights. The union was arranged by mutual friends, and wife and husband lodged together at his home. During the day they were with their respective relatives, the husband not daring to enter his wife's cabin until she had children. At Onondaga, in 1657, it was observed that for the time being “the only community of goods there is between the one and the other is that the husband gives all the fruits of the chase to his wife, who renders him some services in recompense, and is obliged to cultivate his fields and make his harvest.”' <sup id="cite_ref-929" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-929">[929]</a></sup> Morgan claims that polygamy was forbidden, but divorce was possible, at least in principle:  'In intimate connection with the subject of marriage, is that of divorce. Polygamy was forbidden among the Iroquois, and never became a practice; (99) but the right to put away the wife, or of voluntary separation, was allowed to all. (100) The mothers of the married pair were responsible for their concord and harmony. If differences arose between them, it became their duty to effect a reconciliation, and by advice and counsel, to guard against a repetition of the difficulty. But if disturbances continued to follow reconciliations, and their dispositions were found to be too incongruous for domestic peace, a separation followed, either by mutual consent or the absolute refusal of one of the parties longer to recognize the marriage relation. As such a rupture in ancient times was regarded as discreditable to the parties, and brought them under [Page 316] the pressure of public censure, they were then unfrequent. In later days, however, the inviolability of the nuptial contract was less sacredly regarded, and the most frivolous reasons, or the caprice of the moment, were sufficient for breaking the marriage tie.' <sup id="cite_ref-930" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-930">[930]</a></sup> Clans were exogamous, and marriages also served to establish political alliances: 'Marriage was arranged by parents who gave seriousconsideration to the rules of clan exogamy as well as tothe social prestige and economic conditions of the families [Page [p.486]] oncerned. Married couples were expected to staytogether for life; divorce and infidelity, being seriousoffenses against the church, led to expulsion and socialostracism.' <sup id="cite_ref-931" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-931">[931]</a></sup> 'Men and women of the same clan might not marry, all these being esteemed near relations. For a long time clan burial prevailed, so that husband and wife were not interred together but in the grounds of their respective clans. The children were of the mother's clan and nation. Thus the noted Logan was a Cayuga because his mother was one, though his father was a distinguished Oneida chief. This feature of Iroquois life is a great bar to the division of their lands in severalty. Marriage into another clan or nation might bring personal advantages to a man if he desired them. Two of the leading framers of the Iroquois League were reputed Onondagas by birth, but Dekanawidah or his father and Hiawatha married Mohawk wives and became chiefs of that nation. In 1637 a young Seneca was displeased because his people had made peace with the Hurons. He“married among the Onondagas, in order always to have liberty to bear arms against them.”' <sup id="cite_ref-932" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-932">[932]</a></sup> 'The husband and wife were never of the same tribe, as has been elsewhere more fully explained; and the children were of the tribe of their mother. No right in the father to the custody of their persons, or to their nurture, was recognized. As, after separation, he gave himself no farther trouble concerning them, nor interested himself in their future welfare, they became estranged as well as separated. Parental affection was much weaker, as is usually the fact, on the part of the father than on that of the mother. The Indian father seldom caressed his children, or by any outward acts manifested the least solicitude for their welfare; but when his sons grew up to maturity, he became more attached to them, making them his companions in the hunt and upon the war-path. The care of their infancy and childhood was intrusted to the watchful affection of the mother alone.' <sup id="cite_ref-933" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-933">[933]</a></sup> 'Men might change their nationality in order to build up a nation or clan. This is sometimes done now by both men and women. In the Relation for 1645 it appears that nearly all the Oneida men were [Page 85] at one time slain by the Hurons. The Oneidas had made peace with the Mohawks, and sent to them “for some men to be married to the girls and women who had remained without husbands, that the nation should not perish. This is why the Iroquois name that village their child.”' <sup id="cite_ref-934" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-934">[934]</a></sup> Marriage ceremonies integrated the respective matrilineages: 'The Iroquois marriage ceremony was an alliance that entailed two elemontary economic relations. At the level of village integration, the ceremony established an association relationship in which the village corporate unit, the women's mutual aid society, cooperated with the individual lineages in an economic endeaver of procuring wood for the husband's lineage, in return for a feast given by the wife's lineage tormed the marriage wood ceremony (Lafitau, 1724, 1:576-577). The ceremony was significant because the women's mutual aid society, the main agricultural cooporative group, cooperated to advance the individual matrilineage's goals of establishing an alliance.' <sup id="cite_ref-935" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-935">[935]</a></sup> 'The second economic relationship entailed in a marriage ceromony [Page 13] was an exchange of goods and services between matrilineages. In return for the daughter-in-law's agricultural and wood gathering services, the husband contributed to his wife's lineage his entire first year's hunt, and in subsequent years, a fair share of his hunt (Lafitau, 1724, 2). Thus, the marriage ceremony established symbelic relations between groups that did the labor and these who controlled the natural resources to increase production.' <sup id="cite_ref-936" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-936">[936]</a></sup> 'Another significant integration was feasting. Lafitau (1724, 2) maintained that the village must threw a feast to entice warriers to clear the fields, and that individuals threw feasts to increase prestige. Feasts occured after calondar rituals, burials, and ceremonies honering the dead. Indeed, the support of the women's aid society was accomplished by a feast after the marriage wood ceremony. Feasting was a redistributive mechanism that cemented productive relations, as well as an integral part of the prestige and belief system, and as such will be examined in a subsequent section. In recapitulation, two complomentary principles deminated Iroquois productive organization; they were alliance and exchange. Within the village economy existed ceremonies which, at crucial times, such as the Mid-winter feast and harvest, united the labor force in accordance with sexual productive roles. At another level of organization, individual matrilineages through marriage alliances established produce and service exchanges in order to increase their productivity.' <sup id="cite_ref-937" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-937">[937]</a></sup> Morgan writes that marriages were typically arranged by the matrilineage: 'In this connection, the marriage customs of the Iroquois naturally suggest themselves. They exhibit novel, if not distinctive features. Marriage was not founded upon the affections, which constitute the only legitimate basis of this relation in civilized society, but was regulated exclusively as a matter of physical necessity. It was not even a contract between the parties to be married, but substantially between their mothers, acting oftentimes under the suggestions of the matrons and wise-men of the tribes to which the parties respectively belonged. In a general sense, therefore, the subject of marriage was under the supervision of the older members of each tribe; but practically, it was under maternal control. With the improvement and elevation of the race, changes were gradually introduced in relation to the marriageable age, and the disparity of age between the sexes. In ancient times, the young warrior was always [Page 312] united to a woman several years his senior, on the supposition that he needed a companion experienced in the affairs of life. The period was also deferred on his part until twenty-five that he might first become inured to the hardships of the war-path and of the chase, before his freedom was curtailed and his responsibilities were increased by the cares of a family, light as these cares seem to have been under their social system. Thus, it often happened that the young warrior at twenty-five was married to a woman of forty, and oftentimes a widow; while the widower at sixty was joined to the maiden at twenty. But these were their primitive customs; the ages of the parties afterwards drew nearer to an equality, and the marriageable age was, in time reduced to twenty, and even below it.' <sup id="cite_ref-938" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-938">[938]</a></sup> 'When the mother considered her son of a suitable age for marriage, she looked about her for a maiden, who, from report or acquaintance, she judged would accord with him in disposition and temperament. A negotiation between the mothers ensued, and a conclusion was speedily reached. Sometimes the near relatives and the elderly persons of the tribes to which each belonged were consulted; but their opinions were of no avail, independently of the wishes of the mothers themselves. Not the least singular feature of the transaction was the entire ignorance in which the parties remained of the pending negotiation; the first intimation they received being the announcement of their marriage, without, perhaps, ever having known or seen each other. Remonstrance or objection on their part was never attempted; they received each other as the gift of their parents. As obedience to [Page 313] them in all their requirements was inculcated as a paramount duty, and disobedience was followed by disownment, the operative force of custom, in addition to these motives, was sufficient to secure acquiescence. The Indian father never troubled himself concerning the marriage of his children. To interfere would have been an invasion of female immunities; and these, whatever they were, were as sacredly regarded by him, as he was inflexible in enforcing respect for his own.' <sup id="cite_ref-939" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-939">[939]</a></sup> 'When the fact of marriage had been communicated to the parties, a simple ceremonial completed the transaction. On the day following the announcement, the maiden was conducted by her mother, accompanied by a few female friends, to the home of her intended husband. She carried in her hand a few cakes of unleavened corn bread, which she presented on entering the house, to her mother-in-law, as an earnest of her usefulness and of her skill in the domestic arts. After receiving it, the mother of the young warrior returned a present of venison, or other fruit of the chase, to the mother of the bride, as an earnest of his ability to provide for his household. This exchange of presents ratified and concluded the contract, which bound the new pair together in the marriage relation. Thus simple was the formation of the nuptial bond among our primitive inhabitants.' <sup id="cite_ref-940" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-940">[940]</a></sup> Wives and children had obligations to their husband's/father's matrilineage: 'The Iroquois traced descent through the female line of lineage “Ohwatjira”. A man's children belonged to his wife's ledge not his own. However, the wife and her lineage had affinial obligations to her husband and his lineage. First, the son had to supply his “akateni”, i.e., [Page 18] father's maternal kinsmen's lineage, with suitable captives to replace their dead members. Second, the son had to support his akatoni in blood vendettas. Third, the matron of one's akatoni lineage could control the war activities of the “brothers sons” by either demanding that a raid take place or by prohibiting one. The akatoni lineage had reoiprecal obligations to the “Ohwatjira”, mother's kinsmen. Fourth, the akatoni had to perform the burial service and prepare the body of the “wives”, “sons” or “daughters” of other lineages at the common burial, Feast of the Dead and General Feast of the Dead. Fifth, limited rules of exogamy applied to one's closest akatoni (Lafitau, 1724, 1:559). Sixth, the husband had reciprecal duties in the alliance as he supplied his wife's lineage with produce. Lafitau (1724, 1:580) observed that during the first year of marriage all the husband's hunt went to his wife's household.' <sup id="cite_ref-941" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-941">[941]</a></sup> 'Although the main characteristics of the roles of the spouses entailed both equality and devetion, the alliance was brittle. Lafitau (1724, 1:581) maintained that diverce was frequent. A century lator, Jameson (1825) argued: Diverces are common and for trivial reasons. The husband may abandon the wife or the wife may abandon the husband at will. (Fenton, 1969:125). Despite the fact that diverce ruptured the alliance, certain akatoni [Page 21] obligations still remained such as procuring captives, exogamy and support in vendettas (Basehart, 1952:42).' <sup id="cite_ref-942" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-942">[942]</a></sup> 'A wife had many obligations to the husband's maternal household such as securing firewood and cultivating their gardon. In doing these tasks she was under her mother-in-law's authority. Iroquois residence was shifting matrilecal to patrilocal type, the spouse making periodic visits to the different households (J.R., 43:265). Consequently, when the wife was in her husband's ledge she was subservient to his mother. The husband was subservient to his mother-in-law when in her household. He was not permitted even to speak to his wife's parents until the birth of his first child. The mother-in-law regulated the husband's war efforts. She could force him into blood vendettas or stop his raiding. As stated previously, Wallace (1966) argued that mothers sometimes attempted to force divorces by turning their daughters against their husbands.' <sup id="cite_ref-943" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-943">[943]</a></sup> Taboos also applied to intermarriage between certain tribes: 'All the institutions of the Iroquois have regard to the division of the people into tribes. (54) Originally with reference to marriage, the Wolf, Bear, Beaver, and Turtle tribes, being brothers to each other, were not allowed to intermarry. The four opposite tribes, being also brothers to each other, were likewise prohibited from intermarrying. Either of the first four tribes, however, could intermarry with either of the last four, the relation between them being that of cousins. Thus Hawk could intermarry with Bear or Beaver, Heron with Turtle; but not Beaver and Turtle, nor Deer and Deer. Whoever violated these laws of marriage incurred the deepest detestation and disgrace. In process of time, however, the rigor of the system was relaxed, until finally the prohibition was confined to the tribe of the individual, which, among the residue of the Iroquois, is still religiously observed. They can now marry into any tribe but their own. Under the original as well as modern regulation, the husband and wife were of different tribes. The children always followed the tribe of the mother.' <sup id="cite_ref-944" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-944">[944]</a></sup> But according to Campisi, intraclan marriages also occurred: 'Much of the traditional Oneida kinship system remainedin operation in Canada during the nineteenthcentury. The strongest ties existed between a mother and her daughter; of next importance were those with grandparents,particularly those on the mother's side. Whileband membership was traced bilaterally to an ancestorwho had contributed to the purchase of land, membershipin clans was determined through the mother's side.Marriages were arranged by the parents, usually thefather of the bridegroom. Intraclan marriages were common,and although subject to criticism, no sanctions werebrought to bear on the couples. It was commonlybelieved that intraclan marriages resulted in weak, deformed,or mentally deficient offspring. However, thetendency for intraclan marriage was a natural outgrowthof the community attitude against marrying out and the relatively small Oneida population from which to selectmates (Ricciardelli 1966:186-189).' <sup id="cite_ref-945" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-945">[945]</a></sup> We have assumed that monogamy was the norm. We have to ascertain how common polygyny was prior to its disappearance: whether it was widespread or only limited to chiefs and other prominent figures. Morgan's comments on the matter are cryptic and influenced by Victorian theorizing, so their usefulness may be limited: 'Syndyasmian Marriage (Greek Term). This was the condition of the Iroquois and of most of the tribes of North America at the time of the discovery. It formed a transition stage between the Punaluan and Monogamian families, and to the outward observer was a pairing dissoluble at the will of either party, and even when not dissolved importing no very rigid conjugal fidelity. If Morgan's views, as to the history of marriage, are correct, this infidelity was not properly so called, but was merely a survival of the Punaluan form of marriage. In the Syndyasmian stage, then, each man had one chief wife and each woman one chief husband, but each was still espoused to the entire group. Some early observers report this state of affairs as simple licentiousness, others as polygamy or polyandry.' <sup id="cite_ref-946" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-946">[946]</a></sup> 'The reminiscence of group marriage, no doubt, had its share in the interest and control of the clan in the marriage of its members. When a girl took a husband, it was admitting a new member to the marriage group.' <sup id="cite_ref-947" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-947">[947]</a></sup> 'From Syndyasmian marriage the road branches, the settled agricultural peoples moving usually towards monogamy, the wandering tribes towards the patriarchal state and its concomitant polygamy. Marriage, to the modern mind, connotes one of these forms. It was once commonly supposed that polygamy was the earlier form, but the researches of Morgan and others would mark it as simply a late offshoot from the main stem which ends in Monogamy.' <sup id="cite_ref-948" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-948">[948]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Ideology reinforces prosociality ♣ present ♥</b>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>♠ charity ♣ absent ♥</b> Mutual aid societies were present on the village level: 'The members of matrisibs cooperated in economic activities and were obligated to avenge the death or injury of any other member. Moieties had reciprocal and complementary ceremonial functions and competed against one another in games. Matrisibs cut across tribal boundaries so that members were found in each tribe and village and often within each longhouse.' <sup id="cite_ref-949" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-949">[949]</a></sup> 'The Iroquois organized various village-wide mutual aid societies. First, a village-wide warrior group cleared the fields and built the palisades (Lafitau, 1724, 2:3). Second, the males had a communal hunt previous to the major festivals. This hunt was supervised by ceremonial officials. Jessie Cornplanter revealed: The communal hunt is entirely of a different nature from the individual hunt. It occurs only when ceremonies, such as Mid-Winter are about to begin. Then the Faith Keepers go, as they say, ‘hunting all abreast’, meaning sert of a drive. (Quain, 1961: 252, fn. 2). Third, a women's mutual aid society gathered in village-wide groups in order to prepare the ground, sew the soil, harvest the produce and gather the wood. Internal order was maintained by older females who supervised the activities of the younger women (Quain, 1961:258). Mary Jamison described some of the activities of the women's aid society: In order to expedite their business and at the same time enjoy each other's company, they all work together in one field or at whatever job they may have at hand. In the spring they chose an old active squaw to be their driver and everseer when at labor, and they consider themselves bound to obey her. When the time for planting arrives and the sail is prepared, the squaws are assembled in the morning and conducted into a field where each plants one row. They then go into the next and plant one acress, and so on until they have gone through the tribe. If any remains to be planted they again commence where they did at first (in the same field) and so keep on until the whole is completed. By this rule they perform their labor of every kind and every jealousy of one having done more or less than another is effectively avoided. (Seaver, 1918: 175). At harvest time the men did not join the women of the mutual aid society in the villagewide effort to harvest the crop. However, men participated in husking (Parker, 1968:31).' <sup id="cite_ref-950" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-950">[950]</a></sup> In addition, allied matrilineages exchanged produce and services: 'Another significant integration was feasting. Lafitau (1724, 2) maintained that the village must threw a feast to entice warriers to clear the fields, and that individuals threw feasts to increase prestige. Feasts occured after calondar rituals, burials, and ceremonies honering the dead. Indeed, the support of the women's aid society was accomplished by a feast after the marriage wood ceremony. Feasting was a redistributive mechanism that cemented productive relations, as well as an integral part of the prestige and belief system, and as such will be examined in a subsequent section. In recapitulation, two complomentary principles deminated Iroquois productive organization; they were alliance and exchange. Within the village economy existed ceremonies which, at crucial times, such as the Mid-winter feast and harvest, united the labor force in accordance with sexual productive roles. At another level of organization, individual matrilineages through marriage alliances established produce and service exchanges in order to increase their productivity.' <sup id="cite_ref-951" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-951">[951]</a></sup> However, this does not seem to constitute 'charity'.</dd>

<dd><b>♠ communal dining ♣ present ♥</b> Feasting was an important integrating mechanism: 'Another significant integration was feasting. Lafitau (1724, 2) maintained that the village must threw a feast to entice warriers to clear the fields, and that individuals threw feasts to increase prestige. Feasts occured after calondar rituals, burials, and ceremonies honering the dead. Indeed, the support of the women's aid society was accomplished by a feast after the marriage wood ceremony. Feasting was a redistributive mechanism that cemented productive relations, as well as an integral part of the prestige and belief system, and as such will be examined in a subsequent section. In recapitulation, two complomentary principles deminated Iroquois productive organization; they were alliance and exchange.

The Maple Dance: 'This was the first festival of the spring. It was usually called the Maple Dance. The primary idea of this ceremonial was to return thanks to the maple itself; but at the same time they rendered their thanks to the Great Spirit for the gift of the maple. It lasted but one day. When the sap began to flow, the keepers of the faith announced the time and place for commemorating the recurrence of this event, and summoned the people to assemble for that purpose. Some days before the time appointed for the festival, the people assembled for the mutual confession of their sins, both as an act of religious duty, and as a preparation for the council. This act preceded all the festivals; but it was more general and thorough at the three last than at the three first, as they were deemed more important, and continued for a greater length of time. This council, Sa-nun-dät-ha-wä[unknown] -ta, literally “a meeting for repentance,” was opened by one of the keepers of the faith, with an address upon the propriety and importance of acknowledging their evil deeds, to strengthen their minds against future temptations. He then took the string of white wampum in his hand, and set the example by a confession of his own faults; after which he handed the string to the one nearest to him, who received it, made his confession in like manner, and passed it to another. In this way the wampum went around from hand to hand; and those who had confessions to make stated wherein they had done wrong, and promised to do better in [Page 181] the future. Old and young, men, women, and even children all united in this public acknowledgment of their faults, and joined in the common resolution of amendment. On some occasions the string of wampum was placed in the centre of the room, and each one advanced in turn to perform the duty, as the inclination seized him. A confession and promise without holding the wampum would be of no avail. It was the wampum which recorded their words, and gave their pledge of sincerity. The object of the confession was future amendment. The Iroquois appear to have had no idea either of the atonement or of the forgiveness of sins. Meritorious acts neutralized evil deeds, but neither the one nor the other, when done, could be recalled, or changed, or obliterated.' <sup id="cite_ref-953" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-953">[953]</a></sup> 'The celebration of this festival was not limited to one particular place, but it was observed in all the villages of the several nations of the League, which were too remote to unite around the same council-fire. At the time appointed, the people gathered from the subjacent districts, some to offer religious admonitions, some prepared for the dance, others for the games, and still others for the enjoyment of the feast. It was one of their festive days, awakening the eagerness of expectation in the minds of all. On the morning of the day, the matrons, to whom the duty appertained, commenced the preparation of the customary feast for the people, which was as sumptaous as the season and the means of the hunter life would afford. Towards meridian, the out-door sports and games, which were common to such occasions, were suspended, and the people assembled in council. An opening speech was [Page 182] then delivered, by one of the keepers of the faith. The following, made at the opening of one of these councils among the Senecas, is in the usual form, and will illustrate their general chalacter:--' <sup id="cite_ref-954" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-954">[954]</a></sup> '“Friends and Relatives: -- The sun, the ruler of the day, is high in his path, and we must hasten to do our duty. We are assembled to observe an ancient custom. It is an institution handed down to us by our forefathers. It was given to them by the Great Spirit. He has ever required of his people to return thanks to him for all blessings received. We have always endeavored to live faithful to this wise command. “Friends and Relatives, continue to listen: -- It is to perform this duty that we are this day gathered. The season when the maple tree yields its sweet waters has again returned. We are all thankful that it is so. We therefore expect all of you to join in our general thanksgiving to the maple. We also expect you to join in a thanksgiving to the Great Spirit, who has wisely made this tree for the good of man. We hope and expect that order and harmony will prevail. “Friends and Relatives: -- We are gratified to see so many here, and we thank you all that you have thought well of this matter. We thank the Great Spirit, that he has been kind to so many of us, in sparing our lives to participate again in the festivities of this season. Na-bo[unknown] .” Other speeches often followed, which were in the nature of exhortations to duty. These occasions were seized upon by their moral teachers, to inculcate anew the precepts of their faith, and to offer admonitions for their spiritual guidance. One of the keepers of [Page 183] the faith, addressing the people at such a time, would inculcate the virtues which became a warrior, and unfold the duties which were incumbent upon them as members of one common brotherhood. The duty of living in harmony and peace, of avoiding evil speaking, of kindness to the orphan, of charity to the needy, and of hospitality to all, would be among the prominent topics brought under consideration. He would remind them that the Great Spirit noticed and rewarded good acts, and that those who hoped for success in the affairs of life, should be ready to do them whenever occasion offered; that those who had done wrong should not be treated harshly; that enmities were not to be contracted, lest a spirit of revenge should be awakened, which would never sleep; and finally, that those who pursued the right path would never fall into trouble.' <sup id="cite_ref-955" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-955">[955]</a></sup> 'When these speeches and exhortations were concluded, the dance, which was a prominent feature of their religious festivals, was announced. It is proper here to observe, that dancing was regarded by the Iroquois as an appropriate mode of worship. They regarded the dance as a perpetual outward ceremonial of thanksgiving to the Great Spirit. A belief prevailed among them that the custom was of divine origin. “The Great Spirit knew the Indian could not live without some amusement, therefore he originated the idea of dancing, which he gave to them.” 1 The dance set apart in a peculiar manner for the worship of the Great Spirit, at their festivals, was one of their [Page [facing p. 184]] [Page 184] own invention; and the most spirited, graceful and beautiful in their list. It is known as the Great Feather Dance ( O-sto-weh[unknown] -go-wä ). It was performed by a select band, in full costume, and was reserved exclusively for religious councils and for great occasions. It lasted about an hour, never failing to arouse a deep spirit of enthusiastic excitement. Before the band came in, one of the keepers of the faith made a brief speech, explanatory of its origin, nature and objects; in which the popular belief was interwoven, that this dance would be enjoyed by the faithful in the future life, in the realm of the Great Spirit, to whose worship it was especially consecrated.' <sup id="cite_ref-956" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-956">[956]</a></sup> 'After the conclusion of this dance others followed, in which all participated. Before they were ended, the usual thanksgiving address to the Great Spirit, with the burning of tobacco, was made. In ancient times the Maple festival was terminated with these dances. One of the keepers of the faith made a closing speech, after which the people partook of the feast, and separated for their respective homes. There is a popular belief among the Iroquois that the early part of the day is dedicated to the Great Spirit, and the after part to the spirits of the dead; consequently their religious services should properly be concluded at meridian. They still retain the theory, and to this day religious discourses are seldom continued after noon; but in practice it was found impossible, from the tardiness of the people in assembling, to conclude the ceremonies of the festival before twilight. A further innovation was made many years ago by [Page 185] devoting the evenings of these festive days to dancing, for the entertainment of guests from other villages or nations, who chanced to be with them. This became, in time, the universal custom, and they now continue the practice for their own amusement. These evening entertainments, however, in strictness, form no part of the festival, although apparently it is one proceeding from the opening of the council until late at night, when the entertainment is ended. A distinction should constantly be held in view, between their proper religious exercises, and their amusements, and also between the ancient mode of celebrating these festivals, and the modern. The regular religious ceremonies at the Maple festival consisted of the opening discourse by one of the keepers of the faith, the exhortations of others, the Feather dance, the thanksgiving address to the Great Spirit, with the incense of tobacco, two or three other dances, the closing speech, and the feast in common.' <sup id="cite_ref-957" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-957">[957]</a></sup> 'In ancient times these ceremonies were concluded at meridian, but in modern times at twilight. Formerly all the exercises at these festivals were of a strictly religious character, except certain games which were common to these occasions. But in later times other dances have been added, and also an evening entertainment devoted exclusively to dancing. There were likewise certain games of chance, sports, and athletic games, common to all these festivals, which yet formed no part of their religious ceremonies. They were merely outside diversions for the people. Still the Maple festival, as celebrated at the present day among the descendants of the ancient Iroquois, is [Page 186] the same, in its essential features, as at the period of its institution.' <sup id="cite_ref-958" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-958">[958]</a></sup> The planting season festival: 'This word signifies “the planting season.” When this time arrived another festival was held to celebrate the event. It continued but one day. In its observances there was nothing to distinguish it very materially from the Maple festival. A description is therefore unnecessary, except to point out some peculiarities. The object of this festival was two-fold: to render thanks to the Great Spirit for the return of the planting season, and to invoke his blessing upon the seed which they had committed to the earth, that it might yield an abundant harvest. The Indian had no Sabbath, no sacred writings to furnish him an inexhaustible fountain of instruction; but his gratitude was awakened by every returning manifestation of divine goodness. When nature had reclothed herself in the vestments of spring, and the teeming earth invited him to commit the seeds to her bosom, he recognized in the event the watchful kindness of the Great Spirit. There is something eminently spiritual and beautiful in this Indian conception of the natural periods of worship. Seizing upon the moment when the most conspicuous evidences of the protecting care of the Deity were before him, he acknowledged both his existence and his beneficence, [Page 187] and manifested, at the same time, his gratitude and devotion, by those simple rites which the piety of his heart suggested.' <sup id="cite_ref-959" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-959">[959]</a></sup> 'At the time appointed by the keepers of the faith, the people assembled to observe the day. After the speeches were over, the Feather and other dances were performed, as at the Maple festival. In ancient times, the thanksgiving address, or prayer to the Great Spirit, with the burning of tobacco, was confined to the last three, or the principal festivals; but in later days such a prayer was offered generally at the first three also. As elsewhere observed, when the Iroquois returned thanks to the various objects in nature which ministered to their wants, or when they acknowledged to each other their thankfulness to the Great Spirit, or to the lesser Spirits, they never burned tobacco. In these cases, their thanks were returned to the trees and plants and elements direct, to do which, according to their theology, did not require the use of incense, while, as to the spiritual world, they merely avowed to each other that they returned their thanks. But when they offered a prayer, or called upon the Great Spirit, or his Invisible Aids, they were obliged to use the ascending smoke to put themselves in communication with the spiritual world. This address occurred at no particular stage in the ceremonies of the day. The keepers of the faith having appointed one of their number to perform this duty, the person designated selected a suitable moment for its delivery. Advancing to the fire prepared for the purpose, he called the attention of the people by an exclamation, which was the known precursor of [Page 188] this address. Having sprinkled a few leaves of Indian tobacco upon the fire, he addressed Hä-wen-ne[unknown] -yu, as the smoke ascended. The ollowing, delivered at a Planting festival among the Senecas, will illustrate the general character of these prayers or thanksgiving addresses:--' <sup id="cite_ref-960" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-960">[960]</a></sup> '“Great Spirit, who dwellest alone, listen now to the words of thy people here assembled. The smoke of our offering arises. Give kind attention to our words, as they arise to thee in the smoke. We thank thee for this return of the planting season. Give to us a good season, that our crops may be plentiful. “Continue to listen, for the smoke yet arises. (Throwing on tobacco.) Preserve us from all pestilential diseases. Give strength to us all that we may not fall. Preserve our old men among us, and protect the young. Help us to celebrate with feeling the ceremonies of this season. Guide the minds of thy people, that they may remember thee in all their actions. Na-bo[unknown] . ” There was nothing further to distinguish this festival from the former. If, after the planting season, a drought should come upon the land, threatening a failure of the harvest, a special council was frequently called, to invoke He[unknown] -no, the Thunderer, to send rain upon the earth. Before the time appointed for this council, the people assembled, as before other festivals, for mutual confession. They feared, as they expressed it, “that some of their number had done some great wrong, for which the Great Spirit was angry with them, and withheld the rain as a merited punishment.” After this special council was opened in the usual form, the Thanksgiving [Page 189] dance, and the Ah-d[unknown] -web, hereafter to be described, were introduced, which were supposed to be peculiarly acceptable to He[unknown] -no. At a proper time, in the progress of these ceremonies, the keeper of the faith, who had been appointed as usual, advanced to the fire, and having laid on the leaves of tobacco, and gained the attention of the people, he made the following invocation of the Thunderer, as the incense ascended:--' <sup id="cite_ref-961" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-961">[961]</a></sup> '“ He[unknown] -no, our Grandfather, listen now to the words of thy grandchildren. We feel grieved. Our minds are sorely troubled. We fear Our Supporters will fail, and bring famine upon us. We ask our Grandfather that he may come, and give us rain, that the earth may not dry up, and refuse to produce for our support. Thy grandchildren all send their salutations to their grandfather, He[unknown] -no. ” Then taking another handful of tobacco, and placing it upon the fire, he changed the address to Hä-wen-ne[unknown] -yu: -- “Great Spirit: listen to the words of thy suffering children. They come to thee with pure minds. If they have done wrong, they have confessed, and turned their minds, (at the same time holding up the string of white wampum with which the confession was recorded.) Be kind to us. Hear our grievances, and supply our wants. Direct that He[unknown] -no may come, and give us rain, that Our Supporters may not fail us, and bring famine to our homes. Na-bo[unknown] . ” After concluding the dance the assembly was dismissed.' <sup id="cite_ref-962" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-962">[962]</a></sup> The Strawberry festival: 'In the progress of the seasons, next came the Strawberry, the first fruit of the earth. The Iroquois [Page [facing p. 190]] [Page 190] seized upon this spontaneous gift of nature for their sustenance as another suitable occasion for a thanksgiving festival. By such ceremonials they habituated their minds to a recognition of the providential care of Hä-wen-ne[unknown] -yu; cultivating, at the same time, a grateful spirit for the constant return of his gifts. The observances at this festival were the same as those at the Maple, with a sufficient variation of terms to designate the particular occasion. It was concluded with a feast of strawberries. The berries were prepared with maple sugar, in capacious bark trays, in the form of a jelly; and in this condition the people feasted upon this great luxury of nature.' <sup id="cite_ref-963" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-963">[963]</a></sup> 'The ripening of the Whortleberry was often made the occasion of another festival. It was in all respects like the last, the only difference consisting in the fact, that the former was an acknowledgment for the first fruit of plants, and the latter for the first fruit of trees.' <sup id="cite_ref-964" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-964">[964]</a></sup> The Green Corn festival: 'The word from which this takes its name signifies “a feast.” It continued four days, the proceedings of each being different in most particulars, but each one terminating with a feast. When the green corn became fit for use, the season of plenty with the Indian had emphatically arrived. They made it another occasion of general thanksgiving to the Great Spirit, and of feasting and rejoicing among themselves. Corn has ever been the staple article-of consumption among the Iroquois. They cultivated this plant, and also the bean and the [Page [facing p. 191]] [Page 191] squash, before the formation of the League. From the most remote period to which tradition reaches, the knowledge of the cultivation and use of these plants has been handed down among them. 1 They raised sufficient quantities of each to supply their utmost wants, preparing them for food in a great variety of ways, and making them at least the basis of their sustenance. (19) In their own mode of expressing the idea, these plants are mentioned together, under the figurative name of “Our Life,” or “Our Supporters.” It cannot, therefore, be affirmed with correctness, that the Indian subsisted principally by the chase. (84) After the formation of the League, they resided in permanent villages, and within certain well-defined territorial limits. The fruits of the chase then became a secondary, although a necessary means of subsistence.' <sup id="cite_ref-965" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-965">[965]</a></sup> 'On the first day of this festival, after the introductory speeches had been made, the Feather dance, the thanksgiving address, with the burning of tobacco, [Page 192] and three or four other dances, made up the principal religious exercises. This address was introduced in the midst of one of the dances which succeeded the first. One more specimen of these brief prayers of the Iroquois, as made by the Senecas, will be furnished. Having placed the leaves of tobacco on the fire, as usual, the keeper of the faith thus addressed Hä-wen-ne[unknown] -yu: --' <sup id="cite_ref-966" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-966">[966]</a></sup> '“Great Spirit in heaven, listen to our words. We have assembled to perform a sacred duty, as thou hast commanded. This institution has descended to us from our fathers. We salute thee with our thanks, that thou hast preserved so many of us another year, to participate in the ceremonies of this occasion. “Great Spirit, continue to listen: We thank thee for thy great goodness in causing our mother, the earth, again to bring forth her fruits. We thank thee that thou hast caused Our Supporters to yield abundantly. “Great Spirit, our words still continue to flow towards thee. (Throwing on tobacco). Preserve us from all danger. Preserve our aged men. Preserve our mothers. Preserve our warriors. Preserve our children. We burn this tobacco; may its smoke arise to thee. May our thanks, ascending with it, be pleasing to thee. Give wisdom to the keepers of the faith, that they may direct these ceremonies with propriety. Strengthen our warriors, that they may celebrate with pleasure the sacred dances of thy appointment. “Great Spirit; the council here assembled, the aged men and women, the strong warriors, the women and children, unite their voice of thanksgiving to thee. Na-bo! ”' <sup id="cite_ref-967" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-967">[967]</a></sup> 'Before partaking of the feast, 1 the people went out to witness some of those games which were often introduced, as an amusement, to accompany the other exercises of these festive days. The second day commenced with the usual address, after which they had the Thanksgiving dance, Gä-na[unknown] -o-ub, which was the principal religious exercise of the day. This dance was not necessarily a costume performance, although it was usually given by a select band in full dress. In figure, step, and music, it was precisely like the Feather dance, the chief difference between them being the introduction of short thanksgiving speeches between the songs of the dance. This dance is fully explained elsewhere; but it is proper to say, to make it intelligible here, that the music consisted of a series of thanksgiving songs, performed by select singers, who accompanied themselves with turtleshell rattles, to mark time. Each song lasted about two minutes, during which the band danced around the room, in column, with great animation. When the song ceased, the dancers walked around the council-house, about the same length of time, to the beat of the rattles. The thanksgiving speeches were made during these intervals between the songs. A person arose, and perhaps thanked the Maple as follows: “We return thanks to the Maple, which yields its sweet waters for the good of man.” Again the dance was resumed, and another song danced out, after which another speech was made by some other person, perhaps as follows: “We return thanks to the bushes and trees, which provide us with fruit.” The dance was then resumed as before. In this manner the [Page 194] thanksgiving speeches, the songs and the dance were continued, until all the prominent objects in nature had been made the subjects of special notice. There were always set speeches introduced with the Thanksgiving dance, at the Green Corn and Harvest festivals, and they formed a conspicuous part of the worship of the Iroquois. These speeches, or the principal ones, may be collected into one, for the purpose of showing the range of subjects taken; yet it must be borne in mind that each object formed the subject of a separate speech, and was followed by a thanksgiving song, adapted to the case, which the band danced through. It may be proper further to add, that these speeches were consolidated to form the principal part of the annual thanksgiving address to the Great Spirit, made at the burning of the White Dog. The following is their natural order:--' <sup id="cite_ref-968" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-968">[968]</a></sup> '“We return thanks to our mother, the earth, which sustains us. We return thanks to the rivers and streams, which supply us with water. We return thanks to all herbs, which furnish medicines for the cure of our diseases. We return thanks to the corn, and to her sisters, the beans and squashes, which give us life. We return thanks to the bushes and trees, which provide us with fruit. We return thanks to the wind, which, moving the air, has banished diseases. We return thanks to the moon and stars, which have given to us their light when the sun was gone. We return thanks to our grandfather He[unknown] -no, that he has protected his grandchildren from witches and reptiles, and has given to us his rain. We return thanks to the sun, that he has looked upon [Page 195] the earth with a beneficent eye. Lastly, we return thanks to the Great Spirit, in whom is embodied all goodness, and who directs all things for the good of his children.”' <sup id="cite_ref-969" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-969">[969]</a></sup> 'After the conclusion of the Thanksgiving dance, two or three other dances followed, and after them the feast, with which the exercises of the day were concluded. The third morning was set apart for a thanksgiving concert, called the Ah-do[unknown] -weh, which constituted the chief ceremony of the day. The council was opened by an introductory speech by one of the keepers of the faith, upon its nature, objects, and institution. This novelty in their worship was a succession of short speeches made by different persons, one after another, returning thanks to a great variety of objects, each one following his speech with an appropriate song, the words of which were of his own composing, and oftentimes the music also. In a chorus to each song all the people joined, thus sending forth a united anthem of praise. They passed through the whole range of natural objects, thanking each one directly, as in the Thanksgiving dance; but they were not in the Ah-do[unknown] -weh confined either to the natural or to the spiritual world. Acts of kindness, personal achievements, political events, in a word, all the affairs of public and private life were open on this occasion to the indulgence of the grateful affections. Oftentimes one or two hours were consumed, before the people had all expressed their thanks to each other for personal favors, to the works of nature for their constant ministration to their wants, and to the Great Spirit and [Page 196] the “Invisible Aids” for their protecting care. Many of the speeches on these occasions, especially those which referred to objects in the natural world, were the same from year. But those which grew out of their private relations would vary with circumstances. This was esteemed one of their highest religious exercises, and it always continued to be one of their favorite observances. When the Ah-do[unknown] -weh was concluded, two or three dances were generally introduced before the enjoyment of the feast, with which, as before remarked, each day's proceedings were terminated.' <sup id="cite_ref-970" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-970">[970]</a></sup> 'On the fourth day, the festival was concluded with the peach-stone game, Gus-gä[unknown] -a, a game of chance, on which they bet profusely, and to which they were extravagantly attached. It was not in the nature of a religious exercise, but a favorite entertainment, with which to terminate the Green Corn ceremonial. It is elsewhere described. It should be held in the memory, that at the period of the institution of their religious festivals, they were concluded at meridian; during the middle period of their history, they were continued until towards twilight; but in modern times, an evening entertainment, in the way of dancing, always follows each day of the festival, so long as it continues, although it forms no part of their religious observances. It may be further observed, that at the present time, this festival lasts but three days, the proceedings of the third and fourth being completed on the former day. At the close of each day, 1 the people regaled themselves upon a sumptuous feast of succotash. This [Page 197] was always the entertainment at the green corn season. It was made of corn, beans and squashes, and was always a favorite article of food with the red man. It may be well to state in this connection, that among the Iroquois at the present day, they do not sit down together to a common repast, except at religious councils of unusual interest. The feast, after being prepared at the place of council, is distributed at its close, and carried by the women, in vessels brought for the purpose, to their respective homes, where it is enjoyed by each family at their own fireside. But when the people feasted together after the ancient fashion, as they still do occasionally, they selected the hour of twilight. The huge kettles of soup, or hommony, or succotash, as the case might be, were brought into their midst, smoking from the fire. Before partaking of this evening banquet, they never omitted to say grace, which, with them, was a simple ceremonial, but in perfect harmony with their mode of worship. It was a prolonged exclamation, upon a high key, by the solitary voice of one of the keepers of the faith, followed by a swelling chorus from the multitude, upon a lower note. It was designed as an acknowledgment to each other of their gratitude to the great Giver of the feast.' <sup id="cite_ref-971" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-971">[971]</a></sup> The thanksgiving festival: 'After the gathering of the harvest, the Iroquois held another general thanksgiving for four days. It was the last in the year, as the New Year's observances were not of the same general character. The [Page 198] name given to this festival signifies “Thanksgiving to Our Supporters.” It was instituted primarily to return thanks to the corn, beans and squashes, which are always characterized by the Iroquois under this figurative name. Also, to the triad of Spirits, who are so intimately connected in their minds with the plants themselves, that they are nearly inseparable. The resulting object, however, of all these Indian rites, was the praise of Hä-wen-ne[unknown] -yu. Nature having matured and poured forth her stores for their sustenance, they instituted this ceremonial as a perpetual acknowledgment of their gratitude for each returning harvest.' <sup id="cite_ref-972" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-972">[972]</a></sup> 'In the mode of summoning this council, and in the religious ceremonies, and concluding festivities of each day, it so closely resembled the Green Corn worship, that a separate description is rendered unnecessary. These religious councils were seasons of animation and excitement. The greater activity in social intercourse among the people, generally awakened by these ceremonies and festivities, contributed largely to keep up the spirit of these occasions. In the evening, as soon as the twilight hour was passed, the people gathered for the dance, as this entertainment, since the innovation before referred to, always follows the religious ceremonies of each day. The Iroquois have numerous dances, and to the practice itself they have always been extravagantly addicted. On such occasions the passion was gratified by a free indulgence, and the hours of the night passed by unheeded. With the Iroquois in their festivities, as with more refined communities, neither the admonition of the setting stars, [Page 199] nor of the fallen dew, “counselled sleep.” Not, perhaps, until the faint light of approaching day illumined the east, did the spirit of enjoyment decline, and the last murmur of the dispersing council finally subside.' <sup id="cite_ref-973" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-973">[973]</a></sup> Morgan also describes new year's ceremonies: 'The name given to this festival literally signifies “The most excellent faith,” or “The supreme belief.” 1 Among the ceremonies incident to the worship of the Iroquois, the most novel were those which ushered in the new year. In mid-winter, usually about the first of February, this religious celebration was held. It continued for seven successive days, revealing, in its various ceremonials, nearly every feature of their religious system. The prominent act which characterized this jubilee, and which, perhaps, indicated what they understood by “The most excellent faith,” was the burning of the White Dog, on the fifth day of the festival. This annual sacrifice of the Iroquois has long been known, attracting at various times considerable attention. But the true principle involved in it appears not to have been rightly understood. In the sequel, it will be found to be a very simple and tangible idea, harmonizing fully with their system of faith and worship. Several days before the time appointed for the jubilee, the people assembled for the confession of their sins. On this occasion they were more thorough [Page 200] in the work than at any other season, that they might enter upon the new year with a firm purpose of amendment. This council not unfrequently lasted three days, before all the people had performed this act of religious duty.' <sup id="cite_ref-974" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-974">[974]</a></sup> 'The observances of the new year were commenced on the day appointed, by two of the keepers of the faith, who visited every house in and about the Indian village, morning and evening. They were disguised in bear skins or buffalo robes, which were secured around their heads with wreaths of corn-husks, and then gathered in loose folds about the body. Wreaths of corn-husks were also adjusted around their arms and ankles. They were robed in this manner, and painted by the matrons, who, like themselves, were keepers of the faith, and by them were they commissioned to go forth in this formidable attire, to announce the commencement of the jubilee. Taking corn-pounders in their hands, they went out in company, on the morning of the day, to perform their duty. Upon entering a house, they saluted the inmates in a formal manner, after which, one of them, striking upon the floor, to restore silence and secure attention, thus addressed them: --“Listen, Listen, Listen: -- The ceremonies which the Great Spirit has commanded us to perform, are about to commence. Prepare your houses. Clear away the rubbish. Drive out all evil animals. We wish nothing to hinder or obstruct the coming observances. We enjoin upon every one to obey our requirements. Should any of your friends be taken sick and die, we command you not to mourn for them, nor allow any of your friends to mourn. But lay the body aside, [Page 201] and enjoy the coming ceremonies with us. When they are over, we will mourn with you.” 1' <sup id="cite_ref-975" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-975">[975]</a></sup> 'After singing a short thanksgiving song, they passed out. In the afternoon this visit was repeated in the same manner. After saluting the family as before, one of the keepers of the faith thus addressed them: --“My Nephews, my Nephews, my Nephews: -- We now announce to you that the New Year's ceremonies have commenced, according to our ancient custom. You are, each of you, now required to go forth, and participate in their observance. This is the will of the Great Spirit. Your first duty will be to prepare your wooden blades ( Gä-ger-we-sä[unknown] ) with which to stir up the ashes upon your neighbors' hearths. Then return to the Great Spirit your individual thanks for the return of this season, and for the enjoyment of this privilege.” Having sung another song, appropriate to the occasion, they departed finally, and when they had in this way made the circuit of the village, the ceremonies of the first day were concluded. On the first day, however, the White Dog was strangled. (96) They selected a dog, free from physical [Page 202] blemish, and of a pure white, if such an one could be found. The white deer, white squirrel, and other chance animals of the albino kind, were regarded as consecrated to the Great Spirit. White was the Iroquois emblem of purity and of faith. In strangling the dog, they were careful neither to shed his blood nor break his bones. The dog was then spotted, in places, over his body and limbs, with red paint, and ornamented with feathers in various ways. Around his neck was hung a string of white wampum, the pledge of their sincerity. In modern times, the dog is ornamented with a profusion of many-colored rib-bons, which are adjusted around his body and limbs. 1 The ornaments placed upon the dog were the voluntary offerings of the pious; and for each gift thus bestowed, the giver was taught to expect a blessing. When the dog had been thus decorated, it was suspended by the neck about eight feet from the ground, on the branching prong of a pole erected for that purpose. Here it hung, night and day, until the morning of the fifth day, when it was taken down to be burned. Oftentimes two dogs were burned, one for each four of the tribes. (57) In this case, the people separated into two divisions, and after going through separate preparatory ceremonies, they united around the same altar for the burning of the dogs, and the offering of the thanksgiving address to the Great Spirit.' <sup id="cite_ref-976" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-976">[976]</a></sup> 'On the second day 1 all the people went forth, and [Page 203] visited in turn the houses of their neighbors, either in the morning, at noon, or in the evening. They went in small parties apparelled in their best attire. It was customary, however, for the people to be preceded by the two keepers of the faith who made the recitations the day previous, as a matter of etiquette; the houses not being open to all, until these personages had made their call. At this time was performed the ceremony of stirring the ashes upon the hearth, which appears to have no particular idea attached to it, beyond that of a formal visitation. (95) Putting aside the disguise of the day before, the keepers of the faith assumed the costume of warriors, plumed and painted, in which attire they visited every family three times, in the morning, at noon, and in the evening. Taking in their hands wooden blades or shovels, they entered the lodge and saluted the family. One of them then stirred the ashes, and having taken up a quantity upon the blade of the shovel, and sprinkled them upon the hearth, he thus addressed the inmates, as they were in the act of falling: “I thank the Great Spirit that he has spared your lives again to witness this New Year's celebration.” Then repeating the process with another shovel full of ashes, he continued: “I thank the Great Spirit that he has spared my life, again to be an actor in this ceremony. And now I do this to please the Great Spirit.” The two then united in a chanksgiving song prepared for the occasion, upon the conclusion of which they took their departure. Other parties of the people then came in successively, and each went through the same performances. In this manner every house was thrice visited on the second day, by the [Page 204] keepers of the faith in the first instance, and afterwards by the whole community.' <sup id="cite_ref-977" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-977">[977]</a></sup> 'The proceedings upon the third and fourth days were alike. Small dancing parties were organized, which visited from house to house, and danced at the domestic fireside. Each set selected a different dance, appointed their own leader, and furnished their own music. One party, for instance, took the Feather dance, another the Fish dance, another the Trotting dance, to give variety to the short entertainments which succeeded each other at every house. It was not uncommon, on such occasions, to see a party of juveniles, about a dozen in number, dressed in full costume, feathered and painted, dancing the War dance, from house to house, with all the zeal and enthusiasm which this dance was so eminently calculated to excite. In this manner every house was made a scene of gaiety and amusement, for none was so humble or so retired as to remain unvisited. Another pastime incident to these days was the formation of a “thieving party,” as it was called, a band of mischievous boys, disguised with false faces, paint and rags, to collect materials for a feast. This vagrant company strolled from house to house, accompanied by an old woman carrying a huge basket. If the family received them kindly, and made them presents, they handed the latter to the female carrier, and having given the family a dance in acknowledgment of the present, they retired without committing any depredations. But if no presents were made, or such as were insufficient, they purloined whatever articles they could most adroitly and easily conceal. [Page 205] If detected, they at once made restitution, but if not, it was considered a fair win. On the return of this party from their rounds, all the articles collected were deposited in a place open to public examination; where any one who had lost an article which he particularly prized, was allowed to redeem it, on paying an equivalent. But no one was permitted to reclaim, as the owner, any article successfully taken by this thieving party on its professional round. Upon the proceeds of this forced collection, a feast was eventually given, together with a dance in some private family.' <sup id="cite_ref-978" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-978">[978]</a></sup> 'Guessing dreams was another of the novel practices of the Iroquois, which distinguished these festive days. It is difficult to understand precisely how far the self-delusion under which the dreamer appeared to act was real. A person with a melancholy and dejected countenance, entering a house, announced that he had a dream, and requested the inmates to guess it. He thus wandered from house to house, until he found a solution which suited him. This was either received as an interpretation of an actual dream, or suggested such a dream as the person was willing to adopt as his own. He at once avowed that his dream had been correctly guessed; and if the dream, as interpreted, prescribed any future conduct, he fulfilled it to the letter at whatever sacrifice. The celebrated Cornplanter, Gy-ant[unknown] -wä-ka, resigned his chiefship in consequence of a dream. 1 In relation to dreams, the [Page 206] Iroquois had ever been prone to extravagant and supernatural beliefs. They often regarded a dream as a divine monition, and followed its injunctions to the utmost extremity. Their notions upon this subject recall to remembrance the conceit of Homer, that “dreams descend from Jove.” (62)' <sup id="cite_ref-979" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-979">[979]</a></sup> 'During the first four days the people were without a feast, from the fact that the observances themselves did not require the assembling of the people at the council-house. But entertainments were given in the [Page 207] evenings at private houses, where the night was devoted to the dance. Another amusement at this particular season was the Snow-snake game, which, like all Indian games, was wont to arouse considerable interest.' <sup id="cite_ref-980" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-980">[980]</a></sup> 'On the morning of the fifth day, soon after dawn, the White Dog was burned on an altar of wood erected by the keepers of the faith near the councilhouse. It is difficult, from outward observation, to draw forth the true intent with which the dog was burned. The obscurity with which the object was veiled has led to various conjectures. Among other things, it has been pronounced a sacrifice for sin. In the religious system of the Iroquois, there is no recognition of the doctrine of atonement for sin, or of the absolution or forgiveness of sins. Upon this whole subject, their system is silent. An act once done was registered beyond the power of change. The greates advance upon this point of faith was the belief that good deeds cancelled the evil, thus placing heaven, through good works, within the reach of all. The notion that this was an expiation for sin is thus refuted by their system of theology itself. The other idea, that the sins of the people, by some mystic process, were transferred to the dog, and by him thus borne away, on the principle of the scapegoat of the Hebrews, is also without any foundation in truth. The burning of the dog had not the slightest connection with the sins of the people. On the contrary, the simple idea of the sacrifice was, to send up the spirit of the dog as a messenger to the Great Spirit, to announce their continued fidelity to his service, and also to convey to him their united [Page 208] thanks for the blessings of the year. The fidelity of the dog, the companion of the Indian, as a hunter, was emblematical of their fidelity. No messenger so trusty could be found to bear their petitions to the Master of life. The Iroquois believed that the Great Spirit made a covenant with their fathers to the effect, that when they should send up to him the spirit of a dog, of a spotless white, he would receive it as the pledge of their adherence to his worship, and his ears would thus be opened in a special manner to their petitions. To approach Hä-wen-ne[unknown] -yu in the most acceptable manner, and to gain attention to their thanksgiving acknowledgments and supplications in the way of his own appointing, was the end and object of burning the dog. They hung around his neck a string of white wampum, the pledge of their faith. They believed that the spirit of the dog hovered around the body until it was committed to the flames, when it ascended into the presence of the Great Spirit, itself the acknowledged evidence of their fidelity, and bearing also to him the united thanks and supplications of the people. This sacrifice was the most solemn and impressive manner of drawing near to the Great Spirit known to the Iroquois. They used the spirit of the dog in precisely the same manner that they did the incense of tobacco, as an instrumentality through which to commune with their Maker. This sacrifice was their highest act of piety.' <sup id="cite_ref-981" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-981">[981]</a></sup> 'The burning of the dog was attended with many ceremonies. It was first taken down and laid out upon a bench in the council-house, while the fire of the altar was kindling. A speech was then made over [Page 209] it by one of the keepers of the faith, in which he spoke of the antiquity of this institution of their fathers, of its importance and solemnity, and finally enjoined upon them all to direct their thoughts to the Great Spirit, and unite with the keepers of the faith in these observances. He concluded with thanking the Great Spirit, that the lives of so many of them had been spared through another year. A chant or song, appropriate to the occasion, was then sung, the people joining in chorus. By the time this was over, the altar was blazing up on every side ready for the offering. A procession was then formed, the officiating keeper of the faith preceding, followed by four others bearing the dog upon a kind of bark litter, behind which came the people in Indian file. A loud exclamation, in the nature of a warwhoop, announced the starting of the procession. They moved on towards the altar, and having marched around it, the keepers of the faith halted, facing the fising sun. With some immaterial ceremonies, the dog was laid upon the burning altar, and as the flames surrounded the offering, the officiating keeper of the faith, by a species of ejaculation, upon a high key, thrice repeated, invoked the attention of the Great Spirit.' <sup id="cite_ref-982" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-982">[982]</a></sup> '“ Luä, quä, quä: -- (Hail, hail, hail.) Thou who hast created all things, who rulest all things, and who givest laws and commands to thy creatures, listen to our words. We now obey thy commands. That which thou hast made is returning unto thee. It is rising to thee, by which it will appear that our words are true.” 1' <sup id="cite_ref-983" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-983">[983]</a></sup> 'Several thanksgiving songs or chants, in measured verse, were then sung by the keepers of the faith, the people joining in chorus. After this, was made the great thanksgiving address of the Iroquois. The keeper of the faith appointed to deliver it, invoked the attention of Hä-wen-ne[unknown] -yu by the same thricerepeated exclamation. As the speech progressed, he threw leaves of tobacco into the fire from time to time, that its incense might constantly ascend during the whole address. The following is the address, as delivered among the Senecas: 1 --“Hail, Hail, Hail: -- Listen now, with an open ear, to the words of thy people, as they ascend to thy dwelling, in the smoke of our offering. Behold thy people here assembled. Behold, they have come up to celebrate anew the sacred rites thou hast given them. Look down upon us beneficently. Give us wisdom faithfully to execute thy commands. “Continue to listen: -- The united voice of thy people continues to ascend to thee. Forbid, by thy wisdom, all things which shall tempt thy people to relinquish their ancient faith. Give us power to celebrate at all times, with zeal and fidelity, the sacred ceremonies which thou hast given us. “Continue to listen: -- Give to the keepers of the faith wisdom to execute properly thy commands. Give to our warriors, and our mothers, strength to perform the sacred ceremonies of thy institution. We thank thee that, in thy wisdom, thou hast given to us these commands. We thank thee that thou hast preserved them pure unto this day. “Continue to listen: -- We thank thee that the lives of [Page 211] so many of thy children are spared, to participate in the exercises of this occasion.

With this the religious exercises of the day were concluded. Other dances, however, followed, for the entertainment of the people, and the day and evening were given up to this amusement. Last of all came the feast, with which the proceedings of the day were terminated. On the morning of the sixth day, the people again assembled at the place of council. This day was observed in about the same manner as one of their ordinary religious days, at which the Thanksgiving dance was introduced. The seventh and last day was commenced with the Ah-do[unknown] -weh; after which the Peach-stone game was introduced, with the determination of which ended the New Year's jubilee.' <sup id="cite_ref-987" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-987">[987]</a></sup>

<dd><b>♠ Ideology forbids slavery universally ♣ absent ♥</b> Prisoners of war were enslaved: 'To us slavery is a relic of barbarism, yet for the Onondagas it was a step forward when they perceived the wisdom of sparing captives that they might have slaves to work their fields.' <sup id="cite_ref-988" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-988">[988]</a></sup> 'As in civilized communities, there was a division of work between men and women, and the women's work was often assigned to men who had become slaves of the Iroquois. They had lost their rank as warriors, unless adopted by some family or clan.'<sup id="cite_ref-989" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-989">[989]</a></sup> Some remained servants, but others were adopted into Iroquois society and could acquire titles: 'Colden said the Iroquois had no slaves, but they not only frequently appear but are classified in the Relation for 1657. There were three kinds. The first were admitted into families, and sometimes became chiefs, though still considered slaves. The second were given to the richer Indians, and had food and shelter, but nothing more. The third were young women and girls, continually exposed to every danger. Often, however, they were saved from death to become wives. As slaves the treatment of these girls depended on the temper of their mistress, and this was often cruel. In 1656 an Erie girl displeased her Onondaga mistress, who hired a young man to kill her. The life of the slave was absolutely in the power of the owner.' <sup id="cite_ref-990" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-990">[990]</a></sup> Morgan describes the process of adoption: 'THE statements in the text, while of course not made on personal observation, are, in the main, correct. The reason prisoners were not exchanged was that after they had been adopted they were Iroquois, and to surrender them would be to give up an Iroquois to a strange nation. Individuals who had not been adopted might be and often were given up, or rescued by their countrymen. An adopted prisoner was usually taken in place of some member of a household who had recently died, and might be tortured and burnt, or saved alive, at the discretion of the house which owned him. From this point of view it was better to be adopted in place of one who had died by disease or accident than in place of one killed in battle. The adopted citizens [Page p278] were for a long time subject to suspicion and in danger of their lives; any untoward event, physical disability of the captive, or the mere caprice of their owners being enough to order them out to be burnt. Most of these were treated as slaves, but their position, particularly if of Iroquoian stock, would gradually improve, and in the second generation no difference would remain between slaves and masters. An interesting and fortunate case of adoption is that of the Jesuit Milet taken prisoner by the Onondagas in 1689. He had previously been among the Oneidas as a missionary, and was given to them, they being represented in the war party. For some weeks he remained in the town, well treated but his fate undetermined. Then a council was held to decide the cases of Milet and three other Frenchmen. Two of the others were burned, but Milet was claimed by both the Bear and Tortoise clans, who finally turned him over to the Wolf clan in which he had friends. “Through the influence of the chief women,” says Milet, “they showed me the friendliness of giving me in the place of a sachem who had died long before of disease, rather than of one killed in the attack on the French.” This sachem was Hodashateh, the first Sachem of the Oneidas, and Milet, accordingly, succeeded to the Sachemship and was soon in good standing as a member of the council. (Letter of Milet, 64 F. R., 90, 100.)' <sup id="cite_ref-991" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-991">[991]</a></sup> High-ranking individuals tended to have more servants: 'It must be remembered that all were not equally rich, nor did all women rank alike. Some were brought up delicately. In the Relation for 1670 we have an account of the recent death of a young Seneca woman of high rank who had been baptized. To the comforting words of the missionary the mother replied, “Thou wast not acquainted with her; she was mistress here, and commanded more than twenty slaves who are still with me. She knew not what it was to go to the forest to bring in wood, or to the river there to draw up water. She was not able to trouble herself with all that which concerns housekeeping. Now I doubt not but that being now the only one of our family in Paradise, she may have much trouble to accustom herself to it; for she will be obliged to do her cooking herself, to go to the wood and the water, and to prepare all with her own hands for eating and drinking.” If only one of her slaves could go to the same place it would be all right.' <sup id="cite_ref-992" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-992">[992]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<p><b>♠ Human sacrifice ♣ 3 ♥</b> According to Waugh, some prisoners of war were subject to ceremonial cannibalism: 'Ceremonial cannibalism was evidently quite a common practice, the offering in this way of prisoners captured in war being considered particularly acceptable. In some instances, according to the Relations, the Sun was thought to be offended and to withhold his favour because they had been remiss in torturing and eating prisoners. Portions of the latter, such as the heart, the lips, and other parts were apparently eaten from a belief in sympathetic magic, or the ability to acquire the bravery or other virtues of an enemy.' <sup id="cite_ref-993" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-993">[993]</a></sup> 'The torturing of captive warriors was a common practice among the Hurons and Iroquois, although the latter were, purportedly, the more vicious. The Iroquois massacre of Algonquin and Huron villages was portrayed in all of its bloody detail by dismayed and disappointed Jesuits (J.R. 10:226-228; 54:74; 30:236-240). Cannabalism was especially unnerving to the French. This practice was not limited to eating the heart of a courageous captive. In one village, after the Iroquois had tied up the women and children, they set about devouring the slain Huron men. . . . They dismember those whom they have just massacred, cut them in pieces, and throw the feet, legs, arms, and heads into the stew, which they set boiling with so much joy, that the poor captives who remain alive are heartbroken.' <sup id="cite_ref-994" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-994">[994]</a></sup> Cannibalism and scalp-taking could be considered as a symbolic adoption: 'The equilibrium-maintaining function of Iroquois warfare requires some amplification. Certainly the Iroquois were not unique among Indian tribes, or even primitive peoples generally, in the importance of kinship in establishing the individual's social rights and obligations and in defining his image in his own eyes and the eyes of others. Such discipline and security as the individual enjoyed tended to be provided by his family (and by “family” we mean not merely the immediate household but the various and widely ramifying connections of the kinship system). In such a setting an injury to an Iroquois Indian's relatives became doubly significant, not only because it disturbed the integrity of the group with which he was identified, but also because the affected individuals could not depend upon obtaining redress through police and courts. It was thus a matter of honor for kinfolk to protect one another and, if necessary, to avenge injuries. In the case of a killing, the most immediately affected parties might well be women--mother, sisters, and wife of the lost person--who could demand either the torture and death of the offender or the adoption of a captive to take the departed person's place. (In a fundamental sense, even the dead offender was adopted, since the scalp torn from the slain foe was often ritually adopted into the bereaved family, and the bodies of captives who had been tortured to death were sometimes eaten ceremonially.) While women could hold the initiative in demanding redress and could determine the fate of captives, men were responsible for risking their lives to bring back scalps or prisoners. Joining a war party thereby became a test of manhood, conducted under the watchful eyes of bereaved women, and failure to participate in the revenge process would prejudice the reluctant youth's standing in the eyes of his own family and the community generally.' <sup id="cite_ref-995" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-995">[995]</a></sup> 'Many prisoners were, however, consigned to torture, particularly during the seventeenth century; the manifest horror of the more civilized Europeans at the sight of tortures little different from those they deplored in their own societies was doubtless responsible in part for the lapsing of the torture complex during the eighteenth century. Torture was a ritual and followed a formal, predictable course, in which the victim and his tormentors were expected to play traditionally respectable roles. The victim (usually a man, occasionally a woman, rarely a child) was expected to show composure and hardihood; weaklings who were unable to perform the role, who broke down, wept, and cried for mercy, were sometimes dispatched in disgust with a quick hatchet-blow. While undoubtedly unconscious meanings, various according to the participant and spectator, attached to the torture ritual, many of the tormentors consciously were not anxious to see transports of agony and emotional collapse, but rather the reverse: they wanted to see a stouthearted man with unconquerable self-control, maintaining defiance and self-respect to the bitter end, and the torture was a test of these qualities. Since the victim was in many cases eaten afterward and had in some cases been previously [Page ( 104 )] adopted, he was in a very real sense being incorporated by a family and a community, and becoming a part of them, and a show of strength on his part was gratifying to those who identified with him.' <sup id="cite_ref-996" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-996">[996]</a></sup> Some captive women were also burnt and eaten: 'Mr. Horatio Hale rather strangely says in his “Iroquois Book of Rites,” page 97, “The Iroquois never burnt women at the stake,” and considers this but an occasional death for their male prisoners. He looked at their character through his own benevolent eyes. The [Page 84] instances of their both burning and eating women in the seventeenth century are so many that it is hardly worth while to discuss this. Four Andastes women were burned at Oneida alone in 1668, and another was burned and eaten at Cayuga the same year. Jogues' account of the burning and eating of a female prisoner in sacrifice, by the Mohawks, is well known. She was first burned all over the body, then thrown into a great fire, taken out in due season, and then “her body was cut up, sent to the various villages and devoured.” Similar things were common.' <sup id="cite_ref-997" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-997">[997]</a></sup> Fenton's comments seem to suggest that ceremonial cannibalism was discontinued at some point in the 18th century: 'Feasts on an animal head echo an earlier ceremonial cannibalism. The Huron, Mohawk, and Oneida tribes held feasts where the head, frequently the head of an enemy captive after torture, went into the kettle and then as a choice morsel went first to the chiefs. In the war feast the head, often a dog's head cooked in the soup, was presented to the captain who carried it in his hands inciting others to enlist. By [Page 107] the middle of the eighteenth century, the accounts refer to whole hogs being boiled in the corn soup and warriors successively danced with the hog's head in their hands. Thus, pork replaced the dog as the war feast food, and later it supplanted the bear and venison in all feasts, until today the pig's head is the ceremonial head, the pièce de résistance. Aside from the disappearance of the game animals, it is easy to understand the rapid introduction of pork as a ceremonial food, because the modern Iroquois have an almost insatiable appetite for fresh pork.

In some instances, according to the Relations, the Sun was thought to be offended and to withhold his favour because they had been remiss in torturing and eating prisoners. Portions of the latter, such as the heart, the lips, and other parts were apparently eaten from a belief in sympathetic magic, or the ability to acquire the bravery or other virtues of an enemy.' <sup id="cite_ref-1000" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1000">[1,000]</a></sup> 'The torturing of captive warriors was a common practice among the Hurons and Iroquois, although the latter were, purportedly, the more vicious. The Iroquois massacre of Algonquin and Huron villages was portrayed in all of its bloody detail by dismayed and disappointed Jesuits (J.R. 10:226-228; 54:74; 30:236-240). Cannabalism was especially unnerving to the French. This practice was not limited to eating the heart of a courageous captive. In one village, after the Iroquois had tied up the women and children, they set about devouring the slain Huron men. . . . They dismember those whom they have just massacred, cut them in pieces, and throw the feet, legs, arms, and heads into the stew, which they set boiling with so much joy, that the poor captives who remain alive are heartbroken.' <sup id="cite_ref-1001" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1001">[1,001]</a></sup> Cannibalism and scalp-taking could be considered as a symbolic adoption: 'The equilibrium-maintaining function of Iroquois warfare requires some amplification. Certainly the Iroquois were not unique among Indian tribes, or even primitive peoples generally, in the importance of kinship in establishing the individual's social rights and obligations and in defining his image in his own eyes and the eyes of others. Such discipline and security as the individual enjoyed tended to be provided by his family (and by “family” we mean not merely the immediate household but the various and widely ramifying connections of the kinship system). In such a setting an injury to an Iroquois Indian's relatives became doubly significant, not only because it disturbed the integrity of the group with which he was identified, but also because the affected individuals could not depend upon obtaining redress through police and courts. It was thus a matter of honor for kinfolk to protect one another and, if necessary, to avenge injuries. In the case of a killing, the most immediately affected parties might well be women--mother, sisters, and wife of the lost person--who could demand either the torture and death of the offender or the adoption of a captive to take the departed person's place. (In a fundamental sense, even the dead offender was adopted, since the scalp torn from the slain foe was often ritually adopted into the bereaved family, and the bodies of captives who had been tortured to death were sometimes eaten ceremonially.) While women could hold the initiative in demanding redress and could determine the fate of captives, men were responsible for risking their lives to bring back scalps or prisoners.

(In a fundamental sense, even the dead offender was adopted, since the scalp torn from the slain foe was often ritually adopted into the bereaved family, and the bodies of captives who had been tortured to death were sometimes eaten ceremonially.) While women could hold the initiative in demanding redress and could determine the fate of captives, men were responsible for risking their lives to bring back scalps or prisoners.

In such a setting an injury to an Iroquois Indian's relatives became doubly significant, not only because it disturbed the integrity of the group with which he was identified, but also because the affected individuals could not depend upon obtaining redress through police and courts. It was thus a matter of honor for kinfolk to protect one another and, if necessary, to avenge injuries. In the case of a killing, the most immediately affected parties might well be women--mother, sisters, and wife of the lost person--who could demand either the torture and death of the offender or the adoption of a captive to take the departed person's place. (In a fundamental sense, even the dead offender was adopted, since the scalp torn from the slain foe was often ritually adopted into the bereaved family, and the bodies of captives who had been tortured to death were sometimes eaten ceremonially.) While women could hold the initiative in demanding redress and could determine the fate of captives, men were responsible for risking their lives to bring back scalps or prisoners.

The victim (usually a man, occasionally a woman, rarely a child) was expected to show composure and hardihood; weaklings who were unable to perform the role, who broke down, wept, and cried for mercy, were sometimes dispatched in disgust with a quick hatchet-blow. While undoubtedly unconscious meanings, various according to the participant and spectator, attached to the torture ritual, many of the tormentors consciously were not anxious to see transports of agony and emotional collapse, but rather the reverse: they wanted to see a stouthearted man with unconquerable self-control, maintaining defiance and self-respect to the bitter end, and the torture was a test of these qualities.

Thus, pork replaced the dog as the war feast food, and later it supplanted the bear and venison in all feasts, until today the pig's head is the ceremonial head, the pièce de résistance. Aside from the disappearance of the game animals, it is easy to understand the rapid introduction of pork as a ceremonial food, because the modern Iroquois have an almost insatiable appetite for fresh pork. The present use of the hog's head, nevertheless, evokes the same symbolisms involved in the ancient manipulation of a human or dog's head.

In some instances, according to the Relations, the Sun was thought to be offended and to withhold his favour because they had been remiss in torturing and eating prisoners. Portions of the latter, such as the heart, the lips, and other parts were apparently eaten from a belief in sympathetic magic, or the ability to acquire the bravery or other virtues of an enemy.' <sup id="cite_ref-1049" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1049">[1,049]</a></sup> 'The torturing of captive warriors was a common practice among the Hurons and Iroquois, although the latter were, purportedly, the more vicious. The Iroquois massacre of Algonquin and Huron villages was portrayed in all of its bloody detail by dismayed and disappointed Jesuits (J.R. 10:226-228; 54:74; 30:236-240). Cannabalism was especially unnerving to the French. This practice was not limited to eating the heart of a courageous captive.

<p><b>Supernatural beings (e.g., gods, spirits, ancestors)</b>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Number of officially sanctioned supernatural beings ♣ polytheistic ♥</b> 'The supernatural world of the Iroquois included numerous deities, the most important of which was Great Spirit, who was responsible for the creation of men, the plants and, animals and the forces of good in nature. The Iroquois believed that Great Spirit indirectly guided the lives of ordinary men. Other important deities were Thunderer and the Three Sisters, the spirits of Maize, Beans and Squash. Opposing the Great Spirit and the other forces of good were Evil Spirit and other lesser spirits responsible for disease and other misfortune. In the Iroquois view ordinary humans could not communicate directly with Great Spirit, but could do so indirectly by burning tobacco, which carried their prayers to the lesser spirits of good. The Iroquois regarded dreams as important supernatural signs and serious attention was given to interpreting dreams. It was believed that dreams expressed the desire of the soul and as a result the fulfillment of a dream was of paramount importance to the individual.'<sup id="cite_ref-1059" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1059">[1,059]</a></sup> According to Lewis Henry Morgan, the Great Spirit was the result of mixing pre-Christian beliefs with Christian ones, starting perhaps in the late seventeenth century; however, his reconstruction of pre-Christian Iroquois beliefs is still polytheistic. 'The beautiful and elevating conception of the Great Spirit watching over his red children from the heavens, and pleased with their good deeds, their prayers, and their sacrifices, has been known to the Indians only since the Gospel of Christ was preached to them. The primitive Indians, says W. P. Clark, in his valuable book, The Indian Sign Language, “were limited pantheists -- they did not believe that the universe taken as a whole was God; but that everything in the world had its spiritual essence made manifest in the forces and laws of nature.” Hence the regard of the Indian for the totem of his clan held much more of reverence than the feeling of a present-day Briton or American for the lion or the eagle. Not only was the clan totem reverenced, but each individual had his personal totem -- (in Algonquin manitou, in Iroquois oki ). In youth after certain exercises and fastings he waited for a dream, and whatever he dreamed of became his manitou on which his fortune depended, -- the Master of his Life, the Jesuits translated it. With one it might be a muskrat, with another a knife; and whatever the totemic object, it accompanied the Indian on his journeys and especially on the war-path. If the manitou were an animal, the skin, or the plumage of a bird, was taken as containing the spirit of the animal. It would seem that when the Senecas attacked Herkimer at Oriskany they left in their camp their baggage containing many of these totemic objects. The capture of this baggage by Gansevoort was an even greater calamity than their defeat by Herkimer, and after that day'<sup id="cite_ref-1060" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1060">[1,060]</a></sup> 'In addition to this limited pantheism the Iroquois recognized several personal deities. Ataentsic was the oldest of their deities, and dwelt with her grandson Jouskeha in a bark cabin in the land of souls. She has been connected with the Moon and he with the Sun. Areskoui, the God of War, is more evidently a Sun God. Most of the worship now given to the Great Spirit belongs historically to Areskoui. Tarenyawagon was much reverenced, for he was the sender of dreams, and Hiawatha was an actual hero raised after his death to a place in the Iroquois Pantheon. The Iroquois religion was in a state of transition from pantheism to polytheism, and would soon have developed into a system like that of Rome where the nature worship was merged in that of the personal deities.'<sup id="cite_ref-1061" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1061">[1,061]</a></sup> 'There was however one deity worshipped throughout North America, the all-seeing one, the dweller in Heaven, the giver of many blessings, the Sun. To him were paid prayer and sacrifice and thanks for such good gifts as food, sunshine, and victory over the enemy. When the missionaries told of the God of the white man and his attributes, the account seemed credible to the Indian, who accepted much of it as further history of his Sun God; and the sacrifices, thanksgivings, and offerings were still offered to the Great Spirit as in earlier days to the Sun. Though the pleaching of Christianity made but slight direct impression upon the observances and actions of most of the Red Men, it did greatly affect their myths and beliefs, thus preparing the way for an ethical religion.'<sup id="cite_ref-1062" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1062">[1,062]</a></sup> Given Morgan’s Victorian evolutionist proclivities, some of his claims may turn out to be incorrect under expert review. Peter Peregrine: "Accusation of witchcraft was an essential social control mechanism among Iroquoian groups, I’m not sure how that fits into your model.  The belief that witches exist is obviously core to this, but it is not witches doing the social control, rather it is the fear that deviant behavior will lead to an accusation of being a witch that provides the mechanism for self-discipline. During the historic period there was a series of shifts in Iroquoian religious beliefs.  The “false face” spirits, who are moralists, came to the fore, and the interesting “Code of Handsome Lake” practices that blended indigenous beliefs with strongly moralizing Christian ones developed.  Thus it is essential to understand the time period to which your quote is referring.  If it reflects a period after around 1750 then I would not consider it “traditional.”  Obviously if you want to only look at pre-Christian times then you need to go back to 1600 or so.  If you have not yet, the Jesuit Relations and Allied Documents, which are on-line, provide a wealth of information about Iroquoian beliefs from this early time period." <sup id="cite_ref-1063" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1063">[1,063]</a></sup></dd>

Areskoui, the God of War, is more evidently a Sun God. Most of the worship now given to the Great Spirit belongs historically to Areskoui. Tarenyawagon was much reverenced, for he was the sender of dreams, and Hiawatha was an actual hero raised after his death to a place in the Iroquois Pantheon. The Iroquois religion was in a state of transition from pantheism to polytheism, and would soon have developed into a system like that of Rome where the nature worship was merged in that of the personal deities.'<sup id="cite_ref-1073" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1073">[1,073]</a></sup> 'There was however one deity worshipped throughout North America, the all-seeing one, the dweller in Heaven, the giver of many blessings, the Sun.

But in justice to them it must be acknowledged, that no people ever possessed a higher sense of honor and self-respect in this particular, or looked down with greater disdain upon this shameful practice, than did the Iroquois. To this day, among their descendants, this offence is almost unknown. No locks, or bolts, or private repositories were ever necessary for the protection of property among themselves.

In precisely those local groups where the system of life chiefs survives (Tonawanda, Onondaga, Tuscarora, Six Nations), the distinction is made between chiefly lineages and the clan. Controversies rage as to which lineage in a clan possesses a title and whether the clan mother is the oldest woman of the chiefly lineage or the oldest woman of the clan (Tonawanda Turtles in National Gypsum Co. case). If the local titlebearing lineage lacks a likely candidate for chiefship, the matron loans her title to the matron of another lineage who installs her son, or sister's son, etc., and the second lineage after a generation or so claims the title, or swears that it belongs to the whole clan. Similarly, a title may pass from one community to another, or to another clan in the same phratry. In the two communities of the Seneca Nation--Allegany and Cattaraugus--which adopted the elective system of Councilors after Buffalo Creek, the practical distinction between maternal family and clan has blurred.

Her descendants and those who were related clanwise were his constituents. The matron and the chief tended to reside in the same settlement, for when the Chief removed, the clan had no one to regard with confidence unless he returned for village councils. If the matron removed, local succession was in jeopardy. [Page 51] The results of deliberations by the clan were taken from village councils to the council of the tribe. The ranking clan chiefs residing at a place were the cochiefs of that settlement. All eight of the Seneca chiefs are now concentrated at Tonawanda, but formerly the Seneca had at least four villages, and all the rest save the Oneida had each two or three principal towns with satellite settlements. The tribe thus spoke a common language, it comprised two or more settlements, it was governed by a common council of village chiefs who also represented constituent clans, and they governed a common territory adjacent to the towns. In time all clans were present in all villages, probably about in the same proportions as they are now. As any clan predominated in a settlement, members had to seek mates in the next village, or divide their own house in twain, thus distributing the clans again.'<sup id="cite_ref-1108" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1108">[1,108]</a></sup> Beauchamp speaks of an Iroquois 'nobility', by which he might mean chiefly lineages: 'If they had no great prominence in magical arts at an early day it was not because they were undervalued.

On this her family “degraded her from the nobility, in an assembly of the chiefs of the town, and took away the name and title of Oiander, that is to say, esteemed, a quality which they much esteem and which she had inherited from her ancestors, and deserved by her own good spirit, her prudence and wise conduct, and at the same time they installed another in her place.

The second were given to the richer Indians, and had food and shelter, but nothing more. The third were young women and girls, continually exposed to every danger. Often, however, they were saved from death to become wives. As slaves the treatment of these girls depended on the temper of their mistress, and this was often cruel.

Although disease and warfare such as the Beaver Wars of 1748-1780 and the French and Indian War of 1754 had taken their toll in reducing the Iroquois, they, by adopting captives, replenished their population. Fenton noted: By the end of the seventeenth century the adopted or their offspring outnumbered the Iroquois proper. They became thoroughly acculturated and acted more like the Iroquois than the Iroquois themselves. Chieftenship titles were even conforred on adoptees. The rejuvenating power of the People of the Longhouse amazed everyone who wrote about them. (1971:143)'<sup id="cite_ref-1113" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1113">[1,113]</a></sup> Morgan describes the process of adoption: 'THE statements in the text, while of course not made on personal observation, are, in the main, correct. The reason prisoners were not exchanged was that after they had been adopted they were Iroquois, and to surrender them would be to give up an Iroquois to a strange nation. Individuals who had not been adopted might be and often were given up, or rescued by their countrymen. An adopted prisoner was usually taken in place of some member of a household who had recently died, and might be tortured and burnt, or saved alive, at the discretion of the house which owned him. From this point of view it was better to be adopted in place of one who had died by disease or accident than in place of one killed in battle. The adopted citizens [Page p278] were for a long time subject to suspicion and in danger of their lives; any untoward event, physical disability of the captive, or the mere caprice of their owners being enough to order them out to be burnt. Most of these were treated as slaves, but their position, particularly if of Iroquoian stock, would gradually improve, and in the second generation no difference would remain between slaves and masters. An interesting and fortunate case of adoption is that of the Jesuit Milet taken prisoner by the Onondagas in 1689. He had previously been among the Oneidas as a missionary, and was given to them, they being represented in the war party. For some weeks he remained in the town, well treated but his fate undetermined. Then a council was held to decide the cases of Milet and three other Frenchmen. Two of the others were burned, but Milet was claimed by both the Bear and Tortoise clans, who finally turned him over to the Wolf clan in which he had friends. “Through the influence of the chief women,” says Milet, “they showed me the friendliness of giving me in the place of a sachem who had died long before of disease, rather than of one killed in the attack on the French.” This sachem was Hodashateh, the first Sachem of the Oneidas, and Milet, accordingly, succeeded to the Sachemship and was soon in good standing as a member of the council. (Letter of Milet, 64 F. R., 90, 100.)'<sup id="cite_ref-1114" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1114">[1,114]</a></sup>  High-ranking individuals tended to have more servants: 'It must be remembered that all were not equally rich, nor did all women rank alike. Some were brought up delicately. In the Relation for 1670 we have an account of the recent death of a young Seneca woman of high rank who had been baptized. To the comforting words of the missionary the mother replied, “Thou wast not acquainted with her; she was mistress here, and commanded more than twenty slaves who are still with me. She knew not what it was to go to the forest to bring in wood, or to the river there to draw up water. She was not able to trouble herself with all that which concerns housekeeping. Now I doubt not but that being now the only one of our family in Paradise, she may have much trouble to accustom herself to it; for she will be obliged to do her cooking herself, to go to the wood and the water, and to prepare all with her own hands for eating and drinking.” If only one of her slaves could go to the same place it would be all right.'<sup id="cite_ref-1115" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1115">[1,115]</a></sup> But social classes in our sense of the term were absent: 'The lack of social classes is also considered to be characteristically Indian. No individual is considered socially superior to any other. Whatever prestige is to be gained is achieved by living up to the previously mentioned behavioral ideals of generosity, patience, willingness to help, self-control, etc. Indians who try to claim rank are derisively chided or talked about.'<sup id="cite_ref-1116" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1116">[1,116]</a></sup> Given the complexities of the Iroquois situation, we are unsure how best to code for this variable.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ purity ♣ present ♥</b> Confession rituals were performed before certain festivals: 'Preliminary confession rites, wherein individuals may confess their sins to the Creatorover strings of wampum, should precede every festival of rites addressed to the Creator.This usually occupies two mornings during the week before the festival, the first beingfor the Faith-keepers.'<sup id="cite_ref-1117" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1117">[1,117]</a></sup> 'The confession rite, which should precede all festivals addressed to the Creator, is anopportunity for the community to prepare itself for the coming celebration and has someclaim to antiquity.'<sup id="cite_ref-1118" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1118">[1,118]</a></sup> Foley describes a confession ceremony from the 20th century: 'The ceremonial schedule at a chiefs, convention is basically similar to oircuit conventions. The meeting is scheduled from 8 a.m. until noon; the ceremony begins with the long Thanksgiving Address; the reading of the code followed by an abbreviated Thanksgiving address. Next the congregation dances a set of feather dances to express thanks to the creator and preacher (Shimony, 1961). Then the sponsoring Longhouse provides lunch. After lunch the congregation assembles for an explanation of the text and a confession, or Kaijista?. A confession holding the Kaijista? or five sacred wampum strings is scheduled for the second and subsequent days. All visiting Longhouses through appointed representatives must present their Kaijista? to the host Longhouse's guardian of the code on the second day. They are returned on the last day of the Kay[unknown] d:yho? roading. Shimony (1961:197) describes the Kaijista? confession which she contends, as did Speck (1949), represents an aboriginal survival. Then the speaker explains the confession to the assenblage, the two benches which hold the confessors are centered in the house, and the two confidants (those who take confession from the people) are handed the wampum of the Longhouses to be used during the confession. These two men need not be from opposite moieties, and their only qualification is that they are able to speak the requisite words. The confidints rise first and confess their sins in public, which usually takes the form of a simple declaration of being sorry for having done wrong. Absolutely essential for [Page 262] confession, however, is the holding of the wampum for it is the wampum which impresses on the individual the sanctity of the occasion and which helps to convey his contrition to Handsome Lake and the Creator. It is often recounted that the individual will shake involuntarily during confession so that the wampum rattles, bead against bead. Such confessions are adjudged to be most sincere. That there is often much enotion in confession is beyond doubt. Men and women weep, offer lengthy explanations of the cause of sin and resolve with feeling to ‘go a straight road.’ (1961:197-198) A shortened thanksgiving address follows the Kaijista?'<sup id="cite_ref-1119" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1119">[1,119]</a></sup> It is unclear whether confessions in the 18th and 19th century differed from more recent practices. Morgan also describes confession ceremonies: 'This was the first festival of the spring. It was usually called the Maple Dance. The primary idea of this ceremonial was to return thanks to the maple itself; but at the same time they rendered their thanks to the Great Spirit for the gift of the maple. It lasted but one day. When the sap began to flow, the keepers of the faith announced the time and place for commemorating the recurrence of this event, and summoned the people to assemble for that purpose. Some days before the time appointed for the festival, the people assembled for the mutual confession of their sins, both as an act of religious duty, and as a preparation for the council. This act preceded all the festivals; but it was more general and thorough at the three last than at the three first, as they were deemed more important, and continued for a greater length of time. This council, Sa-nun-dät-ha-wä[unknown] -ta, literally “a meeting for repentance,” was opened by one of the keepers of the faith, with an address upon the propriety and importance of acknowledging their evil deeds, to strengthen their minds against future temptations. He then took the string of white wampum in his hand, and set the example by a confession of his own faults; after which he handed the string to the one nearest to him, who received it, made his confession in like manner, and passed it to another. In this way the wampum went around from hand to hand; and those who had confessions to make stated wherein they had done wrong, and promised to do better in [Page 181] the future. Old and young, men, women, and even children all united in this public acknowledgment of their faults, and joined in the common resolution of amendment. On some occasions the string of wampum was placed in the centre of the room, and each one advanced in turn to perform the duty, as the inclination seized him. A confession and promise without holding the wampum would be of no avail. It was the wampum which recorded their words, and gave their pledge of sincerity. The object of the confession was future amendment. The Iroquois appear to have had no idea either of the atonement or of the forgiveness of sins. Meritorious acts neutralized evil deeds, but neither the one nor the other, when done, could be recalled, or changed, or obliterated.'<sup id="cite_ref-1120" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1120">[1,120]</a></sup> 'If, after the planting season, a drought should come upon the land, threatening a failure of the harvest, a special council was frequently called, to invoke He[unknown] -no, the Thunderer, to send rain upon the earth. Before the time appointed for this council, the people assembled, as before other festivals, for mutual confession. They feared, as they expressed it, “that some of their number had done some great wrong, for which the Great Spirit was angry with them, and withheld the rain as a merited punishment.” After this special council was opened in the usual form, the Thanksgiving [Page 189] dance, and the Ah-d[unknown] -web, hereafter to be described, were introduced, which were supposed to be peculiarly acceptable to He[unknown] -no. At a proper time, in the progress of these ceremonies, the keeper of the faith, who had been appointed as usual, advanced to the fire, and having laid on the leaves of tobacco, and gained the attention of the people, he made the following invocation of the Thunderer, as the incense ascended:--'<sup id="cite_ref-1121" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1121">[1,121]</a></sup> '“ He[unknown] -no, our Grandfather, listen now to the words of thy grandchildren.

It is the confession of sins. Before each of their periodical religious festivals, there is made a general and public confession. Several days before the time designated for the festival, the people assemble by appointment, and each one in turn, who has a confession to make, rising, and taking a string of white wampum in his hand, acknowledges his faults and transgressions, and publicly professes a purpose of amendment. The white wampum is the emblem of purity and sincerity. With it he confirms and records his words. The absolution or forgiveness of sins formed no part of the motive or object in the confession. It had reference to the future conduct exclusively. One who was willing to confess a fault from a sense of religious duty, would, by the act, strengthen his mind against future temptation. This custom has prevailed so long among them, that they have lost its origin. It contains no such analogy to the practices of any Christian community as to compel us to ascribe it to external influences, but yet it has about it so much of the fragrance of Christianity, [Page 165] that it awakens in the mind a doubt of its Indian origin. It is by no means certain, however, but that it is one of their own primitive religious customs, under a modified form.'<sup id="cite_ref-1126" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1126">[1,126]</a></sup> We are unsure whether confessions should be considered to be a form of ritual purification, but we have assumed so for the time being. We are also unsure when confessions were first introduced, given the presence of Christian missionaries. Contamination with the 'common world' was thought to impede contact with supernatural beings: 'The Iroquois have observed real birds in their native habitat, and they have projected that behavior, magnifying size and characteristics, and granting corresponding powers, until they envisage mythological birds which “no one has ever seen.” Such is the operation of a principle: for everything in the known animal world, there is a great prototype in the supernatural world. The fact that supernatural birds are seldom, if ever, seen exalts their power, because, in Iroquois thinking, in order to be pure and free of contamination anything must be secluded from sight. Conversely, the only person who has rapport with “secluded” things is the one who has himself been kept apart from all contamination. Thus one who is born with a caul over his head will, if kept in seclusion, have powers of second sight. He becomes a pure person and has easy access to all those things which exist beyond the pale of vulgar persons who observe only the events and phenomena of the common world. Consequently men went into seclusion apart from women and purged themselves in order to lure down mere eagles, and a few were blessed by seeing the great Dew Eagles. Again, when a person takes the Little Water Medicine, he must go into seclusion during 4 days, and abstain from grease and salt, because the medicinal ingredients derive from birds and animals who are secluded (hodi[unknown] ya'dawa[unknown] d[unknown] ').'<sup id="cite_ref-1127" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1127">[1,127]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ kinship ♣ present ♥</b> Iroquois society was organized in matrilineages: 'Matrilineages were organized into 15 matrisibs.

Lineage offices such as chiefa, deputy chiefs, runners and keepers of secret medicine were invested natrilineally, as were the six ceremonial clan officers. Individuals could not marry within one's own lineage or one's father's matrilineage.

Whileband membership was traced bilaterally to an ancestorwho had contributed to the purchase of land, membershipin clans was determined through the mother's side.Marriages were arranged by the parents, usually thefather of the bridegroom. Intraclan marriages were common,and although subject to criticism, no sanctions werebrought to bear on the couples. It was commonlybelieved that intraclan marriages resulted in weak, deformed,or mentally deficient offspring. However, thetendency for intraclan marriage was a natural outgrowthof the community attitude against marrying out and the relatively small Oneida population from which to selectmates (Ricciardelli 1966:186-189).'<sup id="cite_ref-1131" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1131">[1,131]</a></sup> Matrilineages held and transmitted property: 'Matrilineages were the property holding unit in traditional Iroquoian society.'<sup id="cite_ref-1132" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1132">[1,132]</a></sup> 'Traditionally, property was inherited matrilineally.

When the Tuscarora joined the League in 1722, no new sachem positions were created for it. The council was a legislative, executive and judicial body that deliberated only on the external affairs of the confederacy, such as peace and war, and on matters common to the five constituent tribes.

Below the level of the League council were separate tribal councils concerned with the internal affairs of each tribe and each tribe's relations with external groups. The tribal council was composed of the sachems who represented the tribe on the League council. Sachem positions were hereditary within each tribe and belonged to particular matrisibs. The women of the matrisib nominated each new sachem, who was always a male, and had the power to recall or "dehorn" a chief who failed to represent the interests of his people. Theoretically, each sachem was equal to the others in power, but in practice those with better oratorial skills wielded greater influence. After the confederacy had been functioning for a period of time a new, nonhereditary office of Pine Tree Chief was created to provide local leadership and to act as advisors to the council sachems, although later they actually sat on the League council and equaled the sachems in power. Pine Tree Chiefs held their position for life and were chosen by the women of a matrisib on the basis of skill in warfare.'<sup id="cite_ref-1136" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1136">[1,136]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ bravery ♣ present ♥</b> Warriors signalled their status with special ornaments: 'Charles Eastman (1971) provides an interesting and excellent example of the relationship of symbols to the event from his Indian boyhood experiences. A Plains Indian was identified as a warrior through an elaborate set of symbols that included eagle feathers, down, non-eagle feathers, paint, and weasel skin. A single upright eagle feather signaled the warrior had counted coup (touched his enemy upon his fall), while a feather hanging downward indicated he had been wounded in the same battle he counted coup, and a full war bonnet meant an Indian had been successful in ten battles. The Indian was a warrior, not because he wore feathers, but because he had participated in battle. The feathers signified, post hoc, the warrior's feats of bravery to the community.'<sup id="cite_ref-1137" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1137">[1,137]</a></sup> Skilled warriors could become war leaders: 'In addition to the position of hereditary chief (called variously sachem, peace chief, lord of the League, or federal chief) there were three categories of achieved chieftainships. A warrior might become a war chief through demonstrating bravery and leadership ability. Men of wisdom, intellectual superiority, or oratory skill might obtain pine tree chief status. Finally, men by virtue of age and wisdom could become chiefs of the village council. The achieved chieftainships terminated upon the [Page 46] death of the individual and were not passed on to others in the family. Originally, war chiefs and pine tree chiefs were advisers and counsellors to the sachems, but in time they assumed an equality with the sachems (Morgan 1969:71, 1870:99-101; Fenton 1961:269; see also Tooker 1964:43).'<sup id="cite_ref-1138" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1138">[1,138]</a></sup> Bravery was valued and was subject to ritual elaboration: 'The rite of Personal Chant is ancient with the Iroquois. Each individual has his own set of songs which are to some extent the property of his family and possibly his clan. They range in character from war chants, through a motley series of ridiculous songs frequently having sexual reference, to personal thanksgiving for members of one's family or a “friend.” It is the song of adoption by the clan. It is the last song sung by a warrior in torture or on the point of death, and each individual takes one with him “on the long trail” to the hereafter. The individual stands and sings part of his song and then, hesitatingly placing one heel forward, rocks his weight onto his toes as his other foot lags, and then advances in the rhythm of his chant. Thus he traverses the length of the room and returns. Men chant in unison and women clap hands. It is one of the Four Ceremonies which the Seneca believe were given to them by the Creator, and which were exalted by Handsome Lake (Fenton, 1936 b, p. 16; 1942, pp. 18-20). Of the many accounts coming down to us in the earlier literature, attesting its long use, Lafitau comes closest to conveying the real spirit of the chant. Each individual knocks a post and paces out his song. Then they publicly present the heads of dogs, which were cooked in the soup, to the greatest warriors to excite their courage. They shame the timid into enlisting by putting ashes on their heads. Only those who have proved their bravery may strike one of the assistants as if he were an enemy, and those who misrepresent pay forfeits of presents to the injured (Lafitau, 1724, vol. 1, pp. 521-523; vol. 2, pp. 189-191).'<sup id="cite_ref-1139" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1139">[1,139]</a></sup> Fenton describes war dances and other ceremonial events where bravery was celebrated: 'The Night before they set out, they make a grand Feast; to this all the noted Warriors of the Nation are invited; and here they have their War Dance, to the Beat of a Kind of a Kettle-drum. The Warriors are seated in two Rows in the House, and each rises up in his Turn, and sings the great Acts he has himself performed, and the Deeds of his Ancestors; and this is always accompanied with a Kind of Dance, or rather Action, representing the Manner in which they were performed; and from Time to Time, all present join in a Chorus, applauding every notable Act. They exaggerate the Injuries they have at any Time received from their Enemies, and extol the Glory which any of their Ancestors have gained by their Bravery and Courage; so that they work up their Spirits to a high degree of warlike Enthusiasm. I have sometimes persuaded some of their young Indians to act these Dances, for our Diversion, and to show us the Manner of them; and even, on these Occasions, they have work'd themselves up to such a pitch, that they have made all present uneasy.

At this feast the common dance is the dance of the calumet (Pwauk[unknown][unknown] na m[unknown][unknown] hendgee). It is danced by four persons only. Four grand calumets are laid upon a mat on the ground, ornamented in full with the feathers of the eagle. A pole is placed in the ground near this, and when the dancers are ready to commence, one of the war chiefs marches to the place of deposit, picks up a pipe and striking the pole with the stem, recounts in a loud voice the many feats of bravery which he has performed, and in conclusion says that all those things are smoothed down by the late happy agreement between the contending parties. He then turns about and selecting some active young man he gives him the pipe and desires him to dance. The young man leads off, keeping time to the musick of a drum &amp; gourd which are in the hand of some of the bystanders. He does not dance long before another chief or great warrior goes to the mat and taking another pipe, pursues the same course just described. In this way the pipes are all distributed, and the dancers are occasionally relieved by the speech of a warrior who rises, picks up a piece of tobacco or a knife and striking the post there with recounts his deeds in war.'<sup id="cite_ref-1142" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1142">[1,142]</a></sup> Warfare and hunting featured prominently in the socialization of boys, at least before the reservation period: 'At the age at which sex differentiation entered the socializing process, boys formed age-grade groups which mimicked the hunting and warlike occupations of the men. These groups initiated the process of weaning the males away from the control of the family of orientation. Whereas the training of girls bound them more closely to the family group, the association of the boys with their age mates in the village freed them from kin associations and laid the foundation for future hunting and war parties. When a boy was about fourteen and able to accompany the men on hunting trips, his father and other men of the hunting party took an interest in training him in the use of bow and arrow and other manly weapons. The men of the tribe recounted, for the benefit of the growing generation, their exploits on the warpath in order to instill in the youth ideals of courage and patriotism. The game of la crosse also provided valuable training for the warpath Like his sister, the boy was also influenced by attendance at religious ceremonies where the faithkeepers delivered addresses explaining the system of Iroquois supernaturals and admonishing the people to be thankful and obedient to the Great Spirit and to the moral codes of the nation.'<sup id="cite_ref-1143" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1143">[1,143]</a></sup> Fenton's material indicates that accusing someone of cowardice was a major insult: 'Throughout the first half of the eighteenth century the Iroquois were at war with the “Flathead” or Catawba in Carolina, a cause in which their young men gained prestige by taking scalps and bringing home prisoners to replenish losses of manpower, although many Catawba were tortured. French agents among the Five Nations greatly aided and abetted these campaigns to the great distress of the English colonists who suffered depredations along the Warriors' Path, which roughly followed the fall line east of the mountains from Pennsylvania to Carolina. British policy was to secure these Indians against the French, and the colonial governors were instructed to make peace between the warring tribes. As early as 1741, the Cherokee and Catawba agreed to consider a peace settlement which the Six Nations offered through the good offices of the Governors of New York and Carolina. The Cherokee sent some beads, a pipe, an eagle's tail, and a white flag which they had taken from the French. The Catawba sent a wampum belt, a pipe of peace, and tobacco. The belt which the Iroquois had sent was to be kept in one of the principal Cherokee towns (O'Callaghan, 1855, vol. 6, pp. 208, 210-211). The Creek also told the Carolina authorities that they desired peace, but the Catawba ended by refusing all such propositions and calling the Cherokee “Old Women” (Milling, 1940, p. 243).

In the 1980s matrilineal inheritance continued to be practiced among Iroquois on reservations in the United States, but not so for those in Canada, where the government has enforced a patrilineal system of inheritance.'<sup id="cite_ref-1149" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1149">[1,149]</a></sup> 'Nations' owned priviledged access to natural resources in their territory: 'Seasonal return to hunting and fishing economy meant that Iroquois villages were abandoned periodically. From the harvest to midwinter, families went to the woods to hunt for meat, seeking hunting partners in settlements adjacent to hunting grounds. Villages were again evacuated in early spring: (1) a short removal to the nearby sugar bush for several weeks, (2) for a longer period in March and April to attend pigeon nestings, and (3) to nearby fishing sites. In all these activities a semblance of local organization was maintained. Village and tribal holdings in sugar bush, pigeon nesting sites, and fishing places formed a continuous territory with the farm and ordinary hunting lands of the village. Major pigeon nestings and longterm fall hunts were carried on at some remove from the village settlements and required the movement of persons from say Buffalo some 70 or 80 miles to south of Warren, Pa. (Fenton and Deardorff, 1943, p. 296 and map). Villages tended to move within rather narrow orbits, quite definitely within the above territory, moving to perhaps a day's walk from the old settlement, frequently the “old town” giving way to the “new town” as a gradual development of one out of the other. At earlier times the movements were more abrupt (Fenton, 1940). Use of hunting territory, fishing sites, berrying grounds, and medicinal plant stations were deemed local privileges belonging to the inhabitants of that place. Ultimately, such ownership rested in the tribe or “nation.” To this day the title of lands rests in the nation; nothing like the Algonquian type of individual hunting territories was known. A Cayuga hunter, however, was careful to leave the pelt in the Seneca nation's territory, vouchsafing a privilege which was not extended to alien tribes outside the League. Similarly the use of fields and cemeteries will redound to local inhabitants. To the extent that coresidents are related unilaterally, [Page 43] clan fields will adjoin; cemeteries will contain the bones of predominately one clan.'<sup id="cite_ref-1150" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1150">[1,150]</a></sup> Land was thus generally held in common, but individuals retained usufruct rights in lands which they themselves had opened for cultivation: 'Property, both in amount and variety, was exceedingly limited; as would naturally be expected among a people living a hunter and semi-agricultural life, and making a mere subsistence the limit of their wants and of their ambition. But inconsiderable as it was in the aggregate, it was held, and subject to distribution, under fixed laws. Having neither currency nor trade, nor the love of gain, their property consisted merely of planting lots, orchards, houses, implements of the chase, weapons, articles of apparel, domestic utensils, personal ornaments, stores of grain, skins of animals, and those miscellaneous fabrics which the necessities of life led them to invent. The rights of property, of both husband and wife, were continued distinct during the existence of the marriage relation; the wife holding, and controlling her own, the same as her husband, and in case of separation, taking it with her. No individual could obtain the absolute title to land, as that was vested by the laws of the Iroquois in all the people; but he could reduce unoccupied lands to cultivation, to any extent he pleased; and so long as he continued to use them, his right to their enjoyment was protected and secured. He could also sell his improvements, or bequeath them to his wife or children. If the wife, either before or after marriage, inherited orchards, or planting lots, or reduced land to cultivation, she could dispose of them at her pleasure, and in case of her death they were inherited, together with her other effects, by her children. The rule of descent, on the death of the father, was different. His children, not being [Page 318] of his tribe, were out of the line of inheritance; for by their laws, property could not, by descent, pass out of the tribe. If he gave his planting lots, or any articles of property to his wife or children, in the presence of a witness, they were allowed to hold them. But if he made no disposition of his effects, they were handed over upon his decease, to the near relatives in his own tribe, who usually assigned to the family the house, and such other articles as they deemed advisable, and distributed the residue among themselves, as personal mementos of the deceased.'<sup id="cite_ref-1151" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1151">[1,151]</a></sup> However, some differentiation of wealth was present: 'The distinction of rich and poor was known among the Iroquois, as applying both to the individual and to the house. [Page 274] Even in the same clan one house might be wealthy and the other poor. Property rnight be transferred by gift or purchase, by gambling, as a hire of labor, but rather as a fee than a wage, or in payment of damages for a tort.'<sup id="cite_ref-1152" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1152">[1,152]</a></sup> Morgan provides a general summary of the property system: 'The tribe had its property also, -- its lands, tenements, and hereditaments. These included (1) the territories which it occupied, the boundaries being, as elsewhere mentioned, as definite as those of a modern state; and by ownership of the and is meant not merely sovereignty, but that the tribe was he actual and sole owner of the fee of the soil. An individual, a house, or a clan could acquire no right to land beyond the term of actual occupation. (2) Rights of toll from ersons passing through the public domain. (3) Rights of hunting, fishing, and trading in any new countries discovered by a citizen. (4) The tribe had also a public treasury, conaining not only archives, records, and maps, but also personal [Page 273] property of all kinds, even including slaves, and usually it owned a council house.'<sup id="cite_ref-1153" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1153">[1,153]</a></sup> 'Expenses of war (but a comparatively small portion of these), of public gifts, and of the entertainment of ambassadors were among the charges which fell upon the public treasury.'<sup id="cite_ref-1154" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1154">[1,154]</a></sup> 'Everything else belonged to the clan or to the house, between which, as often, it is not easy to discriminate in all details. The house owned the communal dwelling, the chattels of general use that it contained, and all that might be brought into it as trophies of war or the chase or the product of agriculture. In brief, the product of the labor of a member of the house belonged to the house; and as a curious illustration of this a newly discovered cure for disease was the property of the house.'<sup id="cite_ref-1155" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1155">[1,155]</a></sup> 'The clan owned the lives of its members; these lives it might itself take, or if any one else took them the right to compensation belonged to the clan. As a member of the clan or household an individual had the right to a place in the dwelling, to a share in its food supply, and to the exclusive possession of a field. When he died or emigrated the clan was his heir, or, more accurately, his administrator. All property which by law he might not take with him, he might distribute before his departure; but if he failed to do so it was distributed by the clan, usually to his nearest relatives. If an apartment or a planting lot were abandoned, it reverted to the general stock, and might with the approval of the clan or house be occupied by another.'<sup id="cite_ref-1156" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1156">[1,156]</a></sup> 'By the use of the pronoun “he” it is by no means intended to exclude the female. A woman might have her individual property, her ornaments, or her field, but for obvious reasons the man, who was a stranger and sojourner in the dwelling where he abode, would accumulate more separate estate than the woman who was of it.'<sup id="cite_ref-1157" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1157">[1,157]</a></sup> But individuals privately owned movables: 'The individual owned, to use a convenient measure, only that he could carry with him; his clothing and ornaments, the mat on which he slept, his weapons, his pipe, and his kettle. These and no more he could take with him when he emigrated, and they were buried with him when he died. As a member of the house, clan, or tribe, he had a special property in other chattels and in land so long as he was in possession and use thereof as a member of the community. But when his relation ended his rights ended also.'<sup id="cite_ref-1158" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1158">[1,158]</a></sup> The colonial government initially restricted the 'privatization' of Iroquois property: 'The lands of the Iroquois are still held in common, the title being vested in the people. Their progress towards a higher agricultural life has rendered this ancient tenure a source of inconvenience; although they are not as yet prepared for their division among the people. Each individual can improve and enclose any portion of their common domain, and sell or retain such improvements, in the same manner as with personal property; but they have no power to transfer [Page 119] the title to the land to each other, or to strangers. (101) As early as the reign of James the Second, the right of purchasing Indian lands was made a government right exclusively, by royal proclamation, and it proved such a necessary shield against the rapacity of speculators, that this humane provision is still retained as a law in all the States of the Union, and by the national government. When the Iroquois reach such a stable position, as agriculturists, as to make it safe to divide their lands among the several families of each nation, with the power of alienation, it will give to them that stimulus and ambition which separate rights of property are so well calculated to produce. The present system has at least the merit of saving all the people from poverty and vagrancy, if it does not enable a portion of them to become thrifty and substantial agriculturists. The first step towards the amelioration of their condition in this particular, would be a division among themselves, with the power of alienation to each other, under such restrictions as would be adapted to the case. This would serve to prepare the way for other changes, until finally they could be restored, with safety to themselves, not only to the full possession of those rights of property which are common to ourselves, but also to the rights and privileges of citizens of the State. When this time arrives, they will cease to be Indians, except in name.'<sup id="cite_ref-1159" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1159">[1,159]</a></sup> According to Morgan, theft was virtually unknown: 'Theft, the most despicable of human crimes, was scarcely known among them. In the days of their primitive simplicity, a m[unknown] rcenary thought had not entered the Indian mind. After the commencement of their intercourse with the whites, the distribution of presents and of ardent spirits among them, and the creation of new kinds of property by the pursuits of trade, so far corrupted the habits of the Indian, that in some instances the vagrant and intemperate were led to the commission of this offence. But in justice to them it must be acknowledged, that no people ever possessed a higher sense of honor and self-respect in this particular, or looked down with greater disdain upon this shameful practice, than did the Iroquois. To this day, among their descendants, this offence is almost unknown. No locks, or bolts, or private repositories were ever necessary for the protection of property among themselves. The lash of public indignation, the severest punishment known to the red man, was the only [Page 325] penalty attached to this dereliction from the path of integrity.'<sup id="cite_ref-1160" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1160">[1,160]</a></sup> This points towards respect for the property of others. Given the possibility to own movables and the fact that territorial rights were attached to specific clans and nations even before the reservation period, we have provisionally coded 'present'.</dd></dl>
<p><b>♠ Moralistic punishment by human religious agents ♣ absent: 1566-1660 CE; present: 1661-1713 CE ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. eHRAF provides the following general summary: 'The supernatural world of the Iroquois included numerous deities, the most important of which was Great Spirit, who was responsible for the creation of men, the plants and, animals and the forces of good in nature. The Iroquois believed that Great Spirit indirectly guided the lives of ordinary men. Other important deities were Thunderer and the Three Sisters, the spirits of Maize, Beans and Squash. Opposing the Great Spirit and the other forces of good were Evil Spirit and other lesser spirits responsible for disease and other misfortune. In the Iroquois view ordinary humans could not communicate directly with Great Spirit, but could do so indirectly by burning tobacco, which carried their prayers to the lesser spirits of good. The Iroquois regarded dreams as important supernatural signs and serious attention was given to interpreting dreams. It was believed that dreams expressed the desire of the soul and as a result the fulfillment of a dream was of paramount importance to the individual.'<sup id="cite_ref-1161" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1161">[1,161]</a></sup> 'Full time religious specialists were absent, however, there were part-time male and female specialists known as Keepers of the Faith whose primary responsibilities were to arrange and conduct the main religious ceremonies.

In the sequence of occurrence, the 6 major ceremonies were the Maple, Planting, Strawberry, Green Maize, Harvest and Mid-Winter or New Year's festivals. The first 5 festivals in this sequence involved public confessions followed by group ceremonies which included speeches by the Keepers of the Faith, tobacco offerings and prayer. The New Year's festival was usually held in early February and was marked by dream interpretations and the sacrifice of a white dog offered to purge the people of evil.'<sup id="cite_ref-1163" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1163">[1,163]</a></sup> Shamans and members of curing societies acted as healers: 'The clairvoyant was consulted in order to determine the success of a war, the secret cause of a malady and to secure the magic knowledge which would cause good luck for a hunting or fishing party (Ibid. 373). A shaman status also existed. A shaman was a clairveyant who communicated to the spirits and proceeded to cure the malady. Jesuit Father de Quens described the activities of a shaman: 'Toward evening of the ninth of January, we were spectators of the most subtle sorcery of the country employed for the cure of a sick woman of our cabin who had long been ailing. The Sorcorer entered with a tortoise shell in his hand, half full of small pebbles, - such are their instruments of nagic. He teek a seat in the midst of a dozon women who were to help him in banishing the disease and the neighbors gathered about to see this superstitious ceremony. All it consists in is that the magician strikes the tortoise shell against the mat, and intones a song; while the [Page 26] women danced about him in time with his singing and with the noise of the tortoise shell. You see them move their feet, arms, head and entire body with such violence that great drops of sweat cover their bodies. At the first trial the disease was not expelled or at the third; this caused the dance to be prolonged far into the night. (J. R. 1959, 42:148-149)<i><sup id="cite_ref-1164" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1164">[1,164]</a></sup> 'The medicine societies were pan-longhouse. Each society followed a similar pattern. The cures took place in a longhouse, if the cured was a stranger, but the rites were usually performed in private houses. First, there was a tobacce invecation. If the cure was in the Longhouse, the faithkeeper of that specific Longhouse would recite a prayer to the Creater before the invocation. Second, each society member sang his song with the leader of the society singing last. Third, the dance leader of the opposite side of the moiety of the person being cured performed a curing dance. Fourth, a feast was held. If the cure occurred in the longhouse, the society members took their pail of corn soup and then departed. If the feast occurred in a private house all the feed was [Page 100] consumed on the spot (Goldenweiser, Fieldnotes Book 10:25; 16:32).'<sup id="cite_ref-1165" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1165">[1,165]</a></sup> But we have found no evidence of shamans and healers performing moralistic punishment. Keepers of the Faith performed public confessions: 'This was the first festival of the spring. It was usually called the Maple Dance. The primary idea of this ceremonial was to return thanks to the maple itself; but at the same time they rendered their thanks to the Great Spirit for the gift of the maple. It lasted but one day. When the sap began to flow, the keepers of the faith announced the time and place for commemorating the recurrence of this event, and summoned the people to assemble for that purpose. Some days before the time appointed for the festival, the people assembled for the mutual confession of their sins, both as an act of religious duty, and as a preparation for the council. This act preceded all the festivals; but it was more general and thorough at the three last than at the three first, as they were deemed more important, and continued for a greater length of time. This council, Sa-nun-dät-ha-wä[unknown] -ta, literally “a meeting for repentance,” was opened by one of the keepers of the faith, with an address upon the propriety and importance of acknowledging their evil deeds, to strengthen their minds against future temptations. He then took the string of white wampum in his hand, and set the example by a confession of his own faults; after which he handed the string to the one nearest to him, who received it, made his confession in like manner, and passed it to another. In this way the wampum went around from hand to hand; and those who had confessions to make stated wherein they had done wrong, and promised to do better in [Page 181] the future. Old and young, men, women, and even children all united in this public acknowledgment of their faults, and joined in the common resolution of amendment. On some occasions the string of wampum was placed in the centre of the room, and each one advanced in turn to perform the duty, as the inclination seized him. A confession and promise without holding the wampum would be of no avail. It was the wampum which recorded their words, and gave their pledge of sincerity. The object of the confession was future amendment. The Iroquois appear to have had no idea either of the atonement or of the forgiveness of sins. Meritorious acts neutralized evil deeds, but neither the one nor the other, when done, could be recalled, or changed, or obliterated.'<sup id="cite_ref-1166" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1166">[1,166]</a></sup> 'We may take it that the culture which Jackson describes is what he and his friends found in 1798. He says the Indians believe in one all-wise being they call How-wa-neeo; an evil spirit, Nish-she-o-nee; and a place of happiness for the good. He mentions no equivalent of Hell. Twice a year preliminary to their Worship Dances an examination of men, women, and children takes place, “whether they have committed any offenses or evil acts. Of these it is often the case that the offender makes confession, the design of which is, that all wrong things may be done away and reconciliation take place . . . and a promise on the part of the aggressor to try to do better for the future; which done, the council then assembled forgive them.” He describes “the Harvest Dance” and the Personal Chant, “the thanking or cheer songs.” These two, with the Great Feather Dance and Bowl Game, constitute the Four Sacred Ceremonies of the Good Message. It is notable that all four were associated originally with the two sober Worship Dances, rather than with their “frequent banquets, in which they regale themselves with strong liquors, and pass whole nights in singing, dancing, and music” (Jackson, 1830 a, pp. 23-31).'<sup id="cite_ref-1167" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1167">[1,167]</a></sup> We have assumed that the confessions performed by Keepers of the Faith constitute moralistic enforcement by religious agents. We have assumed that these rituals were introduced during contact with missionaries, but this remains in need of confirmation. Expert input is needed on the matter. Accordingly, the date of transition we selected is only provisional. The role of ritual specialists in the reservation-period Handsome Lake movement was clearly moralistic: 'A core of knowledgeable old men became speakers and faithkeepers and leaders in the curing societies and thus became dominant in the religious life of the Longhouse community. Specifically, an elder male succeeded to the office of a Handsome Lake preacher. The preacher recited yearly 130 parables that were the ethical commandments upon which Indian behavier rested. He had two male assistants, known as “guardians of the good message”, to help him in his duties. The chart below illustrates male, fomale stratification in office holding.'<sup id="cite_ref-1168" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1168">[1,168]</a></sup></i>

<dl><dd> <b>♠ physical punishment ♣ present ♥</b> While there was no formal criminal code, some conventions concerning punishment and dispute resolution were present. Informal social control was important, but capital punishment, expulsion, compensation, and loss of status were all known and practiced: 'Cadwallader Colden observed the League in action many times as they gathered in council with the English at Albany, New York. He wrote of them: Each Nation is an absolute Republick by itself, govern'd in all Public Affairs of War and Peace by the Sachems or Old Men, whose authority and Power is gained by and consists wholly in the Opinions the rest of the Nation have of their Wisdom and Integrity. They never execute their Resolutions by Compulsion or Force upon any of their People. Honor and Esteem are their Principal Reward, as Shame and being Despised are their Punishments. They have certain Customs which they observe in their Public Affairs with other Nations, and in their private Affairs among themselves, which it is scandalous for anyone not to observe, and draw after them public or private Resentment when they are broke. [Page 75] A little later he added that he thinks of the present state of the Indians as showing the “most Ancient and Original Condition of almost every Nation; so I believe, here we may with more certainty see the Original Form of all Government ...” Apparently Colden did not realize that the rules governing the Five Nations had been codified many years ago and that while the law was sanctioned by shame, it was also enforced by stringent punishment ranging from death and expulsion to the loss of position as chief. This was no primitive or “Original form of all governments,” but a subtle and complicated system for the control of five disparate nations.'<sup id="cite_ref-1169" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1169">[1,169]</a></sup> 'Law and order within the Iroquoian confederacies lay wholly within the jurisdiction of the tribes, resting in the final analysis with the individual villages. The penalty for treason or witchcraft was death, after summary trial and conviction before a council of the villages; but compounding was permissible and usual in the case of all other offenses. “They have only one method of justice for injuries, which is that the whole village must make amends by presents. For a Huron killed by a Huron, they are generally content with thirty presents; for a woman forty are demanded, because, they say, women can not so easily defend themselves . . . for a stranger, still more are exacted; because they say that otherwise murders would be too frequent, trade would be prevented, and wars would too easily arise between different nations.” (Jesuit Relations.) . . . . Minor offenses were punishable in the same way as murder, but for refractory individuals who continually disturbed the tranquility of the community there loomed in the background outlawry, which deprived them of all legal protection and permitted anyone to kill them on sight. On the whole, public opinion and the knowledge that the entire village would be held responsible for wrong-doing seem to have proved adequate safeguards, and the domestic life of the Iroquoians was probably no less peaceful than our own. Theft was comparatively rare, for land was the property of the community, surplus food was commonly shared with needier neighbours, the long bark dwelling belonged to the maternal family, and personal property like the tools and weapons of the men, the household goods and utensils of the [Page 33] women, were so easily replaced that they possessed little value. Practically the only objects open to theft were the strings of wampum beads that served both as ornaments and currency; but such was the community of spirit of the Iroquoians, so little did they esteem individual wealth, that a multitude of beads brought neither honour nor profit except so far as it gave the owner an opportunity to display his liberality by lavish contributions to the public coffers. (Pages 135-39.)'<sup id="cite_ref-1170" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1170">[1,170]</a></sup> Witches were executed occasionally: 'Witchcraft was the most serious type of anti-social behavior. The Iroquois believed that witches, in concert with the Evil Spirit, could cause disease, accident, death, or other misfortune. Because witches were thought to be able to transform themselves into other objects, they were difficult to catch and punish.'<sup id="cite_ref-1171" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1171">[1,171]</a></sup> 'Part time religious specialists known as Keepers of the Faith served in part to censure anti-social behavior. Unconfessed witches detected through council proceedings were punished with death, while those who confessed might be allowed to reform.'<sup id="cite_ref-1172" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1172">[1,172]</a></sup> 'A class of witches existed who were belioved to cause illness or other maladies. The Iroquois belief in witchcraft functioned as a positive social control to limit the number of deviants (Lafitau, 1724, 1:500). However, it must have produced severe disruption in the society as a kinsman was obliged to kill fellow kinsmen (Seaver, 1918:173-175).'<sup id="cite_ref-1173" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1173">[1,173]</a></sup> 'Crimes and offences were so unfrequent under their social system, that the Iroquois can scarcely be said to have had a criminal code. Yet there were certain misdemeanors which fell under the judicial cognizance of the sachems, and were punished by them in proportion to their magnitude. Witchcraft was punishable with death. Any person could take the life of a witch when discovered in the act. If this was not done, a council was called, and the witch arraigned before it, in the presence of the accuser. A full confession, with a promise of amendment, secured a discharge. But if the accusation was denied, witnesses [Page 322] were called and examined concerning the circumstances of the case; and if they established the charge to the satisfaction of the council, which they rarely failed to do, condemnation followed, with a sentence of death. The witch was then delivered over to such executioners as volunteered for the purpose, and by them was led away to punishment. After the decision of the council, the relatives of the witch gave him up to his doom without a murmur.'<sup id="cite_ref-1174" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1174">[1,174]</a></sup> Blood vengeance was practiced in retaliation for murder, at least before the reservation period, and regulated through reciprocal obligations among kin and affines: 'The members of matrisibs cooperated in economic activities and were obligated to avenge the death or injury of any other member. Moieties had reciprocal and complementary ceremonial functions and competed against one another in games. Matrisibs cut across tribal boundaries so that members were found in each tribe and village and often within each longhouse.'<sup id="cite_ref-1175" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1175">[1,175]</a></sup> 'The Iroquois traced descent through the female line of lineage “Ohwatjira”. A man's children belonged to his wife's ledge not his own. However, the wife and her lineage had affinial obligations to her husband and his lineage. First, the son had to supply his “akateni”, i.e., [Page 18] father's maternal kinsmen's lineage, with suitable captives to replace their dead members. Second, the son had to support his akatoni in blood vendettas. Third, the matron of one's akatoni lineage could control the war activities of the “brothers sons” by either demanding that a raid take place or by prohibiting one. The akatoni lineage had reoiprecal obligations to the “Ohwatjira”, mother's kinsmen. Fourth, the akatoni had to perform the burial service and prepare the body of the “wives”, “sons” or “daughters” of other lineages at the common burial, Feast of the Dead and General Feast of the Dead. Fifth, limited rules of exogamy applied to one's closest akatoni (Lafitau, 1724, 1:559). Sixth, the husband had reciprecal duties in the alliance as he supplied his wife's lineage with produce. Lafitau (1724, 1:580) observed that during the first year of marriage all the husband's hunt went to his wife's household.'<sup id="cite_ref-1176" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1176">[1,176]</a></sup> 'A wife had many obligations to the husband's maternal household such as securing firewood and cultivating their gardon. In doing these tasks she was under her mother-in-law's authority. Iroquois residence was shifting matrilecal to patrilocal type, the spouse making periodic visits to the different households (J.R., 43:265). Consequently, when the wife was in her husband's ledge she was subservient to his mother. The husband was subservient to his mother-in-law when in her household. He was not permitted even to speak to his wife's parents until the birth of his first child. The mother-in-law regulated the husband's war efforts. She could force him into blood vendettas or stop his raiding. As stated previously, Wallace (1966) argued that mothers sometimes attempted to force divorces by turning their daughters against their husbands.'<sup id="cite_ref-1177" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1177">[1,177]</a></sup> Non-Iroquois 'replacement captives' taken in the aftermath of murder were occasionally executed, but more commonly adopted: 'The women exercised political power in three main circumstances. First, whenever one of the forty-nine chiefs of the great intertribal League of the Iroquois died, the senior women of his lineage nominated his successor. Second, when tribal or village decisions had to be made, both men and women attended a kind of town meeting, and while men were the chiefs and normally did the public speaking, the women caucused behind the scenes and lobbied with the spokesmen. Third, a woman was entitled to demand publicly that a murdered kinsman or kinswoman be replaced by a captive from a non-Iroquois tribe, and her male relatives, particularly lineage kinsmen, were morally obligated to go out in a war party to secure captives, whom the bereaved woman might either adopt or consign to torture and death. Adoption was so frequent during the bloody centuries of the beaver wars and the colonial wars that some Iroquois villages were preponderantly composed of formally adopted war captives. In sum, Iroquois women were entitled formally to select chiefs, to participate in consensual politics, and to start wars.'<sup id="cite_ref-1178" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1178">[1,178]</a></sup> Alternatively, reconciliation between the relevant families was possible. Morgan describes the process: 'The greatest of all human crimes, murder, was punished with death; but the act was open to condonation. Unless the family were appeased, the murderer, as with the ancient Greeks, was given up to their private vengeance. They could take his life whenever they found him, even after the lapse of years, without being held accountable. A present of white wampum, sent on the part of the murderer to the family of his victim, when accepted, forever obliterated and wiped out the memory of the transaction. (101) Immediately on the commission of a murder, the affair was taken up by the tribes to which the parties belonged, and strenuous efforts were made to effect a reconciliation, lest private retaliation should lead to disastrous consequences. If the criminal belonged [Page 323] to one of the first four tribes, and the deceased to one of the second four, these tribes assembled in separate councils, (57) to inquire into all the facts of the case. The question of the guilt or innocence of the accused was generally an easy matter to determine, when the consequences of guilt were open to condonation. The first council then ascertained whether the offender was willing to confess his crime, and to make atonement. If he was, the council immediately sent a belt of white wampum, in his name, to the other council, which contained a message to that effect. The latter then endeavored to pacify the family of the deceased, to quiet their excitement, and to induce them to accept the wampum in condonation. If this was not sent in due time, or the family resisted all persuasions to receive it, then their revenge was allowed to take its course. Had it chanced that both parties belonged to one of the four brother tribes, a council of this division alone would convene, to attempt an adjustment among themselves. If, however, the family continued implacable, the further interference of mutual friends was given over, leaving the question to be settled between the murderer and the kindred of his victim, according to the ancient usage. If the belt of wampum was received before the avenger had been appointed, and had left the lodge on his mission, it was usually accepted as a condonation, but if he had gone forth, the time for reparation had passed. The family then either took upon themselves jointly the obligation of taking what they deemed a just retribution, or appointed an avenger, who resolved never to rest until life had [Page 324] answered for life. In such cases, the murderer usually fled. As all quarrels were generally reconciled by the relatives of the parties, long-cherished animosities, and consequently homicides, were unfrequent in ancient times. The present of white wampum was not in the nature of a compensation for the life of the deceased, but of a regretful confession of the crime, with a petition for forgiveness. It was a peace-offering, the acceptance of which was pressed by mutual friends, and under such influences that a reconciliation was usually effected, except perhaps, in aggravated cases of premeditated murder.'<sup id="cite_ref-1179" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1179">[1,179]</a></sup> According to Selden, the peaceful settlement of disputes was common and enabled by the fact that clans and matrisibs crossed 'national' boundaries due to exogamy: 'This would mean that a warrior of the Bear clan was related to every Bear clan member in all of the Five Nations. If he marries a girl from the Wolf clan, then he becomes related by marriage to every Wolf clan member in all the Five Nations. Since the clan organization of society is an ancient widespread institution, it cannot logically be claimed that Deganaweda started the tradition. But putting the customs into a succint oral law and extending it to cover allied tribes may have re-enforced the custom and helped to unify the League. Certainly any quarrels that arose under such a kinship society were apt to be peacefully settled, since pressure on the quarreling factions was exerted by families of two clans. A Seneca warrior's dispute with a Mohawk might involve his wife's own clan, for example, so he would not be likely to settle the issue by using his tomahawk. Indeed, it is possible that this brief stipulation of the Code did more than any political regulation to bring about peace and harmony among the Five Nations.'<sup id="cite_ref-1180" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1180">[1,180]</a></sup></dd>

The Council had apparently never developed sanctions applicable to the individual offender. When its chief concern was extending the League, the war party was an effective sanction, however, this means of enforcing coordination was not adapted to internal application. Only one sanction was recorded which could be evoked against any and all members of the League, removal of a citizen from the band roll (Joseph Wright vs. Council, p. 135).

The tribal council was composed of the sachems who represented the tribe on the League council. Sachem positions were hereditary within each tribe and belonged to particular matrisibs. The women of the matrisib nominated each new sachem, who was always a male, and had the power to recall or "dehorn" a chief who failed to represent the interests of his people. Theoretically, each sachem was equal to the others in power, but in practice those with better oratorial skills wielded greater influence. After the confederacy had been functioning for a period of time a new, nonhereditary office of Pine Tree Chief was created to provide local leadership and to act as advisors to the council sachems, although later they actually sat on the League council and equaled the sachems in power.

<dl><dd> <b>♠ The state regulates banking ♣ absent ♥</b> Note: 'Traditionally, the Iroquois were farmers and hunters who practiced a slash-and-burn form of horticulture. In addition, they fished and gathered berries, plants, and roots. Before the arrival of Europeans the primary weapons were bows and arrows, stone axes and knives and blowguns, however, by the late seventeenth century European trade goods had almost completely replaced the traditional weapons and tools. The principal crops were maize, beans, and squash which, in addition, were prominent in ceremonial activities. In good years surplus crops were dried and stored for future use. After the harvest of crops in the late summer, the seasonal round included fall hunting that lasted until the winter solstice, early spring fishing and hunting of passenger pigeons, and then spring and summer clearing and planting of fields.' <sup id="cite_ref-1188" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1188">[1,188]</a></sup> Labour was divided according to age and gender: 'Traditionally, men hunted and fished, built houses, cleared fields for planting, and were responsible for trade and warfare. In addition, men had the more visible roles in tribal and confederacy politics. Farming was the responsibility of women, whose work also included gathering wild foods, rearing children, preparing food, and making clothing and baskets and other utensils.' <sup id="cite_ref-1189" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1189">[1,189]</a></sup> 'Economically, the maintenance of the household was a joint undertaking, but the women had the chief responsibility in the care of the fields and the raising of the staple foods. Men and women cooperated in the clearing of new fields, after that the women's group took over. Men's hunting added an important relish to the diet. A good meatprovider was considered the best husband. But hunting was more a prestige and recreation point, than a necessity. Village sites were  changed when the fields near them were exhausted--every 15 or 20 years with this type of horticulture--rather than when the district had been hunted out. Conflicts with pioneers occurred more often over the decimation of the game animals, due to the clearing and planting of large numbers of acres, rather than over the scarcity of arable land. But in this case one must remember that it was the Iroquois men with their developed war patterns who came in contact with the pioneers.' <sup id="cite_ref-1190" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1190">[1,190]</a></sup> Many goods were produced in the community: 'The Iroquois knew how to bend and shape wood when green or after steaming. House frames, pack frames, snowshoes, toboggans, basket rims, lacrosse sticks and other wood products were made using these techniques. Rope was made from the inner bark of hickory, basswood and slippery elm and burden straps and prisoner ties were made from the braided fibers of nettle, milkweed and hemp. Pipes of fired clay were among the many types of items manufactured by the Iroquois.

As the westernmost of the five tribes of the Iroquois League, the Seneca were farthest from the Dutch traders at Albany and the French on the Saint Lawrence and nearest the rich beaver grounds to the west. These beaver grounds became more attractive to the Senecas as their own reliance on European trade goods increased and the beaver available in their own country decreased, leading to the attempts by the Senecato expand their hunting territories. When the Senecas began such efforts is not known, but it is possible that the decision of the Wenro to leave their country near the Iroquois about 1638 and to join the Hurons and Neutrals(JR 16:253, 17:25-29, 21:231-33) was in response to Seneca efforts to gain new hunting territory.' <sup id="cite_ref-1193" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1193">[1,193]</a></sup> 'Growing Iroquois antagonism toward the French was the result of Iroquois victories, particularly those of the Senecas (JR 44:153) in their war with the Eries. However, these victories did not bring peace in the region, but rather an intensification of the war between the Iroquois and Susquehannock--a conflict that forced the Senecas when taking their furs to Albany to travel together in large groups for fear of Susquehannock ambush along the route (JR 47:111). It also led the Senecas to seek peace with the French. They hoped that by making such a peace the French would come and settle among them to protect them and furnish guns (JR 49:141). But the Mohawks, who wished to maintain their control of the fur trade by permitting trade only with Albany, thwarted the efforts of the Upper Iroquois to establish peace withthe French until the French destroyed their villages in 1666 (“Early Iroquoian Contacts with Europeans,” fig. 4,this vol.).' <sup id="cite_ref-1194" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1194">[1,194]</a></sup> 'Although the Senecas remained the most hostile of allthe Iroquois tribes to Jesuit missionaries (JR 60:173,61:21, 159), they allowed La Salle to build a fortified trading post at Niagara in 1679. Although the fort accidentally burned down that year, La Salle had correctly recognized the importance of Niagara to the developing western fur trade. Control of Niagara would mean control of the route between Lake Ontario and Lake Erie, an important gateway to the West.' <sup id="cite_ref-1195" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1195">[1,195]</a></sup> 'The peace the Iroquois established with both France and England in 1701 lasted a half century. It permitted the Iroquois to extend their wars and trading to the south and west and thus exert some control over the beaver trade in these areas. At the same time, they played off the French against the English in the contest between these two European powers for control of this trade and hence control of the continent.' <sup id="cite_ref-1196" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1196">[1,196]</a></sup> The same was true of the Onondaga: 'Both because they were “keepers of the fire” at the capitalof the Confederacy and because of their central locationbetween the Dutch and later the English at Albany andthe French and their Indian allies to the west and north,the Onondaga became the center of intrigue in the playoffsystem that characterized Iroquois policy in theseventeenth and eighteenth centuries (see “Early IroquoianContacts with Europeans,” “The League of the Iroquois: Its History, Politics, and Ritual,” and “Originsof the Longhouse Religion,” this vol.). This intrigueintensified after the Iroquois had defeated the Hurons(who had dominated Indian trade with the French to thenorthwest), the Petuns (allies of the Hurons), and theNeutrals and so eliminated except for the Eries andSusquehannocks the other Iroquoians competing fortrade with the Europeans.

In 1669 the Jesuits reported that nearly all theOnondaga warriors had been killed in this war (JR54:111), perhaps an exaggeration but nevertheless areport that suggests the Onondaga war with the Susquehannockswas taking a heavy toll.' <sup id="cite_ref-1198" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1198">[1,198]</a></sup> 'After the war had ended and the Iroquois had establishedpeace with both the French and English, theOnondagas remained as they had been earlier, about equally divided into pro-English and pro-French factions(NYCD 4:689, 998). After the establishment of peacewith the French in 1701, the French Jesuits returned toOnondaga, but they were forced to leave in 1709 andtheir mission house and chapel were burned (NYCD4:917-920, 9:829, 836, 838). In 1710 the English wereasked to come and build a fort at Onondaga (Wraxall1915:69, 76; NYCD 5:218). Subsequently, tensions betweenthe French and the Onondagas apparently eased,for in 1711 the French built a blockhouse at Onondaga.However, the English arrived and pulled it down (NYCD5:243-244, 248-249; Wraxall 1915:81-87). The Frenchagain attempted in 1715 to build a fort at Onondaga (Wraxall 1915:104-105) but were unsuccessful in doingso.

Of the beads that were manufactured and used by the Iroquois those known as “wampum” are by far the most significant. Though the term wampum has been used in some places to include both the discoidal and the cylindrical beads, the true wampum is an Indian-made shell bead, cylindical in form, averaging about one-quarter of an inch in length by an eighth of an inch in diameter, perfectly straight on the sides, with a hole running through it the long way. Some of the wampum beads prepared for commercial trade were as long as half an inch but none of the long beads has been found in the wampum belts. Wampum was made from the quahaug or hard shell clam (Venus Mercenaria) which provides both white and purple beads.

But the significance of wampum generally is that because it is a valuable object, it is used to indicate the significance of the event, either by giving it as a commemoration of the event or as being shown in remembrance of the event. Wampum belts, for example, were given at treaties to indicate good faith in the making of the treaty, and might be brought out to remind others of the treaty.

The frame consisted of upright poles firmly set in the ground, usually five upon the sides, and four at the ends, including those at the corners. [...] In the centre of the roof was an opening for the smoke, the fire being upon the ground in the centre of the house, and the smoke ascending without the guidance of a chimney. At the two ends of the house were doors, either of bark hung upon hinges of wood, or of deer or bear skins suspended before the opening; and however long the house, or whatever the number of fires, these were the only entrances. Over one of these doors was cut the tribal device of the head of the family. Within, upon the two sides, were arranged wide seats, also of bark  boards, about two feet from the ground, well supported underneath, and reaching the entire length of the house. Upon these they spread their mats of skins, and also their blankets, using them as seats by day and couches at night. Similar berths were constructed on each side, about five feet above these, and secured to the frame of the house, thus furnishing accommodations for the family. Upon cross-poles, near the roof, was hung, in bunches, braided together by the husks, their winter supply of corn. Charred and dried corn, and beans were generally stored in bark barrels, and laid away in corners. Their implements for the chase, domestic utensils, weapons, articles of apparel, and miscellaneous notions, were stowed away, and hung up, whenever an unoccupied place was discovered. A house of this description would accommodate a family of eight, with the limited wants of the Indian, and afford shelter for their necessary stores, making a not uncomfortable residence. After they had learned the use of the axe, they began to substitute houses of hewn logs, but they constructed them after the ancient model. Many of the houses of their modern villages in the valley of the Genesee were of this description.' <sup id="cite_ref-1206" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1206">[1,206]</a></sup> 'At each end of the longhouse, storage booths and platforms were provided for the food that was to be kept in barrels and other large containers.' <sup id="cite_ref-1207" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1207">[1,207]</a></sup> Corn cribs and root cellars are more likely candidates for communal food storage, but this is unclear from the sources: 'The Iroquois built shelters for their farm and garden equipment and well ventilated corn cribs of unpainted planks in which corn could be dried and kept, and they dug underground pits or caches (root cellars) for the storage of corn and other foods. The pit was dug in the dry season, and the bottom and sides lined with bark.

Curing ceremonies consisted of group shamanistic practices directed towards propitiating the responsible supernatural agents. One of the curing groups was the False Face Society. False Face Societies were found in each village and, except for a female Keeper of the False Faces who protected the ritual paraphernalia, consisted only of male members who had dreamed of participation in False Face ceremonies.' <sup id="cite_ref-1213" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1213">[1,213]</a></sup> 'Witchcraft was the most serious type of anti-social behavior. The Iroquois believed that witches, in concert with the Evil Spirit, could cause disease, accident, death, or other misfortune. Because witches were thought to be able to transform themselves into other objects, they were difficult to catch and punish.' <sup id="cite_ref-1214" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1214">[1,214]</a></sup> There were multiple healing societies: 'As it has been previoualy stated, the curing societies integrate the four longhouses because members from the four longhouses participate in the nuxerous curing societies. Curing rituals also figure proainently in the ealendric cycle. Each society cures a specific illness. Speck (1949) lists the specialties of the various curing societies: Bear Society Rite: relief from howling hysteria and attacts of dementia in which the victim ‘crawls on the ground in the manner of a bear’...Otter Society Rite: relief from nervous tremors and associated afflictions (not demontia)...White Buffale Society Dance: relief from demontia, convulsions, bellewing hysteria...Wooden False Face Society Rite: relief from hemorrages of the nose, facial paralysis, mouth drawn to one side, dream persecution by visions, and annoyance by False Face spirits and frights in the bush...Corn-Huak Mask Society Rite: relief from afflicting dreams or hallucinations. Medicine Men's (Big Rattle) Society Rite and the Pig Mask Rite: cures bodily injury, wounds and incurable diseases and immunises against the coming of sickness foretold by a dream or vision. [Page 243] Little Water, or Dark Dance, Society Rite: relief from general sickness, called for when a person has a vision of the dwarf spirits. Eagle Society Dance Rite: relief from nervous debility (St. Vitus's dance). (1949:59-60.)' <sup id="cite_ref-1215" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1215">[1,215]</a></sup> While some forms of shamanism declined in the 17th and 18th centuries, healing societies were resilient: 'The increase in deaths due to epidemics, war and starvation contributed to the vanishing of the traditional shamans of the Iroquoians. The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries also saw the decrease in traditional guardian-spirit quests at puberty and a general decrease in belief in guardian spirits. Medicine societies, on the other hand, were gaining in strength and were under the patronage of a tutelary spirit. They assimilated into their traditions and hence “saved” many of the shamanistic songs, dances and healing techniques. Traditional Iroquoian shamanism was disappearing.' <sup id="cite_ref-1216" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1216">[1,216]</a></sup> 'A person joins a society when he or she dreams of the masks or of the rituals or when a clairvoyant prescribes the ceremony as a curing agent. Sometimes the disease symptoms by their very nature lead an individual or fortuneteller to conclude that somehow it was “caused” by a particular society and can only be cured by them. Such is the numinous quality of False-Face power, i.e., it works ill and well. Usual symptoms of illness are “ailments of the head, shoulders and joints. They cause and cure swelling of the face, toothache, inflammation of the eyes, nose bleeding, sore chin and earache. At Tonawanda, red spots on the patient's face calls for the red Faces, [Page 236] who should dance before sunrise. Black spots require the use of black masks at night.”' <sup id="cite_ref-1217" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1217">[1,217]</a></sup> The False Face society is particularly prominent in the ethnography: 'The prime motive in the establishment of this organization was to propitiate those demons called Falsefaces, and among other good results to arrest pestilence and disease. In course of time the band itself was believed to have a species of control over diseases, and over the healing art; and they were often invoked for the cure of simple diseases, and to drive away, or exorcise the plague, if it had actually broken out in their midst. As recently as the summer of 1849, when the cholera prevailed through the State, the Falsefaces, in appropriate costume, went from house to house at Tonawanda, through the old school portion of the village, and performed the usual ceremonies prescribed for the expulsion of the pestilence.//'When any one was sick with a complaint within the range of their healing powers, and dreamed that he saw a Falseface, this was interpreted to signify that through their instrumentality he was to be cured. Having informed the mistress of the band, and prepared the customary feast, the Falsefaces at once appeared, preceded by their female leader, and marching in Indian file. Each one wore a mask or false face, a tattered blanket over his shoulders, and carried a turtle shell rattle in his hand. On entering the house of the invalid they first stirred the ashes upon the hearth, and then sprinkled the patient over with hot ashes until his head and hair were covered; after which they performed some manipulations over him in turn, and finally led him around with them in the falseface dance ( Gä-go-s[unknown] ), with which their ceremonies concluded. When these performances were over, the entertainment prepared for the occasion was distributed to the band, and by [Page 160] them carried away for their private feasting, as they never unmasked themselves before the people. Among the simple complaints which the Falsefaces could cure infallibly, were nose bleed, toothache, swellings, and inflammation of the eyes. The false face shown in the figure was purchased of an Onondaga on Grand river.' <sup id="cite_ref-1218" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1218">[1,218]</a></sup> 'Fenton holds that the False-Face rituals did not enter the Seneca society until the latter half of the seventeenth century, after the devastating defeat of the Hurons by the Iroquois. It may also be that the Seneca began to use the masks when they were visited by the great epidemics. It is most likely that they were quite aware of the function of these masks from their observation of Huronian practices during the latter's epidemics. Being in the grip of such a powerful, deadly and decimating disease, the Seneca and other [Page 240] Iroquoians would undoubtedly have tried any and all magico-religious devices at hand.' <sup id="cite_ref-1219" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1219">[1,219]</a></sup> There were multiple forms of shamanistic healing: 'The other class, who were held in greater honor and were better paid, taught that disease was due rather to psychical than to physical causes, and for its cure they practised a course of treatment which may be most briefly and intelligibly described as <i>parva componere magnis</i>, a sort of Heathen Science. The patient was sick because of some evil thought, or other malevolence acting upon his spirit, and could be cured only by the spiritual efforts of the healer, exerted in both present and absent treatment, and often accompanied by much blowing, reciting of rituals, exercises, jugglery, etc., etc. Since this class of healer did not recognize the existence of disease, no knowledge of anatomy was necessary. Occasionally they made a slight concession to the widespread belief that disease has a physical cause and exhibited a stone, stick, or other object, which they pretended to have extracted [Page 286] from the patient, alleging that it had been implanted in his body by the malevolence of witch, demon, or other enemy.' <sup id="cite_ref-1220" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1220">[1,220]</a></sup> Accordingly, there was no 'public health' infrastructure in our own sense of the term.

<p><b>♠ State pensions for elites ♣ absent ♥</b> 'THE POLITICAL ORGANIZATION of the Iroquois--the system by which decisions were made about problems affecting village, tribe, or confederacy --had three levels. The town or village itself decided local issues like the use of nearby hunting lands, the relocation of houses and cornfields, movement to another site, the acceptance or rejection of visitors, and the raising of war parties. There was a village chiefs' council, numbering up to twenty men, formally organized with a chairman and one or more representatives for each clan. These chiefs were influential men and women, who might be League sachems, warcaptains, warriors, or simply old men who were looked up to and consulted. The council generally met in the presence of the warriors and the women, and rarely diverged in its decisions from the popular consensus, or at least the majority view. This council met in the village's ceremonial longhouse, which usually was merely a large dwelling.' <sup id="cite_ref-1221" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1221">[1,221]</a></sup> Female lineage elders played an important role on the local level: 'The primary local groups of Iroquois society were the extended household and the village. Each extended family lived in a long bark structure, some of which were from fifty to one hundred and fifty feet in length by sixty in breadth, known as longhouses. Throughout its length was a central passageway in which were located hearths at intervals of ten to twelve feet with each hearth being used by two conjugal families. On both sides of this central passageway were apartments each occupied by a simple family. The composition of the group inhabiting the longhouse appears to have been controlled by the matriarch of a lineage. Influential matriarchs who held a chiefly title tended to group their female relatives around them in the same longhouse.' <sup id="cite_ref-1222" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1222">[1,222]</a></sup> Various political levels were validated by wampum beads: 'The longhouse owns “wampums” which validate its position as a ritual center but which are rarely brought out. Wampum occasionally  figures in the ritual, such as the string of wampum used in the rite of confession. But the significance of wampum generally is that because it is a valuable object, it is used to indicate the significance of the event, either by giving it as a commemoration of the event or as being shown in remembrance of the event. Wampum belts, for example, were given at treaties to indicate good faith in the making of the treaty, and might be brought out to remind others of the treaty. In and of itself, wampum is not sacred.' <sup id="cite_ref-1223" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1223">[1,223]</a></sup> The central League Council dealt with commonn affairs, with tribal chiefs and councils (as well as the female elders of their respective lineages and more recently created non-hereditary positions) occupying an intermediary position: 'The Iroquois confederacy operated under a council of 50 sachems representing the five original tribes. When the Tuscarora joined the League in 1722, no new sachem positions were created for it. The council was a legislative, executive and judicial body that deliberated only on the external affairs of the confederacy, such as peace and war, and on matters common to the five constituent tribes. The council had no voice in the internal affairs of the separate tribes. Tribal representation on the council was unequally distributed among the 5 tribes although abuse of power was limited by the requirement of unanimity in all council decisions. Below the level of the League council were separate tribal councils concerned with the internal affairs of each tribe and each tribe's relations with external groups. The tribal council was composed of the sachems who represented the tribe on the League council. Sachem positions were hereditary within each tribe and belonged to particular matrisibs. The women of the matrisib nominated each new sachem, who was always a male, and had the power to recall or "dehorn" a chief who failed to represent the interests of his people. Theoretically, each sachem was equal to the others in power, but in practice those with better oratorial skills wielded greater influence. After the confederacy had been functioning for a period of time a new, nonhereditary office of Pine Tree Chief was created to provide local leadership and to act as advisors to the council sachems, although later they actually sat on the League council and equaled the sachems in power. Pine Tree Chiefs held their position for life and were chosen by the women of a matrisib on the basis of skill in warfare. Iroquois involvement in the fur trade and war with the French increased the importance and solidarity of the League council and thereby strengthened the confederacy. The strength of the confederacy continued to grow until the time of the American Revolution when Iroquois interests divided between alliances to the British and the American colonists.' <sup id="cite_ref-1224" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1224">[1,224]</a></sup> 'A Chief was appointed by the oldest woman of the maternal family in which the title descended. Her descendants and those who were related clanwise were his constituents. The matron and the chief tended to reside in the same settlement, for when the Chief removed, the clan had no one to regard with confidence unless he returned for village councils. If the matron removed, local succession was in jeopardy.  The results of deliberations by the clan were taken from village councils to the council of the tribe. The ranking clan chiefs residing at a place were the cochiefs of that settlement. All eight of the Seneca chiefs are now concentrated at Tonawanda, but formerly the Seneca had at least four villages, and all the rest save the Oneida had each two or three principal towns with satellite settlements. The tribe thus spoke a common language, it comprised two or more settlements, it was governed by a common council of village chiefs who also represented constituent clans, and they governed a common territory adjacent to the towns. In time all clans were present in all villages, probably about in the same proportions as they are now. As any clan predominated in a settlement, members had to seek mates in the next village, or divide their own house in twain, thus distributing the clans again.' <sup id="cite_ref-1225" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1225">[1,225]</a></sup> Tribes were composed of matrilineages: 'Matrilineages were organized into 15 matrisibs. Among the Cayuga, Onondaga, Seneca and Tuscarora the matrisibs were further organized into moieties. Among the Mohawk and the Oneida no moiety division was recognized. Descent was matrilineal.' <sup id="cite_ref-1226" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1226">[1,226]</a></sup> The League Council initially met at Onondaga, but the council fire was extinguished and rekindled in various places during the tribulations of the colonial period: 'The council continued to be composed of hereditary chiefs, who together with the “war chiefs” from 1812 andthe Pine Tree chiefs numbered over 50. The Crown madeno attempt to interfere with the appointment or dismissalof chiefs (Weaver 1975). The chiefs met in the Onondagacouncil house, a log structure near Middleport, two orthree times a year to deliberate in traditional fashionmatters of community interest (Weaver 1963-1974). The Onondagas, known collectively as the firekeepers, actedas mediators in the proceedings according to traditionalcustom. However, the tribal seating plan differed fromthe traditional one in that the Mohawks and Senecasoccupied the positions east of the council fire, while theOneidas and Cayugas sat on the west, together with thedependent nations: Tuscaroras, Nanticokes, Delawares,and Tutelos. Although the dependent nations were tospeak through “their voice,” the Cayugas, in fact theyoften directly addressed the assembly of chiefs, andoperated quite independently, though not equaling theoriginal five nations in power or status.' <sup id="cite_ref-1227" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1227">[1,227]</a></sup>  'Despite the efforts of the Onondagas at Onondaga tohave them returned to Onondaga, the council fire of theConfederacy and its wampum records remained at BuffaloCreek until after that reservation had been sold andCaptain Cold (“The League of the Iroquois: Its History,Politics, and Ritual,” fig. 11, this vol.), keeper of thecouncil fire and the wampum, had died.

<p><b>♠ Funding for festivals ♣ absent ♥</b> Morgan provides a general introduction to Iroquois rituals and worship: 'The Iroquois had a systematic worship. It consisted in the celebration of periodical festivals, which were held at stated seasons of the year. These observances were suggested by the changes in the seasons, the ripening of the fruits, and the gathering of the harvest. They were performed annually, with the same established ceremonies, which had been handed down from age to age. The worship of the Iroquois, as before remarked, has undergone no change in centuries. It is still the same, in all essential particulars, that it was at the period of their discovery. Some slight additions, ascribable, doubtless, to missionary instructions, will be detected, but they are too inconsiderable to change the form, or disturb the harmony of the whole. Upon an examination of the principal features of the system, it will become apparent that it was chiefly a thanksgiving worship, although the supplication of the Great Spirit for the continuance of his protection entered into it as an essential element. Six regular festivals, or thanksgivings, were observed by the Iroquois. The first, in the order of [Page 176] time, was the Maple festival. This was a return of thanks to the maple itself, for yielding its sweet waters. Next was the Planting festival, designed, chiefly, as an invocation of the Great Spirit to bless the seed. Third came the Strawberry festival, instituted as a thanksgiving for the first fruits of the earth. The fourth was the Green Corn festival, designed as a thanksgiving acknowledgment for the ripening of the corn, beans and squashes. Next was celebrated the Harvest festival, instituted as a general thanksgiving to “Our Supporters,” after the gathering of the harvest. Last in the enumeration is placed the New Year's festival, the great jubilee of the lroquois, at which the white dog was sacrificed.' <sup id="cite_ref-1229" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1229">[1,229]</a></sup> 'The principle involved in the formal worship of the Great Spirit at stated periods, and the fidelity with which the Iroquois, in prosperity and in adversity, adhered to these observances from generation to generation, are of much more importance in forming a judgment of their religious sentiments than the mere ceremonies themselves. In this constant recognition of their dependence upon the divine power, there is much to awaken a feeling of sympathy and a sentiment of respect for a people who, untaught by revelation, had reached such high conclusions. By assembling at periodical seasons to render their thanks to Hä-wen-ne[unknown] -yu for his gifts, they fully recognized the duty which rested upon them as the recipients of such favors. And, also, by supplicating the continuance of his watchful care, and by invoking his blessing upon their present acts, they manifested the sincerity of their faith, and the fulness [Page 177] of their trust in the great Author of their being. But the ceremonies themselves are not without a peculiar interest. They will convey to the mind a more distinct impression of the nature and simplicity of their worship. No attempt will be made to describe these observances with the minuteness of a picture. An outline of those appropriate to each festival will sufficiently illustrate their general character and purpose.' <sup id="cite_ref-1230" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1230">[1,230]</a></sup> 'The question here presents itself as to the religious office or priesthood among the Iroquois. Under the League itself no sacerdotal office was recognized. Sachems were raised up, and invested with their titles by a council of all the sachems of the League. Chiefs were first raised up in the nation to which they belonged, and their title was afterwards confirmed by the same general council. But no religious dignitaries were ever raised up by the council of sachems to fill any priestly station. In each nation, however, there was a select class appointed by the several tribes to take the charge of their religious festivals, and the general supervision of their worship. They were styled Ho-nun-de[unknown] -ont, or “Keepers of the Faith,” as the term literally signifies. In the election of this class, their powers and duties, and the tenure of their office, there are many circumstances to distinguish them as a sacerdotal order. (53) To their number there was no limit, and they were usually about as numerous as the chiefs. The chiefs themselves were ex officio keepers of the fait 1. (65) The office was elective, and continued as long as the individual was faithful to his trust. Suitable persons were selected [Page 178] by the wise men and matrons out of their respective tribes, and advanced to the office. 1 Their original names were then taken away, and new ones assigned, out of a collection of names which belonged to this class. At the first subsequent council of the nation, their appointment and names were publicly announced, which in itself completed the investiture. The number furnished by each tribe was an evidence of its fidelity to the ancient faith. They were, to some extent, censors of the people; and their admonitions were received with kindness, as coming from those commissioned to remonstrate. In some cases they reported the evil deeds of individuals to the council, to make of them an example by exposure. Sometimes they held consultations to deliberate upon the moral condition of the people. It was the duty of every individual to accept the office when bestowed; but he could relinquish it at any moment by laying aside his new name and resuming his old. (68) It was their duty to designate the times for holding the periodical festivals, to make the necessary arrangements for their celebration, and to conduct the ceremonies. Certain ones of their number, by previous appointment, made the opening speech, and the thanksgiving address at the council, and also delivered religious discourses whenever they were deemed advisable. All of the members of this class were equal in authority and privileges. Those animated by the highest zeal and enthusiasm would naturally assume the most active charge; but they had no acknowledged head. The distribution of all powers, duties and offices among a number of equals was the prevailing [Page 179] feature of their civil polity. It was necessary that women as well as men should be appointed keepers of the faith, and about in equal numbers. To the matrons more particularly was intrusted the charge of the feast. The Iroquois never held a mourning or religious council, without preparing an entertainment for all the people in attendance on the evening of each day. None but those matrons who were keepers of the faith could take any part in its preparation. But their duties were not confined to the supervision of the feast. They had an equal voice in the general management of the festivals, and of all of their religious concernments. During a discourse or address, all the keepers of the faith acted, if necessary, as prompters to the speaker, and through him communicated to the people any injunction or precept which they deemed advisable. For this reason, one of their names as a class was that of “prompters.”' <sup id="cite_ref-1231" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1231">[1,231]</a></sup> 'Notwithstanding the systematic organization of the keepers of the faith, and the precise limitation of their duties, there do not seem to be sufficient reasons for calling this class a religious order, or a priesthood, as these terms are usually understood. They were distinguished by no special privileges, except while in the act of discharging their prescribed duties; they wore no costume, or emblem of office, to separate them from the people. In fact they were common warriors, and common women, and, in every sense, of and among the people. The office was one of necessity, and was without reward, like all Indian offices of every name, and also without particular honor to the individual.' <sup id="cite_ref-1232" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1232">[1,232]</a></sup> Morgan provides information on the various thanksgiving festivals associated with the agricultural cycle. The Maple Dance: 'This was the first festival of the spring. It was usually called the Maple Dance. The primary idea of this ceremonial was to return thanks to the maple itself; but at the same time they rendered their thanks to the Great Spirit for the gift of the maple. It lasted but one day. When the sap began to flow, the keepers of the faith announced the time and place for commemorating the recurrence of this event, and summoned the people to assemble for that purpose. Some days before the time appointed for the festival, the people assembled for the mutual confession of their sins, both as an act of religious duty, and as a preparation for the council. This act preceded all the festivals; but it was more general and thorough at the three last than at the three first, as they were deemed more important, and continued for a greater length of time. This council, Sa-nun-dät-ha-wä[unknown] -ta, literally “a meeting for repentance,” was opened by one of the keepers of the faith, with an address upon the propriety and importance of acknowledging their evil deeds, to strengthen their minds against future temptations. He then took the string of white wampum in his hand, and set the example by a confession of his own faults; after which he handed the string to the one nearest to him, who received it, made his confession in like manner, and passed it to another. In this way the wampum went around from hand to hand; and those who had confessions to make stated wherein they had done wrong, and promised to do better in [Page 181] the future. Old and young, men, women, and even children all united in this public acknowledgment of their faults, and joined in the common resolution of amendment. On some occasions the string of wampum was placed in the centre of the room, and each one advanced in turn to perform the duty, as the inclination seized him. A confession and promise without holding the wampum would be of no avail. It was the wampum which recorded their words, and gave their pledge of sincerity. The object of the confession was future amendment. The Iroquois appear to have had no idea either of the atonement or of the forgiveness of sins. Meritorious acts neutralized evil deeds, but neither the one nor the other, when done, could be recalled, or changed, or obliterated.' <sup id="cite_ref-1233" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1233">[1,233]</a></sup> 'The celebration of this festival was not limited to one particular place, but it was observed in all the villages of the several nations of the League, which were too remote to unite around the same council-fire. At the time appointed, the people gathered from the subjacent districts, some to offer religious admonitions, some prepared for the dance, others for the games, and still others for the enjoyment of the feast. It was one of their festive days, awakening the eagerness of expectation in the minds of all. On the morning of the day, the matrons, to whom the duty appertained, commenced the preparation of the customary feast for the people, which was as sumptaous as the season and the means of the hunter life would afford. Towards meridian, the out-door sports and games, which were common to such occasions, were suspended, and the people assembled in council. An opening speech was [Page 182] then delivered, by one of the keepers of the faith. The following, made at the opening of one of these councils among the Senecas, is in the usual form, and will illustrate their general chalacter:--' <sup id="cite_ref-1234" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1234">[1,234]</a></sup> '“Friends and Relatives: -- The sun, the ruler of the day, is high in his path, and we must hasten to do our duty. We are assembled to observe an ancient custom. It is an institution handed down to us by our forefathers. It was given to them by the Great Spirit. He has ever required of his people to return thanks to him for all blessings received. We have always endeavored to live faithful to this wise command. “Friends and Relatives, continue to listen: -- It is to perform this duty that we are this day gathered. The season when the maple tree yields its sweet waters has again returned. We are all thankful that it is so. We therefore expect all of you to join in our general thanksgiving to the maple. We also expect you to join in a thanksgiving to the Great Spirit, who has wisely made this tree for the good of man. We hope and expect that order and harmony will prevail. “Friends and Relatives: -- We are gratified to see so many here, and we thank you all that you have thought well of this matter. We thank the Great Spirit, that he has been kind to so many of us, in sparing our lives to participate again in the festivities of this season. Na-bo[unknown] .” Other speeches often followed, which were in the nature of exhortations to duty. These occasions were seized upon by their moral teachers, to inculcate anew the precepts of their faith, and to offer admonitions for their spiritual guidance. One of the keepers of [Page 183] the faith, addressing the people at such a time, would inculcate the virtues which became a warrior, and unfold the duties which were incumbent upon them as members of one common brotherhood. The duty of living in harmony and peace, of avoiding evil speaking, of kindness to the orphan, of charity to the needy, and of hospitality to all, would be among the prominent topics brought under consideration. He would remind them that the Great Spirit noticed and rewarded good acts, and that those who hoped for success in the affairs of life, should be ready to do them whenever occasion offered; that those who had done wrong should not be treated harshly; that enmities were not to be contracted, lest a spirit of revenge should be awakened, which would never sleep; and finally, that those who pursued the right path would never fall into trouble.' <sup id="cite_ref-1235" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1235">[1,235]</a></sup> 'When these speeches and exhortations were concluded, the dance, which was a prominent feature of their religious festivals, was announced. It is proper here to observe, that dancing was regarded by the Iroquois as an appropriate mode of worship. They regarded the dance as a perpetual outward ceremonial of thanksgiving to the Great Spirit. A belief prevailed among them that the custom was of divine origin. “The Great Spirit knew the Indian could not live without some amusement, therefore he originated the idea of dancing, which he gave to them.” 1 The dance set apart in a peculiar manner for the worship of the Great Spirit, at their festivals, was one of their [Page [facing p. 184]] [Page 184] own invention; and the most spirited, graceful and beautiful in their list. It is known as the Great Feather Dance ( O-sto-weh[unknown] -go-wä ). It was performed by a select band, in full costume, and was reserved exclusively for religious councils and for great occasions. It lasted about an hour, never failing to arouse a deep spirit of enthusiastic excitement. Before the band came in, one of the keepers of the faith made a brief speech, explanatory of its origin, nature and objects; in which the popular belief was interwoven, that this dance would be enjoyed by the faithful in the future life, in the realm of the Great Spirit, to whose worship it was especially consecrated.' <sup id="cite_ref-1236" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1236">[1,236]</a></sup> 'After the conclusion of this dance others followed, in which all participated. Before they were ended, the usual thanksgiving address to the Great Spirit, with the burning of tobacco, was made. In ancient times the Maple festival was terminated with these dances. One of the keepers of the faith made a closing speech, after which the people partook of the feast, and separated for their respective homes. There is a popular belief among the Iroquois that the early part of the day is dedicated to the Great Spirit, and the after part to the spirits of the dead; consequently their religious services should properly be concluded at meridian. They still retain the theory, and to this day religious discourses are seldom continued after noon; but in practice it was found impossible, from the tardiness of the people in assembling, to conclude the ceremonies of the festival before twilight. A further innovation was made many years ago by [Page 185] devoting the evenings of these festive days to dancing, for the entertainment of guests from other villages or nations, who chanced to be with them. This became, in time, the universal custom, and they now continue the practice for their own amusement. These evening entertainments, however, in strictness, form no part of the festival, although apparently it is one proceeding from the opening of the council until late at night, when the entertainment is ended. A distinction should constantly be held in view, between their proper religious exercises, and their amusements, and also between the ancient mode of celebrating these festivals, and the modern. The regular religious ceremonies at the Maple festival consisted of the opening discourse by one of the keepers of the faith, the exhortations of others, the Feather dance, the thanksgiving address to the Great Spirit, with the incense of tobacco, two or three other dances, the closing speech, and the feast in common.' <sup id="cite_ref-1237" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1237">[1,237]</a></sup> 'In ancient times these ceremonies were concluded at meridian, but in modern times at twilight. Formerly all the exercises at these festivals were of a strictly religious character, except certain games which were common to these occasions. But in later times other dances have been added, and also an evening entertainment devoted exclusively to dancing. There were likewise certain games of chance, sports, and athletic games, common to all these festivals, which yet formed no part of their religious ceremonies. They were merely outside diversions for the people. Still the Maple festival, as celebrated at the present day among the descendants of the ancient Iroquois, is [Page 186] the same, in its essential features, as at the period of its institution.' <sup id="cite_ref-1238" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1238">[1,238]</a></sup> The planting season festival: 'This word signifies “the planting season.” When this time arrived another festival was held to celebrate the event. It continued but one day. In its observances there was nothing to distinguish it very materially from the Maple festival. A description is therefore unnecessary, except to point out some peculiarities. The object of this festival was two-fold: to render thanks to the Great Spirit for the return of the planting season, and to invoke his blessing upon the seed which they had committed to the earth, that it might yield an abundant harvest. The Indian had no Sabbath, no sacred writings to furnish him an inexhaustible fountain of instruction; but his gratitude was awakened by every returning manifestation of divine goodness. When nature had reclothed herself in the vestments of spring, and the teeming earth invited him to commit the seeds to her bosom, he recognized in the event the watchful kindness of the Great Spirit. There is something eminently spiritual and beautiful in this Indian conception of the natural periods of worship. Seizing upon the moment when the most conspicuous evidences of the protecting care of the Deity were before him, he acknowledged both his existence and his beneficence, [Page 187] and manifested, at the same time, his gratitude and devotion, by those simple rites which the piety of his heart suggested.' <sup id="cite_ref-1239" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1239">[1,239]</a></sup> 'At the time appointed by the keepers of the faith, the people assembled to observe the day. After the speeches were over, the Feather and other dances were performed, as at the Maple festival. In ancient times, the thanksgiving address, or prayer to the Great Spirit, with the burning of tobacco, was confined to the last three, or the principal festivals; but in later days such a prayer was offered generally at the first three also. As elsewhere observed, when the Iroquois returned thanks to the various objects in nature which ministered to their wants, or when they acknowledged to each other their thankfulness to the Great Spirit, or to the lesser Spirits, they never burned tobacco. In these cases, their thanks were returned to the trees and plants and elements direct, to do which, according to their theology, did not require the use of incense, while, as to the spiritual world, they merely avowed to each other that they returned their thanks. But when they offered a prayer, or called upon the Great Spirit, or his Invisible Aids, they were obliged to use the ascending smoke to put themselves in communication with the spiritual world. This address occurred at no particular stage in the ceremonies of the day. The keepers of the faith having appointed one of their number to perform this duty, the person designated selected a suitable moment for its delivery. Advancing to the fire prepared for the purpose, he called the attention of the people by an exclamation, which was the known precursor of [Page 188] this address. Having sprinkled a few leaves of Indian tobacco upon the fire, he addressed Hä-wen-ne[unknown] -yu, as the smoke ascended. The ollowing, delivered at a Planting festival among the Senecas, will illustrate the general character of these prayers or thanksgiving addresses:--' <sup id="cite_ref-1240" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1240">[1,240]</a></sup> '“Great Spirit, who dwellest alone, listen now to the words of thy people here assembled. The smoke of our offering arises. Give kind attention to our words, as they arise to thee in the smoke. We thank thee for this return of the planting season. Give to us a good season, that our crops may be plentiful. “Continue to listen, for the smoke yet arises. (Throwing on tobacco.) Preserve us from all pestilential diseases. Give strength to us all that we may not fall. Preserve our old men among us, and protect the young. Help us to celebrate with feeling the ceremonies of this season. Guide the minds of thy people, that they may remember thee in all their actions. Na-bo[unknown] . ” There was nothing further to distinguish this festival from the former. If, after the planting season, a drought should come upon the land, threatening a failure of the harvest, a special council was frequently called, to invoke He[unknown] -no, the Thunderer, to send rain upon the earth. Before the time appointed for this council, the people assembled, as before other festivals, for mutual confession. They feared, as they expressed it, “that some of their number had done some great wrong, for which the Great Spirit was angry with them, and withheld the rain as a merited punishment.” After this special council was opened in the usual form, the Thanksgiving [Page 189] dance, and the Ah-d[unknown] -web, hereafter to be described, were introduced, which were supposed to be peculiarly acceptable to He[unknown] -no. At a proper time, in the progress of these ceremonies, the keeper of the faith, who had been appointed as usual, advanced to the fire, and having laid on the leaves of tobacco, and gained the attention of the people, he made the following invocation of the Thunderer, as the incense ascended:--' <sup id="cite_ref-1241" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1241">[1,241]</a></sup> '“ He[unknown] -no, our Grandfather, listen now to the words of thy grandchildren. We feel grieved. Our minds are sorely troubled. We fear Our Supporters will fail, and bring famine upon us. We ask our Grandfather that he may come, and give us rain, that the earth may not dry up, and refuse to produce for our support. Thy grandchildren all send their salutations to their grandfather, He[unknown] -no. ” Then taking another handful of tobacco, and placing it upon the fire, he changed the address to Hä-wen-ne[unknown] -yu: -- “Great Spirit: listen to the words of thy suffering children. They come to thee with pure minds. If they have done wrong, they have confessed, and turned their minds, (at the same time holding up the string of white wampum with which the confession was recorded.) Be kind to us. Hear our grievances, and supply our wants. Direct that He[unknown] -no may come, and give us rain, that Our Supporters may not fail us, and bring famine to our homes. Na-bo[unknown] . ” After concluding the dance the assembly was dismissed.' <sup id="cite_ref-1242" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1242">[1,242]</a></sup> The Strawberry festival: 'In the progress of the seasons, next came the Strawberry, the first fruit of the earth. The Iroquois [Page [facing p. 190]] [Page 190] seized upon this spontaneous gift of nature for their sustenance as another suitable occasion for a thanksgiving festival. By such ceremonials they habituated their minds to a recognition of the providential care of Hä-wen-ne[unknown] -yu; cultivating, at the same time, a grateful spirit for the constant return of his gifts. The observances at this festival were the same as those at the Maple, with a sufficient variation of terms to designate the particular occasion. It was concluded with a feast of strawberries. The berries were prepared with maple sugar, in capacious bark trays, in the form of a jelly; and in this condition the people feasted upon this great luxury of nature.' <sup id="cite_ref-1243" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1243">[1,243]</a></sup> 'The ripening of the Whortleberry was often made the occasion of another festival. It was in all respects like the last, the only difference consisting in the fact, that the former was an acknowledgment for the first fruit of plants, and the latter for the first fruit of trees.' <sup id="cite_ref-1244" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1244">[1,244]</a></sup> The Green Corn festival: 'The word from which this takes its name signifies “a feast.” It continued four days, the proceedings of each being different in most particulars, but each one terminating with a feast. When the green corn became fit for use, the season of plenty with the Indian had emphatically arrived. They made it another occasion of general thanksgiving to the Great Spirit, and of feasting and rejoicing among themselves. Corn has ever been the staple article-of consumption among the Iroquois. They cultivated this plant, and also the bean and the [Page [facing p. 191]] [Page 191] squash, before the formation of the League. From the most remote period to which tradition reaches, the knowledge of the cultivation and use of these plants has been handed down among them. 1 They raised sufficient quantities of each to supply their utmost wants, preparing them for food in a great variety of ways, and making them at least the basis of their sustenance. (19) In their own mode of expressing the idea, these plants are mentioned together, under the figurative name of “Our Life,” or “Our Supporters.” It cannot, therefore, be affirmed with correctness, that the Indian subsisted principally by the chase. (84) After the formation of the League, they resided in permanent villages, and within certain well-defined territorial limits. The fruits of the chase then became a secondary, although a necessary means of subsistence.' <sup id="cite_ref-1245" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1245">[1,245]</a></sup> 'On the first day of this festival, after the introductory speeches had been made, the Feather dance, the thanksgiving address, with the burning of tobacco, [Page 192] and three or four other dances, made up the principal religious exercises. This address was introduced in the midst of one of the dances which succeeded the first. One more specimen of these brief prayers of the Iroquois, as made by the Senecas, will be furnished. Having placed the leaves of tobacco on the fire, as usual, the keeper of the faith thus addressed Hä-wen-ne[unknown] -yu: --' <sup id="cite_ref-1246" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1246">[1,246]</a></sup> '“Great Spirit in heaven, listen to our words. We have assembled to perform a sacred duty, as thou hast commanded. This institution has descended to us from our fathers. We salute thee with our thanks, that thou hast preserved so many of us another year, to participate in the ceremonies of this occasion. “Great Spirit, continue to listen: We thank thee for thy great goodness in causing our mother, the earth, again to bring forth her fruits. We thank thee that thou hast caused Our Supporters to yield abundantly. “Great Spirit, our words still continue to flow towards thee. (Throwing on tobacco). Preserve us from all danger. Preserve our aged men. Preserve our mothers. Preserve our warriors. Preserve our children. We burn this tobacco; may its smoke arise to thee. May our thanks, ascending with it, be pleasing to thee. Give wisdom to the keepers of the faith, that they may direct these ceremonies with propriety. Strengthen our warriors, that they may celebrate with pleasure the sacred dances of thy appointment. “Great Spirit; the council here assembled, the aged men and women, the strong warriors, the women and children, unite their voice of thanksgiving to thee. Na-bo! ”' <sup id="cite_ref-1247" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1247">[1,247]</a></sup> 'Before partaking of the feast, 1 the people went out to witness some of those games which were often introduced, as an amusement, to accompany the other exercises of these festive days. The second day commenced with the usual address, after which they had the Thanksgiving dance, Gä-na[unknown] -o-ub, which was the principal religious exercise of the day. This dance was not necessarily a costume performance, although it was usually given by a select band in full dress. In figure, step, and music, it was precisely like the Feather dance, the chief difference between them being the introduction of short thanksgiving speeches between the songs of the dance. This dance is fully explained elsewhere; but it is proper to say, to make it intelligible here, that the music consisted of a series of thanksgiving songs, performed by select singers, who accompanied themselves with turtleshell rattles, to mark time. Each song lasted about two minutes, during which the band danced around the room, in column, with great animation. When the song ceased, the dancers walked around the council-house, about the same length of time, to the beat of the rattles. The thanksgiving speeches were made during these intervals between the songs. A person arose, and perhaps thanked the Maple as follows: “We return thanks to the Maple, which yields its sweet waters for the good of man.” Again the dance was resumed, and another song danced out, after which another speech was made by some other person, perhaps as follows: “We return thanks to the bushes and trees, which provide us with fruit.” The dance was then resumed as before. In this manner the [Page 194] thanksgiving speeches, the songs and the dance were continued, until all the prominent objects in nature had been made the subjects of special notice. There were always set speeches introduced with the Thanksgiving dance, at the Green Corn and Harvest festivals, and they formed a conspicuous part of the worship of the Iroquois. These speeches, or the principal ones, may be collected into one, for the purpose of showing the range of subjects taken; yet it must be borne in mind that each object formed the subject of a separate speech, and was followed by a thanksgiving song, adapted to the case, which the band danced through. It may be proper further to add, that these speeches were consolidated to form the principal part of the annual thanksgiving address to the Great Spirit, made at the burning of the White Dog. The following is their natural order:--' <sup id="cite_ref-1248" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1248">[1,248]</a></sup> '“We return thanks to our mother, the earth, which sustains us. We return thanks to the rivers and streams, which supply us with water. We return thanks to all herbs, which furnish medicines for the cure of our diseases. We return thanks to the corn, and to her sisters, the beans and squashes, which give us life. We return thanks to the bushes and trees, which provide us with fruit. We return thanks to the wind, which, moving the air, has banished diseases. We return thanks to the moon and stars, which have given to us their light when the sun was gone. We return thanks to our grandfather He[unknown] -no, that he has protected his grandchildren from witches and reptiles, and has given to us his rain. We return thanks to the sun, that he has looked upon [Page 195] the earth with a beneficent eye. Lastly, we return thanks to the Great Spirit, in whom is embodied all goodness, and who directs all things for the good of his children.”' <sup id="cite_ref-1249" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1249">[1,249]</a></sup> 'After the conclusion of the Thanksgiving dance, two or three other dances followed, and after them the feast, with which the exercises of the day were concluded. The third morning was set apart for a thanksgiving concert, called the Ah-do[unknown] -weh, which constituted the chief ceremony of the day. The council was opened by an introductory speech by one of the keepers of the faith, upon its nature, objects, and institution. This novelty in their worship was a succession of short speeches made by different persons, one after another, returning thanks to a great variety of objects, each one following his speech with an appropriate song, the words of which were of his own composing, and oftentimes the music also. In a chorus to each song all the people joined, thus sending forth a united anthem of praise. They passed through the whole range of natural objects, thanking each one directly, as in the Thanksgiving dance; but they were not in the Ah-do[unknown] -weh confined either to the natural or to the spiritual world. Acts of kindness, personal achievements, political events, in a word, all the affairs of public and private life were open on this occasion to the indulgence of the grateful affections. Oftentimes one or two hours were consumed, before the people had all expressed their thanks to each other for personal favors, to the works of nature for their constant ministration to their wants, and to the Great Spirit and [Page 196] the “Invisible Aids” for their protecting care. Many of the speeches on these occasions, especially those which referred to objects in the natural world, were the same from year. But those which grew out of their private relations would vary with circumstances. This was esteemed one of their highest religious exercises, and it always continued to be one of their favorite observances. When the Ah-do[unknown] -weh was concluded, two or three dances were generally introduced before the enjoyment of the feast, with which, as before remarked, each day's proceedings were terminated.' <sup id="cite_ref-1250" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1250">[1,250]</a></sup> 'On the fourth day, the festival was concluded with the peach-stone game, Gus-gä[unknown] -a, a game of chance, on which they bet profusely, and to which they were extravagantly attached. It was not in the nature of a religious exercise, but a favorite entertainment, with which to terminate the Green Corn ceremonial. It is elsewhere described. It should be held in the memory, that at the period of the institution of their religious festivals, they were concluded at meridian; during the middle period of their history, they were continued until towards twilight; but in modern times, an evening entertainment, in the way of dancing, always follows each day of the festival, so long as it continues, although it forms no part of their religious observances. It may be further observed, that at the present time, this festival lasts but three days, the proceedings of the third and fourth being completed on the former day. At the close of each day, 1 the people regaled themselves upon a sumptuous feast of succotash. This [Page 197] was always the entertainment at the green corn season. It was made of corn, beans and squashes, and was always a favorite article of food with the red man. It may be well to state in this connection, that among the Iroquois at the present day, they do not sit down together to a common repast, except at religious councils of unusual interest. The feast, after being prepared at the place of council, is distributed at its close, and carried by the women, in vessels brought for the purpose, to their respective homes, where it is enjoyed by each family at their own fireside. But when the people feasted together after the ancient fashion, as they still do occasionally, they selected the hour of twilight. The huge kettles of soup, or hommony, or succotash, as the case might be, were brought into their midst, smoking from the fire. Before partaking of this evening banquet, they never omitted to say grace, which, with them, was a simple ceremonial, but in perfect harmony with their mode of worship. It was a prolonged exclamation, upon a high key, by the solitary voice of one of the keepers of the faith, followed by a swelling chorus from the multitude, upon a lower note. It was designed as an acknowledgment to each other of their gratitude to the great Giver of the feast.' <sup id="cite_ref-1251" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1251">[1,251]</a></sup> The thanksgiving festival: 'After the gathering of the harvest, the Iroquois held another general thanksgiving for four days. It was the last in the year, as the New Year's observances were not of the same general character. The [Page 198] name given to this festival signifies “Thanksgiving to Our Supporters.” It was instituted primarily to return thanks to the corn, beans and squashes, which are always characterized by the Iroquois under this figurative name. Also, to the triad of Spirits, who are so intimately connected in their minds with the plants themselves, that they are nearly inseparable. The resulting object, however, of all these Indian rites, was the praise of Hä-wen-ne[unknown] -yu. Nature having matured and poured forth her stores for their sustenance, they instituted this ceremonial as a perpetual acknowledgment of their gratitude for each returning harvest.' <sup id="cite_ref-1252" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1252">[1,252]</a></sup> 'In the mode of summoning this council, and in the religious ceremonies, and concluding festivities of each day, it so closely resembled the Green Corn worship, that a separate description is rendered unnecessary. These religious councils were seasons of animation and excitement. The greater activity in social intercourse among the people, generally awakened by these ceremonies and festivities, contributed largely to keep up the spirit of these occasions. In the evening, as soon as the twilight hour was passed, the people gathered for the dance, as this entertainment, since the innovation before referred to, always follows the religious ceremonies of each day. The Iroquois have numerous dances, and to the practice itself they have always been extravagantly addicted. On such occasions the passion was gratified by a free indulgence, and the hours of the night passed by unheeded. With the Iroquois in their festivities, as with more refined communities, neither the admonition of the setting stars, [Page 199] nor of the fallen dew, “counselled sleep.” Not, perhaps, until the faint light of approaching day illumined the east, did the spirit of enjoyment decline, and the last murmur of the dispersing council finally subside.' <sup id="cite_ref-1253" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1253">[1,253]</a></sup> Morgan also describes new year's ceremonies: 'The name given to this festival literally signifies “The most excellent faith,” or “The supreme belief.” 1 Among the ceremonies incident to the worship of the Iroquois, the most novel were those which ushered in the new year. In mid-winter, usually about the first of February, this religious celebration was held. It continued for seven successive days, revealing, in its various ceremonials, nearly every feature of their religious system. The prominent act which characterized this jubilee, and which, perhaps, indicated what they understood by “The most excellent faith,” was the burning of the White Dog, on the fifth day of the festival. This annual sacrifice of the Iroquois has long been known, attracting at various times considerable attention. But the true principle involved in it appears not to have been rightly understood. In the sequel, it will be found to be a very simple and tangible idea, harmonizing fully with their system of faith and worship. Several days before the time appointed for the jubilee, the people assembled for the confession of their sins. On this occasion they were more thorough [Page 200] in the work than at any other season, that they might enter upon the new year with a firm purpose of amendment. This council not unfrequently lasted three days, before all the people had performed this act of religious duty.' <sup id="cite_ref-1254" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1254">[1,254]</a></sup> 'The observances of the new year were commenced on the day appointed, by two of the keepers of the faith, who visited every house in and about the Indian village, morning and evening. They were disguised in bear skins or buffalo robes, which were secured around their heads with wreaths of corn-husks, and then gathered in loose folds about the body. Wreaths of corn-husks were also adjusted around their arms and ankles. They were robed in this manner, and painted by the matrons, who, like themselves, were keepers of the faith, and by them were they commissioned to go forth in this formidable attire, to announce the commencement of the jubilee. Taking corn-pounders in their hands, they went out in company, on the morning of the day, to perform their duty. Upon entering a house, they saluted the inmates in a formal manner, after which, one of them, striking upon the floor, to restore silence and secure attention, thus addressed them: --“Listen, Listen, Listen: -- The ceremonies which the Great Spirit has commanded us to perform, are about to commence. Prepare your houses. Clear away the rubbish. Drive out all evil animals. We wish nothing to hinder or obstruct the coming observances. We enjoin upon every one to obey our requirements. Should any of your friends be taken sick and die, we command you not to mourn for them, nor allow any of your friends to mourn. But lay the body aside, [Page 201] and enjoy the coming ceremonies with us. When they are over, we will mourn with you.” 1' <sup id="cite_ref-1255" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1255">[1,255]</a></sup> 'After singing a short thanksgiving song, they passed out. In the afternoon this visit was repeated in the same manner. After saluting the family as before, one of the keepers of the faith thus addressed them: --“My Nephews, my Nephews, my Nephews: -- We now announce to you that the New Year's ceremonies have commenced, according to our ancient custom. You are, each of you, now required to go forth, and participate in their observance. This is the will of the Great Spirit. Your first duty will be to prepare your wooden blades ( Gä-ger-we-sä[unknown] ) with which to stir up the ashes upon your neighbors' hearths. Then return to the Great Spirit your individual thanks for the return of this season, and for the enjoyment of this privilege.” Having sung another song, appropriate to the occasion, they departed finally, and when they had in this way made the circuit of the village, the ceremonies of the first day were concluded. On the first day, however, the White Dog was strangled. (96) They selected a dog, free from physical [Page 202] blemish, and of a pure white, if such an one could be found. The white deer, white squirrel, and other chance animals of the albino kind, were regarded as consecrated to the Great Spirit. White was the Iroquois emblem of purity and of faith. In strangling the dog, they were careful neither to shed his blood nor break his bones. The dog was then spotted, in places, over his body and limbs, with red paint, and ornamented with feathers in various ways. Around his neck was hung a string of white wampum, the pledge of their sincerity. In modern times, the dog is ornamented with a profusion of many-colored rib-bons, which are adjusted around his body and limbs. 1 The ornaments placed upon the dog were the voluntary offerings of the pious; and for each gift thus bestowed, the giver was taught to expect a blessing. When the dog had been thus decorated, it was suspended by the neck about eight feet from the ground, on the branching prong of a pole erected for that purpose. Here it hung, night and day, until the morning of the fifth day, when it was taken down to be burned. Oftentimes two dogs were burned, one for each four of the tribes. (57) In this case, the people separated into two divisions, and after going through separate preparatory ceremonies, they united around the same altar for the burning of the dogs, and the offering of the thanksgiving address to the Great Spirit.' <sup id="cite_ref-1256" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1256">[1,256]</a></sup> 'On the second day 1 all the people went forth, and [Page 203] visited in turn the houses of their neighbors, either in the morning, at noon, or in the evening. They went in small parties apparelled in their best attire. It was customary, however, for the people to be preceded by the two keepers of the faith who made the recitations the day previous, as a matter of etiquette; the houses not being open to all, until these personages had made their call. At this time was performed the ceremony of stirring the ashes upon the hearth, which appears to have no particular idea attached to it, beyond that of a formal visitation. (95) Putting aside the disguise of the day before, the keepers of the faith assumed the costume of warriors, plumed and painted, in which attire they visited every family three times, in the morning, at noon, and in the evening. Taking in their hands wooden blades or shovels, they entered the lodge and saluted the family. One of them then stirred the ashes, and having taken up a quantity upon the blade of the shovel, and sprinkled them upon the hearth, he thus addressed the inmates, as they were in the act of falling: “I thank the Great Spirit that he has spared your lives again to witness this New Year's celebration.” Then repeating the process with another shovel full of ashes, he continued: “I thank the Great Spirit that he has spared my life, again to be an actor in this ceremony. And now I do this to please the Great Spirit.” The two then united in a chanksgiving song prepared for the occasion, upon the conclusion of which they took their departure. Other parties of the people then came in successively, and each went through the same performances. In this manner every house was thrice visited on the second day, by the [Page 204] keepers of the faith in the first instance, and afterwards by the whole community.' <sup id="cite_ref-1257" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1257">[1,257]</a></sup> 'The proceedings upon the third and fourth days were alike. Small dancing parties were organized, which visited from house to house, and danced at the domestic fireside. Each set selected a different dance, appointed their own leader, and furnished their own music. One party, for instance, took the Feather dance, another the Fish dance, another the Trotting dance, to give variety to the short entertainments which succeeded each other at every house. It was not uncommon, on such occasions, to see a party of juveniles, about a dozen in number, dressed in full costume, feathered and painted, dancing the War dance, from house to house, with all the zeal and enthusiasm which this dance was so eminently calculated to excite. In this manner every house was made a scene of gaiety and amusement, for none was so humble or so retired as to remain unvisited. Another pastime incident to these days was the formation of a “thieving party,” as it was called, a band of mischievous boys, disguised with false faces, paint and rags, to collect materials for a feast. This vagrant company strolled from house to house, accompanied by an old woman carrying a huge basket. If the family received them kindly, and made them presents, they handed the latter to the female carrier, and having given the family a dance in acknowledgment of the present, they retired without committing any depredations. But if no presents were made, or such as were insufficient, they purloined whatever articles they could most adroitly and easily conceal. [Page 205] If detected, they at once made restitution, but if not, it was considered a fair win. On the return of this party from their rounds, all the articles collected were deposited in a place open to public examination; where any one who had lost an article which he particularly prized, was allowed to redeem it, on paying an equivalent. But no one was permitted to reclaim, as the owner, any article successfully taken by this thieving party on its professional round. Upon the proceeds of this forced collection, a feast was eventually given, together with a dance in some private family.' <sup id="cite_ref-1258" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1258">[1,258]</a></sup> 'Guessing dreams was another of the novel practices of the Iroquois, which distinguished these festive days. It is difficult to understand precisely how far the self-delusion under which the dreamer appeared to act was real. A person with a melancholy and dejected countenance, entering a house, announced that he had a dream, and requested the inmates to guess it. He thus wandered from house to house, until he found a solution which suited him. This was either received as an interpretation of an actual dream, or suggested such a dream as the person was willing to adopt as his own. He at once avowed that his dream had been correctly guessed; and if the dream, as interpreted, prescribed any future conduct, he fulfilled it to the letter at whatever sacrifice. The celebrated Cornplanter, Gy-ant[unknown] -wä-ka, resigned his chiefship in consequence of a dream. 1 In relation to dreams, the [Page 206] Iroquois had ever been prone to extravagant and supernatural beliefs. They often regarded a dream as a divine monition, and followed its injunctions to the utmost extremity. Their notions upon this subject recall to remembrance the conceit of Homer, that “dreams descend from Jove.” (62)' <sup id="cite_ref-1259" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1259">[1,259]</a></sup> 'During the first four days the people were without a feast, from the fact that the observances themselves did not require the assembling of the people at the council-house. But entertainments were given in the [Page 207] evenings at private houses, where the night was devoted to the dance. Another amusement at this particular season was the Snow-snake game, which, like all Indian games, was wont to arouse considerable interest.' <sup id="cite_ref-1260" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1260">[1,260]</a></sup> 'On the morning of the fifth day, soon after dawn, the White Dog was burned on an altar of wood erected by the keepers of the faith near the councilhouse. It is difficult, from outward observation, to draw forth the true intent with which the dog was burned. The obscurity with which the object was veiled has led to various conjectures. Among other things, it has been pronounced a sacrifice for sin. In the religious system of the Iroquois, there is no recognition of the doctrine of atonement for sin, or of the absolution or forgiveness of sins. Upon this whole subject, their system is silent. An act once done was registered beyond the power of change. The greates advance upon this point of faith was the belief that good deeds cancelled the evil, thus placing heaven, through good works, within the reach of all. The notion that this was an expiation for sin is thus refuted by their system of theology itself. The other idea, that the sins of the people, by some mystic process, were transferred to the dog, and by him thus borne away, on the principle of the scapegoat of the Hebrews, is also without any foundation in truth. The burning of the dog had not the slightest connection with the sins of the people. On the contrary, the simple idea of the sacrifice was, to send up the spirit of the dog as a messenger to the Great Spirit, to announce their continued fidelity to his service, and also to convey to him their united [Page 208] thanks for the blessings of the year. The fidelity of the dog, the companion of the Indian, as a hunter, was emblematical of their fidelity. No messenger so trusty could be found to bear their petitions to the Master of life. The Iroquois believed that the Great Spirit made a covenant with their fathers to the effect, that when they should send up to him the spirit of a dog, of a spotless white, he would receive it as the pledge of their adherence to his worship, and his ears would thus be opened in a special manner to their petitions. To approach Hä-wen-ne[unknown] -yu in the most acceptable manner, and to gain attention to their thanksgiving acknowledgments and supplications in the way of his own appointing, was the end and object of burning the dog. They hung around his neck a string of white wampum, the pledge of their faith. They believed that the spirit of the dog hovered around the body until it was committed to the flames, when it ascended into the presence of the Great Spirit, itself the acknowledged evidence of their fidelity, and bearing also to him the united thanks and supplications of the people. This sacrifice was the most solemn and impressive manner of drawing near to the Great Spirit known to the Iroquois. They used the spirit of the dog in precisely the same manner that they did the incense of tobacco, as an instrumentality through which to commune with their Maker. This sacrifice was their highest act of piety.' <sup id="cite_ref-1261" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1261">[1,261]</a></sup> 'The burning of the dog was attended with many ceremonies. It was first taken down and laid out upon a bench in the council-house, while the fire of the altar was kindling. A speech was then made over [Page 209] it by one of the keepers of the faith, in which he spoke of the antiquity of this institution of their fathers, of its importance and solemnity, and finally enjoined upon them all to direct their thoughts to the Great Spirit, and unite with the keepers of the faith in these observances. He concluded with thanking the Great Spirit, that the lives of so many of them had been spared through another year. A chant or song, appropriate to the occasion, was then sung, the people joining in chorus. By the time this was over, the altar was blazing up on every side ready for the offering. A procession was then formed, the officiating keeper of the faith preceding, followed by four others bearing the dog upon a kind of bark litter, behind which came the people in Indian file. A loud exclamation, in the nature of a warwhoop, announced the starting of the procession. They moved on towards the altar, and having marched around it, the keepers of the faith halted, facing the fising sun. With some immaterial ceremonies, the dog was laid upon the burning altar, and as the flames surrounded the offering, the officiating keeper of the faith, by a species of ejaculation, upon a high key, thrice repeated, invoked the attention of the Great Spirit.' <sup id="cite_ref-1262" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1262">[1,262]</a></sup> '“ Luä, quä, quä: -- (Hail, hail, hail.)

It is rising to thee, by which it will appear that our words are true.” 1' <sup id="cite_ref-1263" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1263">[1,263]</a></sup> 'Several thanksgiving songs or chants, in measured verse, were then sung by the keepers of the faith, the people joining in chorus. After this, was made the great thanksgiving address of the Iroquois. The keeper of the faith appointed to deliver it, invoked the attention of Hä-wen-ne[unknown] -yu by the same thricerepeated exclamation. As the speech progressed, he threw leaves of tobacco into the fire from time to time, that its incense might constantly ascend during the whole address. The following is the address, as delivered among the Senecas: 1 --“Hail, Hail, Hail: -- Listen now, with an open ear, to the words of thy people, as they ascend to thy dwelling, in the smoke of our offering. Behold thy people here assembled. Behold, they have come up to celebrate anew the sacred rites thou hast given them. Look down upon us beneficently.

In 1816 Eleazar Williams, an adopted Mohawk catechist and layreader (see “Oneida,” this vol.), visited the Onondagas. Inthat and the following year, a few Onondagas were [Page 497] baptized by Episcopalian clergymen, and subsequentlysome attended the church at Onondaga Hill (Clark 1849,1:238-240). About the same time, a local Presbyterian minister also proselytized among the Onondagas, and in1821 there were said to be 34 who professed Christianityin the Presbyterian form of worship. In 1820 a schooltaught by a Stockbridge woman opened, but the teacherdied a few years later (J. Morse 1822:323-324, 394; Clark1849, 1:240-241). About 1828 a Quaker opened anindustrial school and stayed for six or seven years(Fletcher 1888:551). Nevertheless, there remained considerableopposition to Christian missionaries, and aftera Methodist church was established at Oneida in 1829, Indian exhorters rather than ministers were appointed tovisit Onondaga as the Onondagas remained hostile toChristianity (Clark 1849, 1:241).' <sup id="cite_ref-1269" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1269">[1,269]</a></sup> 'What them was the impotus for change?

Whereas the training of girls bound them more closely to the family group, the association of the boys with their age mates in the village freed them from kin associations and laid the foundation for future hunting and war parties. When a boy was about fourteen and able to accompany the men on hunting trips, his father and other men of the hunting party took an interest in training him in the use of bow and arrow and other manly weapons. The men of the tribe recounted, for the benefit of the growing generation, their exploits on the warpath in order to instill in the youth ideals of courage and patriotism. The game of la crosse also provided valuable training for the warpath Like his sister, the boy was also influenced by attendance at religious ceremonies where the faithkeepers delivered addresses explaining the system of Iroquois supernaturals and admonishing the people to be thankful and obedient to the Great Spirit and to the moral codes of the nation.' <sup id="cite_ref-1293" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1293">[1,293]</a></sup> Christian missionaries installed schools at reservations, but Christianization did not speed up significantly until the middle of the 19th century (see next data sheet).</dd>

Curing ceremonies consisted of group shamanistic practices directed towards propitiating the responsible supernatural agents. One of the curing groups was the False Face Society. False Face Societies were found in each village and, except for a female Keeper of the False Faces who protected the ritual paraphernalia, consisted only of male members who had dreamed of participation in False Face ceremonies.' <sup id="cite_ref-1327" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1327">[1,327]</a></sup> 'Witchcraft was the most serious type of anti-social behavior. The Iroquois believed that witches, in concert with the Evil Spirit, could cause disease, accident, death, or other misfortune. Because witches were thought to be able to transform themselves into other objects, they were difficult to catch and punish.' <sup id="cite_ref-1328" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1328">[1,328]</a></sup> There were multiple shamanistic healing societies: 'As it has been previoualy stated, the curing societies integrate the four longhouses because members from the four longhouses participate in the nuxerous curing societies. Curing rituals also figure proainently in the ealendric cycle. Each society cures a specific illness. Speck (1949) lists the specialties of the various curing societies: Bear Society Rite: relief from howling hysteria and attacts of dementia in which the victim ‘crawls on the ground in the manner of a bear’...Otter Society Rite: relief from nervous tremors and associated afflictions (not demontia)...White Buffale Society Dance: relief from demontia, convulsions, bellewing hysteria...Wooden False Face Society Rite: relief from hemorrages of the nose, facial paralysis, mouth drawn to one side, dream persecution by visions, and annoyance by False Face spirits and frights in the bush...Corn-Huak Mask Society Rite: relief from afflicting dreams or hallucinations. Medicine Men's (Big Rattle) Society Rite and the Pig Mask Rite: cures bodily injury, wounds and incurable diseases and immunises against the coming of sickness foretold by a dream or vision. [Page 243] Little Water, or Dark Dance, Society Rite: relief from general sickness, called for when a person has a vision of the dwarf spirits. Eagle Society Dance Rite: relief from nervous debility (St. Vitus's dance). (1949:59-60.)' <sup id="cite_ref-1329" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1329">[1,329]</a></sup> While some forms of shamanism declined in the 17th and 18th centuries, healing societies were resilient: 'The increase in deaths due to epidemics, war and starvation contributed to the vanishing of the traditional shamans of the Iroquoians. The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries also saw the decrease in traditional guardian-spirit quests at puberty and a general decrease in belief in guardian spirits. Medicine societies, on the other hand, were gaining in strength and were under the patronage of a tutelary spirit. They assimilated into their traditions and hence “saved” many of the shamanistic songs, dances and healing techniques. Traditional Iroquoian shamanism was disappearing.' <sup id="cite_ref-1330" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1330">[1,330]</a></sup> 'A person joins a society when he or she dreams of the masks or of the rituals or when a clairvoyant prescribes the ceremony as a curing agent. Sometimes the disease symptoms by their very nature lead an individual or fortuneteller to conclude that somehow it was “caused” by a particular society and can only be cured by them. Such is the numinous quality of False-Face power, i.e., it works ill and well. Usual symptoms of illness are “ailments of the head, shoulders and joints. They cause and cure swelling of the face, toothache, inflammation of the eyes, nose bleeding, sore chin and earache. At Tonawanda, red spots on the patient's face calls for the red Faces, [Page 236] who should dance before sunrise. Black spots require the use of black masks at night.”' <sup id="cite_ref-1331" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1331">[1,331]</a></sup> The False Face society is particularly prominent in the ethnography: 'The prime motive in the establishment of this organization was to propitiate those demons called Falsefaces, and among other good results to arrest pestilence and disease. In course of time the band itself was believed to have a species of control over diseases, and over the healing art; and they were often invoked for the cure of simple diseases, and to drive away, or exorcise the plague, if it had actually broken out in their midst. As recently as the summer of 1849, when the cholera prevailed through the State, the Falsefaces, in appropriate costume, went from house to house at Tonawanda, through the old school portion of the village, and performed the usual ceremonies prescribed for the expulsion of the pestilence.//'When any one was sick with a complaint within the range of their healing powers, and dreamed that he saw a Falseface, this was interpreted to signify that through their instrumentality he was to be cured. Having informed the mistress of the band, and prepared the customary feast, the Falsefaces at once appeared, preceded by their female leader, and marching in Indian file. Each one wore a mask or false face, a tattered blanket over his shoulders, and carried a turtle shell rattle in his hand. On entering the house of the invalid they first stirred the ashes upon the hearth, and then sprinkled the patient over with hot ashes until his head and hair were covered; after which they performed some manipulations over him in turn, and finally led him around with them in the falseface dance ( Gä-go-s[unknown] ), with which their ceremonies concluded. When these performances were over, the entertainment prepared for the occasion was distributed to the band, and by [Page 160] them carried away for their private feasting, as they never unmasked themselves before the people. Among the simple complaints which the Falsefaces could cure infallibly, were nose bleed, toothache, swellings, and inflammation of the eyes. The false face shown in the figure was purchased of an Onondaga on Grand river.' <sup id="cite_ref-1332" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1332">[1,332]</a></sup> 'Fenton holds that the False-Face rituals did not enter the Seneca society until the latter half of the seventeenth century, after the devastating defeat of the Hurons by the Iroquois. It may also be that the Seneca began to use the masks when they were visited by the great epidemics. It is most likely that they were quite aware of the function of these masks from their observation of Huronian practices during the latter's epidemics. Being in the grip of such a powerful, deadly and decimating disease, the Seneca and other [Page 240] Iroquoians would undoubtedly have tried any and all magico-religious devices at hand.' <sup id="cite_ref-1333" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1333">[1,333]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Tribute ♣ present ♥</b> The league received tribute from subject peoples: 'Up to 1693 the Iroquois also used wampum as money, either in strings or loose. It served as currency between the Indians and the Dutch and English colonists. Enormous quantities were used to pay the tribute demanded from the Iroquois by other Indian tribes.' <sup id="cite_ref-1334" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1334">[1,334]</a></sup> 'Hale (1965:88-89) has summarized the principles and methods used by the Iroquois in attempting to establish universal peace. The League's primary goal was the voluntary admittance of all nations and tribes. However admirable this project was, the realities of life quickly demonstrated a great void between ideology and execution. Nevertheless, some [Page 52] Nanticokes, Tuteloes, a band of Delawares, and the Tuscarora were ultimately admitted to the League. If a nation did not ask outright to join the League, the Iroquois then sought to accomplish the same end by suggesting a treaty of alliance. Should subtle hints of this nature fail to bring the desired response the third alternative was to declare war. If the unfortunate nation capitulated early, it was at once spared and usually allowed to retain its territory and most of its property. The people were required to acknowledge the Iroquois as their superior, to pay a modest tribute in wampum and furs, and refrain from any further war activity. When all else failed, the Iroquois did not hesitate to totally annihilate whole tribes. “But,” Hale (1965:95) points out, the Iroquois never for a moment forgot the principles which lay at the foundation of their League, and which taught them to “strengthen their house” by converting enemies into friends. On the instant that resistance ceased, slaughter ceased with it. The warriors who were willing to unite their fortunes with the Confederates were at once welcomed among them. Some were adopted into the families of those who had lost children or brothers. Others had lands allotted to them, on which they were allowed to live by themselves, under their own chiefs and their native laws, until in two or three generations, by friendly intercourse, frequent intermarriages, and community of interests, they became gradually absorbed into the society about them.' <sup id="cite_ref-1335" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1335">[1,335]</a></sup> 'If we examine the conditions under which European-Iroquois contacts took place it may be possible to suggest the factors which were responsible for the League's losing its independent status. At the outset we can dismiss the consideration that the League may have failed to comprehend fully the significance of sovereignty. As a confederate body to which member nations had delegated control of external affairs, the League was practiced in dealing with self-governing Indian groups. As conquerors of many neighboring tribes from which they collected tribute they inevitably learned the distinction between an independent and a subject people. The English were assisted in their relations with Amerind groups by possessing an apperceptive background for contact which the Iroquois lacked. Earlier voyages had acquainted them with the existence of other races and cultures and provided an opportunity for appraising their position in relation to other societies. The Six Nations, not possessing this experience, were relatively unprepared for the appearance of Europeans.' <sup id="cite_ref-1336" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1336">[1,336]</a></sup> The Delaware paid tribute to the league: 'In 1712, when the Delaware got ready to carry their annual tribute to Onondaga, they sent for the Governor of Pennsylvania and laid out on the floor 32 belts of wampum in which various figures had been wrought by their women, and a large calumet which they said had been given to them a generation previously when they submitted to the Five Nations, who had told them to show it whenever they came to a new place and on returning to Onondaga as symbolic of their friendship and subjection to the Five Nations. The calumet, which attracted some attention and is variously described in the records, had “a stone head, a wooden or cane shaft, and feathers fixt to it like wings, with other ornaments” (Provincial Council of Pa., Minutes, 1852, vol. 2, p. 546; Hanna, 1911, vol. 1, pp. 101-102 [slightly different]; Weslager, 1944, p. 383).' <sup id="cite_ref-1337" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1337">[1,337]</a></sup> It seems the Mohawk also collected tribute independently of the league: 'The Mohawks were receivers of tribute from subjugated nations. This hereditary privilege must be placed upon the same footing with the preceding. It may, perhaps, indicate that the nations upon their borders were in subjection.' <sup id="cite_ref-1338" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1338">[1,338]</a></sup> 'Theoretically, the tribes of the Confederacy enjoyed equality within the structure of the League. The special prerogatives held by certain tribes were the result of accidents of location, and numerical differences in the tribes at the time of the formation of the Confederacy. The four (or three) brothers side or moiety were elder brothers of the three (or two) brothers moiety. The Mohawk of the elder brother side were referred to or, as it may be rendered, the shield.” The special prerogative of this tribe was the right to collect tribute from subject tribes. The Seneca, also of this moiety, were the guardians of the “western door” because of their geographical position along the western boundary of the Confederacy, and were known as those “who threw out the snake.” That is, it was their duty to dispose of any matters harmful to the League. In addition to this [Page 39] privilege, the Seneca were further honored by being assigned the two hereditary war chiefships of the League. The most important honors belonged to the third tribe of this moiety, the Onondaga. They were the Firekeeepers of the Confederacy and one of their chiefs was the custodian of the Council wampum. No particular prerogatives belonged to the two tribes of the younger brother moiety; the Oneida who were known as the Great Tree, and the Cayuga whose national epithet was the Great Pipe.' <sup id="cite_ref-1339" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1339">[1,339]</a></sup>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Staple ♣ absent ♥</b> eHRAF provides a general summary of Iroquois political and military history: 'The Iroquoian confederacy was organized sometime between 1400 and A.D. 1600 for the purpose of maintaining peaceful relations between the 5 constituent tribes. Subsequent to European contact relations within the confederacy were sometimes strained as each of the 5 tribes sought to expand and maintain its own interests in the developing fur trade. For the most part, however, the fur trade served to strengthen the confederacy because tribal interests often complemented one another and all gained from acting in concert. The League was skillful at playing French and English interests off against one another to its advantage and thereby was able to play a major role in the economic and political events of northeastern North America during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The Iroquois aggressively maintained and expanded their role in the fur trade and as a result periodically found themselves at war with their neighbors, such as the Huron, Petun, and the Neutral to the West and the Susquehannock to the south. Much of the fighting was done by the Seneca, the most powerful of the Iroquoian tribes. From 1667 to the 1680s the Iroquois maintained friendly relations with the French and during this time Jesuit missions were established among each of the 5 tribes.' <sup id="cite_ref-1340" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1340">[1,340]</a></sup> 'However, Iroquois aggression and expansion eventually brought them into conflict with the French and, at the same time, into closer alliance with the English. In 1687, 1693 and 1696 French military expeditions raided and burned Iroquois villages and fields. During Queen Anne's War (1702-1713) the Iroquois allied with the English and at the War's end were acknowledged to be British subjects, though they continued to aggressively maintain and extend their middleman role between English traders at Fort Orange (Albany) and native groups farther west. The victory of the English over the French in North America in 1763 weakened the power of the confederacy by undermining the strategic economic and political position of the tribes and by promoting the rapid expansion of White settlement. When the American Revolution broke out in 1775 neither the League as a whole nor even the tribes individually were able to agree on a common course of action. Most of the Iroquois allied with the British and as a result during and after the Revolution were forced from their homelands. In the period following the American Revolution the members of the Iroquois tribes settled on reservations in western New York state, southern Quebec and southern Ontario, where many of their descendants remain today.' <sup id="cite_ref-1341" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1341">[1,341]</a></sup></dd>

<p><b>♠ Degree of taxation ♣ absent ♥</b> There was no taxation within the league: 'Thus the League of the Iroquois was an alliance conceived among aboriginal nations which, though culturally related and speaking languages fundamentally similar but differing in vocabulary and [Page 37] idiom, had recurrently been in conflict. The league brought them out of conflict into peace. Then came the French, the Dutch, and the English, and the doom of the league was sealed, its desired results nullified. Here was an alliance binding together five distinct nations, based upon an orally transmitted constitution. It had no inscribed statutes, no taxes or levies, no gendarmerie, no hireling politicians. We hear, however, of tribute exacted of subjugated tribes. Tribute, as the Iroquois took it, consisted of stipulated sums of wampum demanded of the Algonkian tribes on the Atlantic Coast who produced it; and wampum was not an item of money, cash, or currency in native economy before the coming of Europeans to the Hudson Valley. Its function was that of a symbol, valuable in a spiritual sense and capable of serving the purposes of mnemonic record making. Thus the wampum tribute we read so much about would seem to be a measure pressed upon subjugated smaller tribes in the shell-bearing coastal regions, requiring them to furnish the wampum the Iroquois needed in the score of ceremonial uses they had developed for it.' <sup id="cite_ref-1342" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1342">[1,342]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Wages ♣ ♥</b> Note: 'Traditionally, the Iroquois were farmers and hunters who practiced a slash-and-burn form of horticulture. In addition, they fished and gathered berries, plants, and roots. Before the arrival of Europeans the primary weapons were bows and arrows, stone axes and knives and blowguns, however, by the late seventeenth century European trade goods had almost completely replaced the traditional weapons and tools. The principal crops were maize, beans, and squash which, in addition, were prominent in ceremonial activities. In good years surplus crops were dried and stored for future use. After the harvest of crops in the late summer, the seasonal round included fall hunting that lasted until the winter solstice, early spring fishing and hunting of passenger pigeons, and then spring and summer clearing and planting of fields.' <sup id="cite_ref-1343" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1343">[1,343]</a></sup> Labour was divided according to age and gender: 'Traditionally, men hunted and fished, built houses, cleared fields for planting, and were responsible for trade and warfare. In addition, men had the more visible roles in tribal and confederacy politics. Farming was the responsibility of women, whose work also included gathering wild foods, rearing children, preparing food, and making clothing and baskets and other utensils.' <sup id="cite_ref-1344" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1344">[1,344]</a></sup> 'Economically, the maintenance of the household was a joint undertaking, but the women had the chief responsibility in the care of the fields and the raising of the staple foods. Men and women cooperated in the clearing of new fields, after that the women's group took over. Men's hunting added an important relish to the diet. A good meatprovider was considered the best husband. But hunting was more a prestige and recreation point, than a necessity. Village sites were  changed when the fields near them were exhausted--every 15 or 20 years with this type of horticulture--rather than when the district had been hunted out. Conflicts with pioneers occurred more often over the decimation of the game animals, due to the clearing and planting of large numbers of acres, rather than over the scarcity of arable land. But in this case one must remember that it was the Iroquois men with their developed war patterns who came in contact with the pioneers.' <sup id="cite_ref-1345" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1345">[1,345]</a></sup> Many goods were produced in the community: 'The Iroquois knew how to bend and shape wood when green or after steaming. House frames, pack frames, snowshoes, toboggans, basket rims, lacrosse sticks and other wood products were made using these techniques. Rope was made from the inner bark of hickory, basswood and slippery elm and burden straps and prisoner ties were made from the braided fibers of nettle, milkweed and hemp. Pipes of fired clay were among the many types of items manufactured by the Iroquois. The Iroquois are known for making ash and maple splint baskets, although this craft may be of European origin.' <sup id="cite_ref-1346" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1346">[1,346]</a></sup> But trade was also important: 'Long before European contact the Iroquois were involved in an intricate trade network with other native groups (see cultural relations above). Clay pipes were an important trade item that reached other native groups all along the east coast of North America. The aggressive behavior the Iroquois exhibited towards their neighbors during the fur trade period has been interpreted by some as the result of their aim to protect and expand their middleman role. Others have suggested that the aggressive behavior of the Iroquois tribes was related to the scarcity of furs in their own territory and the resulting difficulty in obtaining European trade goods. According to this theory, the Iroquois warred primarily to obtain the trade goods of their neighbors in closer contact with Europeans. After the center of fur trading activities had moved farther west, the Iroquois continued to play an important role as voyageurs and trappers.' <sup id="cite_ref-1347" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1347">[1,347]</a></sup> Accordingly, some of the below variables may not be applicable to the Iroquois.
