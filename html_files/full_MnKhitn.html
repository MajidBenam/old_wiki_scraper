<p>"The Khitan first appear in documentary sources in the 4th century as a people of the south-central portion of northeast China, from a region of mountains and open grasslands. Under the leadership of Abaoji, the Khitan rapidly adopted a centralized royal form of organization, with clear similarities to Chinese traditions but also incorporating some of the familiar steppe pastoralist strategies (Wittfogel and Feng 1949, pp. 59-65).

<dl><dd> "The Liao emperor did not conquer and govern the Central Plains directly. ... by dint of military success, he had become the legitimate emperor of the Central Plains. Familiar with T'ang protocols, and advised by formally educated ministers from both Liao and the Later Chin, Te-kuang observed such practices as declaring a new dynasty, wearing Chinese dress, and reemploying former officials. ... He appointed new governors, demoted K'ai-feng from its capital status, and established Chen-chou as a capital instead. But Te-kuang did not intend to stay. ... he treaded the conquest as a very large raid, in which public relations were irrelevant and only loot mattered. Perhaps most damaging to Te-kuang's image was the policy of "smashing the pasture and grain" (ta ts'ao-yu) ... The Liao armies devestated the region around the capital, foraging to supply themselves and practicing the all-too-common cruelties of soldiers in wartime. To reward his troops, claimed to number three hundred thousand, Te-kuang demanded from an already overtaxed population cash and cloth to be stockpiled for transport north. Most ambitious of all was Te-kuang's attempt to take north every material element of the Later Chin imperial institution, including palace women and eunuchs, the complete contents of the imperial storehouses, and every last bureaucrat. ... Te-kuang ... apparently wrote his younger brother listing his own three faults in this venture: demanding cash from the people. ordering indiscriminate foraging and plundering, and failing to return the governors to their provinces in good time. The letter, preserved in the Liao shih (Official history of the Liao), describes the "foreignness" of the Khitan: they are raiders (rather than tax collectors) and pastoralists (rather than farmers), and they keep their governors at court(rather than giving them active responsibility in their provinces)."<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup></dd>

</p><p>"The comitatus of the early Khitan, a Mongolic people, is known from the ac- counts of An Lu-shan’s Rebellion. For a detailed treatment of the later Liao Dynasty of the Khitan, including discussion of its imperial guard corps, see the outstanding early study by Wittfogel and Fêng (1949). “Each [Khitan Liao] emperor had a separate ordo, or camp, with a ‘heart and belly guard’ of 10,000 to 20,000 households. . . . The members of this guard, particularly the non-Khitans, were the emperor’s private slaves, but their proximity to him gave them high status. After the emperor’s death they guarded his mausoleum while his suc- cessor recruited a new ordo and guard” (Atwood 2004: 297). The Liao state, with its five capitals (ordo), seems to have been organized, theoretically, around the ideal of the “khan and four-bey” system. The khan of the Kereit, who were rivals of Temüjin during his rise to power, “had crack forces of ba’aturs, ‘heroes’, and a 1,000-man day guard, institutions Chinggis Khan would later imitate” (Atwood 2004: 296), along with the golden tent (ordo) connected to them." <sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>

</p><p><b>♠ Wars of world religion against tribal religion ♣ inferred present ♥</b> "Kitan cultural activity included poetry, painting, and Buddhism (entirely in the Chinese tradition), but there was little interest in CONFUCIANISM. Twice the court fed all the realm’s monks: 50,000 of them in 942 and 360,000 in 1078. Kitans regularly sent at least one son to a monastery. Even so, traditional Kitan rituals continued, including monthly worship of the sun and annual worship of the dynastic progenitors at the sacred Muye Mountain near the Laoha-Shara Mören (Xar Moron) confluence. Shamans were an honored part of society. Kitan coronations included unique rituals such as the 'rebirthing ceremony,' in which the emperor was symbolically reborn as a baby, and the 'firewood investiture,' in which a dragon-embroidered rug was burned to announce the emperor’s accession."<sup id="cite_ref-137" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-137">[137]</a></sup> It seems reasonable that the Khitans, who followed Chinese Buddhism (albeit mixed with local traditions), fought with steppe groups that followed their own tribal practices.

The first, 'large' script was created in 920 and was basically logographic (i.e., one character per word).

"Abaoji advanced toward Mongolia with his conquest of the “Black-Cart” SHIWEI (probably around modern SHILIIN GOL) in 907, famed for their carts and metalworking.

"In the early years of T'ien-tso's reign, relations between the Jurchen and the Liao had become increasingly strained. The Jurchen bitterly resented the way in which the Liao local officials at Ning-chiang, the main border trading post, constantly cheated them.

<p>"Over the centuries prior to the formation of their expansive state, the Khitans alternated alliance and war with virtually all their neighbors, but especially different Chinese states. In A.D. 947 the Later Jin dynasty (A.D. 1115-1234) surrendered and the Khitan state took on the name Great Liao (for the Liao River). Successful Khitan attacks farther south against the Song dynasty (A.D. 960-1279) resulted in substantial tribute payments and a trade agreement that continued for 100 years. After initial expansion the Khitans did not continue to press against the Xia steppe empire or against Korea; diplomatic agreements were put in place instead. The principal challenge to the empire came from internal dissention by several of the original groups of the confederation. By 1114, a Jurchin alliance instigated a civil war in cooperation with the Sung Chinese. The capital was captured and the emperor killed in 1125 (Franke 1990)." <sup id="cite_ref-152" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-152">[152]</a></sup>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ blood brotherhood ritual ♥</b> In the fifth century BCE, Herodotus says they were performed by the Scythians <sup id="cite_ref-227" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-227">[227]</a></sup> (typically the first people mentioned in histories of Central Eurasia, even though they never reached as far as our NGA), we know that the Khitan performed them in the tenth century at least <sup id="cite_ref-228" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-228">[228]</a></sup>, and we know that the Mongols performed them in subsequent centuries <sup id="cite_ref-229" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-229">[229]</a></sup>. This suggests continuity between the Scythians, Khitan and Mongols, which in turn suggests that the blood brotherhood ritual was probably performed by peoples that inhabited Central Eurasia after the Scythians and before the Khitan - and these people may well have included the Xiungnu. "Herodotus also tells us that the Scythians give each other sworn pledges by pouring their blood, mixed with wine, into a bowl in which they dip a sword, arrows, an axe and a javelin before drinking from it. We may note that the use of arrows in making a 'blood-brother' agreement is evidenced in the case of Genghis Khan and also in East (or Chinese) Turkistan (now Sinkiang or Xinjiang in north-west China): there, as generally among the Turks and Mongols, the weapons represent the souls of men themselves." <sup id="cite_ref-230" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-230">[230]</a></sup> "Arrows (along with bows, saddles, horses, and gowns) also figure in ritual exchanges made between two men who agree to be blood-brothers." <sup id="cite_ref-231" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-231">[231]</a></sup>. "Found in many Turco-Mongol nomadic societies, the ritual of blood brotherhood involved drinking from a cup into which blood from both parties had been poured.

</p><p>For the purposes of this project we define an institution as a system of social norms that governs the behavior of individuals in certain contexts, with social norms understood simply as socially transmitted rules of behavior. Institutions are also understood as being generally persistent across generations, changing only slowly over time although sometimes changing suddenly through some shock or radical social change. A classic example of an institution is marriage, which governs the behavior of the spouses in the context of their family and household. Particular norms within this institution describe the expected division of labor, rights and obligations of the partners, their children, and in-laws, etc. Because norms are socially transmitted rules, they are an example of a cultural element (by our definition, culture is any kind of socially transmitted information). There are other definitions of norms and institutions, but the one given here was chosen for its compatibility with the theoretical framework of cultural evolution (and this definition is not incompatible with alternative ones, e.g. institutions as alternative equilibria). It is often useful to distinguish formal from informal institutions. In the following, we will ask whether an institution is legally prescribed (part of a constitution or formal law code) or something that is an unwritten rule that, nevertheless, reflects the way things are done, and are expected to be done.
</p><p>We define 'elite' as the top social, political, economic, and/or religious members of society. In the codes below, when we say to code as 'equal to top nobility', we are referring to the society's elite groups and families. 'Higher than top nobility', then, refers to the ruling family, and 'lower than top nobility' refers to all people at a lower status than the elite groups and families.

"Relations with his neighbors were also of secondary importance to A-pao- chi, for he faced a major problem in maintaining his supreme power among the Khitan. After his election as leader in 907, his plans to consolidate his absolute authority did not go unchallenged. The biggest threat came from his younger brothers and other members of the Yeh-lii clan, who had become the new Khitan aristocracy following the eclipse of the Yao-lien. In traditional Khitan society, succession to both the khaghanate and tribal chieftainships had commonly passed to brothers or cousins. Moreover, custom demanded that the ruler be reelected every three years, when another member of the tribal council or another candidate from his own clan might be chosen to replace him. In 910, when his reelection was due, A-pao-chi failed to go through this procedure, and his brothers, feeling cheated of their own chances of succession, sought to prevent him from establishing a permanent dynasty based on succession from father to son, as this would have ended forever their own claims to leadership. Most resentful was the eldest of A- pao-chi's younger brothers, La-ko. In 911 four of the younger brothers rebelled, and in 912 another plot to assassinate A-pao-chi engineered by the same four brothers was uncovered before it could be carried out. In 913, when A-pao-chi's second three-year term as khaghan came to an end and he again refused to put himself forward for reelection, a far more serious rebellion, led by his brothers, his uncle, and his cousin who was chieftain of the I-la, broke out and was suppressed with much bloodshed. All these rebellions failed, however, and their defeat acceler- ated the accumulation of power in A-pao-chi's hands. But he was not yet a complete despot. He remained sufficiently enmeshed in the Khitan tribal system that he could not simply eliminate all his rivals. His brothers' lives were spared, although his uncle and cousin and more than three hundred of their supporters were executed. <sup id="cite_ref-292" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-292">[292]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<p>While the codes above reflect a legal or explicit right of some group to constrain the executive power, below code for non-formal limits. These include social or cultural norms which limit the action that can be seen as legitimately undertaken by the executive, for instance an unwritten restriction against an executive making changes to or decisions on religious matters. It is possible to code for all four combinations of absent/present along the formal/informal institution. So there could be the legal right to criticize a chief executive but it’s never used. Or, there may not be a law that specifies how the ruler is criticized, but there is an established practice of doing so. Where coding ‘present’ provide explanation and examples. Note that you should only code non-violent actions (so a rebellion that overthrows the head of state is not an instance of informal ‘impeachment’)

The khaghan's tenure of office was not for life; he might be removed from his office and replaced. In such a case he would bear no malice against his successor and would be allowed to return unmolested to head his own tribe. Such a form of political organization was not unique to the Khitan but was also found among other northern peoples. It was a device to ensure that leadership was in the hands of a capable man enjoying the confidence of his tribal peers. The "hereditary" leadership first of the Ta-ho and later of the Yao-lien clans was thus not a simple hereditary succession determined by primogeniture. Although the clan provided a pool of eligible candidates, succession did not necessarily pass to the senior clan member or even to a member of the senior generation. Rather, it was a succession subject to election and periodical confirmation by the leaders of the other tribal groups." <sup id="cite_ref-309" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-309">[309]</a></sup></dd>

The empress sent Li-hu with an army to block Yiian's return to the capital. When Li-hu's army was defeated, the redoubtable old lady led her own army to confront the new emperor. On the Shira muren, just south of the Supreme Capital, the two armies faced each other for several days. The crisis was resolved by the mediation of a royal cousin named Yeh-lii Wu-chih (916-72). This time the empress dowager was unable to have her way. Wu-chih and the Khitan nobles rejected Li-hu on the grounds that he had made himself generally hated because of his cruelty. The empress dowager gave in, telling Li-hu that he had brought failure on himself. The confrontation between the legitimate hereditary heir and the late emperor's brother was thus resolved in favor of the hereditary heir. But it was not his hereditary claim that had prevailed; rather, his rival had been rejected by the nobility because he was personally unacceptable as a ruler. Although the empress lost, the Khitan principle of "electing" a suitable candidate was what swayed the decision."  <sup id="cite_ref-312" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-312">[312]</a></sup> <span style="color:purple">3. Shih-Tsung to Mu-Tsung: </span> Shih-Tsung was murdered but the succession passed to Mu-Tsung regardless of the conspirators' claim. "In the late autumn of 951 Shih-tsung took personal command of a southern expedition against the Chou. But before the army set out, he fell victim to yet another conspiracy, this time hatched by sons of A-pao-chi's younger brothers, seeking once again to assert the claims to the succession of junior lines of the royal family. The emperor, like many of the Khitan nobles, was much addicted to drink, and when he and his entourage were helplessly drunk after having sacrificed to his deceased father in preparation for the expedition, Ch'a-ko, a son of A-pao-chi's younger brother An-tuan, murdered him. The conspirators, however, had neglected to gain the support of the courtiers and thus were summarily executed. Shih-tsung was only thirty-three, and because he had no grown son, the succession passed to the eldest son of T'ai-tsung, Ching (931-69; Khitan name Shu-lii), who is known by his posthumous temple name Mu-tsung. The southern campaign was abandoned." <sup id="cite_ref-313" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-313">[313]</a></sup>  Mu-Tsung was also murdered, but not in an attempt to contest the transition to his heir. "In 969 Mu-tsung was murdered. He had spent the whole of the first month of the year in a furious drinking bout during which he again abused members of his entourage. In the second month he attended to business long enough to invest as his vassal the new ruler of Northern Han, Liu Chi-yiian. But he then again began to act violently and irrationally, butchering some of his bodyguards. Finally, driven to extremes, six of his personal attendants murdered him during the night. The Liao were well rid of a bloodthirsty and totally unpredictable tyrant.

<p><b>♠ State-level administrators ♣ present ♥</b> "At the beginning of Shih-tsung's reign, immediately after his return to the Supreme Capital, he formally divided the empire into Northern and Southern Regions (Pei-mien, Nan-mien). These were true regional divisions of Liao territory. The Southern Region comprised the predominantly Chinese and Po-hai areas of the south and east. The Northern Region was the area largely settled by Khitan and dependent tribal peoples. Because the Northern Region also included stable settlements of Chinese, Po-hai, and even Uighurs, it was given a dual administrative system. It had therefore both a Khitan Northern Commission for Military Affairs (Ch'i-tan Pei shu-mi yiian) and a Khitan Southern Commission for Military Affairs (Ch'i-tan Nan shu-mi yiian). The southern commissioners were usually members of the Yeh-lii royal clan, the northern commissioners mostly members of the Hsiao consort clan. The administration of the Northern Region was mainly, though not exclusively, staffed by Khitan holding traditional Khitan titles. Its most powerful officers were the Khitan commissioners for military affairs, the prime ministers of the Northern and Southern administrations {Pei-fu tsai-hsiang, Nan-fu tsai-hsiang), the Northern and Southern Great Kings (Pei Ta-wang, Nan Ta- wang), both of whom were members of the royal clan, and the commander in chief {yu-yueh). These men controlled all military and tribal affairs, the selection of military commanders, the disposition of the tribal herds, and the allocation of pastures. Beneath them was a bewildering array of tribal officials, an office for the royal clan of the former Po-hai state, and a range of offices providing services to the imperial house: artisans, physicians, huntsmen, and commissioners responsible for the royal herds, stud farms, and stables. No one could possibly confuse the administration of the Northern Region with the orderly model of T'ang government. It was essentially a great tribal leader's personal retinue, and many of its offices were specifically reserved for members of one or another branch of the royal or consort clans and filled by hereditary selection (shih-hsiian).[...]  The government of the Southern Region was designed in imitation of a T'ang model. It was based, as was the government of the Northern Region, at the Supreme Capital, where it had its main offices. It had the traditional groups of elder statesmen, the Three Preceptors (san shih) and the Three Dukes (san kung) to act as imperial advisers, and a complex bureaucracy at the head of which were three ministries similar to the three central ministries (san sheng) of early T'ang. There was a Chinese Commission for Military Affairs (Han-jen Shu-mi yiian), which combined the functions of the Commission for Military Affairs (Shu-mi yiian) under the Five Dynasties with those of the T'ang Department of State Affairs (Shang-shu sheng) and controlled five rather than six executive boards; a Secretariat (at first called Cheng-shih sheng; after 1044, Chung-shu sheng) headed by a grand prime minister (ta ch'eng-hsiang) and two deputy prime ministers (ch'eng-hsiang) and including a staff of secretaries and councillors; and a Chancellery (Men-hsia sheng) responsible for drafting documents. Each of these ministries had, on paper at least, a complicated bureaucratic establishment similar to its T'ang model, but only the Secretariat played any significant role in political decisions. There was also the Censorate (Yii-shih t'ai), the Han-lin Academy, the Office of Historiography, and various groups of court scholars, all organized along Tang lines. There was an imperial household department, various specialized courts (ssu) and directorates (chieri), a formal establishment for the heir apparent, and a military organization of royal guards {wet)."  <sup id="cite_ref-318" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-318">[318]</a></sup>

The "court" was a great portable city of tents and pavilions, transported on a train of ox-drawn wagons. The entourage lived partly off the land surrounding their camp: The local inhabitants were sometimes granted tax exemptions in recompense. In the early days at least, the imperial palace at the capital was not the expected vast range of lavish buildings but, rather, the site where the emperor's tents were pitched when he was in residence." <sup id="cite_ref-320" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-320">[320]</a></sup></dd></dl>

Last, a Western Capital at Ta-t'ung was established in 1044. Each of these capitals was not so much an alternative seat of imperial government (as, e.g., Ch'ang-an and Lo-yang had been in early T'ang) as the regional center of a circuit, a local administrative network. Each of these circuits seems to have followed administrative procedures appropriate to its own population. The picture was further complicated during the tenth century by the fact that two of the larger groups of conquered peoples, the Hsi and Po-hai, retained a great degree of autonomy under their own leaders and paid tribute as vassals rather than taxes as subjects. Only in the early eleventh century were these populations fully incorporated into the Liao system of government. The viceroys (liu-hou) of these capitals wielded great power over their circuits, especially those of the Southern and Eastern capitals, who were among the most powerful men in the Liao system of government.

Its most powerful officers were the Khitan commissioners for military affairs, the prime ministers of the Northern and Southern administrations {Pei-fu tsai-hsiang, Nan-fu tsai-hsiang), the Northern and Southern Great Kings (Pei Ta-wang, Nan Ta- wang), both of whom were members of the royal clan, and the commander in chief {yu-yueh). These men controlled all military and tribal affairs, the selection of military commanders, the disposition of the tribal herds, and the allocation of pastures. Beneath them was a bewildering array of tribal officials, an office for the royal clan of the former Po-hai state, and a range of offices providing services to the imperial house: artisans, physicians, huntsmen, and commissioners responsible for the royal herds, stud farms, and stables. No one could possibly confuse the administration of the Northern Region with the orderly model of T'ang government. It was essentially a great tribal leader's personal retinue, and many of its offices were specifically reserved for members of one or another branch of the royal or consort clans and filled by hereditary selection (shih-hsiian)."  <sup id="cite_ref-367" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-367">[367]</a></sup></dd>

<p>We are interested here in any systems of thought and behavior that can influence people's actions, which we term a <i>Normative Ideology</i>.  Normative ideologies are thought-systems concerned with the correct behavior of people, governments/leaders, and other groups (and particularly the relationships between these groups).
</p><p>Mainly, this will be a religious or ritual system. As usual, when we mention Religious or Ritual System our focus  is on the 'official cult', defined the same way as in the Rituals section:
</p>
<dl><dd>With the official cult we refer to the set of collective religious practices that are most closely associated with legitimation of the power structure (including elites, if any).</dd></dl>
<p>However, Normative Ideologies are not restricted to religious/ritual systems. They include other thought systems, such as philosophy or anything that prescribes a particular pattern of behaviour. An example is  classical Greek philosophy, such as the works of Plato and Aristotle, who were concerned with correct or moral behaviour and whose thoughts influenced the actual practice of several societies (the empire of Alexander the Great, notably).

Consequently, Buddhism’s ethical system emerged resting squarely on a body of preestablished forms of family practice, and supported by a fairly codified sociolegal system that had already taken form under the aegis of the Brahmanical tradition, sometime before the sixth-century bce. Thus, as a relatively late arriver, Buddhism accepted, tacitly, many of the given forms of social praxis in India. And, even when Buddhism sought to redefine religious goals and family values, these efforts were manifested vis-a-vis patterns that had already been in place for centuries. In short, whatever the exact historical reasons, one will look in vain for Buddhist spokespersons seeking to redo marriage law in India or in other Asian countries.” <sup id="cite_ref-418" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-418">[418]</a></sup>

If we take care of our own spiritual development, we render a service to others; and if we develop love towards others, we thereby also help ourselves. Accordingly, it is explicitly stated, someone who pursues the path of salvation only for his or her own benefit is to be censured, while the one who follows the path for one’s own benefit and for the benefit of others is to be commended (see AN 7:64).” <sup id="cite_ref-419" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-419">[419]</a></sup> “Three segments of the Noble Eightfold Path (3 - 5) are traditionally subsumed under the principle of morality (śīla): ‘right speech’ (3), ‘right action’ (4) and ‘right livelihood’ (5).

From monks and nuns complete sexual abstention is demanded. ‘Right livelihood’ means abstaining from those sources of income which involve harming other beings: trading in weapons for instance, or trading in living beings, meat, intoxicants or poison; also included is the avoidance of fraud and avarice.” <sup id="cite_ref-420" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-420">[420]</a></sup>

<p><b>Supernatural Enforcement of Morality</b>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement against harm ♣ present ♥</b> “The heart of Buddhist spiritual life, whether lay or monastic, is puṇya (Pali puñña ). This term is usually translated as ‘merit’ and refers to certain significant kinds of action that are regarded as auspicious and potent deeds. Essentially, merit is good ‘karma’ ( karman/kamma)&nbsp;: wholesome ( kuśla/kusala ) deeds which plant seeds that bear fortunate and pleasant fruits, whether in this life or lives to come, and thereby create conditions for further meritorious action in the future. These are the kinds of action that conduce to the development of the qualities of the eightfold path. Moreover it is making merit that binds the lay and monastic communities together. The traditional ‘bases of merit’ are generosity (dāna), ethical conduct ( śīla/sīla ), and meditation ( bhāvanā ). [...]The practice of good conduct takes the form of commitment to the five precepts usually recited in conjunction with the three refuges: (1) to refrain from harming living creatures, (2) to refrain from taking what is not given, (3) to refrain from sexual misconduct, (4) to refrain from false speech, (5) to refrain from intoxicants that cause heedlessness (see pp. 170- 2). In addition the lay disciple may on special occasions (traditionally the full moon ‘observance’ days) or for longer periods take the eight precepts, replacing the third precept (refraining from sexual misconduct) with complete sexual abstinence and adding (6) refraining from eating after midday, (7) refraining from attending entertainments and using perfumes, etc., and (8) refraining from using luxurious beds.”<sup id="cite_ref-460" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-460">[460]</a></sup> “The nature of bad action is usually illustrated by reference to a list of the ten courses of unwholesome action ( karma/kamma-patha ) which consist of three bodily courses of action (taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct), four vocal courses of action (lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech, frivolous speech), and three mental courses of action (covetousness, ill-will, wrong view). [...] Essentially the psychological states that motivate the ten unwholesome courses of action— strong greed, hatred, and delusion —lead to rebirth in the unhappy destinies or ‘descents’: in a hell realm, as a hungry ghost, an animal, or a jealous god. In fact rather a precise correlation exists here: dominated by greed one becomes a hungry ghost, a class of beings ever discontent and anguished because of being unable to satisfy their greed; dominated by hatred one enters one of the hell realms where one suffers terrible pain; dominated by ignorance one becomes an animal ruled by the instincts of food and reproduction.” <sup id="cite_ref-461" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-461">[461]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of fairness ♣ present ♥</b> “In the cosmology set out above, karma functions as the elevator that takes people from one floor of the building to another. Good deeds result in an upward movement and bad deeds in a downward one. Karma is not a system of rewards and punishments meted out by God but a kind of natural law akin to the law of gravity. [...] Buddhists speak of good karma as ‘merit’ (puñña, Sanskrit: puṇya), and much effort is expended in acquiring it. Some picture it as a kind of spiritual capital—like money in a bank account—whereby credit is built up as the deposit on a heavenly rebirth.

<dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of in-group loyalty ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> “As mentioned before, the development of a loving mind towards all beings, whether friend or foe, is the aim of one of the meditative practices of early Buddhism (see above p. 53f ). In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsāric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f ). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21).” <sup id="cite_ref-471" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-471">[471]</a></sup> “[...] Buddhism maintained a fairly flexible posture vis-a-vis competing religions and never sought to require laity to identify themselves exclusively as Buddhist or to rely singularly on the Buddhist clergy for all their spiritual needs.” <sup id="cite_ref-472" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-472">[472]</a></sup></dd>

Some texts affirm that even killing in self-defence, or in defence of family or friends, is wrongful, and in general an attitude of non-resistance in the face of violence is commended. The commentary to the Dhammapada relates how on one occasion when the Buddha's kinsmen, the Sakyas, were under attack, they allowed themselves to be slaughtered rather than break the First Precept.

The "court" was a great portable city of tents and pavilions, transported on a train of ox-drawn wagons. The entourage lived partly off the land surrounding their camp: The local inhabitants were sometimes granted tax exemptions in recompense.

They continued to impose a modified version of the two-tax system established under the Tang, plus various surtaxes such as a levy on agricultural implements, and they frequently levied manpower for corvee work." <sup id="cite_ref-559" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-559">[559]</a></sup></dd></dl>

</p><p><b>♠ staple cost of principal source of carbohydrates ♣ ♥</b> give known median price of the chief carbohydrate source (e.g., cost for a standardized measure of rice, wheat, maize, oats, or a loaf of bread; see list in the productivity section). Explain what form the quoted cost takes (unit of account, coinage, other good, etc.) and the amount included in the price. If the staple price of the chief carbohydrate is not given, provide the cost of an alternative stable
</p><p><b>♠ Top fortune ♣ ♥</b> give estimate of the wealth of the ‘richest’ person in the polity where known (can be a relative of the ruler, but not the ruler him/herself). Explain in what form the wealth is expressed (money, property, etc.)
</p><p><b>♠ Other wealth distribution ♣ ♥</b> provide any other information on income and wealth distribution that can be found. For instance, if there are estimates of the proportion of GDP held by the wealthiest 10% of the population, or estimates about the number of people in each ‘rank’ or group containing wealth requirements (i.e. Senators in the Roman Republic and Principate)
