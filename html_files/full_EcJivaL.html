This culture summary focuses on the Jivaro of Ecuador who are now frequently called Shuar. When the term "Jivaro" is referred to alone, it usually refers to this Ecuadorian group. Other Jivaroan groups are the Achuara Jivaro who straddle the Ecuadorian-Peruvian border near the Pastaza River; the Aguaruna Jivaro near the Marañon River in Peru, and the Huambisa Jivaro in Peru who straddle the Santiago River.' <sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> 'Jívaro, South American Indian people living in the Montaña (the eastern slopes of the Andes), in Ecuador and Peru north of the Marañón River.

The term is, however, highly offensive to contemporary populations, as it was repurposed by many Spanish colonial writers to indicate a 'barbaric' or 'savage' nature.

</p><p><b> ♠ Peak Date  ♣ ♥ </b> Ecuador gained independence in the first half of the 19th century: 'The people of Quito, the Ecuadoran capital, claim that it was the scene of the first Ecuadoran patriot uprising against Spanish rule (1809).

Increasing involvement in the world market and in international politics meant that the country could no longer escape entanglements and the consequences of world ideological conflicts.

</p><p><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ quasi-polity ♥ </b> Authority among the Shuar was mostly informal and local: '“At the present time the political organization of the Jivaros is at best a very flexible thing and is simple both in theory and in practice. The Jivaro-speaking peoples are divided into scores of so-called tribes. These tribal divisions, however, are merely artificial denominations given by the whites to groups more or less isolated in certain geographical units such as rivers or divides. Tribes in this sense have no existence in the minds of the Indians themselves.' <sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> 'The simplest unit of organization is the patrilineal family group living under a single roof. Such a household is quite independent and self-sufficient, being subservient to no one. The head of the [39] household is usually the oldest man in it, known by the Spanish term ‘capito.’ Where there are a number of houses in the same general vicinity these may recognize a common war leader known by the Quechua term ‘curaka.’ It is significant that there is apparently no word in the Jivaro language indicating the equivalent of our idea of a chief.”' <sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> 'The chieftain is called kuháku. In the case of disputes within the group he has no executive, but only advisory powers. He has no greater number of wives than any other respected member of the community.' <sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> '“A typical unit or group under a curaka [KS: head of the household]consists of six or seven houses, each with its capito [KS: common war leader], situated over an area of 5 or 6 miles on some small river. Such a group has no name to designate it other than that of the stream on which it is located. The blood ties in such a group are likely to be rather close. All groupings of the Jivaros other than the household group proper, which is a natural family unit, are traceable directly to the custom of blood revenge. Such groups are in the nature of loose alliances for defensive or offensive warfare. Insomuch as war raids are purely in the nature of feuds, these alliances are never very extensive or very permanent.”' <sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> '“The power of the curaka [KS: head of the household] is purely advisory and is confined to warfare. He had no authority to order men against their will for any purpose, even that of fighting. The curaka has no special insignia denoting rank and has no special privileges, other than the prestige which his position gives him. He holds his position only as long as he retains his personal influence with the group. Realinements of household groups are frequent as leaders lose prestige or die.”' <sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> '“The number of households under the influence of a given curaka is subject to a great deal of fluctuation. It frequently happens that a strong curaka will build up a fairly powerful group of warriors about him. A weak curaka or capito may have a blood-revenge killing to attend to but will find himself outnumbered by the enemy to such an extent that he is afraid to attempt a killing with his own group. In this event he is likely to call upon the strong curaka to arrange the killing for him, paying him with a gun or a woman. Often, too, a weak curaka, fearing that his group would not be able successfully to defend themselves against an attack from enemies, will voluntarily place himself and his group under the influence of the strong curaka in a loose sort of alliance. In this way the strong group tends to grow and to become even stronger until one curaka may have 8 or 10 lesser curakas more or less under his control. This state of affairs is usually not very permanent. Owing to the loose organization and lack of any real power on the part of the head curaka, the large group becomes unwieldy or develops diverse interests and it tends to split up again into independent units. Consequently, in as little as 2 or 3 years' time, the original head curaka may find that one or more of his former lieutenants are now stronger than he.”' <sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> 'Although on some occasions considerable numbers of Jivaros unite for the purpose of war raids, or in defense against attack from invaders, their decentralized manner of living makes this rather difficult. Living as they do in individual houses, each containing a few families at most, and separated one from the other by considerable distances, there is no concentration of population at any one place such as would tend to produce large engagements.”' <sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> This decentralized pattern even applied to more prominent leaders: 'Four or five years ago there was a strong chief on the Upano River named Tuki, known to the Ecuadoreans as José Grande. In the manner previously described, all of the curakas from Macas on the Upano River to Mendez on the Paute River became subchiefs under him until he was generally recognized as the strongest of all of the Jivaro curakas. However, he was beginning to grow old by this time and some of his subcurakas were strong men in their own right. About 2 years ago, Ambusha, who had been gradually gaining in power and becoming famous for his head-hunting activities, split off with his own group, taking several curakas and their men with him. A little later Utita did the same thing. At the time of the writer's visit (1931), although Tuki was recognized by the Government of Ecuador as being head chief of the Macas-Mendez region, actually he had lost all power excepting that over his own family group and was in reality no more than a capito. These divisions of the organization, if it may be termed such, took place apparently without any ill-feeling or formal announcements.' <sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> While Ecuador claimed nominal sovereignty over the Oriente, bureaucratic control was low and no regular governmental officials were present in Shuar communities. The Shuar themselves did not recognize Ecuadorian rule: '“Rising in the western foothills of the Cordillera Oriental the Rio Zamora flows through Loja, where it is joined by the Rio Malacatos. ( ) Ten miles farther north, in confluence with the Rio de las Juntas, it breaks through the Andes and enters the province of Oriente, the Amazon region of Ecuador, comprising a northwestern part of the basin of the great river. Vast in extent and largely unknown, unexplored and unmapped, this territory has always been a bone of contention among the republics of Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru. But although the particular portion of it which I visited, on a reconnaissance of the Rio Zamora, was supposedly under the sovereignty of Ecuador, no evidence of administrative authority was to be found there, nor did the savages of the Jíbaro tribe who live there acknowledge allegiance to the government at Quito.”' <sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> Accordingly, 'quasi-polity' most closely reflects the realities on the ground.

Later expeditions of colonists and soldiers soon followed. These newcomers traded with the Jivaro, made peace pacts with them, and soon began to exploit the gold found in alluvial or glacial deposits in the region. Eventually the Spaniards were able to obtain the co-operation of some of the Indians in working the gold deposits, but others remained hostile, killing many of the colonists and soldiers at every opportunity. Under the subjection of the Spaniards, the Jivaro were required to pay tribute in gold dust; a demand that increased yearly. Finally, in 1599, the Jivaro rebelled en masse, killing many thousands of Spaniards in the process and driving them from the region. After 1599, until nearly the middle of the nineteenth century, Jivaro-European relations remained intermittent and mostly hostile. A few missionary and military expeditions entered the region from the Andean highlands, but these frequently ended in disaster and no permanent colonization ever resulted. One of the few "friendly" gestures reported for the tribe during this time occurred in 1767, when they gave a Spanish missionizing expedition "gifts", which included the skulls of Spaniards who had apparently been killed earlier by the Jivaro (Harner, 1953: 26). Thus it seems that the Jivaros are the only tribe known to have successfully revolted against the Spanish Empire and to have been able to thwart all subsequent attempts by the Spaniards to conquer them.

It is situated on the lower slopes of the volcano Pichincha, which last erupted in 1666, in a narrow Andean valley at an elevation of 9,350 feet (2,850 metres), just south of the Equator. The oldest of all South American capitals, Quito is notable for its well-preserved old town, which was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1978. The area was a market centre and political frontier before its conquest by the Inca empire, which led to its fortification as an Inca settlement. Sebastián de Belalcázar, a lieutenant of the Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro, occupied the city on December 6, 1534, and declared a municipal government (cabildo). (Founder’s Day, December 6, is marked with a weeklong celebration.) Quito remained the focal point of national affairs-political, social, and economic-until the early 20th century, when economic dominance shifted to Guayaquil.' <sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup> 'The people of Quito, the Ecuadoran capital, claim that it was the scene of the first Ecuadoran patriot uprising against Spanish rule (1809).

<dl><dd>The forested foothills of the Andes, near the border between Ecuador and Peru, have long been inhabited by the Shuar, subsistence horticulturalists living in autonomous residential hamlets. There are many Shuar groups, but here we focus specifically on the Ecuadorian group commonly known simply as 'Shuar'. Europeans - specifically, Spaniards - first encountered the Shuar in the 16th century and soon imposed tributes, which the Shuar paid, in increasing amounts, until they rebelled in 1599, driving the Spanish out of the region. Indeed, the Shuar were able to ward off outside interference up until 1930, just as they were able to avoid being subjugated by the Inca. In 1930, Catholic missionaries persuaded the Ecuadorian government to provide a reservation for the Shuar.<sup id="cite_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-57">[57]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p><i>Population and political organization</i>
</p>
<dl><dd>Authority among the Shuar was mostly informal and local, and resided in men referred to as <i>unyä</i> ('big' or 'old' men) or <i>kakaram</i> ('powerful ones'). These were usually renowned warriors or shamans, but they in fact acquired their reputation by being old enough to have grandchildren, as well as through their friendliness, honesty and generosity in dealing with others. The unyä or kakaram were believed to be able to curse to death anyone who angered them.<sup id="cite_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The scholarly literature does not provide population estimates, even for the more recent period. Indeed, writing in the 1920s, the ethnographer Fritz W. Up de Graff declared that obtaining accurate statistics relating to the Shuar was an 'impossible task' due to their migratory habits and commitment to concealing their true numbers from potential enemies.<sup id="cite_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup></dd></dl>

To form an estimate of the relative strengths of these peoples is more than I dare attempt; their migratory habits and their custom of living in small scattered settlements hidden in the dense jungle makes it an impossible task. Indeed, one of the main points of their policy is to conceal from one another not only their whereabouts but also their fighting strength, even going so far as never to use the same trail twice, if possible, in approaching their homes.

One such group has a definite name.' <sup id="cite_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-76">[76]</a></sup> '“Jivaro houses, it might be noted, are never built closely together after the manner of a village, but widely separated in the jungle, with greater resultant personal freedom and less squabbling amongst neighbours. A wise precaution which we in our country might emulate to advantage.”' <sup id="cite_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-77">[77]</a></sup> 'Generally, there are many families living in a single house, usually about 15 people united by close family ties. The building has the form of an elongated ellipse( ) (fig. 10). the long axis of which measures 15 to 25 meters. The framework is made in the following manner: two posts about 4 meters high, placed in the foci of the ellipse, support a longitudinal ridge-pole, four other posts measuring about 3 meters in height, located on the periphery at the angles of the [584] rectangle inscribed in this ellipse, support two transverse longitudinal timbers which outline this rectangle. All this framework is of chonta wood (Bactris Iriartea) and the joints are secured with the aid of lianas. The walls( ) are made of cane-stalks (Guadua angustifolia) placed close together; in addition to this they are reinforced on the inside to a height of 1 50 from the ground by planks of chonta or caña about 5 cm. wide, arranged in such a manner that their joints never coincide with the interstices of the exterior wall. This precaution is for the purpose of preventing an enemy thrusting his lance through the fissures and striking the Jíbaro in his bed, which, as well shall see, is backed up against the partition. The battens are made of caña stalks spaced o 50 apart and placed in diverging rays from the longitudinal beam to the peripheral beams; cross-beams placed at the same distance from each other complete the lattice work upon which the roof rests; the roof is formed of little bundles of straw called cambana or of leaves of a kind of Pandanus (cambaalga), skillfully imbricated from the edges toward the center.' <sup id="cite_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-78">[78]</a></sup> Autonomous hamlets were separated by no-man's lands: 'The redistribution of settlements and creation of no-man's lands between them has been a repeated consequence of escalated hostilities between or within Jivaroan subgroups. The fact that these buffer zones may not be reoccupied or exploited for several decades is important to the reestablishment of game densities in zones that may have experienced considerable hunting over long periods of time. The relationship between game depletion, armed conflict, and no-man's lands is explored below and in greater detail elsewhere (see Bennett Ross 1980:48,53).' <sup id="cite_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-79">[79]</a></sup> 'The escalation of hostilities also may lead relatives to withdraw from home communities and unite at a single fortified settlement. However, attempts to construct separate dwellings and gardens require time and considerable effort, and the stress placed on the facilities and resources available to such communities provides an important impetus to reconcile the difficulties when possible.' <sup id="cite_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-80">[80]</a></sup> Hamlets were left behind and reestablished elsewhere periodically: 'The Indians are inhabitants of a region which extends along the upper course of the Marañón River, from Yusamaro downward to Puerto Meléndez at the Pongo de Manseriche. They live in this region in small and widely dispersed settlements close to the banks of the River. I have been informed that their chief settlements are located farther up along the tributary rivers. Beyond Yusamaro no Indians are said to remain anymore, yet formerly their settlements are said to have extended to the Pongo Rentema. They had moved down to the Marañón River on account of the quarrels they had with the whites or, rather, the mestizos. Their settlements can not be called permanent anyway. Despite the fact that the Indians live at one place for a long time, and in relatively permanent dwellings at that, they are said to leave their settlements frequently for no special reason in order to reestablish themselves again at some distance from the former settlement.' <sup id="cite_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-81">[81]</a></sup> During the early Ecuadorian period, there was apparently no significant migration of Shuar to colonial towns: 'By 1899, when the explorer Up de Graff ascended the Marañón, Barranca was considered the westernmost outpost of civilization on the river (1923:146). It had, nevertheless, withstood its own share of Indian attacks (Larrabure i Correa 1905/II:369; IX:357-367). Less than a year prior to Up de Graff's visit, Barranca was nearly devastated by a party of Huambisas who arrived from upriver ostensibly to trade, but then burned and looted most of the cauchero quarters (Up de Graff 1923:150).' <sup id="cite_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-82">[82]</a></sup> 'By the turn of the century, when Ecuadorian missionaries had reunited some of the scattered refugees and reestablished their town on the Bobonaza River, there were at least a dozen caucheros exploiting rubber along western tributaries of the middle Pastaza such as the Huasaga (Fuentes 1908/I:194ff.), which was gradually being occupied by southward-moving Achuarä.' <sup id="cite_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-83">[83]</a></sup>

<p>Shuar political organization was local and informal: "The Jivaro lack any formal political organization, although an informal form of leadership is found in the role of individuals referred to as UNYÄ ("big" or "old" men) or KAKARAM ("powerful" or "powerful ones") who are renown as killers in feuds or war, or exercise important shamanistic powers in the community. These individuals acquire their reputation in the community by being old enough to have grandchildren, and are friendly, honest, and generous in dealing with others in the society. Because of these characteristics the UNYÄ or KAKARAM are believed to possess great ARUTAM soul power and the ability to curse to death anyone who incurs their anger. Generally most neighborhoods have at least one or two UNYÄ as well as a few superior shamans who provide protection for their relatives or other individuals with whom they are on friendly terms."<sup id="cite_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-84">[84]</a></sup>
</p><p>"If we may speak of a ‘government’, it is a purely patriarchal one, the head of the family and the owner of the house being at the same time the ‘chief’ of this small community, theoretically even with absolute power. It is of particular interest to see how he exercises this power in practice."<sup id="cite_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-85">[85]</a></sup>
</p><p>"The chief of this group is the one who by his endurance, his skill, his intelligence, his courage and also by luck imposes himself on the individuals of the neighborhood. His authority rests only on a tacit assent, carries no exterior emblem or sign, and in no case is transmitted by heredity to his descendants. His role is limited to the coordination of individual efforts in special circumstances. In times of peace he has no longer any special attributes. Occasionally, a peril or a common hate make allies of neighboring tribes, but these alliances are only temporary."<sup id="cite_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-86">[86]</a></sup>
</p><p>"Often, too, a weak curaka, fearing that his group would not be able successfully to defend themselves against an attack from enemies, will voluntarily place himself and his group under the influence of the strong curaka in a loose sort of alliance. In this way the strong group tends to grow and to become even stronger until one curaka may have 8 or 10 lesser curakas more or less under his control. This state of affairs is usually not very permanent. Owing to the loose organization and lack of any real power on the part of the head curaka, the large group becomes unwieldy or develops diverse interests and it tends to split up again into independent units. Consequently, in as little as 2 or 3 years' time, the original head curaka may find that one or more of his former lieutenants are now stronger than he."<sup id="cite_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-87">[87]</a></sup>
</p><p>Some more prominent leaders emerged in times of war with external colonial powers, although even those arrangements were fluid. The following example relates to the Ecuadorian period, but it is possible that the Spanish also recognized overall leaders among the Shuar.
"Four or five years ago there was a strong chief on the Upano River named Tuki, known to the Ecuadoreans as José Grande. In the manner previously described, all of the curakas from Macas on the Upano River to Mendez on the Paute River became subchiefs under him until he was generally recognized as the strongest of all of the Jivaro curakas. However, he was beginning to grow old by this time and some of his subcurakas were strong men in their own right. About 2 years ago, Ambusha, who had been gradually gaining in power and becoming famous for his head-hunting activities, split off with his own group, taking several curakas and their men with him. A little later Utita did the same thing. At the time of the writer's visit (1931), although Tuki was recognized by the Government of Ecuador as being head chief of the Macas-Mendez region, actually he had lost all power excepting that over his own family group and was in reality no more than a capito. These divisions of the organization, if it may be termed such, took place apparently without any ill-feeling or formal announcements."<sup id="cite_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-88">[88]</a></sup>

<p>"The relationship between the shaman supplying the magical power and the person receiving it is not a relationship between equals. The power-giver is referred to in these tribes as the 'higher' shaman, and the recipient as the 'lower.' The 'higher' and 'lower' designations refer to actual authority and control exercised by the giver of power over the recipient. The higher shaman, it is believed, can magically take back the power which he has conferred, regardless of the distance separating the two shamans (see pp. 165-66). He may take back this power because of a personal offense, or because he has been bribed to do so by an enemy of the lower shaman. Such occurrences are frequently reported, and there are a number of former shamans who testify that they lost their power in this manner."<sup id="cite_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-89">[89]</a></sup>
</p><p>"A sudden loss of shamanistic power is believed to result in serious illness and often in death. The lower shaman, therefore, tends to fear his higher associate and attempts to keep on good terms with him. With this purpose in mind, he sends tribute in the form of substantial gifts of material valuables (kuit) at regular intervals. Such kuit includes shotguns, hunting dogs, blowguns, curare, feather headbands (tawaspä), and Western-manufactured shirts and trousers. He particularly hopes that these gifts will offset any bribes that may be offered to the higher shaman."<sup id="cite_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-90">[90]</a></sup>
</p><p>"A secondary incentive for sending tribute is the need of the lower shaman to replenish his supply of magical darts [Page 122] every few years. His power, in the form of these spirit servants, is gradually used up through curing, bewitching, or dispensing it. He expects, therefore, to have to replenish his supply by visiting his higher associate. The lower shaman may look forward to help from the higher man only if he has been faithful in the submission of goods."<sup id="cite_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-91">[91]</a></sup>
</p><p>"Tribute between shamans flows from the south, since, of course, the most powerful shamans are in the north. The tribute follows the lines of the shaman hierarchies up into the Canelos tribe. These hierarchies do not converge upon a single Canelos shaman, however, because there are a number of banks of about equal power in the tribe. In other words, this is basically a system of plural and parallel hierarchies culminating in the same region, but not in the same individual."<sup id="cite_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-92">[92]</a></sup>
</p><p>"The hierarchical situation is further complicated by the fact that a given shaman frequently obtains magical power from several higher associates. He does this so that his power cannot be completely taken away from him at the whim of a single higher shaman. This tendency seems to prevent the hierarchies from being used as chains of authority. Since a shaman is thus often directly subordinate to several others, considerable intertwining of hierarchical relationships occurs."<sup id="cite_ref-93" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-93">[93]</a></sup>

Each is also located four or more kilometers from their nearest neighboring community. The community is made up of patrilineally and affinally related individuals, traditionally consisting of from 80 to 300 people (30 to 40 people in the twentieth century), living in one house called a JIVARIA. For defensive purposes, this house is built on a steep hill usually at the upper end of a stream. The house itself is approximately 13 meters by 26 meters in size, elliptical in shape, and has a thatched roof. In times of war, two or more communities united to fight a common enemy, as was the case when the Spanish attempted to conquer them.' <sup id="cite_ref-95" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-95">[95]</a></sup> 'Their society is thus based on the family and the blood tie. Only such sub-tribes as recognize some sort of consanguinity display a feeling of solidarity: the rest, although they speak the same language, are looked upon, not only as outsiders, but as downright natural enemies, a feature which will be further illustrated in the part dealing with their wars. It is as a rule between the different sub-tribes that the wars of extermination have occurred.' <sup id="cite_ref-96" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-96">[96]</a></sup> Warriors were accordingly male members of feuding communities: 'The terrible custom demands ever new, ever more victims, all security must disappear, every individual constantly lives in danger of being ambushed; there is a general and permanent state of war. Hence the arrangement of the houses, one door of which can be used for flight, while the battle rages at the other; hence the customs mentioned at the beginning in connection with approaching a dwelling, for the protection of which, in addition, a pack of half-wild dogs are kept. A quarrel between two families must lead to battles between whole tribes; larger groups of tribes become hostile to one another; war and battle become customary, a man's lifework. A longer period of quiet, of peace, must be unbearable for such a nation of warriors. Ambitious, bold leaders will easily find companions for joint war expeditions; the neighboring nations are attacked and plundered. Thus, these Indians are carrying on among themselves a war of annihilation which must gradually bring about their own downfall. Severe depopulation is already noticeable in the region of the Jívaros, and it is being accelerated by epidemics, of the diseases introduced by the Europeans, which appear with great violence at times.' <sup id="cite_ref-97" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-97">[97]</a></sup> Warfare was deeply connected to headhunting: 'The primary motivation for warfare is to secure as many human heads as possible from an alien tribe, and secondarily to capture women. The acquisition of territory had never been a motive for engaging in warfare. The war party, consisting of approximately thirty or forty men, is recruited from the community itself or from friendly neighborhoods nearby, and is usually led by the  or  as war leader or chief. Actual warfare consists of preliminary ceremonies involving ritualized chanting, surprise attacks against one or two enemy houses, the killing and decapitation of the inhabitants or the occasional capture of a girl or woman as an extra wife, and the preparation of the  on the return to the home village. Unlike many of the warlike Amazon tribes captives are not tortured or sacrificed, nor is cannibalism practiced.' <sup id="cite_ref-98" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-98">[98]</a></sup> Local leaders and chiefs often combined 'political' and 'military' duties rather than separating them: '“The dignity of a chieftain is hereditary in a relative sense, in so far that the son of a chief is generally elected chief in time of war after his father has died or grown decrepit. This, however, can only take place if he has proved a valiant and skilled warrior and has killed enemies. No Jibaro is selected as a chief if he has not killed at least one enemy. The Jibaros have absolute faith in the heritability of prominent qualities, and ascribe extraordinary importance to education and the power of example. The son of a great chief, they say, must necessarily also become an able warrior because he is, as it were, a direct continuation of his father, has received a careful education for the deeds of war, and has always had the good example of his great father before his eyes.”' <sup id="cite_ref-99" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-99">[99]</a></sup> In times of war against external colonial enemies or larger tribal groups, different communities combined to attach themselves to a common war-leader, although even those arrangements were fluid and often of an ad hoc character. [Family and local leadership can extend beyond a single community; even in recent times (ie, in the 1970’s) some particularly strong men could aggregate several local groups in conflict situations and lead quite large war parties; however, such positions were unstable and rarely lasted more than a few years, if that. The definition of ‘community’ is highly relative; ‘my people’ can include a single nuclear family, or a collection of communities temporarily coalesced around a powerful war leader.] 'Still, as appears from their history, there have been occasions when they have been able to overcome the natural antipathy separating them from one another, and to unite against a common enemy. This common enemy has been the white man, who has so often threatened [184] the liberty of the people; but the alliances, such as that for instance in 1599, have been exceptional and wholly due to the influence of a single, eminent personality.”' <sup id="cite_ref-100" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-100">[100]</a></sup>' 'When a whole tribe, or perhaps several tribes together, prepare a war against one or more other tribes, the first thing done is to elect a common chief. He should be an elderly, experienced man, who has taken part in several wars, killed many enemies, and celebrated at least one victory feast. The rest of the warriors, who are generally younger men, swear him unlimited obedience. During the time the expedition is planned and the preparations are made, the warriors, and especially the chief, repeatedly drink maikoa or natéma to consult the spirits. They pay great attention to their dreams, even to those not produced under the direct influence of the narcotic drinks, tell them to each other, and discuss their possible significance. Only if they believe that they have received favourable answers and all omens are good are measures taken to carry out the war plan conceived. Meanwhile they try, through spies, to acquire as accurate a knowledge as possible about everything concerning the enemy: how many houses there are in the tract, how many fighting men in each house, if the houses are fortified, if the [283] men are well armed, and especially if they have firearms. All these and similar details the spies investigate by making trips into the country of the enemy and by stealing at night to the houses. Everything is prepared with the greatest secrecy possible, so that the enemy is caught unprepared, for otherwise he will have time to take measures of defence that may defeat the whole undertaking.”' <sup id="cite_ref-101" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-101">[101]</a></sup> '“The authority of the chief elected for a war is very great. It is he alone who arranges everything for the expedition planned, who decides [268] about the time for and the mode of making the attack, and the younger warriors oblige themselves to obey him in everything. But as soon as a war has been carried to a successful end the power of the chief ceases, and he has, in spite of the great repute he always enjoys, no more authority or right to decide about the doings of his tribesmen than any other family-father among the Jibaros.”' <sup id="cite_ref-102" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-102">[102]</a></sup> Ecuador recognized some of those leaders as regional head-chiefs: 'Four or five years ago there was a strong chief on the Upano River named Tuki, known to the Ecuadoreans as José Grande.

The Jivaros carry their sense of the personal, not only to animals, but also to trees and inanimate objects. In their eyes all things are animated by human spirits, male or female. The yuca has a female soul, hence it is proper for the women to cultivate it. Clay is feminine, therefore women must fashion the simple pottery which they use. Women must also handle the vessels when it comes to cooking. Most trees are men, hence men must chop them down. Cotton is of the male gender, so men must spin thread and make their own ‘itipis’ and also the ‘tarachi,’ or garments worn by the women. It is the sex distinction which is all important. Man and woman's work is as distinct as night from day, and the duties of one never overlap those of the other. There is not even a question of comparison between the two.

However, it is clear that by 1917 at least some Achuarä were participating actively in such work. In that year, Rafael Karsten, a Scandinavian ethnographer, visited an Achuarä community in the company of their cauchero patrón, over a day's walk inland from another western tributary of the Pastaza, the Río Tunigrama (Karsten 1935:43).' <sup id="cite_ref-108" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-108">[108]</a></sup> 'Historically the most persistent external pressure on the entire area occupied by the Jivaroan populations has been along the western frontier of Shuarä territory in Ecuador, in the Upano River Valley where the town of Macas is situated. By 1887, the Upano was observed to be suffering a shortage of game as a result of the presence of collectors of cinchona bark (for quinine) and other tropical products, who descended into the region from the Ecuadorian highlands (Vacas Galindo 1895:28-29). Many of the collectors worked primarily out of Macas, employing its non-Indian residents but occasionally enlisting the labor of Jívaro inhabitants of the valley in exchange for guns and other trade items (Harner 1972:30). Shuarä who had migrated there earlier in efforts to establish direct access to Western manufactures at Macas, found that with the stepping up of commercial activity in the valley and the initiation of cattle ranching at Macas, there was reduced demand for items they had formerly provided in exchange-deer, pigs, and native salt-although shrunken heads were still a greatly desired commodity (Harner 1972:29; Karsten 1935:56). In order to sustain their supply of manufactured trade goods, some of the Indians cut pastures for the Macabeos (Harner 1972:29); others, as observed, engaged in the extractive industry.' <sup id="cite_ref-109" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-109">[109]</a></sup> There was no professional specialization.

Furthermore, the only military support of which one truly can be assured, once a contemplated or actual homicide develops, comes from persons obligated by affinal ties-sons-in-law or brothers-in-law-who often reside together.

A longer period of quiet, of peace, must be unbearable for such a nation of warriors. Ambitious, bold leaders will easily find companions for joint war expeditions; the neighboring nations are attacked and plundered. Thus, these Indians are carrying on among themselves a war of annihilation which must gradually bring about their own downfall. Severe depopulation is already noticeable in the region of the Jívaros, and it is being accelerated by epidemics, of the diseases introduced by the Europeans, which appear with great violence at times.' <sup id="cite_ref-113" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-113">[113]</a></sup> 'The primary motivation for warfare is to secure as many human heads as possible from an alien tribe, and secondarily to capture women. The acquisition of territory had never been a motive for engaging in warfare. The war party, consisting of approximately thirty or forty men, is recruited from the community itself or from friendly neighborhoods nearby, and is usually led by the  or  as war leader or chief. Actual warfare consists of preliminary ceremonies involving ritualized chanting, surprise attacks against one or two enemy houses, the killing and decapitation of the inhabitants or the occasional capture of a girl or woman as an extra wife, and the preparation of the  on the return to the home village. Unlike many of the warlike Amazon tribes captives are not tortured or sacrificed, nor is cannibalism practiced.' <sup id="cite_ref-114" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-114">[114]</a></sup> 'It therefore behooves any Achuarä contemplating revenge upon someone to discuss his plans with potential allies, aligning them in his camp in advance of his action. The recruitment of military support among the Achuarä and other Jivaroans (cf. Harner 1972:98) is a rather insecure business. This derives, in part, from the fact that social relations are organized within a framework of cognatic, bilateral kinship, in which the only people sharing the same personal kindreds, and the rights and obligations associated with them, are siblings. Furthermore, the only military support of which one truly can be assured, once a contemplated or actual homicide develops, comes from persons obligated by affinal ties-sons-in-law or brothers-in-law-who often reside together. Where branching kin ties are overridden by divergent affinal obligations, relatives may very likely be drawn into enemy camps.' <sup id="cite_ref-115" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-115">[115]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Professional priesthood ♣ absent ♥ </b> Full-time specialists. Shamans were local practicioners: 'There are no gods who play ethical or moral roles in the Jivaro pantheon, nor are there any priests or other religious specialist except the shaman (UWISIN  ) whose primary role in the society is magical curing, although he also has the power to send illness into an individual as a form of sorcery (Service, 1958: 196). Lacking true political organization, the shaman may be the most influential individual in the community frequently acting the role of KAKARAM   as well as shaman.' <sup id="cite_ref-116" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-116">[116]</a></sup> 'The Jivaro lack any formal political organization, although an informal form of leadership is found in the role of individuals referred to as UNYÄ  ("big" or "old" men) or KAKARAM   ("powerful" or "powerful ones") who are renown as killers in feuds or war, or exercise important shamanistic powers in the community. These individuals acquire their reputation in the community by being old enough to have grandchildren, and are friendly, honest, and generous in dealing with others in the society. Because of these characteristics the UNYÄ   or KAKARAM   are believed to possess great ARUTAM   soul power and the ability to curse to death anyone who incurs their anger. Generally most neighborhoods have at least one or two UNYÄ   as well as a few superior shamans who provide protection for their relatives or other individuals with whom they are on friendly terms.' <sup id="cite_ref-117" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-117">[117]</a></sup> Many rituals could be performed by non-specialists: '“Under this general heading it seems to me convenient to treat of certain customs of the Indians which are clearly of a religious or magical nature and are regularly practised when the Indians have to enter into relations with the spiritual world. Everybody is not prepared to take part in religious ceremonies; children for example are excluded until they have passed through the initiations. Fullgrown women, on the other hand, as we have seen, take part in many of them, and there are even religious rites which can only be peformed by the women, because only they possess the ‘inner’ qualifications necessary for success. But when ordinary conjurations of evil spirits are in question, the men, and particularly old men, are both physically and mentally far in advance of the women.”' <sup id="cite_ref-118" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-118">[118]</a></sup>Shamans were capable of sorcery and healing: 'In the Aguaruna tribe only men can act as sorcerers. Their magic is monistic. The sorcerer is called ananténtšo or tuntsi. They do not believe in a separation of a being from its body. They have only one kind of sorcerer: the sorcerer who kills has at the same time healing faculties.' <sup id="cite_ref-119" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-119">[119]</a></sup> Shamans trained novices themselves: 'According to Karsten (The Religion, pp. 319 ff.), in the Chiwaro-Makas tribe an old sorcerer supervises the novice, putting in his mouth the spines of the Guilelma palm mixed with some saliva. It seems, however, that the novice receives the actual magic substance from the demon. This demon, in the shape of a giant snake or in the shape of some other serpentiform monster, appears before the entranced novice. The sorcerer must eat certain animals; others he must avoid-all this on account of certain analogous properties. The demon is said to hand the magic spines to the newly initiated. The derivation of the magic properties of a sorcerer is not quite clear to me. The leading sorcerer is remunerated for his services.' <sup id="cite_ref-120" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-120">[120]</a></sup> Shamans were frequently the target of accusations of sorcery: '“Since supposed sorcery is nearly always the nearest cause of murders within the tribe, it is clear that the professional sorcerers or medi-[270] cine men are those members of Jibaro society which are most frequently exposed to the revengeful attacks of their enemies. As a matter of fact, in large Indian societies sorcerers are very often assassinated, or at least threatened with death, by their enemies. When a medicine-man has undertaken to cure a sick person and the latter dies in spite of the treatment, the ‘doctor’ is also generally made responsible for the death, the relatives of the dead reasoning that the medicine-man, instead of curing the patient, on the contrary used his art to kill him. The unsuccessful curer is therefore murdered unless he escapes by flight. Since the Jibaros, on the whole, do not recognize what we call a natural death but always attribute a death to supernatural causes, any death among them tends to give rise to a murder, the relatives of the deceased considering it as their duty to take revenge upon the supposed author of the accident.”' <sup id="cite_ref-121" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-121">[121]</a></sup> Shamans are usually not full-time specialists. Here also, some fluidity may be involved in the distribution of roles. [Shamans do not often act as war leaders (except in the invisible realm)&nbsp;; the more usual pattern is a sort of dyarchy between a war leader and a shaman (brother in law or son in law). However, men can slide in and out of ‘shamanship’ so it is not unheard of for a shaman to become a war leader and vice versa.]

<p><b> ♠ Full-time bureaucrats ♣ absent ♥ </b> Full-time specialists. Shuar political authority was informal and decentralized: 'Each community is politically independent with its own headman. Each is also located four or more kilometers from their nearest neighboring community. The community is made up of patrilineally and affinally related individuals, traditionally consisting of from 80 to 300 people (30 to 40 people in the twentieth century), living in one house called a JIVARIA. For defensive purposes, this house is built on a steep hill usually at the upper end of a stream. The house itself is approximately 13 meters by 26 meters in size, elliptical in shape, and has a thatched roof. In times of war, two or more communities united to fight a common enemy, as was the case when the Spanish attempted to conquer them.' <sup id="cite_ref-122" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-122">[122]</a></sup> '“From the statements I have previously made as to the distribution of the Jibaro tribes it appears that their social organization is loose. In fact, the whole people is split up into a great number of tribes which in their turn are sub-divided into smaller clans or septs comprising a few families closely related to one another by blood. These sub-tribes do not form village communities; each family inhabits its own big communal house (héa), but these are not situated close to one another, they lie scattered here and there in the virgin forest. Generally one has to march for one or several hours to arrive at the next house. Each Jibaro house forms in fact a separate and independent social, political, and economic unit with its own household, its own plantations in the vicinity of the house, and its own ruler or chief, the oldest family father who, at any rate in time of peace, is not controlled by anybody. It is much the same feature that we meet in other parts of tropical South America, where the impenetrable virgin forests necessarily lead to social disintegration, which is further increased by the general anti-social tendencies of the Indians. The state of things found among the Jibaros, however, is in many respects unique.' <sup id="cite_ref-123" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-123">[123]</a></sup> Some more prominent leaders emerged as well: 'Four or five years ago there was a strong chief on the Upano River named Tuki, known to the Ecuadoreans as José Grande. In the manner previously described, all of the curakas from Macas on the Upano River to Mendez on the Paute River became subchiefs under him until he was generally recognized as the strongest of all of the Jivaro curakas. However, he was beginning to grow old by this time and some of his subcurakas were strong men in their own right. About 2 years ago, Ambusha, who had been gradually gaining in power and becoming famous for his head-hunting activities, split off with his own group, taking several curakas and their men with him. A little later Utita did the same thing. At the time of the writer's visit (1931), although Tuki was recognized by the Government of Ecuador as being head chief of the Macas-Mendez region, actually he had lost all power excepting that over his own family group and was in reality no more than a capito. These divisions of the organization, if it may be termed such, took place apparently without any ill-feeling or formal announcements.' <sup id="cite_ref-124" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-124">[124]</a></sup> The Shuar bartered with whites and other Amerindians: 'The commercial activities of the Jivaro are very restricted. In the early days of European contact hogs and chickens were raised for sale to those of European background. Salt, a rare commodity in the region, was gathered in clay pots from a few brackish springs in the area, allowed to evaporate, and the resulting hardened ball of salt used in exchange transactions with neighboring tribal groups. The Jivaro were famous for the shrinking of the human heads () of their enemies (actually only the skin). Passing out of Jivaro country through a series of exchanges, these heads eventually found their way into the hands of traders who brought them down the Amazon to Para where they were sold. Soon the traders had a burgeoning trade in these items, and the Jivaro were hard-put to keep up with the demand. The Indians were by no means particular as to whose head was used, and advance orders were taken and filled. Eventually this native "industry" was brought to a halt by the Ecuadorian and Peruvian governments although by the late twentieth century life-like replicas of the heads made from animal skins are still being sold commercially.' <sup id="cite_ref-125" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-125">[125]</a></sup> There was no bureaucratic penetration of Shuar territory at the time: '“Rising in the western foothills of the Cordillera Oriental the Rio Zamora flows through Loja, where it is joined by the Rio Malacatos. ( ) Ten miles farther north, in confluence with the Rio de las Juntas, it breaks through the Andes and enters the province of Oriente, the Amazon region of Ecuador, comprising a northwestern part of the basin of the great river. Vast in extent and largely unknown, unexplored and unmapped, this territory has always been a bone of contention among the republics of Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru. But although the particular portion of it which I visited, on a reconnaissance of the Rio Zamora, was supposedly under the sovereignty of Ecuador, no evidence of administrative authority was to be found there, nor did the savages of the Jíbaro tribe who live there acknowledge allegiance to the government at Quito.”' <sup id="cite_ref-126" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-126">[126]</a></sup> The same seems to be true for missionary attempts: 'Since all attempts to win back the lost territories by force of arms were unsuccessful, there was recourse to the cross in order to bend the Indians again under the yoke of slavery by this apparently gentle means. The missionaries were successful among some tribes, but the Jívaros turned away all intruders and have maintained their freedom up to our time. Only the small mission of Mácas, inhabited by the Quichua Indians, is located in their territory, and neither the secular clergy nor the Jesuit fathers, who have alternately tried their luck there, have been successful in making converts.' <sup id="cite_ref-127" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-127">[127]</a></sup>

<p><b> ♠ Formal legal code ♣ absent ♥ </b> SCCS variable 149 'Writing and Records' is coded as ‘1’ or ‘None’, not ‘Mnemonic devices’, or ‘Nonwritten records’, or 'True writing, no records', or ‘True writing; records’ The Shuar did not use a formal legal code, but had established means of responding to offenses. The murder of a kinsman had to be avenged: '“When a murder committed by tribesman is to be avenged, the social morality of the Jibaros requires that the punishment shall be meted out with justice, in so far that for one life which has been taken only one life should be taken in retaliation. Thereupon the blood-guilt is atoned for (tumáshi akérkama) and the offended family is satisfied. Consequently, if a Jibaro Indian wishes to avenge the murder of his brother, it may well happen that he, if the slayer himself cannot be caught and punished, will assassinate his brother or father instead of him, but he does not take the life of more than one member of the family, even if he has an opportunity of killing more. If he, for instance, killed not only the murderer himself but also one of his brothers, this would awaken indignation in the whole tribe, and it would be considered just that the family thus offended in its turn should take revenge. The blood guilt in such a case has passed to the original avenger. This principle, which requires that there shall be justice in the retaliation so that life is weighed against life, in itself of course has a tendency to limit blood-revenge. It happens, however, in many cases, and especially when supposed witchery is in question, that the person accused of the crime does not admit the guilt, but asserts that he and his family are innocently persecuted by the relatives of the dead. If then he or a member of his family is murdered, his relatives try, in their turn, to take revenge, and so on, in which case the blood feud tends to become prolonged indefinitely.”' <sup id="cite_ref-128" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-128">[128]</a></sup> 'It seemed that this uncle had beaten one of his wives to death because she was unfaithful to him, and the woman's family, considering the treatment unnecessarily harsh, had murdered the husband in retaliation. Custom said that Kuashu's family must also take a life in order to satisfy the Jivaro sense of justice. With this end in view, the spirit of revenge was being kept alive, and almost every day the young men of the household were reminded of the duty which they inherited, and how they would eventually have to kill some member of the family who were responsible for their uncle's murder. The boys listened to the tale, which had already been told them hundreds of times, with as much interest as if they had never heard it before, and I wondered how long it would be ere their hands were stained with blood. They saw nothing wrong in this lust for vengeance, for their creed taught them that the spirit [158] of their uncle could not rest till justice had been meted out. Furthermore, if they failed to take reprisals they and their families would be the ones to suffer.” ' <sup id="cite_ref-129" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-129">[129]</a></sup> The obligation to avenge could be avoided through gift-giving: 'It seems that among the Aguaruna Indians there is a sort of murderous revenge, though there is a way of redeeming it with gifts. I heard of one case where the gift of a blowgun eliminated the necessity for bloody revenge.' <sup id="cite_ref-130" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-130">[130]</a></sup> Deaths by sorcery had to be avenged as well: 'Fear of sorcery and incurring the wrath of the  act as restraining elements of social control in the Jivaro community. In this society the code of lex talionis holds true so that anti-social acts directed against members of the community will result in assured retaliation by the victim's family. Thus, the fear of reprisal also acts as a means of aggression control in the society.' <sup id="cite_ref-131" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-131">[131]</a></sup> '“Their unbounded sense of liberty and their desire to be independent, not only of the whites but also of each other, is one of the reasons why they do not live in villages but each family separately, for in this way conflicts are more easily avoided. It may for instance, happen that the swine, the most important domestic animals, who during the day are allowed to roam about freely in the forest, penetrate into the plantations of a neighbouring family and devastate the crops. The owner gets angry and claims compensation for the damage done. In this way quarrels easily arise which may develop into bloody fights; at any rate there arises general discord and distrust between the two families. Some time later it may happen that one or more members of either family fall ill with some of the diseases which the Jibaros ascribe to witchcraft. When trying to find out the author of the evil the head of that family is most likely to attribute it to the malicious art of a neighbour with whom he has had such a quarrel. If the patient dies he has recourse to divination by means of the narcotic natéma, which generally leads to his suspicions of the neighbour being confirmed. The family's sense of justice as well as the duty to the deceased now require that revenge shall be taken, and the supposed wizard is assassinated. This murder naturally awakens the desire for blood-revenge on the part of the family thus outraged, and so a blood-feud is begun, which, as is easily understood, has a tendency to make itself permanent.”' <sup id="cite_ref-132" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-132">[132]</a></sup> Blood vengeance was less common within families, conflicts being solved informally: '“Though, as we have seen, among the Jibaros blood-revenge takes place with regard to members of the same sub-tribe, this is not so when a crime is committed within the family. Among these Indians it sometimes occurs that a man kills his brother, if the latter, for instance, has seduced his wife or bewitched one of his children. But in this case blood-revenge is not generally taken, inasmuch as the natural avengers-that is, the father and the remaining brothers-abstain from carrying it out. ‘It is enough that one member of our family has died,’ they say, ‘why should we deprive ourselves of one more?’ The slayer is consequently pardoned. The absence of blood-revenge in a case like this is due to the natural sympathy which the avengers feel for the slayer, as well as to the consideration that by killing him they would only harm themselves, by weakening the power and influence of the family.”' <sup id="cite_ref-133" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-133">[133]</a></sup> Stirling describes recognized extenuating circumstances: 'In the same way the Jivaros are apt to recognize extenuating circumstances in other cases where the crime has not been caused willfully, as for example, when someone in a state of intoxication or under the influence of a narcotic drink has been the cause of another person's death. However, in any of these instances, if the [117] evildoer refuses to pay to compensation asked, he becomes liable to blood revenge.”' <sup id="cite_ref-134" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-134">[134]</a></sup>

A wise precaution which we in our country might emulate to advantage.”' <sup id="cite_ref-147" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-147">[147]</a></sup> Brüning provides a summary of the construction process: 'Construction begins with the erection of a provisional scaffold which serves as a support for the workmen. The ground plan of the house (Fig. 1) has almost the shape of a large oval, that is to say, the two long sides run parallel, and at each end there is a half circle. Two round, smooth trees, 6 - 6.5 meters in length, constitute the foundation of the house. These trees are set up as uprights in the centers (A in the drawing) of the two half circles. On top the two uprights are connected by the roof-tree. On either side of the central uprights three additional uprights (B), shorter than the central ones, are set up. The tops of these outside uprights are connected with the roof-tree by means of a square frame. The walls are formed by means of thin posts which on top are connected with each other. The rafters rest on these thin posts and, in turn, support the laths. Everything is firmly tied with lianas, bast, and chambira. Next comes the roof, which is built with special attention as you may expect it in a country where there is hardly a day without rain. The material used are the leaves of various palm trees that had been seasoned long in advance. In Timasto, I have seen a special storehouse for the prepared plaited leaves, that had been stored here over a long period of time. A layer of large, pinnate and plaited palm leaves is first placed upon the laths. (Illustration number 1 shows such palm leaves, partly plaited, in the foreground.) Next, loose leaves are placed upon the first layer (see Illustrations 2, 3, and 4). The roof projects about one meter beyond the wall. When I first visited one of these houses in S. Antonio [52] on the Muchingis (a village about one rowing-hour distant from Nazaret), I beheld with admiration a roof which, as to its construction, surpassed all the roofs of the coastal and mountain Indians and even of the whites. The cleanliness and tidiness of the Indians is generally another point in their favor.' <sup id="cite_ref-148" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-148">[148]</a></sup> 'After the completion of the roof the house is ready for occupancy. The outside wall is only gradually finished. The Indians use for it split Chonta palms or even bamboo. These walls permit enough light to go through for the illumination of the interior. As for the doors there do not seem to exist any fixed rules: I found them in the middle of the long side, but also at one end, and even at both ends. I had an opportunity for a closer study of the house of the Curaca Laichape in Huaracayo. In this house there was at one end (toward the river) a double door, and at the other end (toward the forest) a single door. These doors were crudely made out of one piece, as thick boards hewn with the axe. In Huavico I noticed a door which was made of plaited palm leaves. The Curaca, who was our host, used this door as an umbrella when he was once forced to leave the house during a heavy rain.' <sup id="cite_ref-149" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-149">[149]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Special purpose house ♣ absent ♥ </b> Community buildings were residential. Reiss provides a description of the interior of a Jivaria: 'The houses, the tambos, are real forest palaces, extremely clean and regularly built, with successful utilization of the materials provided by the forest. The high roof, beautifully plaited out of palm leaves, is supported by several rows of slender columns, the faultless trunks of giant palms; the rafters are decoratively arranged in such a way that they can be considered ornamentation. The walls all around, made of tightly fitted split bamboo, fill hardly half the space between the floor and the edge of the roof, so that air comes in freely and yet protection against a first attack is assured. Each house exhibits two doors, one on the straight front wall, the other in the center of the semicircular, projecting rear-side. The house of a young chief was 87 feet long, 60 feet wide, and about 25 feet high, an airy, beautiful building, The front third served as a sort of reception room. Shield and drum were hung on the palm trunks supporting the roof; special contrivances permit the secure placement of the lances and blowguns, whose quivers are put near the fires.  Some low sitting-benches carved out of wood take the place of chairs; low benches made out of split bamboo are placed along the walls, and several frames of the same type serve as couches for the men so that they may take a siesta during the day. These latter contrivances are peculiar in that there is space on them for the body only about to the knee, but the foot rests on a slender crosspiece supported by two forks for the support of the freely projecting leg. Directly in front of this pedestal a very smoky fire burns continuously, almost scorching the soles of the person resting. The smoke of the fire is supposed to provide protection against the mosquitoes,  which are almost unbearable here. - The center part of the tambo is kitchen, dining room, and common living room, in which pots and utensils are kept in the best order. Finally, in the semicircular, bulging part located at the back are the bedrooms of the families. A number of beds, similar to the couch described above, each with a fire probably kept going all night, are placed symmetrically along the side walls. Each individual bed is bounded on three sides by rather high bamboo walls and open only toward the foot end, so that small sleeping cells, so to speak, independent of one another, are formed. Each person living in the house has his own cell, on the walls of which is hung his private property, in the case of women cosmetic articles and ornaments in particular, packed carefully in decorative bags. What is most striking during a visit to such a house is the cleanliness and neatness with which the whole is maintained, everything stands in its particular place, is readily and surely available, and at the same time is fixed in such a way that it serves to decorate the room. - The floor is level and tamped hard, like a threshing floor, and is absolutely clean. When I let some cigar ashes fall during my visit, one of the women came immediately to sweep the floor clean again. Not all the houses are equally large and stately; the same strict order and cleanliness which I have just tried to describe do not prevail in all, but even the dwellings that are not maintained as well seem an enviable stopping place to the traveler who has languished in the dirt of Hispano-American housekeeping for years.' <sup id="cite_ref-150" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-150">[150]</a></sup>

In exchange for rubber, various resins, canoes, Maní, yucca, bananas, tamed animals and parrots the Indians ask for Winchester repeating arms, rifles and the necessary ammunition, axes, knives, scissors, needles, fishhooks, mirrors, cotton wares, sewing thread, etc. At that time the rate of exchange was the following: For a small canoe for six people they would receive an ordinary single-barrelled rifle (European value perhaps 10 Marks). For a hen or a large bunch of bananas they would receive one vara (84 cm.) of Tocuyo (thin, unbleached cotton, muslin?). In exchange for a basket (15 liter) of ground-nuts (maní) they could barter 4 vara (336 cm.) of Tocuyo. I have witnessed it several times in Nazaret that the Indians were terribly cheated with regard to weight when they made their rubber deliveries to the white men, and I could see it from the expression on their faces that they were aware of the fraud.' <sup id="cite_ref-159" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-159">[159]</a></sup> In most cases, barter trade operated through intermediaries or patrones rather than established markets in white settlements.

The subsistence system allowed for continuous sowing and harvesting throughout the year: 'Living as they do well to the west of the area which is annually inundated, and consequently being free from dependance on the seasons, they can sow at any time of the year, with the certainty of reaping at the end of the unvarying number of months which are needed in order that the crop may ripen. Yuca, for instance, is ready in six months; Indian corn in three months; yams (a potato which grows three to four feet in length and fifty pounds in weight) in a year; sweet potatoes, peanuts, and tobacco are also cultivated in large quantities.”' <sup id="cite_ref-160" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-160">[160]</a></sup> Karsten reports only household-level food storage. [There were no collective storage facilities. In fact the only crops stored in households were/are peanuts and maize. Since the Shuar only use sweet manioc, they do not manufacture manioc flour.] '“The truth is that the married Jibaro woman is not only completely independent within her own sphere of activity, but exercises a remarkable social influence and authority even in matters which mainly concern the husband. It is interesting to state in this respect that a family-father never sells fruit or other articles of food without the consent of his wife. There are, I think, few civilized societies where the man so unfailingly asks his wife's advice, even in unimportant matters, as among these savages. It occurred very frequently during my travels in the forest that I paid visits to the Jibaro houses to buy manioc or bananas, and received from the ‘autocrat’ of the house the answer: ‘I must first ask [254] my wife.’ Frequently the wife happened to be absent for the moment and then the answer was: ‘Wait a while until my wife arrives.’ I saw that there was a store of manioc and bananas in the house, and it would have been an easy thing for the man to give me immediately what I wanted to buy; yet he compelled me to wait for a long while, perhaps for hours, only to be able to ask his wife's permission to make the insignificant bargain. Still one can understand this consideration for the housewife when articles of food are in question. Since the wife is the keeper of the food and is responsible for the existence of a store sufficient for the needs of the family, it is natural that she should also be allowed to decide how much of it can be given to strangers.' <sup id="cite_ref-161" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-161">[161]</a></sup></dd></dl>

Each house  lies alone by itself, as though lost in the forest, and is usually inhabited by only one family, rarely by several. In approaching, certain precautionary measures must be observed to ensure a friendly reception. The visit is announced from a great distance by shouting, but in the immediate vicinity of the house one marches in absolute silence.

The rivers, still rapid, to be sure, become broad and even navigable for short stretches; an immense forest area stretches out before one's eyes. Up to here we found the brooks, which were difficult to cross, bridged over, although the liana bridges, serving as a model for our suspension bridges, sometimes offered crossings which appeared  dangerous. Farther down, however, the rivers had to be waded, for the Jesuits, in order to make access to their mission more difficult, had pulled down the bridges formerly present and had taken the canoes used for ferrying into Mácas into their own custody.' <sup id="cite_ref-168" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-168">[168]</a></sup></dd>

The aim of this arrangement is to prevent the enemy from approaching the house through the plantations.' <sup id="cite_ref-174" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-174">[174]</a></sup> '“That the Jibaros are professional warriors also appears from the way in which they construct their houses and from the defensive measures to which they have recourse when particularly threatened by their enemies. The houses themselves are constructed with great care, and as we have seen, even in times of peace are provided with walls of strong chonta poles. When a family is particularly threatened by enemies the house is fortified in a special way. On the outer side of the ordinary wall another wall is made, consisting of big chonta stems, so that the house has two walls, one close to the other (Pl. X, 3.4). Within the houses, all along the walls, a number of small rooms or partitions, about 1 meter in height, are likewise made of chonta poles, each having a small hole in the outside through which the warrior can shoot his attacking enemy. There is one such small room for each defender of the house. The partitions will afford the warrior protection in case the enemies are able to penetrate into the house. As to the doors, there are two in each Jibaro house, one at each end of the house, one for the men, the other for the women. These doors generally consist of six chonta poles, the upper ends of which are united by means of strong lianas, while the nether ends are free and can be separated from each other, three to each side, making an opening of triangular form. The whole opening is so small, however, that only one man at a time with some difficulty can enter the house. During the night the poles forming the doors are always carefully closed and fastened by a transverse pole applied to the inner side, so that the entrance of undesirable persons is made impossible. Even the outer wall in a fortified house has a special door consisting of similar poles, which can be closed from the inside.' <sup id="cite_ref-175" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-175">[175]</a></sup> These enclosures appear to have been constructed for the benefit of a whole community rather than just one family.</dd>

In contrast, Aguarunas and Antipas, whom the miners encountered on the Alto Marañón, were found to be inordinately hospitable, especially “fond of European trade goods” and eager to exchange garden produce, salt, and even gold for them in some instances (Von Hassel 1902/II:68, 70-71).' <sup id="cite_ref-176" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-176">[176]</a></sup></dd>

In the more unsettled areas, I have come across defence towers (kumbinta) built alongside the house, and it is not uncommon to see an extra row of short poles planted outside the wall about six inches away, with the intervening space filled with stones; but such things are merely additional safeguards against attack.”' <sup id="cite_ref-177" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-177">[177]</a></sup> 'A special type of buildings are the battle towers which can be found in connection with certain dwellings. I did not see one of these battle towers close enough, but I saw them from a distance while travelling by. The dwellings which I inspected did not have any such battle towers. They are placed at a distance from the main dwelling, but are connected with the latter by means of a ladder, which consists of notched tree-trunks. The towers consist of four sturdy uprights, each one 8 - 10 meters high and placed in a square at a distance of three meters from each other. On top there is a platform, which is protected by a parapet (height: 1 meter) and a roof.' <sup id="cite_ref-178" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-178">[178]</a></sup> 'Formerly, before the use of firearms was so general among the Jibaros as it is now, the chiefs especially were in the habit of constructing a sort of war tower at one end of their houses. These towers were of quadratic form and sometimes 20 or 30 meters in height. On the top of it there was a small room about 4 meters in quadrate and with walls about 1 meter in height, made of strong chonta poles, which protected the defender against the lances of the enemies. The whole thing rested upon pillars of the stem of the chonta palm, and the warrior ascended along a stair consisting of wooden logs with incisions which gave him foothold. These war towers were called kumbinta. After the Jibaros began to make use of firearms in their wars these measures of defence proved less fit for the purpose, and consequently were no longer used.”' <sup id="cite_ref-179" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-179">[179]</a></sup> Others describe temporary cooking shelters and provisional barns: 'The roof (kambańaka), consists of plaited palm leaves, and in the tropical climate is liable to be attacked by insects and gradually destroyed, so it has to be renewed after the lapse of some years. In building a new house therefore the Jibaros observe the following custom. On the fire kindled in the new house no manioc or palm cabbage can be cooked until it has been purified by burning cedar wood (Cedrela herrerae), the smoke of which will penetrate the thatch and kill the insects existing in it. In this way the thatch, according to the idea of the Jibaros, is not only purified for the time being, but permanently. If manioc or palm cabbage is cooked in the new house before the said procedure, certain maggots, which easily develop in the manioc plant and in palm tops, will infest the thatch and soon destroy it. Until the house has been purified in the way indicated these kinds of vegetable food must be cooked in a special, small shelter outside the new house.' <sup id="cite_ref-180" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-180">[180]</a></sup>  “To a limited extent, particularly on the Upano, the Jivaros keep domesticated fowl and pigs, these having been early introduced by the Spaniards. They are cared for by the women and regarded as the women's property. The native ‘pavo’ (Penelope cristata) is also sometimes domesticated. Small conical structures, strongly built of poles, are erected in the clearing of the jivaría where the domestic animals repair at night as protection against prowling members of the cat tribe (pl. 26, b). Various pets are frequently encountered in the jivaría, monkeys, parrots, and toucans being the most common. These, as well as the dogs, are kept inside the house.” <sup id="cite_ref-181" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-181">[181]</a></sup></dd></dl>

Similarly, if for instance six Jibaro Indians have left for a journey and one askes[sic] how many Indians went off, the answer will never be a direct ‘six’, but the Indian interrogated begins to enumerate the names of all those who went off, always counting on his fingers, until he arrives at the first finger on the right hand which means ‘six’.”' <sup id="cite_ref-191" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-191">[191]</a></sup> 'For counting, the five fingers of the hand are used as a base, then one hand + 1, etc. To what extent higher number concepts are present I could not find out through my untrained interpreters.' <sup id="cite_ref-192" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-192">[192]</a></sup> 'The Jíbaros do not have extensive learning.

I have already said that the Jíbaros lack grace. According to the missionaries, their music and their singing would be unbearable to the ear of a White, but it is necessary to take into account the performers' drunkenness during the course of the feasts. The proof of that is that one of my friends who lived in Gualaquiza for a long time, where he was known and loved by the savages, and who had occasion to pass an evening with one of them without drinking, gave an entirely different opinion: “In the middle of the entertainment”, he wrote me, “I asked that the two wives of Santiago (so the Indian was called) let us hear some songs. Santiago agreed and even joined his voice with theirs. I hear even now the harmony of this song; it was so gentle and so melodious that I had them repeat it two or three times. I profited by this in order to put the words in my notebook; finally, I asked the Jíbaro the meaning of what I had written, and I acquired the conviction that they sang whatever came to their minds, without any order, in other words, that they improvised words to a familiar air.”' <sup id="cite_ref-194" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-194">[194]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b> ♠ Written records ♣ absent ♥ </b> SCCS variable 149 'Writing and Records' is coded as ‘1’ or ‘None’, not ‘Mnemonic devices’, or ‘Nonwritten records’, or 'True writing, no records', or ‘True writing; records’ According to Salazar's information, written records and literacy became more widespread only in the second half of the 20th century: 'The official publication of the federation is a bilingual Shuar-Spanish newspaper called Chicham, “Message,” which appears irregularly. Chicham is devoted to accounts of the activities of the federation, as well as general information on such varied subjects as acculturation, government policies, and the situation of Indian groups in Ecuador and South America as a whole. The Shuar have already established contact with native American movements throughout the American continent. Furthermore, the federation has sponsored about 30 publications of different kinds, including scientific subjects (technology, social structure, and mythology of the Shuar), school books (literacy booklets and school texts), and religious works (prayer books, gospel translations). Particular attention must be drawn to the publication of the Mundo Shuar booklets, which represents the greatest effort so far to diffuse Shuar culture in printed form. The collection includes seven series of publications, each series covering a broad aspect of Shuar culture (e.g. ethnohistory, technology, linguistics). Authors include missionaries, white teachers, and Shuar intellectuals who contribute to the recently established Center for Documentation and Research on Shuar Culture. The collection as a whole is printed at the Salesian Publishing House in Quito, and is also directed by a Salesian priest, Father Juan Botasso. Mundo Shuar thus appears as a Salesian effort to rescue what is left of a rich culture that almost disintegrated as a result of more than half a century of Salesian administration of the Shuar people. The works so far published show, as could be expected, a varying degree of scholarship, but on the whole Mundo Shuar has been well accepted in the country, and promises to be an indispensable research tool for anthropologists interested in Shuar culture.' <sup id="cite_ref-195" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-195">[195]</a></sup></dd>

The shuar engaged in barter trade with other Amerindian and settler populations: 'In all the tambos I found Winchester rifles which they had obtained from the rubber collectors by barter for rubber.

They are said to obtain the iron points by way of barter from the Indians along the upper Senepa. The points are said to come from Ecuador. The spear with the iron point is called nánki by the Indians. Formerly spears were used shaped out of the wood of the chonta palm, and they still occur in isolated instances.

There are records of such incursions in last quarter of 18th century and again between 1850 and 1880.] 'In order to get articles that were valuable to them the Indians started to collect the products of their forests. In exchange for rubber, various resins, canoes, Maní, yucca, bananas, tamed animals and parrots the Indians ask for Winchester repeating arms, rifles and the necessary ammunition, axes, knives, scissors, needles, fishhooks, mirrors, cotton wares, sewing thread, etc. At that time the rate of exchange was the following: For a small canoe for six people they would receive an ordinary single-barrelled rifle (European value perhaps 10 Marks). For a hen or a large bunch of bananas they would receive one vara (84 cm.) of Tocuyo (thin, unbleached cotton, muslin?). In exchange for a basket (15 liter) of ground-nuts (maní) they could barter 4 vara (336 cm.) of Tocuyo. I have witnessed it several times in Nazaret that the Indians were terribly cheated with regard to weight when they made their rubber deliveries to the white men, and I could see it from the expression on their faces that they were aware of the fraud.' <sup id="cite_ref-199" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-199">[199]</a></sup> The region was hit economically by the crash of the rubber market: 'However, with the crash of the rubber market, the commercial pressure on Indian populations-more attenuated here than elsewhere (Harner 1972:30)-was diminished. The cauchero whom Karsten encountered on the Pastaza working with inland Achuarä in 1917, was gone on Karsten's return trip in 1929 (Karsten 1935:41, 43, 78). Furthermore, numbers of Peruvian military outposts that had served to oversee commercial activity were withdrawn (Karsten 1935:43, 78; Zanabria Zamudio 1969:157, 159, 195), and access to the entire Pastaza region was gradually curtailed. A Catholic missionary reported in 1928 that “the steamships of Iquitos which periodically make the service to the Alto Marañon, do not enter [the Pastaza], since it is almost completely lacking in civilized people and all exploitation of goma [latex] has been suspended because of the depreciation” (Misiones Pasionistas 1943:264).' <sup id="cite_ref-200" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-200">[200]</a></sup> 'Many sources of Western goods did vanish when the sudden depreciation in the value of wild Amazonian latex resulted in a major cutback in foreign investment and in the cessation of steamship transport to the region gradually coming to be occupied by Achuarä in Peru. However, commercial contact with the area was not wholly terminated. Some rubber extractors and colonists chose to remain after the crash as frontier agriculturalists or patrones of the Indians in the exploitation of other natural products. Furthermore, neither Peru nor Ecuador was fully willing to relinquish a tenuous hold over the northern tributaries of the Marañon and the as yet untapped resources to be found there.' <sup id="cite_ref-201" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-201">[201]</a></sup></dd>

Gold dust had been used in trade and (short-lived) tribute relations with Spanish intruders: 'The first reported white penetration of Jivaro territory was made in 1549 by a Spanish expedition under Hernando de Benavente. Later expeditions of colonists and soldiers soon followed. These newcomers traded with the Jivaro, made peace pacts with them, and soon began to exploit the gold found in alluvial or glacial deposits in the region. Eventually the Spaniards were able to obtain the co-operation of some of the Indians in working the gold deposits, but others remained hostile, killing many of the colonists and soldiers at every opportunity. Under the subjection of the Spaniards, the Jivaro were required to pay tribute in gold dust; a demand that increased yearly. Finally, in 1599, the Jivaro rebelled en masse, killing many thousands of Spaniards in the process and driving them from the region. After 1599, until nearly the middle of the nineteenth century, Jivaro-European relations remained intermittent and mostly hostile. A few missionary and military expeditions entered the region from the Andean highlands, but these frequently ended in disaster and no permanent colonization ever resulted. One of the few "friendly" gestures reported for the tribe during this time occurred in 1767, when they gave a Spanish missionizing expedition "gifts", which included the skulls of Spaniards who had apparently been killed earlier by the Jivaro (Harner, 1953: 26). Thus it seems that the Jivaros are the only tribe known to have successfully revolted against the Spanish Empire and to have been able to thwart all subsequent attempts by the Spaniards to conquer them. They have withstood armies of gold seeking Inkas as well as Spaniards, and defied the bravado of the early conquistadors.' <sup id="cite_ref-202" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-202">[202]</a></sup> [Shuar parties would occasionally travel to colono settlements to trade , and even travel up to Andean cities to trade gold powder against metal tools.

We may presume relations of debt between white patrones and Shuar clients, although they were probably little formalized: 'Contact with constituents of an advancing capitalism and nationalist frontier has altered virtually all the Amerindian populations of lowland South America, through the debilitating effects of epidemics, as a result of enslavement and debt peonage, and through territorial retrenchment or dislocation. Other, less morbid and more readily accepted changes include the introduction of novel cultigens (such as plantains and sugar cane), metal tools (machetes, axes, fishhooks) and, in many cases, the shotgun or carbine. Such influences and innovations have not been uniform, nor the rates and degrees of change identical, but their ultimate consequence of increasing economic dependence on Euroamerican commerce has almost universally created a situation in which fundamental aspects of production and exchange are tied to highly problematic and frequently exploitative relations with mestizo settlements, river traders, and missionaries.' <sup id="cite_ref-205" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-205">[205]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b> ♠ Couriers ♣ absent ♥ </b> Shuar communities transmitted messages through ceremonial and war drums: 'A few words must be said about the túndui, the wireless telephone of the Aguarunas. It consists of a hollowed-out tree trunk, about 100-120 cm. long and of a thickness of 30-35 cm. At each end there is a handle, one of which is used to grab it, the other as a support on the ground, so that the instrument is free to vibrate. On top of the drum there are four holes in one direction. Originally, these holes may have been used to hollow out the trunk, in the end they help with the resonance. (See Illustration number 4.) They beat the instrument with a short stick which is wound with vegetarian wool at one end. The sound differs depending on whether the drum is hit from the side or at the top. The messages are conveyed, in the manner of our Morse system, by a combination of these two sound possibilities. If the air is quiet, one is able to hear the túndui at a distance of several kilometers. The message is transmitted from one place to the other by a process of interception and further transmission.' <sup id="cite_ref-207" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-207">[207]</a></sup> '“As we sat on the banks of the Upano, listening to the words of wisdom that fell from Kuashu's lips, we heard the distant beat of a drum resounding harshly over the forest. It was not the low musical note, full and vibrant, but a peculiarly hard, penetrating noise, resembling the rapid blows of an axe on some fallen tree-trunk. The signal drum or tundai of the Jivaros is just a log of hard wood, carefully hollowed out by hand and slung between a couple of poles for support. It is beaten with a club and the sound emitted has remarkable carrying qualities. If anything of moment ever occurs in the locality, the news is spread from house to house through the medium of the tundai. It also plays a prominent part on all festive occasions.' <sup id="cite_ref-208" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-208">[208]</a></sup> 'First, the tunduí is beaten at the feasts when the narcotics nate´ma or maikoa are ceremonially consumed. In this case the drumming is in very slow time' <sup id="cite_ref-209" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-209">[209]</a></sup> 'Secondly, the Jibaros beat the tunduí at the feasts (nambeŕa) where the ordinary manioc-beer (nihamańchi) or the beer made of the fruit of the chontaruŕu palm is ceremonially consumed.' <sup id="cite_ref-210" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-210">[210]</a></sup> 'In both these cases the spirits (iguańchi), and not human beings, are summoned by means of the tunduí. But thirdly, the Indians use the signal drum to summon their human friends in two events, namely, when a death has taken place in a house and when enemies are [112] making an attack upon it. Since a death is always set down by the Jibaros to the secret machinations of some enemy sorcerer, the situation in the two events is essentially the same. The beating of the drum is a cry for help, or a notification that a crime has been committed. In this third case, i.e. when the drum is beaten for the purpose of giving friends notice of danger, the signalling consists of a series of short, fast strokes in a tone which, in each series, is at first forte or fortissimo and thereafter gradually diminishes. This is repeated several times. This particular mode of signalling is called Pakinmawae.”' <sup id="cite_ref-211" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-211">[211]</a></sup> '“The big signal drum of the Jibaros, called tundúi, also plays a part in the wars, although originally it seems to have been a purely religious instrument. At times when there is fear of an attack of enemies it is placed outside the house on the hill, and the beats may then be heard at a distance of several miles. The drum tundúi is beaten when the Jibaros drink the narcotics maikoa and natéma-in which case the object is to summon the spirits that inhabit these sacred drinks-also after a death, and lastly to give friends notice of an attack by enemies. In the latter case the signalling consists of a series of short and fast beats at a time which is at first forte or fortissimo and there-after gradually diminishes. When the friends in the other houses hear these beats they say: Pakinmawae, ‘they are killing’. Hence this whole mode of signaling is called Pakinmawae. As soon as the inhabitants of a house get knowledge of or suspect the presence of enemies, and also during the attack, if there is time for it, they try by beating the tundúi to summon their friends for rescue, and the singalling may sometimes cause the enemy, fearing the arrival of help, to give up his evil intention and take flight.”' <sup id="cite_ref-212" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-212">[212]</a></sup> They did not use professional couriers or postal services.</dd>

<dd><b> ♠ Fastest individual communication ♣  ♥ </b> Brüning and Karsten provide a general description of the territory: 'The Indians are inhabitants of a region which extends along the upper course of the Marañón River, from Yusamaro downward to Puerto Meléndez at the Pongo de Manseriche. They live in this region in small and widely dispersed settlements close to the banks of the River. I have been informed that their chief settlements are located farther up along the tributary rivers. Beyond Yusamaro no Indians are said to remain anymore, yet formerly their settlements are said to have extended to the Pongo Rentema. They had moved down to the Marañón River on account of the quarrels they had with the whites or, rather, the mestizos. Their settlements can not be called permanent anyway. Despite the fact that the Indians live at one place for a long time, and in relatively permanent dwellings at that, they are said to leave their settlements frequently for no special reason in order to reestablish themselves again at some distance from the former settlement.' <sup id="cite_ref-213" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-213">[213]</a></sup> '“In describing my journeys among the Jibaro Indians I had occasion to mention repeatedly that the savage Jibaros never settle on the banks of the main rivers, but prefer to make their houses beside small affluents in the interior of the country. The reason for this is obvious: it is due to their constant fear of hostile attacks. By hiding themselves in the forests in the way they do, they not only avoid the whites, who now and then travel along the main rivers, but they are also better protected against hostile Indian tribes. The Jibaro houses are also largely constructed with a view to keeping off uninvited guests; in fact, nearly every house is a sort of fortress, as will be shown in greater detail in the part dealing with the warfare of the Indians.”' <sup id="cite_ref-214" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-214">[214]</a></sup> They do not provide the relevant details for this variable.</dd></dl>

They are said to obtain the iron points by way of barter from the Indians along the upper Senepa. The points are said to come from Ecuador. The spear with the iron point is called nánki by the Indians. Formerly spears were used shaped out of the wood of the chonta palm, and they still occur in isolated instances.

One of the extremities is closed by a plug made of a resistant wood for receiving the spur of the throwing stick.

<dd><b> ♠ Other thrown weapons ♣ present ♥ </b> Blow-guns are made from the chonta palm, which is both hard and straight-grained. The guns are made in two pieces cut to a semi-circular shape and grooved on their flat sides. The grooves are also semi-circular in shape, and the straight grain of the palm allows them to be very evenly cut so that when the two pieces are placed together a remarkably clean one-quarter-inch bore results, which is later polished smooth with string, cloth, and sand. The two pieces are now bound tightly together with long thin strips of bark wound spirally around them. Then the whole binding is covered with black beeswax. Several layers of this kind may be applied. The two blow-guns in this collections have carved bone mouthpieces, and taper from about an inch and a quarter in diameter to three quarters of an inch.

<dd><b> ♠ Atlatl ♣ present ♥ </b> [NB: Spear-throwers were likely obselete and out of use by the time period in question: It seems clear that during the sixteenth century the Shuar used lances, spear throwers, and bows and arrows.

The use of the spear thrower appears now to be entirely forgotten by the Shuar.<sup id="cite_ref-222" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-222">[222]</a></sup>] The spear-thrower is made of a piece of wood about 69 cm. long, with a groove hollowed on its upper side to receive the handle of the javelin; the rear end of the latter butts against the edge of the spear-thrower. The spear-thrower has a hole on its lower surface at the junction of its posterior and middle thirds, where the Indian puts his index finger in order to throw the javelin, as the illustration shows.

Spears are attached to these saplings so that when the string is stepped against, the sapling will react as a catapult, launching the spear into the body of the person releasing the trap. Deadfalls with pointed chonta sticks on the bottoms are dug at various strategic points. Frequently a trench with the bottom covered with chonta points in this fashion is dug entirely around the house. Great pains are taken to cover this naturally, so as to make its location difficult to detect.

<dd><b> ♠ Handheld firearms ♣ present ♥ </b> Guns clearly were revolutionary in their impact, producing a situation analogous to that reported by Vayda (1970) for the Maori of New Zealand. The same strenuous efforts were made by hostile Shuar groups to obtain firearms from a limited number of access points. The missionary, Vacas Galindo, reports of one local group allied with Candoshi along the Situye River who, under great pressure from expanding Upano Shuar, ambushed a war party from that district with plans to exchange their shrunken heads with traders down on the Marañón for more firearms (Vacas Galindo 1895:173-178)... Access to firearms was difficult at best along the Alto Marañón and certainly uneven among the various Shuar at this time. Antipas and Aguaruna Indians, whom Up de Graff subsequently encountered upriver near the Pongo, also were known to descend the Marañón to barter at Barranca, even subsequent to the Huambisa treachery of 1898. Yet not one of their approximately 200 warriors carried a firearm as they escorted the explorer up the Santiago River on a collective headtaking expedition against the Huambisas in 1899 (1923:241, 251). Furthermore, they quickly fled southward after raiding several settlements, fearful of retaliation by enemies whom they knew to possess weapons far superior to their own (1923:275; cf. Stirling 1938:58)... As among the Maori, in the early days of acquiring Western weapons, “the outcomes of engagements … reflected mainly the relative success of groups in obtaining guns” (Vayda 1970:580). It is perhaps equally true that while the acquisition of guns became a material goal of raids and head-hunting (setting aside the supernatural motivations), the possession of guns also facilitated long-distance forays, enabling men from the Upano Valley, for example, to range as far south as the Marañón River (Harner 1972:116) through otherwise hostile country (cf. Vayda 1970:580).<sup id="cite_ref-229" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-229">[229]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<dd> <b> ♠ Battle axes ♣ present ♥ </b> The relative isolation of the interior Shuar, however, had not prevented them from obtaining increasing quantities of machetes, steel axes, and shotguns. By means of neighborhood-to-neighborhood relays of native trading partners, these products of Western civilization were passed from the frontier Shuar into the most remote parts of the tribal territory. All of the interior Shuar neighborhoods were thus supplied with steel cutting tools, firearms, and ammunition without the necessity of coming into direct contact with the white population.<sup id="cite_ref-232" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-232">[232]</a></sup></dd>

Thus all the effort goes into beheading the enemy. This is easy in an ambush, but more difficult in a regular battle.

These not only aid in hunting in the forest, as mentioned earlier, but also protect the garden crops, including the manioc tubers, from devastation by agouti and other rodents. A family without a good hunting dog lives in fear of losing much of its garden produce within a few months. An equally important service that they provide is to act as watchdogs against surprise attacks. Leashed to beds in the women's end of the house (see Plate 11), their slightest barking usually results in the household head seizing his gun and preparing to defend himself and his family. Since the dogs' barking indicates that the intended victim has been alerted, the attacking party generally withdraws.

At the bottom of the hole three pointed sticks of chonta, resembling points of lances, are arranged in an erect position. These pointed sticks are called ashi. The part which sticks out from the earth has a length of about half a meter. At the surface of the earth the opening of the hole is covered with small sticks and leaves which makes it difficult or impossible for the enemy, creeping along in the darkness, to discover its presence before he falls into it. When he falls his feet are transfixed by the pointed sticks and he is not able to get out.

Just off the end of the building which was evidently considered least vulnerable there was a small room barely 15 feet square which was protected on all sides in the same manner, but was raised about 20 feet from the ground, supported by four stout posts and placed conveniently near the little door of the main building so that one could at once step on a notched tree trunk and climb to safety, throwing the ladder away. These places are used for the safety of women and children in times of raiding and as a final refuge. Should the enemy try to climb to the hut, a shower of rocks is dropped down upon them, a supply being kept ready for that purpose. Climbing into one of these curious towers, it was found to have convenient niches in order that the occupants could command a complete view of the clearing on all sides and any Indian being fortunate enough to own a rifle and ammunition could easily hold at bay a strong force.

Such massive contingents, with substantially unilateral access to the superior muzzleloader obtained from white colonists in the Upano region, generated a steamroller effect in Shuarä expansion. Indeed, the sequence of expeditions of extermination, territorial retrenchment and movement southeastward by the Achuarä appears to have continued unabated (cf. Karsten 1923:14-15; 1935:59) until at least a good number of the latter acquired their own sources of Western manufactures through participation in the extractive industry along the upper Pastaza and its tributaries. Then, according to missionary reports, “Warfare increased until there grew between the two … a kind of jungle no-man's land in which members of neither group dared to settle for fear of being murdered by the other” (Drown and Drown 1961:11).<sup id="cite_ref-252" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-252">[252]</a></sup>

The tribes of the Rio Chiguaza, a small affluent of the upper Pastaza, are mortal enemies of the Jibaros living on the Rio Capotaza between the upper Pastaza and Bobonaza. All wild Jibaros on the Pastaza have for many years waged real wars of extermination against the half-civilized Canelos Indians on the Bobonaza, and so on.

</p><p>"The primary motivation for warfare is to secure as many human heads as possible from an alien tribe, and secondarily to capture women. The acquisition of territory had never been a motive for engaging in warfare. The war party, consisting of approximately thirty or forty men, is recruited from the community itself or from friendly neighborhoods nearby, and is usually led by the  or  as war leader or chief. Actual warfare consists of preliminary ceremonies involving ritualized chanting, surprise attacks against one or two enemy houses, the killing and decapitation of the inhabitants or the occasional capture of a girl or woman as an extra wife, and the preparation of the  on the return to the home village. Unlike many of the warlike Amazon tribes captives are not tortured or sacrificed, nor is cannibalism practiced." <sup id="cite_ref-270" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-270">[270]</a></sup>
</p><p>"The wars of the Jibaro Indians are thus in their nature nothing but wars of revenge, and never aim at territorial conquests. The Jibaros, in reality, fear and detest the country of their enemies, where secret supernatural dangers may threaten them even after they have conquered their natural enemies. The sorcerers of the hostile tribe may have left their witching arrows everywhere, on the road, in the forest, in the houses, with the result that the invading enemies may be hit by them when they least expect it. The land of the enemy is therefore abandoned as soon as possible. Besides, the Jibaros who inhabit endless virgin forests, where they can make new settlements almost anywhere have no need to conquer the territory of other tribes."<sup id="cite_ref-271" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-271">[271]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Looting ♣ present ♥</b>
</p><p>Looting and sack were common characteristics of feuding: "All this having been decided upon, the victorious party mill around, shouting, and wrecking everything inside the house.

</p><p>"While head-hunting was, undoubtedly, a very effective means of mobilizing and motivating warriors and of instilling fear in their enemies, it should not be ignored that raids were also occasions for “the successful attackers [to] loot the houses of such valuables as blowguns, dart poison, dogs, beads, machetes, steel axes, featherwork, and other ornaments” (Harner 1972:187). These were by no means insignificant acquisitions. Blowguns, for example, were very important to food procurement, particularly in long-exploited regions where the chief sources of game were small rodents, monkeys, and birds; but, as Harner notes, “formerly, blowguns and curare could only be obtained in small quantities by looting Achuarä houses after a successful head-hunting raid” (1972:56, 207)."<sup id="cite_ref-273" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-273">[273]</a></sup>

</p><p>Occasionally, women were taken captive during raids, but according to the sources reviewed so far, this was not a common occurrence in inter-tribal warfare: "The victorious enemy wreaks his savage vengeance not only upon the fighting men, but also on old people, women, and small children, nay, sometimes even on the domestic animals. Although there are many statements-from the very time of the Spaniards-to the effect that younger women, and especially girls, are spared in the wars of the Jibaros, we must not take this to be the general rule. It is true that there is a scarcity of women in the Jibaro society and that in general they are held in great esteem on account of the work they do. But it must be remembered that the Jibaros are essentially endogamous, members of foreign tribes being detested and looked upon as natural enemies. Besides, experience has taught the Indians that full-grown women of a vanquished tribe cannot always be made to submit to a victor who has perhaps cruelly killed their husbands, fathers, or brothers, but that they retain an invincible hatred against him. There are, in consequence, instances of the wives of vanquished enemies being carried home by the victors only to be brutally massacred. Young girls can more easily be brought up to become loyal wives and members of the victor's tribe."<sup id="cite_ref-276" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-276">[276]</a></sup>

<p>A collective ritual is a ritual in which two or more people participate. With the official cult we refer to the set of collective ritual practices that are most closely associated with legitimation of the power structure (including elites, if any).
</p><p><b>♠ RA ♣ Eva Brandl; Enrico Cioni ♥</b> EB did all the research and coding, EC edited.
</p><p><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b>
</p><p>The following general description was extracted from eHRAF: 'Jivaro religion is based on the idea of an impersonal supernatural power called TSARUTAMA  , a concept similar to the Polynesians belief in MANA  . Objects, persons, spirits, and especially the TSANTSAS are all infused with varying degrees of TSARUTAMA which can be used for either good or evil. The mountain Rain God, the Anaconda, the Sun, Moon, Earth, and the chonta palm, are all believed to possess great amounts of this power. In addition to the above the Jivaro recognize three kinds of souls: the ARUTAM WAKANI  , which they believe to be the most significant; the MUISAK, or avenging soul; and the NEKAS WAKANI, the "true", "real", or "ordinary" soul. An individual is not born with an ARUTAM  oul but it is acquired through a vision quest in which fasting, cold water "bathing" and hallucinogenic drugs are used. This "quest" takes place for a boy about the age of six. The possessor of a single ARUTAM soul is thought to be immune to death by physical means or sorcery, but can die of natural causes. Those individuals lucky enough to have two ARUTAM souls cannot die of any cause.' <sup id="cite_ref-293" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-293">[293]</a></sup> 'There are no gods who play ethical or moral roles in the Jivaro pantheon, nor are there any priests or other religious specialist except the shaman (UWISIN  ) whose primary role in the society is magical curing, although he also has the power to send illness into an individual as a form of sorcery (Service, 1958: 196). Lacking true political organization, the shaman may be the most influential individual in the community frequently acting the role of KAKARAM   as well as shaman.' <sup id="cite_ref-294" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-294">[294]</a></sup> 'The vast majority of illnesses and non-violent deaths are believed to be caused by witchcraft. The only diseases not attributed to witchcraft are "white man's diseases", such as whooping cough, measles, colds, smallpox, and mild forms of diarrhea, which are treated by the "laymen" of the community with herbal medicines. Shamans never use herbal remedies, but depend on their ability to manipulate the supernatural world in the diagnosis of a disease. This process involves their taking of hallucinogenic drugs to induce a trance state during which they enter the spirit world and determine the cause of the disease. If the disease is caused by particular spirits, as the Jivaro usually believe, the shaman ritually treats the affliction by a process of singing and sucking.' <sup id="cite_ref-295" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-295">[295]</a></sup> 'Beyond the ritualized chanting that takes place before a raiding expedition, as mentioned above, the only other major ceremony taking place among the Jivaro is the TSANTSA   feast, a great victory celebration taking place in the home village following a successful head-hunting raid. Since food and drink are offered to the invited guests at these celebrations in great quantity, a great strain is put on the economic resources of the head-takers and their families so frequently the TSANTSA   feast may be spread over a period of two to three years during which resources are rebuilt. From the Jivaro's point of view the primary purpose of the TSANTSA feast is not necessarily supernatural, although that is generally recognized as a secondary purpose; but to acquire prestige, friendship, and obligations through being recognized as an accomplished warrior, and through the feasting, by being a generous host to as many neighbors as possible (Harner, 1972: 191-192).' <sup id="cite_ref-296" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-296">[296]</a></sup> 'There is no formal marriage ceremony.' <sup id="cite_ref-297" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-297">[297]</a></sup>
</p><p>Women engaged in garden magic, but this was performed individually: 'Nuŋuí, it is believed, is responsible for pushing the crops up through the ground, i.e., for their growth. Without her help, a woman cannot expect to be successful as a gardener and, therefore, engages in various practices to attract Nuŋuí to the garden, and to keep her there. Such practices are based upon a knowledge of Nuŋuí's two main demands from the Jívaro: to be given a place to dance and to be provided with “babies.” With the breaking of day, Nuŋuí returns underground, going deeper as the day progresses. Since her supernatural force retreats with her, it is believed that the manioc tubers and sweet potatoes diminish in size gradually during the daytime. For this reason, the mistress of the garden prefers to dig up the tuberous crops early in the morning, while they still retain their maximum size. At the same time, going early in the morning to the garden may frighten Nuŋuí, so the woman sings a song of propitation to reassure Nuŋuí and to keep her from submerging more deeply. Sometimes the woman simply thinks the song without opening her mouth, [Page 72] for it is believed that Nuŋuí can hear it this way as well. A typical version is as follows: I am a woman of Nuŋuí. Therefore I sing, So that the manioc will grow well. For when I do not sing, There is not much production. I am of Nuŋuí. Therefore I harvest faster than others. In addition to providing Nuŋuí with a dancing place and treating her with respect through songs, the mistress of the garden provides her with “babies” to encourage her to remain at the garden. These are three red stones which appear to the women in hallucinogen-induced visions and dreams as babies for Nuŋuí. The stones, which are chips of unworked red jasper, are known as the “stones of Nuŋuí” or the “stones of manioc” and supposedly can only be found through having a dream in which Nuŋuí appears and tells the woman, “I am hiding a ‘stone of manioc’ in such-and-such a place.” Then the woman must go out early in the morning, before eating, to find the stone, because if she were to delay, it would disappear as Nuŋuí made her morning withdrawal down into the earth. Only one such stone is found as a result of a given dream, and each is jealously hoarded. They are hidden in the center of the garden under an overturned food-serving bowl.' <sup id="cite_ref-298" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-298">[298]</a></sup> 'Nuŋuí is also believed to have given the dog to the Jívaro for hunting. This association of dogs with Nuŋuí is consistent with the importance of the dogs in protecting the gardens from rodents and other destructive animals, and with the fact that they are cared for by the women. In fact, when a man wishes to hunt game that requires the assistance of a dog, he asks a wife to accompany him, and to handle the dog on a leash. It is believed that the presence of the woman, through her connection to Nuŋuí, will help the man have better luck, and she constantly (and usually silently) sings to Nuŋuí for success in getting game and also so that the dog will be protected from snakebite or other misfortune. Women also sing to Nuŋuí to help protect the household from attack by enemies who might be approaching through the surrounding garden. That is, they believe that the manioc plants especially have an innate desire and capability to suck the blood from any person touching them. A woman, therefore, sings to them to suck the blood of enemies, but not of [Page 76] members of the family.' <sup id="cite_ref-299" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-299">[299]</a></sup> 'To protect themselves from such blood sucking, visitors to other persons' houses sometimes stick a branch of manioc in their belts in order to pass safely through a thick stand of the plant. Parents also employ the blood-sucking belief in telling children why they should not play in the garden.' <sup id="cite_ref-300" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-300">[300]</a></sup>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ napin ♥</b> The third Tsantsa feast to be celebrated after a successful head-hunting raid. A tsantsa is the shrunken head of an enemy. 'When this first tsantsa feast is concluded, the head-takers return to their separate homes and begin to make preparations for the two subsequent feasts which each of them will host individually. Since enormous quantities of beer and food are consumed at these celebrations, the head-taker normally has to clear additional garden space for his wife or wives to plant to assure an ample supply of manioc. The first of these two celebrations, named suamak, normally takes place no sooner than after a year, to allow time for garden clearing and the growth of a large mature crop of manioc as well as for the raising of pigs to help provide meat for the feasting. Also the host may delay the celebration in order to build a new, larger house more worthy of the occasion. Thus, often two or three years pass before a man gives the feast. To assure a large quantity of wild game for the feast, men who are close relatives of the host separately go hunting long distances from the house for a period of approximately nine or ten days before the opening day. Lacking any mnemonic system for keeping count of the days accurately, they are able to time their return to coincide with the arrival of the guests at the feast with the aid of an ingenious device which might be called a “banana clock.” That is, the host gives each hunter a green cooking banana or plantain from the same stalk, which is one of those hanging in the house to ripen for the feast. When each of the hunters' plantains is almost fully ripe, they know that it is time to return for the celebration. The host also sends or delivers plantains from the same stalk to those invited guests living at some distance so that they, too, will arrive at the same time. The celebration lasts five days and is followed, about a month later, by the third feast (napiη). This is the largest of all, with the head-taker supplying food and drink for six days. He must be able to provide plentifully for all his guests or the [Page 191] occasion would cause him to lose, rather than to gain, prestige. Guests at the feasts usually number up to about 125-150 persons, and mainly come from the local neighborhoods. Since these last two feasts, totalling eleven days of unremitted hospitality, must be supplied from the same harvest, often little food remains in the gardens at the end of the celebrations. Not uncommonly, the host and his family are forced onto a relatively meager diet for some months thereafter until the gardens can recover from their near-exhaustion. Sometimes such a large amount of the gardens' supply of manioc is consumed that the host is unable to follow the second feast with the third. There is no stigma attached to this, but it means that the tsantsa never undergoes its final modification.' <sup id="cite_ref-301" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-301">[301]</a></sup>//'The primary purpose of the tsantsa feast, from the Jívaro point of view, is not supernatural, although that is recognized by them as a secondary purpose; but is to acquire prestige, friendship, and obligations through being recognized as [Page 192] an accomplished warrior and, through the feasting, by being a generous host to as many neighbors as possible. One informant observed, “The desire of the Jívaro for heads is like the desire of the whites for gold.”' <sup id="cite_ref-302" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-302">[302]</a></sup>//Harner provides a general idea of the atmosphere during the festival: 'Since the head-taking raids are directed at the Achuara and others “who live far away,” the victim whose head is the focal point of the celebration normally is viewed by everyone in the head-taker's neighborhood as an “enemy.” Accordingly, it is the unique occasion for the members of many Jívaro households to get together to reaffirm their common identity and unity. Under such circumstances, it is not surprising that the tsantsa feast is participated in with great joy and a cumulative sense of euphoria. Of course, the huge quantities of strong manioc beer help, as do the ritual circle dances (wainči), which continue from dusk to dawn night after night. The bountiful quantities of meat and garden foods add to the sense of well-being. It is also a time of relative sexual license, as I had occasion to observe during the one tsantsa feast that I attended. Liaisons are arranged discreetly by both unmarried and married individuals, who rendezvous in the forest surrounding the house. The supernatural and ritual aspects of the celebration contribute to the sense of solidarity by inhibiting fights between men who have become drunk and who may try to even a score with old enemies or with men who have offended them at the feast by flirting with their wives. That is, it is believed that the avenging soul (muisak) of the murdered man will be able to take advantage of any disruption of the binding ritual by escaping from the tsantsa to cause an ongoing fight to culminate in a death. Permitting the muisak to escape from the tsantsa would also be an affront to the host, since it would negate the major supernatural purpose of the feast, that is, to utilize the power of the muisak, while it is resident in the [Page 193] tsantsa, for increasing the power of women who are members of the host's household. Therefore, any fight that erupts is immediately stopped by the other male participants, led by the male master of ceremonies, the wea, who usually has been selected for the role because of his considerable ritual knowledge and prestige. Fights between females at the feast, although less common, are similarly halted by the women, led by the female ceremonial leader, the uhá, who is selected on a basis similar to that for the wea. Thus the religious, ritual, and social pressures of the occasion operate to make it the safest, most euphoric, and largest social gathering known to the Jívaro. It is not surprising, therefore, that the tsantsa feasts tend to be viewed by the Jívaro as the pinnacles of their social lives. It is also expectable, given the ethos of killing and counter-killing, that this, the greatest celebration, centers around the indisputable evidence of a triumph over a common enemy. The intimate interaction between the euphoria of the celebration and the awareness of the murdered enemy is illustrated by this tsantsa feast circle dance song: Today, today, let us greet the dawn only playing. Today, today, let us greet the dawn only playing. Čuwi5 tells me Čuwi tells me We are going to greet the dawn playing. Čuwi tells me Čuwi tells me We are going to greet the dawn. And they taught me previously, I cannot sleep easily, And I will meet the dawn together with Čuwi. And don't you sleep! And don't you sleep!

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Mortuary Ritual ♥</b> 'A death is announced to the neighborhood by beating the log signal drum, if the house has one, in the same rhythm used to send the alarm when a house is attacked. Little ambiguity usually is involved since the neighbors tend to know whether anyone in the signalling household has been seriously ill. All corpses are buried inside of the house instead of out of doors so as to “keep the dead one protected from the cold rain.” Except when the house owner dies, the family continues to live in the dwelling, the rationale being expressed thus by an informant: “When they were alive, we did not fear them. Therefore we should not fear them when they are dead, although we do a little.” After the house is later abandoned in the normal course of events, family members will return when the roof seriously disintegrates to build a small palm thatch over the grave.' <sup id="cite_ref-341" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-341">[341]</a></sup>//'The bodies of deceased older children and wives are also buried in the house floor, although not in urns. A body is interred on its back and extended, with the arms at the sides, and wrapped in sections of split guadua bamboo. More split bamboo is laid on top before the earth is added. Graves are usually only about two-and-a-half to three feet deep, one man explaining, “When we live, we do not live far away from the surface of the earth, so when we are dead, we should not, either.”' <sup id="cite_ref-342" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-342">[342]</a></sup>//'When the house owner dies, the dwelling is abandoned and his wife (wives) and children will go or be taken to live with other relatives, such as a potential husband (yači of the deceased) or a son-in-law, until she remarries. She cuts her hair short as a sign of mourning, and ideally should not take a new husband until the hair has grown back down to her shoulders. Since the house will no longer be used, the deceased head of the household may be buried either below ground or above it on a low scaffold. In the latter case, a large balsa log is hollowed out in a manner somewhat similar to a canoe, from which it takes its name (kanu), although canoes are not actually used for this purpose. The corpse is laid inside and the coffin top is covered with lashed-down bark from the same log. Finally, the log is placed on crossbars so that it is between, and in line with, the two main center posts of the house, with the head towards the doorway of the women's end of the dwelling. A grave is in the same location. If several persons in a household die simultaneously in an epidemic and, as a result, the house is abandoned, they may all receive a scaffold burial.' <sup id="cite_ref-343" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-343">[343]</a></sup>//'Whether buried above or below ground, a man's corpse is dressed in a new kilt, adorned with his glass bead necklaces, [Page 168] and two black streaks are painted under his eyes. The body is wrapped in a woman's dress, the largest cloth available. A palm-wood fighting lance is laid parallel to his body on the surface of the ground, and on the ground adjacent to the burial is placed the man's round stool.

Conversely, if he himself was the victim of a head-taking raid, his corpse is buried in the usual way. A woman is buried in her finest dress and wearing her snail shell dance belt, glass bead necklaces, toucan feather earrings, and an ornamental stick in her lower lip. Her pottery-making tools and beer strainer are placed on the ground near her head, and one of her carrying baskets, containing personal effects, such as her comb and perfume bundle, is hung from a house beam above. A large basket of cooked manioc and meat is left hanging above the head of the deceased, whether male or female, and a bowl of manioc beer is placed on the ground. The food and beer are replaced daily for about a week, after which it is believed that the nekás wakanï, the true soul, has normally departed. However, if one of the survivors subsequently has a bad dream in which the deceased appears and complains of not being fed, the food and beer containers are hastily replenished.' <sup id="cite_ref-345" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-345">[345]</a></sup>//War-leaders sometimes received special treatment: 'Occasionally, an elderly, outstanding untä with renown as a killer may, on his deathbed, advise one or more sons that he wants them each to acquire one of his own arutam souls, which form at his death. When he dies, his corpse is entombed in a special way. It is seated on his round stool, leaning [Page 169] against the center post in the men's end of the abandoned house, facing the doorway. A chonta palm stave stockade is erected all around the body, about one foot from it. A small opening is made in the front of the stockade through which is inserted the magical balsa wood staff the deceased used in bathing at the sacred waterfall. The staff touches a bare spot, left uncovered, on the chest of the corpse and extends horizontally out through the barrier.' <sup id="cite_ref-346" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-346">[346]</a></sup>//'In the adjacent forest, the sons build small lean-to's, each about 300 yards away in the four cardinal directions. Each night a son can come to the abandoned house to seek an arutam soul created by the dead father which, hopefully, is wandering in the vicinity. The seeker must come alone, without a copal torch, and in the utter darkness of the house touch the magical staff, follow it with his hand until he contacts the dead man's chest, and say, “I am your son, Father.” He then goes out of the house to the north lean-to where he drinks tobacco water (nothing stronger is used) and awaits an arutam for about two hours. If none appears, he returns to the house, repeats the ritual and goes to the south lean-to, where he takes more tobacco water. The same procedure is repeated for the east and west lean-to's, dawn finding the arutam seeker at the last place unless he has already been successful. On the subsequent night, another son, or even a son-in-law of the deceased, may visit the corpse, explain his kin relationship and attempt to see an arutam. According to several accounts, the vision is often seen not only in the lean-to's, but in the house, where the arutam souls are believed to come back to visit. Usually the corpse is left in this upright position only two days and then buried in the usual manner, although there are cases where it has been left longer.' <sup id="cite_ref-347" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-347">[347]</a></sup>//The material objects mentioned as grave goods refer to objects available from the Ecuadorian period onwards.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Shamanistic Healing Ritual ♥</b> Shamans performed witchcraft and healing rituals in the case of illness. 'The ordinary sicknesses are cured by the brujo. This is the general Peruvian name for quack and sorcerer. I have not been able to find out what the Aguaruna term was. In a tambo in Huaracayo I had an opportunity to watch a brujo at work. One evening we were assembled in the house of several rubber collectors when we heard a strange singing from a nearby Indian tambo. I was informed that this meant that a brujo was at work. Immediately I went over to witness the procedure. The tambo was completely dark. Nothing could be heard except the forceful voice of the brujo mixed with the whimpering of a woman. I was told that the woman had pains in the leg. The brujo sang with a loud voice. Next he smoked a strong cigar, inhaling the smoke. In between he sucked the aching part of the woman's leg. Then he gnashed his teeth, pretended that he had to vomit and spit, as if to give the impression that he had sucked some foreign matter from the leg. I can not tell how often he repeated this, nor how long the treatment lasted. The brujo acted so realistically, that I was sickened by it and had to leave the hut in order not to vomit myself.' <sup id="cite_ref-382" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-382">[382]</a></sup>//'Mihanda had a bad swelling on his left arm which, judging from its ugly appearance, must have been extremely painful. Napi [KS: medicine man] was called in for consultation. He examined it critically, nodding his head to and fro as if to say, why that is easily cured. He did not express himself one way or the other in words but stepped out of the house for a few moments, returning with a handful of leaves which I could not identify. These he chopped up carefully, as if making mint sauce, and then put on one side. Once more he examined Mihanda's arm, rubbed it, squeezed it, punched it, and generally went through the usual movements of an experienced masseur. His patient put up with the rough handling stolidly and without flinching. The medicine-man's next move was to suck the wound with his mouth. For some minutes he continued doing this, pausing to take breath and then returning to his task with renewed vigour as if he were having quite a struggle to withdraw something from his patient's arm. Suddenly he stopped and sat back as if his efforts had been successful. ‘Look,’ he said to Mihanda, ‘no wonder your arm was sore. Just see what I have taken out of it.’ With which he took out of his mouth a fair sized pebble and handed it over for the astonished Mihanda to examine.//'The treatment did not end here, for next the wizard took the minced-up leaves, smeared them carefully over the sore spot, then taking a stick from the fire, one end of which was so much red-hot charcoal, he proceeded to touch the patient's arm and so cauterize the wound. The pain must have been excruciating but Mihanda did not utter a sound; he only made a wry face.//'Napi's methods might sound a trifle crude to the modern doctor, but it shows, nevertheless, that he had a wonderful fund of knowledge. First of all, note the manipulation of the arm; secondly, the removal of undesirable matter by the simple process of suction. The trick played on the patient's credulity is exceptionally interesting, because it indicates that Napi vaguely realized certain fundamental laws of suggestion. The stone had not come out of Mihanda's arm but out of Napi's wallet which he had slung over his shoulder. I have seen beetles, sticks and all kinds of things taken out of wounds before now, so I was used to this part of the procedure. The final application of the herb and the cauterizing of the wound showed that Napi was not only a good conjurer, but one who understood the medicinal value of plants and the need of making the wound antiseptic. When we last saw Mihanda, thirty-six hours later, the swelling had subsided, the inflammation had gone, and the wound was healing over nicely.' <sup id="cite_ref-383" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-383">[383]</a></sup>//'Shamans prefer to use natemä rather than maikua (Datura arborea) for going into trances, because the potency of the latter is too great for the shaman to be able to function ritually in singing, sucking, and the accompanying social interaction. Also, since the shaman must go into trances with frequency, he does not like to use Datura for that purpose because the strength of the plant is such that its repeated use is believed to lead to insanity. As an illustration of this [Page 154] danger, one informant said, “My father told me that a long time ago a man took maikua all the time. As a result, he lost his mind and would go walking in the forest to speak with the spirits.” For these reasons, the shaman tends to use the less strong Banisteriopsis drink natemä. In arutam seeking, however, a person in a trance does not need to perform ritual or interact with others, and therefore Datura, precisely because of its strength to produce visions, is the drug of choice.' <sup id="cite_ref-384" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-384">[384]</a></sup>//'The use of the hallucinogenic natemä drink among the Jívaro makes it possible for almost anyone to achieve the trance state essential for the practice of shamanism. Given the presence of the drug and the felt need to contact the “real,” or supernatural, world, it is not surprising that approximately one out of every four Jívaro men is a shaman. Any adult, male or female, who desires to become such a practitioner, simply presents a gift to an already practicing shaman, who administers the Banisteriopsis drink and gives some of his own supernatural power-in the form of spirit helpers, or tsentsak-to the apprentice. These spirit helpers, or “darts,” are the main supernatural forces believed to cause illness and death in daily life. To the non-shaman they are normally invisible, and even shamans can perceive them only under the influence of natemä.' <sup id="cite_ref-385" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-385">[385]</a></sup>//'During the period of sexual abstinence, the new shaman collects all kinds of insects, plants, and other objects, which he now has the power to convert into tsentsak. Almost any object, including living insects and worms, can become a tsentsak if it is small enough to be swallowed by a shaman. Certain small spiders become tunčï, a special kind of tsentsak. Different types of tsentsak are used to cause different kinds and degrees of illness, and the greater the variety of these objects that a shaman has in his body, the greater is his ability.' <sup id="cite_ref-386" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-386">[386]</a></sup>//'A special kind of spirit helper, called a pasuk, can aid the bewitching shaman by remaining near the victim in the guise of an insect or animal of the forest after the bewitcher has left. This spirit helper has his own objects to shoot into the victim should a curing shaman succeed in sucking out the tsentsak sent earlier by the bewitcher who is the owner of the pasuk.' <sup id="cite_ref-387" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-387">[387]</a></sup>//'After he returns home from bewitching, the shaman may send a wakanï bird to perch near the house of the victim. Then, if a curing shaman sucks out the intruding object, the bewitching shaman sends the wakanï bird more tsentsak to throw from its beak into the victim. By continually resupplying the wakanï bird with new tsentsak, the sorcerer makes it impossible for the curer to rid his patient permanently of the magical darts.' <sup id="cite_ref-388" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-388">[388]</a></sup>//'The degree of illness produced in a witchcraft victim is a function of both the force with which the tsentsak is shot into the body, and also of the character of the magical dart itself. If a tsentsak is shot all the way through the body of a victim, then “there is nothing for a curing shaman to suck out,” and the patient dies. If the magical dart lodges within the body, however, it is theoretically possible to cure the victim by sucking. But in actual practice, the sucking is not always considered successful.' <sup id="cite_ref-389" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-389">[389]</a></sup>//'The work of the curing shaman is complementary to that of a bewitcher. When a curing shaman is called in to treat a patient, his first task is to see if the illness is due to witchcraft. The usual diagnosis and treatment begin with the curing shaman drinking natemä, tobacco water, and pirípiri in the late afternoon and early evening. These drugs permit him to see into the body of the patient as though it were glass. If the illness is due to sorcery, the curing shaman will see the intruding object within the patient's body clearly enough to determine whether or not he can cure the sickness (see Plate 23).' <sup id="cite_ref-390" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-390">[390]</a></sup>//'A shaman sucks magical darts from a patient's body only at night, and in a dark area of the house, for it is only in the dark that he can perceive the drug-induced visions that are the supernatural reality. With the setting of the sun, [Page 161] he alerts his tsentsak by whistling the tune of the curing song; after about a quarter of an hour, he starts singing. A shaman's curing songs tend to be self-encouraging exhortations  [...].' <sup id="cite_ref-391" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-391">[391]</a></sup>//'When he is ready to suck, the shaman regurgitates two tsentsak into the sides of his throat and mouth. These must be identical to the one he has seen in the patient's body. He holds one of these in the front of the mouth and the other in the rear. They are expected to catch the supernatural aspect of the magical dart that the shaman sucks out of the patient's body. The tsentsak nearest the shaman's lips is supposed to incorporate the sucked-out tsentsak essence within itself. If, however, this supernatural essence should get past it, the second magical dart in the mouth blocks the throat so that the intruder cannot enter the interior of the shaman's body. If the curer's two tsentsak were to fail to catch the supernatural essence of the tsentsak, it would pass down into the shaman's stomach and kill him. Trapped thus within the mouth, this essence is shortly caught by, and incorporated into, the material substance of one of the curing shaman's tsentsak. He then “vomits” out this object and displays [Page 163] it to the patient and his family, saying, “Now I have sucked it out. Here it is.”' <sup id="cite_ref-392" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-392">[392]</a></sup>//'The non-shamans think that the material object itself is what has been sucked out, and the shaman does not disillusion them. At the same time, he is not lying, because he knows that the only important thing about a tsentsak is its supernatural aspect, or essence, which he sincerely believes he has removed from the patient's body. To explain to the layman that he already had these objects in his mouth would serve no fruitful purpose and would prevent him from displaying such an object as proof that he had cured the patient. Without incontrovertible evidence, he would not be able to convince the patient and his family that he had effected the cure and must be paid.' <sup id="cite_ref-393" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-393">[393]</a></sup>//'The ability of the shaman to suck depends largely upon the quantity and strength of his own tsentsak, of which he may have hundreds. His magical darts assume their supernatural aspect as spirit helpers when he is under the influence of natemä, and he sees them as a variety of zoomorphic forms hovering over him, perching on his shoulders, sticking out of his skin, and helping to suck the patient's body. He must drink tobacco water every few hours to “keep them fed” so that they will not leave him. He will also appear, to another shaman under the influence of natemä, to have a gold, red and greenish “crown” above his head (see Plate 24).' <sup id="cite_ref-394" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-394">[394]</a></sup>//'The curing shaman must also deal with any pasuk that may be in the patient's vicinity for the purpose of casting more darts. He drinks additional amounts of natemä in order to see them and engages in tsentsak duels with them if they are present. While the pasuk is enclosed in iron armor, the shaman himself has his own armor, composed of his many tsentsak. As long as he is under the influence of [Page 164] natemä, these magical darts cover his body as a protective shield, and are on the lookout for any enemy tsentsak headed towards their master. When these tsentsak see such a missile coming, they immediately close up together at the point where the enemy dart is attempting to penetrate, and thereby repel it.' <sup id="cite_ref-395" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-395">[395]</a></sup>//'If the curer finds tsentsak entering the body of his patient after he has killed the pasuk, he suspects the presence of a wakanï bird. The shaman drinks maikua (Datura), since it is more powerful than natemä, as well as tobacco water, and silently sneaks into the forest to hunt and kill the bird with tsentsak. When he succeeds, the curer returns to the patient's home, blows all over the house to get rid of the “atmosphere” created by the numerous tsentsak sent by the bird, and completes his sucking of the patient. Even after all the tsentsak are extracted, the shaman may remain another night at the house to suck out any “dirtiness” (pahuri) still inside. In the cures which I have witnessed, this sucking is a most noisy process, accompanied by deep, but dry, vomiting.' <sup id="cite_ref-396" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-396">[396]</a></sup>//'After sucking out a tsentsak, the shaman puts it into a little container. He does not swallow it, because it is not his own magical dart and would therefore kill him. Later, he throws the tsentsak into the air, and it flies back to the shaman who sent it originally into the patient. Tsentsak also fly back to a shaman at the death of a former apprentice who had originally received them from him. Besides receiving “old” magical darts unexpectedly in this manner, the shaman may have tsentsak thrown at him by a bewitcher. Accordingly, shamans constantly drink tobacco water at all hours of the day and night. Although the tobacco water is not truly hallucinogenic, it produces a narcotized state, which is believed necessary to keep one's tsentsak ready to repel any other magical [Page 165] darts. A shaman does not even dare go for a walk without taking along the green tobacco leaves with which he prepares the juice that keeps his spirit helpers alert. Less frequently, but regularly, he must drink natemä for the same purpose and to keep in touch with the supernatural reality.' <sup id="cite_ref-397" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-397">[397]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ napin ♥</b> The third Tsantsa feast to be celebrated after a successful head-hunting raid. A tsantsa is the shrunken head of an enemy. 'When this first tsantsa feast is concluded, the head-takers return to their separate homes and begin to make preparations for the two subsequent feasts which each of them will host individually. Since enormous quantities of beer and food are consumed at these celebrations, the head-taker normally has to clear additional garden space for his wife or wives to plant to assure an ample supply of manioc. The first of these two celebrations, named suamak, normally takes place no sooner than after a year, to allow time for garden clearing and the growth of a large mature crop of manioc as well as for the raising of pigs to help provide meat for the feasting. Also the host may delay the celebration in order to build a new, larger house more worthy of the occasion. Thus, often two or three years pass before a man gives the feast. To assure a large quantity of wild game for the feast, men who are close relatives of the host separately go hunting long distances from the house for a period of approximately nine or ten days before the opening day. Lacking any mnemonic system for keeping count of the days accurately, they are able to time their return to coincide with the arrival of the guests at the feast with the aid of an ingenious device which might be called a “banana clock.” That is, the host gives each hunter a green cooking banana or plantain from the same stalk, which is one of those hanging in the house to ripen for the feast. When each of the hunters' plantains is almost fully ripe, they know that it is time to return for the celebration. The host also sends or delivers plantains from the same stalk to those invited guests living at some distance so that they, too, will arrive at the same time. The celebration lasts five days and is followed, about a month later, by the third feast (napiη). This is the largest of all, with the head-taker supplying food and drink for six days. He must be able to provide plentifully for all his guests or the [Page 191] occasion would cause him to lose, rather than to gain, prestige. Guests at the feasts usually number up to about 125-150 persons, and mainly come from the local neighborhoods. Since these last two feasts, totalling eleven days of unremitted hospitality, must be supplied from the same harvest, often little food remains in the gardens at the end of the celebrations. Not uncommonly, the host and his family are forced onto a relatively meager diet for some months thereafter until the gardens can recover from their near-exhaustion. Sometimes such a large amount of the gardens' supply of manioc is consumed that the host is unable to follow the second feast with the third. There is no stigma attached to this, but it means that the tsantsa never undergoes its final modification.' <sup id="cite_ref-485" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-485">[485]</a></sup>//'The primary purpose of the tsantsa feast, from the Jívaro point of view, is not supernatural, although that is recognized by them as a secondary purpose; but is to acquire prestige, friendship, and obligations through being recognized as [Page 192] an accomplished warrior and, through the feasting, by being a generous host to as many neighbors as possible. One informant observed, “The desire of the Jívaro for heads is like the desire of the whites for gold.”' <sup id="cite_ref-486" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-486">[486]</a></sup>//Harner provides a general idea of the atmosphere during the festival: 'Since the head-taking raids are directed at the Achuara and others “who live far away,” the victim whose head is the focal point of the celebration normally is viewed by everyone in the head-taker's neighborhood as an “enemy.” Accordingly, it is the unique occasion for the members of many Jívaro households to get together to reaffirm their common identity and unity. Under such circumstances, it is not surprising that the tsantsa feast is participated in with great joy and a cumulative sense of euphoria. Of course, the huge quantities of strong manioc beer help, as do the ritual circle dances (wainči), which continue from dusk to dawn night after night. The bountiful quantities of meat and garden foods add to the sense of well-being. It is also a time of relative sexual license, as I had occasion to observe during the one tsantsa feast that I attended. Liaisons are arranged discreetly by both unmarried and married individuals, who rendezvous in the forest surrounding the house. The supernatural and ritual aspects of the celebration contribute to the sense of solidarity by inhibiting fights between men who have become drunk and who may try to even a score with old enemies or with men who have offended them at the feast by flirting with their wives. That is, it is believed that the avenging soul (muisak) of the murdered man will be able to take advantage of any disruption of the binding ritual by escaping from the tsantsa to cause an ongoing fight to culminate in a death. Permitting the muisak to escape from the tsantsa would also be an affront to the host, since it would negate the major supernatural purpose of the feast, that is, to utilize the power of the muisak, while it is resident in the [Page 193] tsantsa, for increasing the power of women who are members of the host's household. Therefore, any fight that erupts is immediately stopped by the other male participants, led by the male master of ceremonies, the wea, who usually has been selected for the role because of his considerable ritual knowledge and prestige. Fights between females at the feast, although less common, are similarly halted by the women, led by the female ceremonial leader, the uhá, who is selected on a basis similar to that for the wea. Thus the religious, ritual, and social pressures of the occasion operate to make it the safest, most euphoric, and largest social gathering known to the Jívaro. It is not surprising, therefore, that the tsantsa feasts tend to be viewed by the Jívaro as the pinnacles of their social lives. It is also expectable, given the ethos of killing and counter-killing, that this, the greatest celebration, centers around the indisputable evidence of a triumph over a common enemy. The intimate interaction between the euphoria of the celebration and the awareness of the murdered enemy is illustrated by this tsantsa feast circle dance song: Today, today, let us greet the dawn only playing. Today, today, let us greet the dawn only playing. Čuwi5 tells me Čuwi tells me We are going to greet the dawn playing. Čuwi tells me Čuwi tells me We are going to greet the dawn.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Soul Pilgrimage ♥</b> 'A person is not born with an arutam soul. Such a soul must be acquired, and in certain traditional ways. The acquisition of this type of soul is considered to be so important to an adult male's survival that a boy's parents do not expect him to live past puberty without one. Women sometimes obtain arutam souls, but it is not considered so essential for them. One reason is that intra-tribal killing, the most common source of violent death, is primarily directed at adult males rather than at women and children. A boy begins seeking an arutam soul at about the age of six years. Accompanied most commonly by his father, he makes a pilgrimage to the sacred waterfall in his neighborhood. This is always the highest waterfall within a few days' travel. It is believed to be the rendezvous of these souls or spirits which wander about as breezes, scattering the spray of the long cascade. During the day, the vision seekers “bathe” in the waterfall by striding back and forth under its cold and drenching canopy, actually walking between the downpour and the cliff from which it is dropping. They walk naked and shivering, and in some danger from falling logs which may  be swept over the cliff with the current. Each paces with the aid of a magical balsa wood staff carved for the occasion, and chants, “tau, tau, tau, ” continually. By night the pilgrims  sleep near the falls in a simple lean-to. Here they fast, drink tobacco water (made by steeping green tobacco leaves in cold water), and await the appearance of an arutam. They may keep up this fasting, “bathing,” and tobacco water drinking for as long as five days. If unsuccessful, they return home to make another attempt at a later date. More likely, though, is that before the five days are up, one of the members of the party will have recourse to drinking hallucinogenic maikua (Datura arborea) juice. Usually this is a person who has failed to see an arutam  on a previous vision quest or who feels an urgent need to see one without delay. Upon acquiring this arutam  soul, the person feels a sudden power surge into his body, accompanied by a new self-confidence. The arutam soul is supposed to increase a person's power in the most general sense. This power, called   kakarma, is believed to increase one's intelligence as well as simple physical strength, and also to make it difficult for the soul possessor to lie or commit other dishonorable acts.  His newly acquired power increases his resistance to contagious disease to some degree, but most important, it makes it impossible for him to die as a result of any physical violence or sorcery. Most of his relatives and acquaintances shortly know that he has acquired an arutam   soul simply because of the change in his personality. For example, he especially tends to speak with great forcefulness.' <sup id="cite_ref-527" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-527">[527]</a></sup>//'Maikua, of which the Jívaro distinguish and use six different types, is recognized by them to be the most powerful and also the most dangerous hallucinogen with which they are familiar. [...] Preparations from these plants tend to produce, in large dosages, a state of excitation, delirium, and hallucinations, followed by a state of narcosis. The Jívaro obtain their hallucinatory experiences with Datura by ingesting the raw juice of the green bark of the stems. The effects begin to be felt within about three to four minutes of ingestion, probably because of the fast action of the atropine. The arutam seeker ingesting the Datura juice is never supposed to do it without the presence of an adult who is not taking the drug. It is the responsibility of the latter to provide psychological support or, in Jívaro terms, to “encourage” him, and also to hold him down, if necessary, during the first phase of the intoxication, when the drug taker tends to become delirious and is in danger of running off into the forest in his highly agitated state and, as a result, [Page 138] possibly falling off a cliff or into a river and drowning. The other pilgrims in the party do not take the substance themselves, partially so that they can protect the maikua drinker from running off. They also believe that an arutam is not likely to come to a vision seeker if he is a coward, which would be evidenced if he were unwilling to take Datura alone and enter the normally invisible world unaccompanied.' <sup id="cite_ref-528" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-528">[528]</a></sup>//'If the arutam seeker is fortunate, he will awaken at about midnight to find the stars gone from the sky, the earth trembling, and a great wind felling the trees of the forest amid thunder and lightning. To keep from being blown down, he grasps a tree trunk and awaits the arutam. Shortly the arutam appears from the depths of the forest, often in the form of a pair of large creatures. The particular animal forms can vary considerably, but some of the most common arutam include a pair of giant jaguars fighting one another as they roll over and over towards the vision seeker, or two anacondas doing the same. Often the vision may simply be a single huge disembodied human head or a ball of fire drifting through the forest towards the arutam seeker. When the apparition arrives to within twenty or thirty feet, the Jívaro must run forward and touch it, either with a small stick or his hand. This is said to require a good deal of courage, and sometimes the person flees the arutam instead. But if he does run forward and touch the vision, it instantly explodes like dynamite and disappears. Upon thus achieving success in encountering an arutam, the person returns to his house, but tells no one that he has accomplished the purpose of his quest. Arriving home, he goes alone to sleep that night on the bank of the nearest river. After nightfall, the soul of the same arutam he touched comes to him as he dreams. His dream visitor is in the form of an old Jívaro man who says to him, “I am your ancestor. Just as I have lived a long time, so will you. Just as I have [Page 139] killed many times, so will you.” Without another word the old man disappears and immediately the arutam soul of this unknown ancestor enters the body of the dreamer, where it is lodged in his chest.' <sup id="cite_ref-529" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-529">[529]</a></sup>//'Upon acquiring this arutam soul, the person feels a sudden power surge into his body, accompanied by a new self-confidence.

Most of his relatives and acquaintances shortly know that he has acquired an arutam soul simply because of the change in his personality. For example, he especially tends to speak with great forcefulness. However, he must not tell anyone that he has acquired such a soul, or it will desert him. When one has thus obtained an arutam soul, he generally is seized with a tremendous desire to kill, and it is ordinarily only a matter of a few months before he joins a killing expedition. If he is a young boy, he will accompany his father. The rare women who possess arutam souls kill primarily by means of poisoning food or manioc beer. Jívaro killing expeditions usually attack the victim's house just before dawn. Late in the afternoon of the day prior to the attack, the expedition halts in the forest about a quarter of a mile from its intended objective. There, in their concealed location, the participants must “declare” what kind of arutam they had each seen. The younger men form a circle around several of the most experienced killers, who then ask [Page 140] each man in turn to describe the arutam that he had seen. As each man, young and old, does this, the soul of his arutam leaves his body forever, to roam the forest again as a wind, for arutam souls “are satisfied with one killing.” The departing arutam souls reportedly generate winds, thunder, and lightning. Eventually, at some time in the indefinite future, each soul is expected once more to enter the body of another Jívaro.' <sup id="cite_ref-530" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-530">[530]</a></sup></dd>

[...] Preparations from these plants tend to produce, in large dosages, a state of excitation, delirium, and hallucinations, followed by a state of narcosis. The Jívaro obtain their hallucinatory experiences with Datura by ingesting the raw juice of the green bark of the stems. The effects begin to be felt within about three to four minutes of ingestion, probably because of the fast action of the atropine. The arutam seeker ingesting the Datura juice is never supposed to do it without the presence of an adult who is not taking the drug. It is the responsibility of the latter to provide psychological support or, in Jívaro terms, to “encourage” him, and also to hold him down, if necessary, during the first phase of the intoxication, when the drug taker tends to become delirious and is in danger of running off into the forest in his highly agitated state and, as a result, [Page 138] possibly falling off a cliff or into a river and drowning. The other pilgrims in the party do not take the substance themselves, partially so that they can protect the maikua drinker from running off.

</p><p>Note: Shuar political authority was informal and decentralized: 'Each community is politically independent with its own headman. Each is also located four or more kilometers from their nearest neighboring community. The community is made up of patrilineally and affinally related individuals, traditionally consisting of from 80 to 300 people (30 to 40 people in the twentieth century), living in one house called a JIVARIA. For defensive purposes, this house is built on a steep hill usually at the upper end of a stream. The house itself is approximately 13 meters by 26 meters in size, elliptical in shape, and has a thatched roof. In times of war, two or more communities united to fight a common enemy, as was the case when the Spanish attempted to conquer them.' <sup id="cite_ref-576" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-576">[576]</a></sup> 'Local groups among the Jivaro are spread over such a large area in the Amazon basin that each has become completely independent of each other. Each JIVARIA or community is autonomous, although alliances between several JIVARIAS in a district may take place, but mostly for the purposes of warfare. There is a tendency for several communities to be related to each other by blood and affinal kinship ties because of the rule of local exogamy, which requires that a man marry a woman from a village other than his own. There is, therefore, a more or less natural grouping of contiguous communities into a loose tribe, but cooperation among them is almost entirely limited to collaboration in feuds or in head-hunting against more distant and unrelated communities (Service, 1958: 190).' <sup id="cite_ref-577" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-577">[577]</a></sup> 'The Jivaro lack any formal political organization, although an informal form of leadership is found in the role of individuals referred to as UNYÄ  ("big" or "old" men) or KAKARAM   ("powerful" or "powerful ones") who are renown as killers in feuds or war, or exercise important shamanistic powers in the community. These individuals acquire their reputation in the community by being old enough to have grandchildren, and are friendly, honest, and generous in dealing with others in the society. Because of these characteristics the UNYÄ   or KAKARAM   are believed to possess great ARUTAM   soul power and the ability to curse to death anyone who incurs their anger. Generally most neighborhoods have at least one or two UNYÄ   as well as a few superior shamans who provide protection for their relatives or other individuals with whom they are on friendly terms.' <sup id="cite_ref-578" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-578">[578]</a></sup> “From the statements I have previously made as to the distribution of the Jibaro tribes it appears that their social organization is loose. In fact, the whole people is split up into a great number of tribes which in their turn are sub-divided into smaller clans or septs comprising a few families closely related to one another by blood. These sub-tribes do not form village communities; each family inhabits its own big communal house (héa), but these are not situated close to one another, they lie scattered here and there in the virgin forest. Generally one has to march for one or several hours to arrive at the next house. Each Jibaro house forms in fact a separate and independent social, political, and economic unit with its own household, its own plantations in the vicinity of the house, and its own ruler or chief, the oldest family father who, at any rate in time of peace, is not controlled by anybody. It is much the same feature that we meet in other parts of tropical South America, where the impenetrable virgin forests necessarily lead to social disintegration, which is further increased by the general anti-social tendencies of the Indians. The state of things found among the Jibaros, however, is in many respects unique.' <sup id="cite_ref-579" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-579">[579]</a></sup> Accordingly, social control was informal and based on witchcraft beliefs and revenge: 'Fear of sorcery and incurring the wrath of the UNYÄ act as restraining elements of social control in the Jivaro community. In this society the code of lex talionis holds true so that anti-social acts directed against members of the community will result in assured retaliation by the victim's family. Thus, the fear of reprisal also acts as a means of aggression control in the society.' <sup id="cite_ref-580" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-580">[580]</a></sup> Some more prominent leaders emerged as well: 'Four or five years ago there was a strong chief on the Upano River named Tuki, known to the Ecuadoreans as José Grande. In the manner previously described, all of the curakas from Macas on the Upano River to Mendez on the Paute River became subchiefs under him until he was generally recognized as the strongest of all of the Jivaro curakas. However, he was beginning to grow old by this time and some of his subcurakas were strong men in their own right. About 2 years ago, Ambusha, who had been gradually gaining in power and becoming famous for his head-hunting activities, split off with his own group, taking several curakas and their men with him. A little later Utita did the same thing. At the time of the writer's visit (1931), although Tuki was recognized by the Government of Ecuador as being head chief of the Macas-Mendez region, actually he had lost all power excepting that over his own family group and was in reality no more than a capito. These divisions of the organization, if it may be termed such, took place apparently without any ill-feeling or formal announcements.' <sup id="cite_ref-581" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-581">[581]</a></sup> The Shuar bartered with whites and other Amerindians: 'The commercial activities of the Jivaro are very restricted. In the early days of European contact hogs and chickens were raised for sale to those of European background. Salt, a rare commodity in the region, was gathered in clay pots from a few brackish springs in the area, allowed to evaporate, and the resulting hardened ball of salt used in exchange transactions with neighboring tribal groups. The Jivaro were famous for the shrinking of the human heads () of their enemies (actually only the skin). Passing out of Jivaro country through a series of exchanges, these heads eventually found their way into the hands of traders who brought them down the Amazon to Para where they were sold. Soon the traders had a burgeoning trade in these items, and the Jivaro were hard-put to keep up with the demand. The Indians were by no means particular as to whose head was used, and advance orders were taken and filled. Eventually this native "industry" was brought to a halt by the Ecuadorian and Peruvian governments although by the late twentieth century life-like replicas of the heads made from animal skins are still being sold commercially.' <sup id="cite_ref-582" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-582">[582]</a></sup> While Ecuador claimed nominal sovereignty over the Oriente, bureaucratic control was low and no regular governmental officials were present in Shuar communities. The Shuar themselves did not recognize Ecuadorian rule: '“Rising in the western foothills of the Cordillera Oriental the Rio Zamora flows through Loja, where it is joined by the Rio Malacatos. ( ) Ten miles farther north, in confluence with the Rio de las Juntas, it breaks through the Andes and enters the province of Oriente, the Amazon region of Ecuador, comprising a northwestern part of the basin of the great river. Vast in extent and largely unknown, unexplored and unmapped, this territory has always been a bone of contention among the republics of Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru. But although the particular portion of it which I visited, on a reconnaissance of the Rio Zamora, was supposedly under the sovereignty of Ecuador, no evidence of administrative authority was to be found there, nor did the savages of the Jíbaro tribe who live there acknowledge allegiance to the government at Quito.”' <sup id="cite_ref-583" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-583">[583]</a></sup> The same seems to be true for missionary attempts: 'Since all attempts to win back the lost territories by force of arms were unsuccessful, there was recourse to the cross in order to bend the Indians again under the yoke of slavery by this apparently gentle means. The missionaries were successful among some tribes, but the Jívaros turned away all intruders and have maintained their freedom up to our time. Only the small mission of Mácas, inhabited by the Quichua Indians, is located in their territory, and neither the secular clergy nor the Jesuit fathers, who have alternately tried their luck there, have been successful in making converts.' <sup id="cite_ref-584" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-584">[584]</a></sup> Accordingly, many of the below variables have been imported from the Spanish colonial-period data sheet and may be irrelevant to the Shuar.
</p><p>Note 2: Harners provides a description of the history of the relationship between Shuar and frontier settlements. Trade was important: 'The Viceroy of Peru soon sent a new expedition of colonists, as well as soldiers, into the Jívaro territory. These newcomers engaged in trade with the Indians, made peace pacts with them, and began to exploit the rich placer gold deposits of the Paute, Zamora and Upano rivers and their tributaries. Experiencing great success in their gold mining activities, the Spaniards founded two major communities, described [Page 18] as “cities,” in 1552: Logroño, possibly at the junction of the Río Paute (and Río Upano) with the Río Zamora; and Sevilla del Oro, probably somewhere on the middle Río Upano.' <sup id="cite_ref-585" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-585">[585]</a></sup> 'With this initiation of trade relations between the two groups, Jívaro families soon migrated north from the Río Paute Valley to settle in the previously uninhabited land between the Rí Paute and Macas. These migrants began to act as middlemen in the barter of Jívaro products for steel machetes and other goods. The Macabeos at first traded mainly to secure pigs and salt obtained by the Jívaro from saline springs, but soon also began to attend tsantsa celebrations to purchase lard obtained from pigs slaughtered by the Jívaro on such occasions. As a consequence of their attendance at the feasts, the Macabeos started also to purchase tsantsa. This was the beginning of the “shrunken head” trade, and the first reported examples of tsantsa reached the outside world at about this time.' <sup id="cite_ref-586" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-586">[586]</a></sup> 'By 1956, the Jívaro west of the Cordillera de Cutucú were largely in direct, continuous contact with the Spanish-speaking Ecuadorian population. In this frontier zone, white soldiers and police had imposed the national laws on the Jívaro. White settlers had seized almost all of the land except that protected by the missionaries, and employed the Jívaro in wage labor. Missionaries, with the backing of law enforcement agencies, were putting the Jívaro children in boarding schools and enculturating them to the new, alien way of life. This direct, unremitted contact was tending to acculturate the frontier Jívaro to the national Ecuadorian way of life and the direction of the trend was towards eventual assimilation.' <sup id="cite_ref-587" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-587">[587]</a></sup> 'In contrast, the Jívaro beyond the frontier of colonization still were not yet in continuous first-hand contact with the white population at the time of the investigator's original fieldwork in 1956-57, and these are the people whose culture will be described here. Their territory, mainly east of the Cordillera de Cutucú, had been rarely, if ever, penetrated by any Spanish expedition or later group of Ecuadorian colonizers. This mountain barrier, which is traversed by an arduous [Page 35] journey of two or more days on foot, still discourages white penetration into the eastern interior.' <sup id="cite_ref-588" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-588">[588]</a></sup> 'Cases of contact between the interior Jívaro and whites are all very recent and highly localized in their occurrence. The largest intrusion was made by the Royal Dutch Shell Oil Corporation in the early 1940's as part of an ill-fated oil exploration project. The company constructed a small airstrip near the Río Pangui in the easternmost part of the Jívaro territory, but within a few years abandoned the site altogether when explorations failed to reveal economically exploitable oil deposits in the region. The project involved relatively limited interaction with the Jívaro.' <sup id="cite_ref-589" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-589">[589]</a></sup> 'Localities within the interior Jívaro territory which had been least touched by white contact in 1956-57 are the ones from which the data are primarily drawn for the present study. These areas include: the upper Río Cangaimi; the upper Río Cusuimi; the upper Río Mangosiza; and the region between the Río Chiguasa and the headwaters of the Río Yuquipa and the Río Macuma (see Map 2). The last region is west of the northern end of the Cutucú mountain barrier [Page 36] but was still largely isolated from colonists' incursions by the swift, bridgeless Río Upano and its often deep canyon (see Plate 1), which acted as an obstacle throughout its length to eastward migration by the horse-dependent settlers. These localities (excluding missions and their environs) had, together with other areas of minimal white penetration, an estimated total population of approximately 2,205 persons. Beginning with Chapter II, the present tense will be used to describe interior Jívaro culture as it existed at the time of the original fieldwork. In other words, the “ethnographic present” is 1956-57.' <sup id="cite_ref-590" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-590">[590]</a></sup> 'The relative isolation of the interior Jívaro, however, had not prevented them from obtaining increasing quantities of machetes, steel axes, and shotguns. By means of neighborhood-to-neighborhood relays of native trading partners, these products of Western civilization were passed from the frontier Jívaro into the most remote parts of the tribal territory. All of the interior Jívaro neighborhoods were thus supplied with steel cutting tools, firearms, and ammunition without the necessity of coming into direct contact with the white population.' <sup id="cite_ref-591" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-591">[591]</a></sup> 'The growth of this trade in recent decades had been made possible by the increasing involvement of the frontier Jívaro in the Ecuadorian socio-economic structure. The frontier Jívaro, primarily through their employment by Ecuadorians in manual labor, had acquired quantities of factory-manufactured goods. At the same time, there was a shortage of native-type goods among the Jívaro on the frontier, partially because of the near exhaustion of local game, which supplied feathers and bird skins for ornament. The interior Jívaro, in contrast, had a much more abundant supply of game and native-produced goods, but a greater scarcity of steel cutting [Page 40] tools and firearms. These complementary inequalities in supply and demand between the frontier and interior Jívaro formed the basis for the trade that supplied the latter with European-type technological items. Such technological items constituted almost the sole aspects of Western civilization that had been adopted by the interior Jívaro in 1956-57.' <sup id="cite_ref-592" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-592">[592]</a></sup> 'The main variables introduced into interior Jívaro culture during the period studied were Western-manufactured trade goods, especially machetes, axes, and guns. Some machetes were acquired by the frontier Jívaro near Macas about a hundred years ago, but very few reached the interior Jívaro by intra-tribal trade until the turn of the century, and even these were so scarce and valued that their blades were each split into fragments to permit their utilization by several households. The more efficient steel blade fragments were at first used in the same manner as the aboriginal stone axe heads, each machete piece being mounted into a wooden handle. After the 1930's, however, machetes became sufficiently abundant so that the need to split the blades into small fragments was eliminated. They also largely replaced by then the traditional palm-wood “machetes” used in cutting down garden weeds. Despite their fair degree of availability at the present time, steel machetes are still highly valued and are used for many years, long after they have lost their handles and have become worn down to a fraction of their former size. Today they are considered to be utterly indispensable tools by the Jívaro, who also have been able to acquire some single-bitted steel axe-heads, although in much smaller numbers than the machetes.' <sup id="cite_ref-593" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-593">[593]</a></sup> 'Economic factors are also playing an important role in the rapidly changing life of these people. The Jívaro, as has been indicated earlier in this book, have long been anxious to acquire the technology and dress of Western civilization. Now that air transportation is available to most of the tribe, the only limit on Jívaro aspirations to acquire manufactured goods is their ability to acquire cash. Their model for such success is the cattle-raising Ecuadorian colonists west of the Cordillera de Cutucú, who have now converted most of the bottomlands of the Río Upano Valley into pasture with the aid of Jívaro labor. Air transport has made it profitable to ship beef to the highlands from there, and three local competing airlines are involved in the lucrative trade. Some Jívaro, with the strong encouragement of both Catholic and Protestant missionaries, are now clearing pasture land also for themselves to raise cattle and are starting to achieve success in acquiring substantial cash in exchange for beef.' <sup id="cite_ref-594" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-594">[594]</a></sup> 'Still, the Jívaro have clearly opted for adaptation to a Western life style and seem to have no brief for maintaining traditional features of their native life simply for tradition's sake alone. While they undoubtedly will wish to preserve and even revive certain aspects of their old culture within the context of a desire for an ethnic identity, at this moment in time they seem to be basically focused upon acquiring what they discern as the most positive features of the whites' life. Whether their eventual fate will parallel that of their North American counterparts, who went through similar attempts at adaptation in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, or whether the twentieth century will be kinder, is a question that remains to be answered.' <sup id="cite_ref-595" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-595">[595]</a></sup> Accordingly, frontier and interior Jivaro were affected differently.
</p><p>Note 3: Salazar describes the evolution of the 'colonization frontier' in the Ecuadorian period and the Shuar response to this development. His data on Shuar self-advocacy mostly refer to the second half of the 20th century, though: 'This paper is intended to contribute to the understanding of the interethnic contact that has come about as a result of government-sponsored projects of colonization in the southern lowlands of Ecuador. The information gathered so far indicates that the Shuar Indians (“Frontier Jívaro” and “Interior Jívaro”; Harner 1972) are very concerned about the ever-growing colonization that is seriously threatening the existence of their culture. The Shuar offered relatively successful resistance to white penetration in the past, but since the beginning of the present century they have undergone strong acculturation through missionaries and colonists.' <sup id="cite_ref-596" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-596">[596]</a></sup> 'Confronted with a future that may bring only marginal integration into the national society, the Shuar have adopted new strategies to counteract the advance of the colonization frontier. These strategies have found their best expression in the establishment of the Shuar Federation (Federación de Centros Shuaras), which has been functioning since 1964. This organization represents a rather unexpected move on the part of the Shuar, considering the independence, individualism, egalitarianism, and even hostility among groups that have characterized Shuar social structure. In any case, the federation has shown that the Shuar are capable of great achievements, despite the discrimination with which they are faced in contemporary Ecuador.' <sup id="cite_ref-597" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-597">[597]</a></sup> 'The purpose of this paper is to describe the framework of the Federación Shuar and to analyze its meaning in the context of colonization in lowland Ecuador. Particular attention will be given to the factors involved in its formation, as well as to the possible explanation for the adoption of an administrative system that clearly differs from the traditional social organization of the Shuar.' <sup id="cite_ref-598" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-598">[598]</a></sup> 'This paper is an attempt to document the formation and activities of the Shuar Federation in the context of colonization in lowland Ecuador. It is known that the process of frontier settlement generates a series of strategies through which the parties involved in contact try to work out a physical and social adjustment to the new situation. However, no colonizing process can be fully understood without bearing in mind the fact that colonization frontiers represent the encounter of a technologically high energy-utilization society (the pioneers) with another possessing a low energy-utilization level (the native population). The nature of the societies involved in contact is a very important feature, for it makes possible the establishment of a colonialist relationship between the pioneers and the native population, usually involving forced acculturation of the latter by the former. Naturally, this relationship can only be possible when contact becomes more or less permanent, in other words, when a “frontier system” is established in the new territory. According to Wells (1973:6), a frontier system is a “dynamic social network” characterized by the following features: “1) one or more foci, 2) territorial expansion of the people from the focus, 3) direct contact by the expanding people with culturally distinct societies, and 4) the presence of a single communication network which links the various societies of the frontier system together.”' <sup id="cite_ref-599" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-599">[599]</a></sup> 'In the light of this definition, the colonization frontier in the southern lowlands of Ecuador can be said to constitute a true frontier system with three foci represented by the highland towns of Riobamba, Cuenca, and Loja. The expansion of these foci into the lowlands has been marked by two distinct types of human migration: an early one characterized by squatters (spontaneous colonization), and a more recent one characterized by individuals participating in government-sponsored projects of colonization (semidirected colonization). As to the social background, most settlers are poor and lower-middle-class whites (actually mestizos), although recently Indian families have also resettled on the colonization frontier. In any case, through migration, the pioneer society came into contact with the native population of the lowlands, in this case with the Shuar, a tribal society with a tropical forest culture pattern. Interethnic contact has generated a communication network of economic and cultural nature, which has resulted in the imposition of the colonist population as the dominant society in the lowlands. The economic network has been established [Page 610] by means of western manufactured goods acquired by colonists at the highland foci of colonization and eventually passed to the Shuar in exchange for labor, land, and handicrafts.' <sup id="cite_ref-600" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-600">[600]</a></sup> 'The importance given by the Shuar to the technologically superior western goods has become the source of economic exploitation and dependence, intensified by the simultaneous acculturative process that the Shuar have undergone. It is interesting to note that, while the economic network flows both ways, that is, from the colonist to the Shuar and vice versa, the “cultural network” flows in only one direction, from the colonist to the Shuar. Colonists have not become acculturated; rather, it is their culture that is being imposed upon the Shuar people. The colonization frontier of contemporary eastern Ecuador represents a situation of “interethnic friction” inasmuch as one culture tends to reject the other (Cardoso de Oliveira 1972:79).' <sup id="cite_ref-601" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-601">[601]</a></sup> 'For more than half a century the Shuar have undergone the consequences of the colonialist expansion of the highland society into the lowlands. The expansion has now reached a critical point, aggravated by the lack of a consistent government policy aimed at the safeguard of Shuar culture. It is for this reason that the establishment of the federation constitutes in Shuar history a landmark in the struggle against complete assimilation by the national society.' <sup id="cite_ref-602" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-602">[602]</a></sup> 'It appears that acculturation among the Shuar (particularly the Upano group, which is the promoter of the federation) has been extensive enough to favor the adoption of administrative structures characteristic of western institutions. Indeed, with the establishment of the frontier system, the Shuar became continuously involved in the administrative framework of Ecuadorian institutions. Although it is probable that the Salesian mission imposed the structure of the federation on the Shuar, it was always possible for the Shuar to reject such structure, had it proved operationally detrimental to their socioeconomic situation.' <sup id="cite_ref-603" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-603">[603]</a></sup> 'Despite the achievements of the federation, it can be said that the colonist society will continue to exert its dominance over the Shuar. And yet, should the government display a serious interest in the economic development of the Shuar and modify its colonization policies, the lowlands could become the setting of an unprecedented parallel development of both pioneer and Indian societies that would, eventually, lead the Shuar to a fair integration in Ecuadorian society. Unfortunately, nothing like this can be foreseen in the near future, for integration of native Amazonian peoples involves not only economic development but also a complete change of attitude on the part of the dominant society. This attitude change from denigration of everything indio to respect for indigenous cultures is unlikely under the social conditions of contemporary Ecuador.' <sup id="cite_ref-604" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-604">[604]</a></sup> 'As of now, the Shuar Federation seems to be struggling in a maze of contradictory forces. The ambiguity of government policies is helping the federation in some ways but preventing its development in others. The Salesian mission is advocating self-sufficiency for the Shuar but at the same time is attempting to keep steady control over the federation. Finally, a small group of Shuar intellectuals has become [Page 612] critical of the federation, questioning basic issues whose resolution is crucial for the future development of the Shuar organization. This new attitude has obviously created some confusion among the Shuar. Today, within the federation, there are Shuar favoring mission patronage and those against it, some who favor collaboration with CREA and those who refuse it, some who favor the revival of the traditional culture and those who want modernization. Indeed, the future of the federation itself is seen by many to lie in the prompt resolution of these contradictions.' <sup id="cite_ref-605" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-605">[605]</a></sup> 'A factor that must be clearly understood is the Shuar determination to survive as both an ethnic and a cultural entity. This factor is already felt in the rest of the country and, eventually, could make a difference if further constraints operate negatively for the Shuar. In fact, considered in a wider perspective, the Shuar Federation constitutes one of the most active and promising Indian movements in Ecuador. Although Ecuadorian Indians have not yet been able to present a unified front so as to become an influential force in Ecuadorian society, it is apparent that interindigenous communication has greatly increased in the last decades. In this context the Shuar experience represents an example to be followed, for the Shuar are, so far, the winners of a struggle where other Indian groups have failed. Indeed, in a national perspective the Shuar have become the potential leaders of a pan-Ecuadorian movement of Indian liberation.' <sup id="cite_ref-606" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-606">[606]</a></sup>

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from military ♣ absent ♥</b> Shuar military organization was informal, given the political autonomy of local groups: 'The Jivaro lack any formal political organization, although an informal form of leadership is found in the role of individuals referred to as UNYÄ  ("big" or "old" men) or KAKARAM   ("powerful" or "powerful ones") who are renown as killers in feuds or war, or exercise important shamanistic powers in the community. These individuals acquire their reputation in the community by being old enough to have grandchildren, and are friendly, honest, and generous in dealing with others in the society. Because of these characteristics the UNYÄ   or KAKARAM   are believed to possess great ARUTAM   soul power and the ability to curse to death anyone who incurs their anger. Generally most neighborhoods have at least one or two UNYÄ   as well as a few superior shamans who provide protection for their relatives or other individuals with whom they are on friendly terms.' <sup id="cite_ref-607" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-607">[607]</a></sup> 'Each community is politically independent with its own headman. Each is also located four or more kilometers from their nearest neighboring community. The community is made up of patrilineally and affinally related individuals, traditionally consisting of from 80 to 300 people (30 to 40 people in the twentieth century), living in one house called a JIVARIA. For defensive purposes, this house is built on a steep hill usually at the upper end of a stream. The house itself is approximately 13 meters by 26 meters in size, elliptical in shape, and has a thatched roof. In times of war, two or more communities united to fight a common enemy, as was the case when the Spanish attempted to conquer them.' <sup id="cite_ref-608" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-608">[608]</a></sup> 'Their society is thus based on the family and the blood tie. Only such sub-tribes as recognize some sort of consanguinity display a feeling of solidarity: the rest, although they speak the same language, are looked upon, not only as outsiders, but as downright natural enemies, a feature which will be further illustrated in the part dealing with their wars. It is as a rule between the different sub-tribes that the wars of extermination have occurred.' <sup id="cite_ref-609" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-609">[609]</a></sup> “There is no permanent chief for the different geographical groups. (Each cluster of houses is named after the rivulets where they are situated, as for instance the Patucas, the Yurupazas, the Yaupis.) The family head is the highest authority and his power is limited to the members of his house. Only in time of war are chiefs appointed for larger units, but their power is provisional and confined to the war-period only.” <sup id="cite_ref-610" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-610">[610]</a></sup> Warriors were accordingly male members of feuding communities: 'The terrible custom demands ever new, ever more victims, all security must disappear, every individual constantly lives in danger of being ambushed; there is a general and permanent state of war. Hence the arrangement of the houses, one door of which can be used for flight, while the battle rages at the other; hence the customs mentioned at the beginning in connection with approaching a dwelling, for the protection of which, in addition, a pack of half-wild dogs are kept. A quarrel between two families must lead to battles between whole tribes; larger groups of tribes become hostile to one another; war and battle become customary, a man's lifework. A longer period of quiet, of peace, must be unbearable for such a nation of warriors. Ambitious, bold leaders will easily find companions for joint war expeditions; the neighboring nations are attacked and plundered. Thus, these Indians are carrying on among themselves a war of annihilation which must gradually bring about their own downfall. Severe depopulation is already noticeable in the region of the Jívaros, and it is being accelerated by epidemics, of the diseases introduced by the Europeans, which appear with great violence at times.' <sup id="cite_ref-611" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-611">[611]</a></sup> Warfare was deeply connected to headhunting: 'The primary motivation for warfare is to secure as many human heads as possible from an alien tribe, and secondarily to capture women. The acquisition of territory had never been a motive for engaging in warfare. The war party, consisting of approximately thirty or forty men, is recruited from the community itself or from friendly neighborhoods nearby, and is usually led by the  or  as war leader or chief. Actual warfare consists of preliminary ceremonies involving ritualized chanting, surprise attacks against one or two enemy houses, the killing and decapitation of the inhabitants or the occasional capture of a girl or woman as an extra wife, and the preparation of the  on the return to the home village. Unlike many of the warlike Amazon tribes captives are not tortured or sacrificed, nor is cannibalism practiced.' <sup id="cite_ref-612" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-612">[612]</a></sup> Killing was connected to notions of power, leadership and spiritual strength: 'Given such factors as the absence of any formal political organization and even of unilineal descent groups, as well as the pervasive belief in shamanistically induced illness and death, the conflict over women, and the emphasis on retaliatory sanctions and feuding, it should not be unexpected that the leaders in Jívaro society are outstanding killers and shamans. Although such leadership is informal, almost all neighborhoods have at least one or two noted killers and a few superior shamans who are valued as protectors of their neighboring relatives, or at least of those with whom they are on friendly terms. Such leadership roles are earned and, in the case of the killers, acquired literally through life-and-death struggle.' <sup id="cite_ref-613" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-613">[613]</a></sup> 'It should be noted that the personal security which the Jívaro believe comes from killing has some social reality. A man who has killed repeatedly, called kakaram or “powerful one,” is rarely attacked because his enemies feel that the protection provided him by his constantly replaced souls would make any assassination attempt against him fruitless.' <sup id="cite_ref-614" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-614">[614]</a></sup> 'The outstanding killer gains prestige and social obligations by helping the people of his locality in eliminating their enemies. Such a man is known as kakaram (“powerful” or “powerful one”) and also, if he is not too youthful, as untä. He is believed to possess an unusually large quantity of arutam soul power (see pp. 135-43) (kakarma), which both protects him from death and is believed to drive him on to kill as often as possible.' <sup id="cite_ref-615" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-615">[615]</a></sup> 'The majority of young men interviewed expressed a strong desire to kill, not only to avenge the deaths of their fathers and other close relatives, but to acquire the arutam soul power and to become known, respected, and feared as kakaram. To be acknowledged as a kakaram, a man must have killed at least several persons. Early in his career, he does this by going on killing expeditions led by others, whether intra-tribal assassinations or the inter-tribal raids for tsantsa. As his reputation increases, he will eventually successfully organize and lead such an expedition himself, usually the more modest local assassination raid, probably against a specific personal enemy who is believed to have, sometime earlier, caused the death of a member of his immediate family. If he acquits himself well in achieving this assassination, especially as evidenced by firing the first shot into the victim, word will rapidly spread of his apparent power. Soon he will be approached by other men to lead them in killing expeditions against their own enemies. The kakaram, anxious to further his reputation as well as to gain additional supernatural power through more killing, rarely refuses such a request, even though it often means that he is agreeing to kill a fellow tribesman who is not even an enemy of his.' <sup id="cite_ref-616" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-616">[616]</a></sup> 'As his reputation grows, the kakaram tends to dress himself in elaborate feather headdresses and ornaments when visiting other households or receiving guests (see frontispiece). [Page 113] Similarly, he adopts an ever more forceful and aggressive style of speaking when receiving visitors, meeting others on the trail, or in visiting other men. He conveys the impression of being invincible in every aspect of his public demeanor. If he has a son, he encourages him to become a killer also, and instructs him to the extent of taking him on assassination expeditions even as early as the age of six or seven years. Although such a young boy will not yet take part in the actual killing, the father brings him up to the corpse after the murder and has him fire into it, with the father helping him hold the gun. The wives of such a kakaram also are expected to outperform other women in making superior pottery vessels, doing garden work and other aspects of household labor. Informants said that one way of looking at this was that since a kakaram is very much a man, his wives have to be very much women.' <sup id="cite_ref-617" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-617">[617]</a></sup> 'While a kakaram is greatly feared by his enemies, his neighbors usually look upon him as a great local asset, a deterrent to attacks upon them, and refer to him with the title untä (big) before his name, especially if he is also hospitable to them and generous with beer and food. Of course, there may be neighbors who get into a quarrel or other dispute with him; but they almost always move as soon as possible to another region of the tribe where they feel more secure. Thus there is a continual process of self-selection in terms of the composition of any neighborhood, which tends to reduce local antagonisms.' <sup id="cite_ref-618" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-618">[618]</a></sup> Accordingly, local leaders and 'war-chiefs' often combined 'political' and 'military' duties rather than separating them: 'A war or head-taking raid is organized by a man who is a kakaram, and who has previously killed at least three or four persons. When the kakaram decides to lead a raid, he asks an untä of his neighborhood, ideally a respected, elderly man who has also killed at least several times, to be the wea, or master of ceremonies, for the first celebration when the raiding party returns. If he agrees, the kakaram and some of the expected participants in the expedition build the wea a new, large house for the feast, the construction work usually taking some months.' <sup id="cite_ref-619" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-619">[619]</a></sup> 'The kakaram warrior sponsoring the raid is usually the expedition leader or chief. There is no special title for this role, beyond the usual untä. There may be two war chiefs if the neighborhood that has the biggest representation in the expedition is one other than the sponsor's. The war leader(s) is theoretically expected to be strictly obeyed by the other members of the party, but only for the duration of the expedition, while it is in hostile territory.' <sup id="cite_ref-620" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-620">[620]</a></sup> “The dignity of a chieftain is hereditary in a relative sense, in so far that the son of a chief is generally elected chief in time of war after his father has died or grown decrepit. This, however, can only take place if he has proved a valiant and skilled warrior and has killed enemies. No Jibaro is selected as a chief if he has not killed at least one enemy. The Jibaros have absolute faith in the heritability of prominent qualities, and ascribe extraordinary importance to education and the power of example. The son of a great chief, they say, must necessarily also become an able warrior because he is, as it were, a direct continuation of his father, has received a careful education for the deeds of war, and has always had the good example of his great father before his eyes.” <sup id="cite_ref-621" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-621">[621]</a></sup> In times of war against external colonial enemies or larger tribal groups, different communities combined to attach themselves to a common war-leader, although even those arrangements were fluid and often of an ad hoc character. [Family and local leadership can extend beyond a single community; even in recent times (ie, in the 1970’s) some particularly strong men could aggregate several local groups in conflict situations and lead quite large war parties; however, such positions were unstable and rarely lasted more than a few years, if that. The definition of ‘community’ is highly relative; ‘my people’ can include a single nuclear family, or a collection of communities temporarily coalesced around a powerful war leader.] “Among the Jibaros as we have seen each family father is theoretically absolute ruler over his house people, and in times of peace there is no recognized common chief even within the tribe, and still less any exercising authority over several tribes. The Jibaros have not even a proper name for a chief. The word capitu, which is sometimes used, is borrowed from the Spanish and is used principally to denote a white man of importance. It is only in times of war that a chieftainship exists; that is to say, during those great wars of extermination which are carried out against other Jibaro tribes. Such a temporary chief of war is generally only called únta, ‘the old one’, because the chiefs are nearly always old, experienced men who have killed many enemies and captured many heads. The small blood-feuds within the tribe, on the other hand, have a more private character and as a rule are not fought out under the leadership of a common chief.” <sup id="cite_ref-622" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-622">[622]</a></sup> 'Still, as appears from their history, there have been occasions when they have been able to overcome the natural antipathy separating them from one another, and to unite against a common enemy. This common enemy has been the white man, who has so often threatened [184] the liberty of the people; but the alliances, such as that for instance in 1599, have been exceptional and wholly due to the influence of a single, eminent personality.”' <sup id="cite_ref-623" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-623">[623]</a></sup> 'When a whole tribe, or perhaps several tribes together, prepare a war against one or more other tribes, the first thing done is to elect a common chief. He should be an elderly, experienced man, who has taken part in several wars, killed many enemies, and celebrated at least one victory feast. The rest of the warriors, who are generally younger men, swear him unlimited obedience. During the time the expedition is planned and the preparations are made, the warriors, and especially the chief, repeatedly drink maikoa or natéma to consult the spirits. They pay great attention to their dreams, even to those not produced under the direct influence of the narcotic drinks, tell them to each other, and discuss their possible significance. Only if they believe that they have received favourable answers and all omens are good are measures taken to carry out the war plan conceived. Meanwhile they try, through spies, to acquire as accurate a knowledge as possible about everything concerning the enemy: how many houses there are in the tract, how many fighting men in each house, if the houses are fortified, if the [283] men are well armed, and especially if they have firearms. All these and similar details the spies investigate by making trips into the country of the enemy and by stealing at night to the houses. Everything is prepared with the greatest secrecy possible, so that the enemy is caught unprepared, for otherwise he will have time to take measures of defence that may defeat the whole undertaking.” <sup id="cite_ref-624" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-624">[624]</a></sup> “The authority of the chief elected for a war is very great. It is he alone who arranges everything for the expedition planned, who decides [268] about the time for and the mode of making the attack, and the younger warriors oblige themselves to obey him in everything. But as soon as a war has been carried to a successful end the power of the chief ceases, and he has, in spite of the great repute he always enjoys, no more authority or right to decide about the doings of his tribesmen than any other family-father among the Jibaros.” <sup id="cite_ref-625" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-625">[625]</a></sup> Ecuador recognized some of those leaders as regional head-chiefs: 'Four or five years ago there was a strong chief on the Upano River named Tuki, known to the Ecuadoreans as José Grande. In the manner previously described, all of the curakas from Macas on the Upano River to Mendez on the Paute River became subchiefs under him until he was generally recognized as the strongest of all of the Jivaro curakas. However, he was beginning to grow old by this time and some of his subcurakas were strong men in their own right. About 2 years ago, Ambusha, who had been gradually gaining in power and becoming famous for his head-hunting activities, split off with his own group, taking several curakas and their men with him. A little later Utita did the same thing. At the time of the writer's visit (1931), although Tuki was recognized by the Government of Ecuador as being head chief of the Macas-Mendez region, actually he had lost all power excepting that over his own family group and was in reality no more than a capito. These divisions of the organization, if it may be termed such, took place apparently without any ill-feeling or formal announcements.' <sup id="cite_ref-626" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-626">[626]</a></sup></dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from legislative ♣ absent ♥</b> There was no legislative as a separate institution as there was no state structure (see above).</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from judiciary ♣ absent ♥</b> The Shuar did not have a formal legal system or judicial authorities, but had established means of responding to offenses. The murder of a kinsman had to be avenged: “When a murder committed by tribesman is to be avenged, the social morality of the Jibaros requires that the punishment shall be meted out with justice, in so far that for one life which has been taken only one life should be taken in retaliation. Thereupon the blood-guilt is atoned for (tumáshi akérkama) and the offended family is satisfied. Consequently, if a Jibaro Indian wishes to avenge the murder of his brother, it may well happen that he, if the slayer himself cannot be caught and punished, will assassinate his brother or father instead of him, but he does not take the life of more than one member of the family, even if he has an opportunity of killing more. If he, for instance, killed not only the murderer himself but also one of his brothers, this would awaken indignation in the whole tribe, and it would be considered just that the family thus offended in its turn should take revenge. The blood guilt in such a case has passed to the original avenger. This principle, which requires that there shall be justice in the retaliation so that life is weighed against life, in itself of course has a tendency to limit blood-revenge. It happens, however, in many cases, and especially when supposed witchery is in question, that the person accused of the crime does not admit the guilt, but asserts that he and his family are innocently persecuted by the relatives of the dead. If then he or a member of his family is murdered, his relatives try, in their turn, to take revenge, and so on, in which case the blood feud tends to become prolonged indefinitely.” <sup id="cite_ref-627" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-627">[627]</a></sup> 'It seemed that this uncle had beaten one of his wives to death because she was unfaithful to him, and the woman's family, considering the treatment unnecessarily harsh, had murdered the husband in retaliation. Custom said that Kuashu's family must also take a life in order to satisfy the Jivaro sense of justice. With this end in view, the spirit of revenge was being kept alive, and almost every day the young men of the household were reminded of the duty which they inherited, and how they would eventually have to kill some member of the family who were responsible for their uncle's murder. The boys listened to the tale, which had already been told them hundreds of times, with as much interest as if they had never heard it before, and I wondered how long it would be ere their hands were stained with blood. They saw nothing wrong in this lust for vengeance, for their creed taught them that the spirit [158] of their uncle could not rest till justice had been meted out. Furthermore, if they failed to take reprisals they and their families would be the ones to suffer.” ' <sup id="cite_ref-628" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-628">[628]</a></sup> Accordingly, kinsmen of the dead, not judges, decided on the course of action taken: 'Feuding or warfare is endemic among the Jivaro. Because of the retaliatory nature of legal sanctions in the society, the application of avenging action frequently initiates long and drawn out hostilities between two groups of kinsmen. This pattern of repeated application of sanctions by two families against one another is a dominant preoccupation especially among the interior Jivaro. These feuds may be formally ended by payment to the deceased's relatives, or when one of the eldest men on one side is killed, or when each group of kinsmen has lost a man.' <sup id="cite_ref-629" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-629">[629]</a></sup> 'After this idea took hold, they travelled upriver to the settlement of Bupátä's brother Ungúmï, a húndach, or old one (although he is only about 45 years old), to seek his counsel. Then, Santü journeyed further north into Ecuador to converse with Mukwíngü, the mother's brother of Bupátä and Ungúmï. Such counsel, as I have indicated, forms an important part of the protocol that characterizes the pattern of Achuarä hostilities. Not every death attributed to sorcery is avenged, especially in the case of young children. But, once a homicide is committed in retaliation for perceived sorcery-related deaths, it inevitably calls forth a revenge raid sometime in the future on the part of close relatives-brothers-in-law or sons-in-law, usually-of the victims. Should their retaliation prove successful, close relatives of the person whose death initiated the feud also become obligated to avenge the more recent killing. Each successive death draws greater numbers of relatives into the feud on each side, and more and more lives are placed in jeopardy.' <sup id="cite_ref-630" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-630">[630]</a></sup> Deaths by sorcery had to be avenged as well: 'Fear of sorcery and incurring the wrath of the  act as restraining elements of social control in the Jivaro community. In this society the code of lex talionis holds true so that anti-social acts directed against members of the community will result in assured retaliation by the victim's family. Thus, the fear of reprisal also acts as a means of aggression control in the society.' <sup id="cite_ref-631" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-631">[631]</a></sup> '“Their unbounded sense of liberty and their desire to be independent, not only of the whites but also of each other, is one of the reasons why they do not live in villages but each family separately, for in this way conflicts are more easily avoided. It may for instance, happen that the swine, the most important domestic animals, who during the day are allowed to roam about freely in the forest, penetrate into the plantations of a neighbouring family and devastate the crops. The owner gets angry and claims compensation for the damage done. In this way quarrels easily arise which may develop into bloody fights; at any rate there arises general discord and distrust between the two families. Some time later it may happen that one or more members of either family fall ill with some of the diseases which the Jibaros ascribe to witchcraft. When trying to find out the author of the evil the head of that family is most likely to attribute it to the malicious art of a neighbour with whom he has had such a quarrel. If the patient dies he has recourse to divination by means of the narcotic natéma, which generally leads to his suspicions of the neighbour being confirmed. The family's sense of justice as well as the duty to the deceased now require that revenge shall be taken, and the supposed wizard is assassinated. This murder naturally awakens the desire for blood-revenge on the part of the family thus outraged, and so a blood-feud is begun, which, as is easily understood, has a tendency to make itself permanent.”' <sup id="cite_ref-632" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-632">[632]</a></sup> The obligation to avenge could be avoided through gift-giving: 'It seems that among the Aguaruna Indians there is a sort of murderous revenge, though there is a way of redeeming it with gifts. I heard of one case where the gift of a blowgun eliminated the necessity for bloody revenge.' <sup id="cite_ref-633" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-633">[633]</a></sup>  Blood vengeance was less common within families, conflicts being solved informally: “Though, as we have seen, among the Jibaros blood-revenge takes place with regard to members of the same sub-tribe, this is not so when a crime is committed within the family. Among these Indians it sometimes occurs that a man kills his brother, if the latter, for instance, has seduced his wife or bewitched one of his children. But in this case blood-revenge is not generally taken, inasmuch as the natural avengers-that is, the father and the remaining brothers-abstain from carrying it out. ‘It is enough that one member of our family has died,’ they say, ‘why should we deprive ourselves of one more?’ The slayer is consequently pardoned. The absence of blood-revenge in a case like this is due to the natural sympathy which the avengers feel for the slayer, as well as to the consideration that by killing him they would only harm themselves, by weakening the power and influence of the family.” <sup id="cite_ref-634" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-634">[634]</a></sup> Stirling describes recognized extenuating circumstances: 'In the same way the Jivaros are apt to recognize extenuating circumstances in other cases where the crime has not been caused willfully, as for example, when someone in a state of intoxication or under the influence of a narcotic drink has been the cause of another person's death. However, in any of these instances, if the [117] evildoer refuses to pay to compensation asked, he becomes liable to blood revenge.”' <sup id="cite_ref-635" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-635">[635]</a></sup> The material suggests that the Shuar population was not pulled into the settler court system during the early Ecuadorian period: 'In retaliation against the ravages of whites and such client Amerindians, some groups responded with force to outside efforts at settlement and exploitation. It is within this general context that our knowledge of Jivaroan warfare and feuding exists; and while the causes of Jívaro conflict lie in good part in environmental factors, this wider dimension cannot be ignored. As early as 1599, the Jivaroan peoples razed the Spanish gold-mining towns of eastern Ecuador and northern Peru, where Indian labor was being exploited to fill the coffers of the Spanish crown (Harner 1972:18-26; Izaguirre 1929/XI:11-19). Subsequent efforts to reestablish mines in the same region of the upper Santiago River have been persistently resisted as have other forms of occupation that have been attempted in or around the Jivaroan area.' <sup id="cite_ref-636" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-636">[636]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Customary mechanism ♣ absent ♥</b> Authority was fluid and informal: “There is no permanent chief for the different geographical groups. (Each cluster of houses is named after the rivulets where they are situated, as for instance the Patucas, the Yurupazas, the Yaupis.) The family head is the highest authority and his power is limited to the members of his house. Only in time of war are chiefs appointed for larger units, but their power is provisional and confined to the war-period only.” <sup id="cite_ref-637" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-637">[637]</a></sup> See also above. Warfare was an important means of attaining prestige: “Among the Jibaros as we have seen each family father is theoretically absolute ruler over his house people, and in times of peace there is no recognized common chief even within the tribe, and still less any exercising authority over several tribes. The Jibaros have not even a proper name for a chief. The word capitu, which is sometimes used, is borrowed from the Spanish and is used principally to denote a white man of importance. It is only in times of war that a chieftainship exists; that is to say, during those great wars of extermination which are carried out against other Jibaro tribes. Such a temporary chief of war is generally only called únta, ‘the old one’, because the chiefs are nearly always old, experienced men who have killed many enemies and captured many heads. The small blood-feuds within the tribe, on the other hand, have a more private character and as a rule are not fought out under the leadership of a common chief.” <sup id="cite_ref-638" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-638">[638]</a></sup> “The authority of the chief elected for a war is very great. It is he alone who arranges everything for the expedition planned, who decides [268] about the time for and the mode of making the attack, and the younger warriors oblige themselves to obey him in everything. But as soon as a war has been carried to a successful end the power of the chief ceases, and he has, in spite of the great repute he always enjoys, no more authority or right to decide about the doings of his tribesmen than any other family-father among the Jibaros.” <sup id="cite_ref-639" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-639">[639]</a></sup> 'When a whole tribe, or perhaps several tribes together, prepare a war against one or more other tribes, the first thing done is to elect a common chief. He should be an elderly, experienced man, who has taken part in several wars, killed many enemies, and celebrated at least one victory feast. The rest of the warriors, who are generally younger men, swear him unlimited obedience. During the time the expedition is planned and the preparations are made, the warriors, and especially the chief, repeatedly drink maikoa or natéma to consult the spirits. They pay great attention to their dreams, even to those not produced under the direct influence of the narcotic drinks, tell them to each other, and discuss their possible significance. Only if they believe that they have received favourable answers and all omens are good are measures taken to carry out the war plan conceived. Meanwhile they try, through spies, to acquire as accurate a knowledge as possible about everything concerning the enemy: how many houses there are in the tract, how many fighting men in each house, if the houses are fortified, if the [283] men are well armed, and especially if they have firearms. All these and similar details the spies investigate by making trips into the country of the enemy and by stealing at night to the houses. Everything is prepared [Page 282-283] with the greatest secrecy possible, so that the enemy is caught unprepared, for otherwise he will have time to take measures of defence that may defeat the whole undertaking.” <sup id="cite_ref-640" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-640">[640]</a></sup> Successful war-leaders were considered to be spiritually powerful: 'It should be noted that the personal security which the Jívaro believe comes from killing has some social reality. A man who has killed repeatedly, called kakaram or “powerful one,” is rarely attacked because his enemies feel that the protection provided him by his constantly replaced souls would make any assassination attempt against him fruitless.' <sup id="cite_ref-641" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-641">[641]</a></sup> 'The outstanding killer gains prestige and social obligations by helping the people of his locality in eliminating their enemies. Such a man is known as kakaram (“powerful” or “powerful one”) and also, if he is not too youthful, as untä. He is believed to possess an unusually large quantity of arutam soul power (see pp. 135-43) (kakarma), which both protects him from death and is believed to drive him on to kill as often as possible.' <sup id="cite_ref-642" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-642">[642]</a></sup> 'The majority of young men interviewed expressed a strong desire to kill, not only to avenge the deaths of their fathers and other close relatives, but to acquire the arutam soul power and to become known, respected, and feared as kakaram. To be acknowledged as a kakaram, a man must have killed at least several persons. Early in his career, he does this by going on killing expeditions led by others, whether intra-tribal assassinations or the inter-tribal raids for tsantsa. As his reputation increases, he will eventually successfully organize and lead such an expedition himself, usually the more modest local assassination raid, probably against a specific personal enemy who is believed to have, sometime earlier, caused the death of a member of his immediate family. If he acquits himself well in achieving this assassination, especially as evidenced by firing the first shot into the victim, word will rapidly spread of his apparent power. Soon he will be approached by other men to lead them in killing expeditions against their own enemies. The kakaram, anxious to further his reputation as well as to gain additional supernatural power through more killing, rarely refuses such a request, even though it often means that he is agreeing to kill a fellow tribesman who is not even an enemy of his.' <sup id="cite_ref-643" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-643">[643]</a></sup> 'As his reputation grows, the kakaram tends to dress himself in elaborate feather headdresses and ornaments when visiting other households or receiving guests (see frontispiece). [Page 113] Similarly, he adopts an ever more forceful and aggressive style of speaking when receiving visitors, meeting others on the trail, or in visiting other men. He conveys the impression of being invincible in every aspect of his public demeanor. If he has a son, he encourages him to become a killer also, and instructs him to the extent of taking him on assassination expeditions even as early as the age of six or seven years. Although such a young boy will not yet take part in the actual killing, the father brings him up to the corpse after the murder and has him fire into it, with the father helping him hold the gun. The wives of such a kakaram also are expected to outperform other women in making superior pottery vessels, doing garden work and other aspects of household labor. Informants said that one way of looking at this was that since a kakaram is very much a man, his wives have to be very much women.' <sup id="cite_ref-644" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-644">[644]</a></sup> 'While a kakaram is greatly feared by his enemies, his neighbors usually look upon him as a great local asset, a deterrent to attacks upon them, and refer to him with the title untä (big) before his name, especially if he is also hospitable to them and generous with beer and food. Of course, there may be neighbors who get into a quarrel or other dispute with him; but they almost always move as soon as possible to another region of the tribe where they feel more secure. Thus there is a continual process of self-selection in terms of the composition of any neighborhood, which tends to reduce local antagonisms.' <sup id="cite_ref-645" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-645">[645]</a></sup> Hospitality was also important: 'If a man clears the forest without the aid of neighbors, he tends to make small clearings at different times, while the rarer communal effort results in one large clearing. Whether [Page 49] the garden area is in a single clearing or several, its total size is heavily influenced by the number of wives a man has to cultivate the fields. A household with one wife tends to have a garden of about 50,000 square feet, while a second spouse increases the area to about 65,000, and a third to approximately 75,000. The areal increases are usually not simple multiples of the number of wives because the demand for food and beer to feed visitors tends to lag behind the increments in additional wives. These figures vary, of course, according to the consumption demands of the household, its number of visitors, and the industry of its inhabitants. A man who wishes to gain prestige may clear garden areas of larger size for each of his wives. In such a case, a household in which there are two wives may sometimes have a total garden of 100,000 square feet or more.' <sup id="cite_ref-646" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-646">[646]</a></sup> 'The importance of wives in producing food and beer goes far beyond the subsistence requirements of the household itself. Plural wives assure a surplus production which will make possible adequate entertainment of visitors from other households. The Jívaro place a high value on drinking beer and eating (perhaps in that order), so that one's status in a neighborhood is greatly affected by one's generosity with beer and food. No one can expect to have many friends unless he is a good host; and he cannot easily meet the requirements of good hospitality without plural wives as a labor force.' <sup id="cite_ref-647" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-647">[647]</a></sup> 'The most successful party-givers and hosts are those men who, in addition to having two or three wives to produce large amounts of beer and food, are respected by their neighbors for: their renown as killers in feuds and war, or as shamans; the achievement of age sufficient to have grand-children; and who are generally of an amiable, honest, and magnanimous nature when dealing with those who are not their enemies. A man who has most of these characteristics is referred to by the term untä, which means “big” or “old” man. The demeanor of party participants in the house of such a man tends to be more circumspect and respectful of the master of the house, and excesses such as arguments and brawls seem to occur less often.' <sup id="cite_ref-648" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-648">[648]</a></sup> 'While the concept of the untä ideally encompasses all of the characteristics described, it is possible to acquire the designation with no formal qualifications other than simply having lived long enough to exhibit a few gray hairs and to have many grandchildren. Such an achievement receives respect as a sign of supernatural power, and an elderly untä of this sort is believed to have the ability to curse to death anyone who incurs his anger. No other kind of person is considered to possess this ability. Partly out of fear of being cursed, young men in the neighborhood assist him in land clearing and other tasks when he requests their aid. While the elderly untä's opinion is normally respected, he usually is not a real leader unless he is also outstanding as a killer, shaman, or good host. Thus the true “big men” are distinguished not only by longevity but by real leadership and generosity.' <sup id="cite_ref-649" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-649">[649]</a></sup> The 'power' of an individual was thus reflected in his material possessions: 'Posts, beams, roof and walls are all lashed firmly together with strips of inner tree bark. Proceeding painstakingly, a man usually constructs a large and impressive structure capable of withstanding not only the natural elements and enemy attack, but also critical evaluation by his neighbors. The size and quality of a man's house is regarded as a serious indication of his personal “power,” kakarma.' <sup id="cite_ref-650" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-650">[650]</a></sup> Sons of leaders were considered to inherit their capacities. However, this does not seem to imply a customary system of power transfer from father to son as individual achievement was still paramount: “The dignity of a chieftain is hereditary in a relative sense, in so far that the son of a chief is generally elected chief in time of war after his father has died or grown decrepit. This, however, can only take place if he has proved a valiant and skilled warrior and has killed enemies. No Jibaro is selected as a chief if he has not killed at least one enemy. The Jibaros have absolute faith in the heritability of prominent qualities, and ascribe extraordinary importance to education and the power of example. The son of a great chief, they say, must necessarily also become an able warrior because he is, as it were, a direct continuation of his father, has received a careful education for the deeds of war, and has always had the good example of his great father before his eyes.” <sup id="cite_ref-651" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-651">[651]</a></sup></dd>

<p><b>♠ State-level administrators ♣ absent ♥</b> There was no state structure. Note: Shuar political authority was informal and decentralized: 'Each community is politically independent with its own headman. Each is also located four or more kilometers from their nearest neighboring community. The community is made up of patrilineally and affinally related individuals, traditionally consisting of from 80 to 300 people (30 to 40 people in the twentieth century), living in one house called a JIVARIA. For defensive purposes, this house is built on a steep hill usually at the upper end of a stream. The house itself is approximately 13 meters by 26 meters in size, elliptical in shape, and has a thatched roof. In times of war, two or more communities united to fight a common enemy, as was the case when the Spanish attempted to conquer them.' <sup id="cite_ref-652" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-652">[652]</a></sup> 'Local groups among the Jivaro are spread over such a large area in the Amazon basin that each has become completely independent of each other. Each JIVARIA or community is autonomous, although alliances between several JIVARIAS in a district may take place, but mostly for the purposes of warfare. There is a tendency for several communities to be related to each other by blood and affinal kinship ties because of the rule of local exogamy, which requires that a man marry a woman from a village other than his own. There is, therefore, a more or less natural grouping of contiguous communities into a loose tribe, but cooperation among them is almost entirely limited to collaboration in feuds or in head-hunting against more distant and unrelated communities (Service, 1958: 190).' <sup id="cite_ref-653" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-653">[653]</a></sup> 'The Jivaro lack any formal political organization, although an informal form of leadership is found in the role of individuals referred to as UNYÄ  ("big" or "old" men) or KAKARAM   ("powerful" or "powerful ones") who are renown as killers in feuds or war, or exercise important shamanistic powers in the community. These individuals acquire their reputation in the community by being old enough to have grandchildren, and are friendly, honest, and generous in dealing with others in the society. Because of these characteristics the UNYÄ   or KAKARAM   are believed to possess great ARUTAM   soul power and the ability to curse to death anyone who incurs their anger. Generally most neighborhoods have at least one or two UNYÄ   as well as a few superior shamans who provide protection for their relatives or other individuals with whom they are on friendly terms.' <sup id="cite_ref-654" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-654">[654]</a></sup> “From the statements I have previously made as to the distribution of the Jibaro tribes it appears that their social organization is loose. In fact, the whole people is split up into a great number of tribes which in their turn are sub-divided into smaller clans or septs comprising a few families closely related to one another by blood. These sub-tribes do not form village communities; each family inhabits its own big communal house (héa), but these are not situated close to one another, they lie scattered here and there in the virgin forest. Generally one has to march for one or several hours to arrive at the next house. Each Jibaro house forms in fact a separate and independent social, political, and economic unit with its own household, its own plantations in the vicinity of the house, and its own ruler or chief, the oldest family father who, at any rate in time of peace, is not controlled by anybody. It is much the same feature that we meet in other parts of tropical South America, where the impenetrable virgin forests necessarily lead to social disintegration, which is further increased by the general anti-social tendencies of the Indians. The state of things found among the Jibaros, however, is in many respects unique.' <sup id="cite_ref-655" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-655">[655]</a></sup> Accordingly, social control was informal and based on witchcraft beliefs and revenge: 'Fear of sorcery and incurring the wrath of the UNYÄ act as restraining elements of social control in the Jivaro community. In this society the code of lex talionis holds true so that anti-social acts directed against members of the community will result in assured retaliation by the victim's family. Thus, the fear of reprisal also acts as a means of aggression control in the society.' <sup id="cite_ref-656" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-656">[656]</a></sup> Some more prominent leaders emerged as well: 'Four or five years ago there was a strong chief on the Upano River named Tuki, known to the Ecuadoreans as José Grande. In the manner previously described, all of the curakas from Macas on the Upano River to Mendez on the Paute River became subchiefs under him until he was generally recognized as the strongest of all of the Jivaro curakas. However, he was beginning to grow old by this time and some of his subcurakas were strong men in their own right. About 2 years ago, Ambusha, who had been gradually gaining in power and becoming famous for his head-hunting activities, split off with his own group, taking several curakas and their men with him. A little later Utita did the same thing. At the time of the writer's visit (1931), although Tuki was recognized by the Government of Ecuador as being head chief of the Macas-Mendez region, actually he had lost all power excepting that over his own family group and was in reality no more than a capito. These divisions of the organization, if it may be termed such, took place apparently without any ill-feeling or formal announcements.' <sup id="cite_ref-657" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-657">[657]</a></sup> The Shuar bartered with whites and other Amerindians: 'The commercial activities of the Jivaro are very restricted. In the early days of European contact hogs and chickens were raised for sale to those of European background. Salt, a rare commodity in the region, was gathered in clay pots from a few brackish springs in the area, allowed to evaporate, and the resulting hardened ball of salt used in exchange transactions with neighboring tribal groups. The Jivaro were famous for the shrinking of the human heads () of their enemies (actually only the skin). Passing out of Jivaro country through a series of exchanges, these heads eventually found their way into the hands of traders who brought them down the Amazon to Para where they were sold. Soon the traders had a burgeoning trade in these items, and the Jivaro were hard-put to keep up with the demand. The Indians were by no means particular as to whose head was used, and advance orders were taken and filled. Eventually this native "industry" was brought to a halt by the Ecuadorian and Peruvian governments although by the late twentieth century life-like replicas of the heads made from animal skins are still being sold commercially.' <sup id="cite_ref-658" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-658">[658]</a></sup> While Ecuador claimed nominal sovereignty over the Oriente, bureaucratic control was low and no regular governmental officials were present in Jivaro communities. The Shuar themselves did not recognize Ecuadorian rule: '“Rising in the western foothills of the Cordillera Oriental the Rio Zamora flows through Loja, where it is joined by the Rio Malacatos. ( ) Ten miles farther north, in confluence with the Rio de las Juntas, it breaks through the Andes and enters the province of Oriente, the Amazon region of Ecuador, comprising a northwestern part of the basin of the great river. Vast in extent and largely unknown, unexplored and unmapped, this territory has always been a bone of contention among the republics of Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru. But although the particular portion of it which I visited, on a reconnaissance of the Rio Zamora, was supposedly under the sovereignty of Ecuador, no evidence of administrative authority was to be found there, nor did the savages of the Jíbaro tribe who live there acknowledge allegiance to the government at Quito.”' <sup id="cite_ref-659" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-659">[659]</a></sup> The same seems to be true for missionary attempts: 'Since all attempts to win back the lost territories by force of arms were unsuccessful, there was recourse to the cross in order to bend the Indians again under the yoke of slavery by this apparently gentle means. The missionaries were successful among some tribes, but the Jívaros turned away all intruders and have maintained their freedom up to our time. Only the small mission of Mácas, inhabited by the Quichua Indians, is located in their territory, and neither the secular clergy nor the Jesuit fathers, who have alternately tried their luck there, have been successful in making converts.' <sup id="cite_ref-660" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-660">[660]</a></sup>

In times of war, two or more communities united to fight a common enemy, as was the case when the Spanish attempted to conquer them.' <sup id="cite_ref-661" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-661">[661]</a></sup> 'Local groups among the Jivaro are spread over such a large area in the Amazon basin that each has become completely independent of each other. Each JIVARIA or community is autonomous, although alliances between several JIVARIAS in a district may take place, but mostly for the purposes of warfare. There is a tendency for several communities to be related to each other by blood and affinal kinship ties because of the rule of local exogamy, which requires that a man marry a woman from a village other than his own. There is, therefore, a more or less natural grouping of contiguous communities into a loose tribe, but cooperation among them is almost entirely limited to collaboration in feuds or in head-hunting against more distant and unrelated communities (Service, 1958: 190).' <sup id="cite_ref-662" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-662">[662]</a></sup> 'The Jivaro lack any formal political organization, although an informal form of leadership is found in the role of individuals referred to as UNYÄ  ("big" or "old" men) or KAKARAM   ("powerful" or "powerful ones") who are renown as killers in feuds or war, or exercise important shamanistic powers in the community. These individuals acquire their reputation in the community by being old enough to have grandchildren, and are friendly, honest, and generous in dealing with others in the society. Because of these characteristics the UNYÄ   or KAKARAM   are believed to possess great ARUTAM   soul power and the ability to curse to death anyone who incurs their anger. Generally most neighborhoods have at least one or two UNYÄ   as well as a few superior shamans who provide protection for their relatives or other individuals with whom they are on friendly terms.' <sup id="cite_ref-663" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-663">[663]</a></sup> “From the statements I have previously made as to the distribution of the Jibaro tribes it appears that their social organization is loose. In fact, the whole people is split up into a great number of tribes which in their turn are sub-divided into smaller clans or septs comprising a few families closely related to one another by blood. These sub-tribes do not form village communities; each family inhabits its own big communal house (héa), but these are not situated close to one another, they lie scattered here and there in the virgin forest. Generally one has to march for one or several hours to arrive at the next house. Each Jibaro house forms in fact a separate and independent social, political, and economic unit with its own household, its own plantations in the vicinity of the house, and its own ruler or chief, the oldest family father who, at any rate in time of peace, is not controlled by anybody. It is much the same feature that we meet in other parts of tropical South America, where the impenetrable virgin forests necessarily lead to social disintegration, which is further increased by the general anti-social tendencies of the Indians. The state of things found among the Jibaros, however, is in many respects unique.' <sup id="cite_ref-664" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-664">[664]</a></sup> Accordingly, social control was informal and based on witchcraft beliefs and revenge: 'Fear of sorcery and incurring the wrath of the UNYÄ act as restraining elements of social control in the Jivaro community. In this society the code of lex talionis holds true so that anti-social acts directed against members of the community will result in assured retaliation by the victim's family. Thus, the fear of reprisal also acts as a means of aggression control in the society.' <sup id="cite_ref-665" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-665">[665]</a></sup> Some more prominent leaders emerged as well: 'Four or five years ago there was a strong chief on the Upano River named Tuki, known to the Ecuadoreans as José Grande. In the manner previously described, all of the curakas from Macas on the Upano River to Mendez on the Paute River became subchiefs under him until he was generally recognized as the strongest of all of the Jivaro curakas. However, he was beginning to grow old by this time and some of his subcurakas were strong men in their own right. About 2 years ago, Ambusha, who had been gradually gaining in power and becoming famous for his head-hunting activities, split off with his own group, taking several curakas and their men with him. A little later Utita did the same thing. At the time of the writer's visit (1931), although Tuki was recognized by the Government of Ecuador as being head chief of the Macas-Mendez region, actually he had lost all power excepting that over his own family group and was in reality no more than a capito. These divisions of the organization, if it may be termed such, took place apparently without any ill-feeling or formal announcements.' <sup id="cite_ref-666" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-666">[666]</a></sup> The Shuar bartered with whites and other Amerindians: 'The commercial activities of the Jivaro are very restricted. In the early days of European contact hogs and chickens were raised for sale to those of European background. Salt, a rare commodity in the region, was gathered in clay pots from a few brackish springs in the area, allowed to evaporate, and the resulting hardened ball of salt used in exchange transactions with neighboring tribal groups. The Jivaro were famous for the shrinking of the human heads () of their enemies (actually only the skin). Passing out of Jivaro country through a series of exchanges, these heads eventually found their way into the hands of traders who brought them down the Amazon to Para where they were sold. Soon the traders had a burgeoning trade in these items, and the Jivaro were hard-put to keep up with the demand. The Indians were by no means particular as to whose head was used, and advance orders were taken and filled. Eventually this native "industry" was brought to a halt by the Ecuadorian and Peruvian governments although by the late twentieth century life-like replicas of the heads made from animal skins are still being sold commercially.' <sup id="cite_ref-667" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-667">[667]</a></sup> While Ecuador claimed nominal sovereignty over the Oriente, bureaucratic control was low and no regular governmental officials were present in Shuar communities. The Shuar themselves did not recognize Ecuadorian rule: '“Rising in the western foothills of the Cordillera Oriental the Rio Zamora flows through Loja, where it is joined by the Rio Malacatos. ( ) Ten miles farther north, in confluence with the Rio de las Juntas, it breaks through the Andes and enters the province of Oriente, the Amazon region of Ecuador, comprising a northwestern part of the basin of the great river. Vast in extent and largely unknown, unexplored and unmapped, this territory has always been a bone of contention among the republics of Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru. But although the particular portion of it which I visited, on a reconnaissance of the Rio Zamora, was supposedly under the sovereignty of Ecuador, no evidence of administrative authority was to be found there, nor did the savages of the Jíbaro tribe who live there acknowledge allegiance to the government at Quito.”' <sup id="cite_ref-668" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-668">[668]</a></sup> The same seems to be true for missionary attempts: 'Since all attempts to win back the lost territories by force of arms were unsuccessful, there was recourse to the cross in order to bend the Indians again under the yoke of slavery by this apparently gentle means. The missionaries were successful among some tribes, but the Jívaros turned away all intruders and have maintained their freedom up to our time. Only the small mission of Mácas, inhabited by the Quichua Indians, is located in their territory, and neither the secular clergy nor the Jesuit fathers, who have alternately tried their luck there, have been successful in making converts.' <sup id="cite_ref-669" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-669">[669]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Multiple legal systems ♣ absent ♥</b> There was no state structure; instead, vengeange and other forms of informal settlement were common. Note: The Shuar did not have a formal legal system, but had established means of responding to offenses. The murder of a kinsman had to be avenged: '“When a murder committed by tribesman is to be avenged, the social morality of the Jibaros requires that the punishment shall be meted out with justice, in so far that for one life which has been taken only one life should be taken in retaliation. Thereupon the blood-guilt is atoned for (tumáshi akérkama) and the offended family is satisfied. Consequently, if a Jibaro Indian wishes to avenge the murder of his brother, it may well happen that he, if the slayer himself cannot be caught and punished, will assassinate his brother or father instead of him, but he does not take the life of more than one member of the family, even if he has an opportunity of killing more. If he, for instance, killed not only the murderer himself but also one of his brothers, this would awaken indignation in the whole tribe, and it would be considered just that the family thus offended in its turn should take revenge. The blood guilt in such a case has passed to the original avenger. This principle, which requires that there shall be justice in the retaliation so that life is weighed against life, in itself of course has a tendency to limit blood-revenge. It happens, however, in many cases, and especially when supposed witchery is in question, that the person accused of the crime does not admit the guilt, but asserts that he and his family are innocently persecuted by the relatives of the dead. If then he or a member of his family is murdered, his relatives try, in their turn, to take revenge, and so on, in which case the blood feud tends to become prolonged indefinitely.”' <sup id="cite_ref-670" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-670">[670]</a></sup> 'It seemed that this uncle had beaten one of his wives to death because she was unfaithful to him, and the woman's family, considering the treatment unnecessarily harsh, had murdered the husband in retaliation. Custom said that Kuashu's family must also take a life in order to satisfy the Jivaro sense of justice. With this end in view, the spirit of revenge was being kept alive, and almost every day the young men of the household were reminded of the duty which they inherited, and how they would eventually have to kill some member of the family who were responsible for their uncle's murder. The boys listened to the tale, which had already been told them hundreds of times, with as much interest as if they had never heard it before, and I wondered how long it would be ere their hands were stained with blood. They saw nothing wrong in this lust for vengeance, for their creed taught them that the spirit [158] of their uncle could not rest till justice had been meted out. Furthermore, if they failed to take reprisals they and their families would be the ones to suffer.” ' <sup id="cite_ref-671" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-671">[671]</a></sup> Accordingly, kinsmen of the dead, not judges, decided on the course of action taken: 'Feuding or warfare is endemic among the Jivaro. Because of the retaliatory nature of legal sanctions in the society, the application of avenging action frequently initiates long and drawn out hostilities between two groups of kinsmen. This pattern of repeated application of sanctions by two families against one another is a dominant preoccupation especially among the interior Jivaro. These feuds may be formally ended by payment to the deceased's relatives, or when one of the eldest men on one side is killed, or when each group of kinsmen has lost a man.' <sup id="cite_ref-672" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-672">[672]</a></sup> 'After this idea took hold, they travelled upriver to the settlement of Bupátä's brother Ungúmï, a húndach, or old one (although he is only about 45 years old), to seek his counsel. Then, Santü journeyed further north into Ecuador to converse with Mukwíngü, the mother's brother of Bupátä and Ungúmï. Such counsel, as I have indicated, forms an important part of the protocol that characterizes the pattern of Achuarä hostilities. Not every death attributed to sorcery is avenged, especially in the case of young children. But, once a homicide is committed in retaliation for perceived sorcery-related deaths, it inevitably calls forth a revenge raid sometime in the future on the part of close relatives-brothers-in-law or sons-in-law, usually-of the victims. Should their retaliation prove successful, close relatives of the person whose death initiated the feud also become obligated to avenge the more recent killing. Each successive death draws greater numbers of relatives into the feud on each side, and more and more lives are placed in jeopardy.' <sup id="cite_ref-673" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-673">[673]</a></sup> Deaths by sorcery had to be avenged as well: 'Fear of sorcery and incurring the wrath of the  act as restraining elements of social control in the Jivaro community.

It may for instance, happen that the swine, the most important domestic animals, who during the day are allowed to roam about freely in the forest, penetrate into the plantations of a neighbouring family and devastate the crops. The owner gets angry and claims compensation for the damage done. In this way quarrels easily arise which may develop into bloody fights; at any rate there arises general discord and distrust between the two families. Some time later it may happen that one or more members of either family fall ill with some of the diseases which the Jibaros ascribe to witchcraft. When trying to find out the author of the evil the head of that family is most likely to attribute it to the malicious art of a neighbour with whom he has had such a quarrel. If the patient dies he has recourse to divination by means of the narcotic natéma, which generally leads to his suspicions of the neighbour being confirmed. The family's sense of justice as well as the duty to the deceased now require that revenge shall be taken, and the supposed wizard is assassinated. This murder naturally awakens the desire for blood-revenge on the part of the family thus outraged, and so a blood-feud is begun, which, as is easily understood, has a tendency to make itself permanent.”' <sup id="cite_ref-675" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-675">[675]</a></sup> The obligation to avenge could be avoided through gift-giving: 'It seems that among the Aguaruna Indians there is a sort of murderous revenge, though there is a way of redeeming it with gifts.

But in this case blood-revenge is not generally taken, inasmuch as the natural avengers-that is, the father and the remaining brothers-abstain from carrying it out. ‘It is enough that one member of our family has died,’ they say, ‘why should we deprive ourselves of one more?’ The slayer is consequently pardoned. The absence of blood-revenge in a case like this is due to the natural sympathy which the avengers feel for the slayer, as well as to the consideration that by killing him they would only harm themselves, by weakening the power and influence of the family.”' <sup id="cite_ref-677" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-677">[677]</a></sup> Stirling describes recognized extenuating circumstances: 'In the same way the Jivaros are apt to recognize extenuating circumstances in other cases where the crime has not been caused willfully, as for example, when someone in a state of intoxication or under the influence of a narcotic drink has been the cause of another person's death. However, in any of these instances, if the [117] evildoer refuses to pay to compensation asked, he becomes liable to blood revenge.”' <sup id="cite_ref-678" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-678">[678]</a></sup> The material suggests that the Shuar population was not pulled into the settler court system during the early Ecuadorian period: 'In retaliation against the ravages of whites and such client Amerindians, some groups responded with force to outside efforts at settlement and exploitation. It is within this general context that our knowledge of Jivaroan warfare and feuding exists; and while the causes of Jívaro conflict lie in good part in environmental factors, this wider dimension cannot be ignored. As early as 1599, the Jivaroan peoples razed the Spanish gold-mining towns of eastern Ecuador and northern Peru, where Indian labor was being exploited to fill the coffers of the Spanish crown (Harner 1972:18-26; Izaguirre 1929/XI:11-19).

If then he or a member of his family is murdered, his relatives try, in their turn, to take revenge, and so on, in which case the blood feud tends to become prolonged indefinitely.”' <sup id="cite_ref-690" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-690">[690]</a></sup> 'It seemed that this uncle had beaten one of his wives to death because she was unfaithful to him, and the woman's family, considering the treatment unnecessarily harsh, had murdered the husband in retaliation. Custom said that Kuashu's family must also take a life in order to satisfy the Jivaro sense of justice. With this end in view, the spirit of revenge was being kept alive, and almost every day the young men of the household were reminded of the duty which they inherited, and how they would eventually have to kill some member of the family who were responsible for their uncle's murder. The boys listened to the tale, which had already been told them hundreds of times, with as much interest as if they had never heard it before, and I wondered how long it would be ere their hands were stained with blood. They saw nothing wrong in this lust for vengeance, for their creed taught them that the spirit [158] of their uncle could not rest till justice had been meted out. Furthermore, if they failed to take reprisals they and their families would be the ones to suffer.” ' <sup id="cite_ref-691" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-691">[691]</a></sup> Accordingly, kinsmen of the dead, not judges, decided on the course of action taken: 'Feuding or warfare is endemic among the Jivaro. Because of the retaliatory nature of legal sanctions in the society, the application of avenging action frequently initiates long and drawn out hostilities between two groups of kinsmen. This pattern of repeated application of sanctions by two families against one another is a dominant preoccupation especially among the interior Jivaro. These feuds may be formally ended by payment to the deceased's relatives, or when one of the eldest men on one side is killed, or when each group of kinsmen has lost a man.' <sup id="cite_ref-692" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-692">[692]</a></sup> 'After this idea took hold, they travelled upriver to the settlement of Bupátä's brother Ungúmï, a húndach, or old one (although he is only about 45 years old), to seek his counsel. Then, Santü journeyed further north into Ecuador to converse with Mukwíngü, the mother's brother of Bupátä and Ungúmï. Such counsel, as I have indicated, forms an important part of the protocol that characterizes the pattern of Achuarä hostilities. Not every death attributed to sorcery is avenged, especially in the case of young children. But, once a homicide is committed in retaliation for perceived sorcery-related deaths, it inevitably calls forth a revenge raid sometime in the future on the part of close relatives-brothers-in-law or sons-in-law, usually-of the victims. Should their retaliation prove successful, close relatives of the person whose death initiated the feud also become obligated to avenge the more recent killing. Each successive death draws greater numbers of relatives into the feud on each side, and more and more lives are placed in jeopardy.' <sup id="cite_ref-693" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-693">[693]</a></sup> Deaths by sorcery had to be avenged as well: 'Fear of sorcery and incurring the wrath of the  act as restraining elements of social control in the Jivaro community. In this society the code of lex talionis holds true so that anti-social acts directed against members of the community will result in assured retaliation by the victim's family. Thus, the fear of reprisal also acts as a means of aggression control in the society.' <sup id="cite_ref-694" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-694">[694]</a></sup> '“Their unbounded sense of liberty and their desire to be independent, not only of the whites but also of each other, is one of the reasons why they do not live in villages but each family separately, for in this way conflicts are more easily avoided. It may for instance, happen that the swine, the most important domestic animals, who during the day are allowed to roam about freely in the forest, penetrate into the plantations of a neighbouring family and devastate the crops. The owner gets angry and claims compensation for the damage done. In this way quarrels easily arise which may develop into bloody fights; at any rate there arises general discord and distrust between the two families. Some time later it may happen that one or more members of either family fall ill with some of the diseases which the Jibaros ascribe to witchcraft. When trying to find out the author of the evil the head of that family is most likely to attribute it to the malicious art of a neighbour with whom he has had such a quarrel. If the patient dies he has recourse to divination by means of the narcotic natéma, which generally leads to his suspicions of the neighbour being confirmed. The family's sense of justice as well as the duty to the deceased now require that revenge shall be taken, and the supposed wizard is assassinated. This murder naturally awakens the desire for blood-revenge on the part of the family thus outraged, and so a blood-feud is begun, which, as is easily understood, has a tendency to make itself permanent.”' <sup id="cite_ref-695" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-695">[695]</a></sup> The obligation to avenge could be avoided through gift-giving: 'It seems that among the Aguaruna Indians there is a sort of murderous revenge, though there is a way of redeeming it with gifts. I heard of one case where the gift of a blowgun eliminated the necessity for bloody revenge.' <sup id="cite_ref-696" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-696">[696]</a></sup>  Blood vengeance was less common within families, conflicts being solved informally: '“Though, as we have seen, among the Jibaros blood-revenge takes place with regard to members of the same sub-tribe, this is not so when a crime is committed within the family. Among these Indians it sometimes occurs that a man kills his brother, if the latter, for instance, has seduced his wife or bewitched one of his children. But in this case blood-revenge is not generally taken, inasmuch as the natural avengers-that is, the father and the remaining brothers-abstain from carrying it out. ‘It is enough that one member of our family has died,’ they say, ‘why should we deprive ourselves of one more?’ The slayer is consequently pardoned. The absence of blood-revenge in a case like this is due to the natural sympathy which the avengers feel for the slayer, as well as to the consideration that by killing him they would only harm themselves, by weakening the power and influence of the family.”' <sup id="cite_ref-697" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-697">[697]</a></sup> Stirling describes recognized extenuating circumstances: 'In the same way the Jivaros are apt to recognize extenuating circumstances in other cases where the crime has not been caused willfully, as for example, when someone in a state of intoxication or under the influence of a narcotic drink has been the cause of another person's death. However, in any of these instances, if the [117] evildoer refuses to pay to compensation asked, he becomes liable to blood revenge.”' <sup id="cite_ref-698" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-698">[698]</a></sup> The material suggests that the Jivaro population was not pulled into the settler court system during the early Ecuadorian period: 'In retaliation against the ravages of whites and such client Amerindians, some groups responded with force to outside efforts at settlement and exploitation. It is within this general context that our knowledge of Jivaroan warfare and feuding exists; and while the causes of Jívaro conflict lie in good part in environmental factors, this wider dimension cannot be ignored. As early as 1599, the Jivaroan peoples razed the Spanish gold-mining towns of eastern Ecuador and northern Peru, where Indian labor was being exploited to fill the coffers of the Spanish crown (Harner 1972:18-26; Izaguirre 1929/XI:11-19). Subsequent efforts to reestablish mines in the same region of the upper Santiago River have been persistently resisted as have other forms of occupation that have been attempted in or around the Jivaroan area.' <sup id="cite_ref-699" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-699">[699]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Private property (land) ♣ absent ♥</b> Obligations to kin varied and were not based on corporate descent groups: 'The basic Jivaro kin group is referred to as a "personal" bilateral kindred. In this type of kinship structure each person has a different kindred, with rights and obligations coinciding only with those of siblings of the same sex. Classification of kin, therefore, is spoken of as degrees of distance from ego, rather than in terms of membership or non-membership in a corporate unit as is quite often characteristic of unilineal descent societies. This form of kin group is probably the most insecure of the basic types of kinship systems for the individual, lacking defined descent groups affording protection from one's enemies and assistance in settling disputes among relatives (Harner, 1973: 97-98).' <sup id="cite_ref-700" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-700">[700]</a></sup> 'Information on the classification of Jivaro kinship terminology is scant in the anthropological literature. In a series of tables appearing in an article entitled "World Ethnographic Sample", in the American Anthropologist, 1957, George P. Murdock characterizes the Jivaro as having bifurcate merging avuncular terminology in which FaBr is equated with Fa, but MoBr is differentiated from both. He also states that cousin terminology is also unusual in that non-marriageable cross-cousins are equated with siblings, while marriageable cross-cousins are differentiated (Murdock, 1957: 673). In single-word or elementary kin terms the modifier "true" or "branch" is added to the term to pin down degrees of relationship to ego. Where specific relatives are involved the modifying terms can often be substituted for one another, depending on the degree of closeness of relationship that the speaker wishes to imply. "True" relationship modifiers are used for an individual's biological kin - grandparents, parents, siblings, children, cross-cousins, and fathers of his cross-cousins. Those relatives assigned the "branch" category are affinal kin who, prior to marrying, were not considered by ego to be relatives of any degree (Harner, 1973: 98).' <sup id="cite_ref-701" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-701">[701]</a></sup> Instead, the polygynous family functioned as the basic socio-economic unit: 'The basic domestic unit among the Jivaro is the polygynous family consisting of a man and his wife or wives and their children. Occasionally another relative such as a widowed mother or unmarried brother of the household head will also be included. In addition a married daughter and her husband may live in the household until the birth of their first child. Following the birth the family will be expected to move to a new dwelling nearby.' <sup id="cite_ref-702" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-702">[702]</a></sup> There was no formal acknowledgement of land ownership: 'There is no individual or communal ownership of land or natural resources, except in the sense that a garden plot is owned by a woman as long as it is being cultivated, but probably not more than five years. However even in this case it is the capital improvement of the land that is owned, not the land itself. There are no territorial boundaries recognized for hunting, fishing or other purposes at a tribal, neighborhood, or household level.' <sup id="cite_ref-703" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-703">[703]</a></sup> 'Land, or natural resources, is not owned individually or communally, except in the sense that a specific garden or part of a garden is owned by a woman as long as it is being cultivated, usually no more than about five years. Even in this case, it is the capital improvement of the land that is owned, in the form of the garden, not the land in its natural state. No territorial boundaries are recognized for hunting, fishing, or other purposes on a tribal, neighborhood, or household level except in one type of apparently very rare situation. This was a reported case of two related men living [Page 180] a few hundred feet apart who agreed to consider a small stream which ran between their houses as a boundary for purposes of clearing land for their wives' gardens.' <sup id="cite_ref-704" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-704">[704]</a></sup> Property involved structures, crops and movables instead, as well as usufruct rights of garden plots: 'Property acquired during a man's lifetime generally consists of the house he has built, artifacts that he has made or received as gifts, game and fish that he has caught, and specific crops, such as maize, that he has raised. At his death these items are inherited by his son of post-puberty age, or if there is none, then by his eldest brother. This brother also has the right to inherit the deceased's wife or wives. If there is no surviving brother, then his eldest parallel cousin is entitled to inherit the wife or wives.' <sup id="cite_ref-705" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-705">[705]</a></sup> 'A woman's property also consists of the artifacts she has made or received as gifts, wild food she has gathered, the crops that she is cultivating or has harvested, the section of the garden in which these crops are grown (in the case of several wives), and the pigs and chickens that she raises. She may also own pottery clay deposits, if they are near her home, and is the discoverer and primary excavator of these deposits (Harner, 1973: 179). This property is inherited by her eldest daughter, but if there is none, the deceased woman's mother will inherit the possessions. In cases where there is no mother or daughter, a sister of the deceased may ask for the goods, otherwise the widower will retain the possessions to give to a future wife.' <sup id="cite_ref-706" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-706">[706]</a></sup> The concept of private land ownership held by white settlers clashed with Shuar subsistence practices and concepts of land tenure in the Ecuadorian period: 'An important aspect of the current situation is the difference between the concepts of land utilization held by the Jívaro and the whites. The Jívaro, with a free land tradition, have a difficult time adjusting to the concept of land ownership. Besides this, the Jívaro do not have the tradition of solely subsisting on agriculture and livestock raising, but also depend significantly upon hunting, fishing, and some gathering. Thus, in localities of high visibility to the whites, especially the mission-administered lands in the Río Upano Valley, the Indian lands appear to be unexploited by white standards, although the Jívaro feel that, in fact, their lands are overexploited in terms of hunting. Thus, while the Jívaro [Page 214] believe that they lack adequate land, the whites feel that the Indians are not using all the territory at their disposal. This basic cultural difference makes successful communication and adjudication of disputes extremely difficult between the two groups. The Catholic Church, specifically the Salesian order, which has the responsibility for the missions in the Upano Valley, has generally chosen to side with the Indians, with the result that it has alienated a large portion of the white colonist population. Allegedly to show their displeasure, some of the whites are reported to be responsible for burning down a Salesian mission building at Sucúa in 1969.' <sup id="cite_ref-707" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-707">[707]</a></sup> Some missionaries assisted with the acquisition of legal titles to land in the Ecuadorian and post-colonial periods: 'The chief vehicle of Salesian support for the Jívaro is the Federation of Shuar Centers (Federación Provincial de Centros Shuaros de Morona-Santiago) founded in 1964 with the guidance of Padre Juan Shukta, and governed by Catholicized Jívaro. The organization, aiming at representing the economic, political and cultural interests of the majority of Jívaro throughout the tribe, is attempting to encourage them to develop a secure economic base through cattle raising, creating pasture, and securing legal rights to their land. The Federation also tries to encourage ethnic pride through brief daily radio broadcasts transmitted in Jívaro from its new headquarters building in Sucúa. To this end, the native term, “Shuar” (šuarä), has been adopted in preference to the formerly locally prevalent “Jíbaro,” the latter term being felt to connote “savage.”' <sup id="cite_ref-708" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-708">[708]</a></sup> However, we have assumed that by the 1930s native notions of land 'tenure' were still the norm in Shuar communities.

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Monogamy ♣ absent ♥</b> Obligations to kin varied and were not organized through corporate descent groups: 'The basic Jivaro kin group is referred to as a "personal" bilateral kindred. In this type of kinship structure each person has a different kindred, with rights and obligations coinciding only with those of siblings of the same sex. Classification of kin, therefore, is spoken of as degrees of distance from ego, rather than in terms of membership or non-membership in a corporate unit as is quite often characteristic of unilineal descent societies. This form of kin group is probably the most insecure of the basic types of kinship systems for the individual, lacking defined descent groups affording protection from one's enemies and assistance in settling disputes among relatives (Harner, 1973: 97-98).' <sup id="cite_ref-729" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-729">[729]</a></sup> 'Information on the classification of Jivaro kinship terminology is scant in the anthropological literature. In a series of tables appearing in an article entitled "World Ethnographic Sample", in the American Anthropologist, 1957, George P. Murdock characterizes the Jivaro as having bifurcate merging avuncular terminology in which FaBr is equated with Fa, but MoBr is differentiated from both. He also states that cousin terminology is also unusual in that non-marriageable cross-cousins are equated with siblings, while marriageable cross-cousins are differentiated (Murdock, 1957: 673). In single-word or elementary kin terms the modifier "true" or "branch" is added to the term to pin down degrees of relationship to ego. Where specific relatives are involved the modifying terms can often be substituted for one another, depending on the degree of closeness of relationship that the speaker wishes to imply. "True" relationship modifiers are used for an individual's biological kin - grandparents, parents, siblings, children, cross-cousins, and fathers of his cross-cousins. Those relatives assigned the "branch" category are affinal kin who, prior to marrying, were not considered by ego to be relatives of any degree (Harner, 1973: 98).' <sup id="cite_ref-730" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-730">[730]</a></sup> Polygyny was common: 'The basic domestic unit among the Jivaro is the polygynous family consisting of a man and his wife or wives and their children. Occasionally another relative such as a widowed mother or unmarried brother of the household head will also be included. In addition a married daughter and her husband may live in the household until the birth of their first child. Following the birth the family will be expected to move to a new dwelling nearby.' <sup id="cite_ref-731" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-731">[731]</a></sup> 'Polygyny is common, with men preferring to have two or more wives who contribute to the subsistence productivity of the household primarily in terms of food production and the preparation of manioc beer. This emphasis on polygyny partly reflects the disproportionate ratio of adult females to males in the society (2:1) largely as a consequence of the high mortality of men as the result of warfare. A man's first wife, preferably an unmarried cross cousin of post-puberty age, is courted, and with her consent, the marriage is concluded with the payment of a bride price or by the performance of bride service to the girl's family. There is no formal marriage ceremony. Additional wives may be obtained by capture on a raid, or the man may purchase a pre-adolescent girl from her father or brother and raise her in his house prior to the actual consummation of the marriage. Sometimes a pregnant woman and her husband will agree to "reserve" their unborn child, if female, for the man as a future wife. This practice results in marriages with substantial age differences between husband and wife.' <sup id="cite_ref-732" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-732">[732]</a></sup> 'Assured and proud, the Jívaro moves in the consciousness of his freedom. The naked, well-proportioned forms of the men are handsome; the women, on the other hand, are small and heavy-set, but good-natured and at most seductive in their earliest youth, but with advancing age terribly ugly, and all the more so as they are then less modest and expose their bodies, disfigured by hard labor, more to the eye. The color of the well-tended skin is a light red-brown for all, as is peculiar to the Indians of the highlands. This difference is often ascribed to mixture with the women abducted during the destruction of the Spanish cities, 333 but the dirtiness of the Quechua Indians may play a not unimportant role in this. The facial expression is usually good-natured and intelligent. The wives were always treated with kindness, their advice sought in almost all negotiations, and the children are allowed to do what they please. I say wives, for seldom does a Jívaro content himself with one partner for life; he has two, three, or four and cannot understand at all that his polygamy is unlawful, since he takes care of his wives and children, whereas the moralistic Christian preachers all too gladly shun these duties. Sometimes several women with their children live in one and the same house; sometimes the lord and master has several houses far from one another and has his wife or wives in each of them. The bond of marriage is kept holy; in the case of adultery the husband has the right to kill his wife. The institution of polygyny, no matter how reprehensible it may be from our standpoint, surely is justified under the conditions that we find among the Jívaros. In the case of a wandering, warlike people which frequently changes residence and in which the individual tribes, indeed, even the individual families, live in war and conflict, the man must always be ready to defend his person and his property; he must [Page 12] 333 cont. practice the use of weapons, live for battle and the hunt. Because of the highly developed sense of freedom of this nation, no one wants to be a servant; there can be no prisoners of war reduced to slavery because of the method of warfare to be discussed forthwith. Who is supposed to till the fields? Who is to perform all the tasks which do not befit the dignity of a warrior? It seems to me that a number of recognized wives are better than a swarm of servant maids subject to the despotism of the master! The men fell the trees, erect the house, and prepare a piece of land for cultivation; the cultivation of the field, always lying in the forest at some distance from the dwelling, like all other work, falls to the women.' <sup id="cite_ref-733" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-733">[733]</a></sup> Marriage to a group of sisters was preferred: 'Polygyny is preferred in the sororal form because sisters are reputed to get along better with one another. A man normally hopes that his father-in-law (iči) eventually will give him all the latter's daughters as wives. Accordingly, the son-in-law's conscientious post-marital bride-service is usually performed to keep his wife's father favorably impressed, so that he will provide such additional brides. Thus men occasionally may obtain several sisters as wives. In such cases, the man is assured of an outstanding production of beer and food and, presumably, a relatively tranquil polygynous family.' <sup id="cite_ref-734" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-734">[734]</a></sup> 'Wives who are sisters usually work out a hierarchical relationship, with the eldest (characteristically the first bride) assuming direction of activities within the house. The second wife, likewise, somewhat dominates the third, and so on. Still, each wife has her own section of the garden which she exclusively works, her own cook-fire, bed, and pottery vessels. Not uncommonly, when a man marries a widow who has an unmarried daughter, the daughter will eventually, and casually, become his second wife. In such cases of stepdaughter marriage, the mother tends to retain a relatively dominant position over her daughter. The situation is usually more individualistic in the case of wives who are not sisters or mothers and daughters. These tend to be too antagonistic to submit to a consistent dominant-subordinate relationship in household activities.' <sup id="cite_ref-735" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-735">[735]</a></sup> 'The most difficult situation tends to occur when a husband brings home a new wife who is not a sister of his pre-existing wife (wives). Since he is already married, he cannot practice temporary matrilocality at the house of his new wife's parents, and thus he must introduce her into a household where the other adult female(s) will tend to be antagonistic. Usually the husband attempts to bring the bride in unannounced so as to take his other wife (wives) by surprise, and tries to act as though the new wife is just a routine addition to the household. Reportedly, however, it is common for an irate pre-existing wife to unleash a temper tantrum, throwing pottery vessels and other handy artifacts at the husband. She may also soon be engaging in quarrels and hair-pullings with the new addition, but normally life in the dwelling gradually settles down, particularly after the new wife has a baby.' <sup id="cite_ref-736" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-736">[736]</a></sup> Cross-cousins were preferred as partners: 'The only kinswoman with whom marriage is formally sanctioned is a cross-cousin (wahe) from either parent's side of the family. A man does have the alternative of finding a marriage partner outside of his kindred, but this normally requires him to move out of his home neighborhood (because of the practice of temporary matrilocality) and consequently to live among strangers who may be intent on killing him for some earlier wrong by one of his kinsmen or simply because he took one of their own preferred potential mates. Slightly over half of actual marriages are with cross-cousins.' <sup id="cite_ref-737" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-737">[737]</a></sup> 'With the normatively unrestricted practice of polygyny creating a high demand for unattached women throughout interior Jívaro society, the preference for cross-cousin marriage promotes conflict in the nuclear family when brothers become old enough to marry, for they all share the same few preferred mates. Not surprisingly, many of the disputes among kinsmen thus arise between brothers over the question of [Page 96] wife acquisition, and the practice of matrilocal residence tends to isolate the brothers from one another. In fact, the norm is for a married man to side with his iči (father-in-law and father of cross-cousins) and sai (wife's brothers and male cross-cousins) in disputes against his own consanguineal relatives. The potential reward of obtaining more daughters as wives from his father-in-law often acts as an additional, but unspoken, inducement for a man to take the side of his in-laws in a quarrel.' <sup id="cite_ref-738" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-738">[738]</a></sup> Levirate marriage was also practiced: 'The Jivaro also observe the practice of the levirate. At the death of a man, the brother who is closest to him in age takes care of the widow and children. Although it is not required that she become his wife, she frequently does so.' <sup id="cite_ref-739" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-739">[739]</a></sup> Harner reports that adultery was common, but may have increased in the Ecuadorian period: 'While young single men are the chief philanderers, young married men also commonly have a penchant for such activities. Under the guise of going hunting, they may visit the houses of other men who are also away hunting and arrange to rendezvous regularly with a wife of the absent husband in the forest near the garden. This kind of activity is so common that husbands sometimes build a special kind of tampunčï “adulterer trap” near the garden of the suspected wife, which is so designed that a bent sapling will strike the unwanted visitor in the stomach or groin. However, this type of tampunčï, unlike that used against mortal enemies, does not have body-penetrating bamboo spikes.' <sup id="cite_ref-740" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-740">[740]</a></sup> 'Married women reportedly respond often with less enthusiasm when approached by a would-be lover who is also married, “because they do not want to share him with other women.” Thus, when a young man is visiting a distant neighborhood where he is relatively unknown, and a woman asks him if he is married, he commonly responds negatively.' <sup id="cite_ref-741" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-741">[741]</a></sup> 'When a man has a number of wives, his difficulty in preventing [Page 107] them from engaging in extramarital affairs is believed by the Jívaro to be proportional to their numbers. Of one man, who had a record six wives, an informant said, “He must have eyes in the back of his head.” A jealous husband, when he leaves the house, sometimes lectures his wives not to engage in sexual relations with any men, saying that he will learn of it if they do. It is not uncommon for such a man to leave a son or daughter in the house to spy on their own mother and to inform him if she speaks to any men.' <sup id="cite_ref-742" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-742">[742]</a></sup> 'The rise in adultery is attributed to the tendency of young men not to work as hard as in former decades and instead to spend their time visiting other households to drink beer, look for sexual partners, and perhaps obtain trade goods through making “friends.” This increase in intra-neighborhood visiting and shamanism may be due to the greater leisure time available for the men since the introduction of steel cutting tools, but informants themselves primarily ascribe the trends in visiting and shamanism to the young men's fixation on the acquisition of the “white man's valuables,” particularly firearms, and a resultant de-emphasis on hard physical work, especially in land clearing.' <sup id="cite_ref-743" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-743">[743]</a></sup> Harner claims that sexual licence was practiced during feasts: 'Since the head-taking raids are directed at the Achuara and others “who live far away,” the victim whose head is the focal point of the celebration normally is viewed by everyone in the head-taker's neighborhood as an “enemy.” Accordingly, it is the unique occasion for the members of many Jívaro households to get together to reaffirm their common identity and unity. Under such circumstances, it is not surprising that the tsantsa feast is participated in with great joy and a cumulative sense of euphoria. Of course, the huge quantities of strong manioc beer help, as do the ritual circle dances (wainči), which continue from dusk to dawn night after night. The bountiful quantities of meat and garden foods add to the sense of well-being. It is also a time of relative sexual license, as I had occasion to observe during the one tsantsa feast that I attended. Liaisons are arranged discreetly by both unmarried and married individuals, who rendezvous in the forest surrounding the house.' <sup id="cite_ref-744" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-744">[744]</a></sup> 'While such hansematä songs have a courtship function between single persons, they are sung by all the dancers, including married persons dancing with the spouses of others. As the drinking and dancing proceed, flirtatious behavior may become overt, extending to pinching and other familiarities in the dim light. The quantities of beer drunk require frequent exits from the house to urinate, and not uncommonly a female, exiting from the women's end of the house, will rendezvous secretly with a male, who has left from the opposite door, to satisfy a call of nature different from that [Page 110] which was their publicly implied intention. As the drunkenness develops, men may get into arguments over normally repressed grievances or over allegedly flirtatious behavior with someone else's wife. Wrestling may ensue, or even hitting with a convenient palm wood slat. However, most parties do not involve such unpleasantness and end rather calmly as some of the participants pass out from drinking and exhaustion. If the head of the household has thus collapsed, a wife or daughter of his may make her way to an unmarried visitor's bed and spend part of the night with him.' <sup id="cite_ref-745" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-745">[745]</a></sup> Adultery was punished through self-help justice and revenge: 'Sexual offenses, with the exception of wife-stealing, normally do not involve the sanction of homicide. The punishment varies in specific instances, but most commonly consists of slashing the forehead and scalp of the offender with a machete. [Page 175] Ordinarily, the aggrieved party administers the punishment personally while several relatives hold the victim. The slashing is usually done without much care, and sometimes the offender dies, although this result is not intended. In the case of premarital sexual intercourse, the punishment is administered to the girl and her lover by the girl's father. In the case of adultery, a man primarily punishes his wife's lover, and a woman primarily punishes her husband.' <sup id="cite_ref-746" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-746">[746]</a></sup> 'When a man learns that another has had sexual relations with his wife, he has the right to cut her lover's scalp whether he discovered him in the act or not. Unlike the punishment for murder, this cutting is usually administered immediately by the aggrieved party, accompanied by several of his kinsmen, normally brothers, parallel or cross-cousins, or his father. If the adulterer flees to a distant neighborhood or otherwise prevents them from punishing him, then the aggrieved party may, in his anger, kill the father of the adulterer, or, if he is not living, a brother or cousin (parallel or cross).' <sup id="cite_ref-747" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-747">[747]</a></sup> 'Even if the punishers are successful in their slashing of the offender's forehead or scalp, they and their close relatives usually remain angry with the family of the offender and refuse to speak to them. After about two years, the offender is also expected to pay the husband a toucan feather headband [Page 176] of the tawaspä type (worth approximately one shotgun) and strings of beads. This formally terminates the matter.' <sup id="cite_ref-748" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-748">[748]</a></sup> 'Seduction of one's wife by one's brother usually does not seem to be considered quite as grave an offense as ordinary adultery. It still warrants a slashing of the offender's head, but the cutting sometimes is done with just a toucan beak instead of a machete. An offender who is a brother of the husband never has to pay anything in addition.' <sup id="cite_ref-749" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-749">[749]</a></sup> 'In cases where the husband discovers the offense at the moment of commission, his anger affects the degree of variability from the norm in the actual manner of punishment. Thus sometimes the husband may kill the offender or mutilate the genitalia of the woman. Ordinarily, however, the wife is not punished, particularly when she is not caught in the act and when she is the one who informs the husband of the incident.' <sup id="cite_ref-750" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-750">[750]</a></sup> 'Rape is not recognized as such and informants could recall no case of a woman violently resisting sexual intercourse. They said that a man would never commit such an act if the woman resisted, because she would tell her family and they would then punish him. Also, it seems that both men and women tend to regard adultery as a spicy diversion, whose attraction seems to be sufficient to make rape unnecessary.' <sup id="cite_ref-751" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-751">[751]</a></sup> 'A woman has the right to punish a husband guilty of adultery. If she actually discovers him in the act, she is expected to slash his scalp with a machete. She rarely attacks the other woman. The husband thus slashed goes to live at the house of his father, or of an avuncular relative called father, or of a brother. Usually after about a month, his wife sends him the message that if he wants to return to her, he should do so immediately or she will cut his head again. If [Page 177] she does not thus invite him to return, however, he remains separated.' <sup id="cite_ref-752" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-752">[752]</a></sup> 'If a man repeatedly commits adultery, his wife has the right to poison him. Of course, the brothers and other close relatives of the man will attempt to murder her in retaliation. Poisoning is also the sanction against a woman who deserts her husband. Desertion of a wife by a man is virtually unheard of, except when she is implacably hostile towards him, in which case it is proper for him to leave.' <sup id="cite_ref-753" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-753">[753]</a></sup> Adultery was considered to be spiritually dangerous to young children: 'No couvade is observed by the new father. Rather, he can go forth daily to hunt game and, if he has no other wife, he takes on the responsibility of fetching water, digging up the manioc in the garden, washing it in the stream, and carrying it into the house. There it is cooked by his recuperating wife, who is not supposed to undertake other household or garden tasks for about two weeks. If she should fail to rest adequately for such a period, it is believed that she will be bedridden for a long time, due to becoming sick from “handling cold water,” such as when washing the manioc. In order to protect the health of the baby, both parents observe certain dietary restrictions, such as avoiding eating any birds that forage close to the ground, or consuming the entrails of any animal. It is also believed that if either parent engages in extramarital sexual relations during the child's infancy, the infant will die, vomiting.' <sup id="cite_ref-754" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-754">[754]</a></sup> Occasionally, wives were acquired through raids, but according to the sources reviewed so far, this was not a common occurrence in inter-tribal warfare due to the normative status of endogamy: 'The victorious enemy wreaks his savage vengeance not only upon the fighting men, but also on old people, women, and small children, nay, sometimes even on the domestic animals. Although there are many statements-from the very time of the Spaniards-to the effect that younger women, and especially girls, are spared in the wars of the Jibaros, we must not take this to be the general rule. It is true that there is a scarcity of women in the Jibaro society and that in general they are held in great esteem on account of the work they do. But it must be remembered that the Jibaros are essentially endogamous, members of foreign tribes being detested and looked upon as natural enemies. Besides, experience has taught the Indians that full-grown women of a vanquished tribe cannot always be made to submit to a victor who has perhaps cruelly killed their husbands, fathers, or brothers, but that they retain an invincible hatred against him. There are, in consequence, instances of the wives of vanquished enemies being carried home by the victors only to be brutally massacred. Young girls can more easily be brought up to become loyal wives and members of the victor's tribe.' <sup id="cite_ref-755" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-755">[755]</a></sup> 'Closely connected with this antagonism between the different Jibaro tribes is their marked endogamy. Marriages are, as a rule, only contracted between persons belonging to families related to each other and socially united. When it has been said that they, like other Indians, particularly make war against other tribes for the sake of procuring women, ( ) the wives of the vanquished enemies regularly becoming the wives of their victors, this clearly involves an exaggeration. The Jibaros fear and detest strange tribes-especially of their own nation -and do not set foot in their dominions except with inimical intentions. How the Jibaros regard exogamous marriages, or sexual relations with members of strange tribes in general, may be inferred from the fact that if a widow or some other woman has been made pregnant by a man belonging to another tribe, the woman is compelled to kill the child as soon as it is born, if it is a boy, ‘in order that the strange man may not leave offspring within the tribe’. The relations to strange tribes will be dealt with again in connection with the wars of the Indians. For the moment it is important to point out that the Jibaros are not likely to take their wives from tribes whom they regard as mortal enemies; such cases rather form exceptions than the rule.' <sup id="cite_ref-756" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-756">[756]</a></sup>  'Heads are taken of all victims, regardless of age or sex. A man may seize an Achuara girl or woman as a captive to try to take her home to be an extra wife, but usually he is unsuccessful in this because one of his companions kills her on the homeward trail to secure a head trophy.' <sup id="cite_ref-757" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-757">[757]</a></sup></dd>

Often such visits last two or three weeks, during which the young man will secretly rendezvous frequently with the girl in the garden or adjacent forest to engage in sexual relations. Her parents usually do not pay much attention to the affair as long as it is never mentioned or observed, although a few fathers are exceptional and may beat a daughter who is suspected of such activities simply because the young man is hanging around. Normally, if the girl becomes pregnant, her parents tell her to bring her lover to their house to live as her husband. Then, the next time she sees him, she invites him to become her husband.

The slashing is usually done without much care, and sometimes the offender dies, although this result is not intended. In the case of premarital sexual intercourse, the punishment is administered to the girl and her lover by the girl's father. In the case of adultery, a man primarily punishes his wife's lover, and a woman primarily punishes her husband.' <sup id="cite_ref-766" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-766">[766]</a></sup> 'When a man learns that another has had sexual relations with his wife, he has the right to cut her lover's scalp whether he discovered him in the act or not. Unlike the punishment for murder, this cutting is usually administered immediately by the aggrieved party, accompanied by several of his kinsmen, normally brothers, parallel or cross-cousins, or his father. If the adulterer flees to a distant neighborhood or otherwise prevents them from punishing him, then the aggrieved party may, in his anger, kill the father of the adulterer, or, if he is not living, a brother or cousin (parallel or cross).' <sup id="cite_ref-767" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-767">[767]</a></sup> 'Even if the punishers are successful in their slashing of the offender's forehead or scalp, they and their close relatives usually remain angry with the family of the offender and refuse to speak to them. After about two years, the offender is also expected to pay the husband a toucan feather headband [Page 176] of the tawaspä type (worth approximately one shotgun) and strings of beads. This formally terminates the matter.' <sup id="cite_ref-768" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-768">[768]</a></sup> 'Seduction of one's wife by one's brother usually does not seem to be considered quite as grave an offense as ordinary adultery. It still warrants a slashing of the offender's head, but the cutting sometimes is done with just a toucan beak instead of a machete. An offender who is a brother of the husband never has to pay anything in addition.' <sup id="cite_ref-769" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-769">[769]</a></sup> 'In cases where the husband discovers the offense at the moment of commission, his anger affects the degree of variability from the norm in the actual manner of punishment. Thus sometimes the husband may kill the offender or mutilate the genitalia of the woman. Ordinarily, however, the wife is not punished, particularly when she is not caught in the act and when she is the one who informs the husband of the incident.' <sup id="cite_ref-770" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-770">[770]</a></sup> 'Rape is not recognized as such and informants could recall no case of a woman violently resisting sexual intercourse. They said that a man would never commit such an act if the woman resisted, because she would tell her family and they would then punish him. Also, it seems that both men and women tend to regard adultery as a spicy diversion, whose attraction seems to be sufficient to make rape unnecessary.' <sup id="cite_ref-771" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-771">[771]</a></sup> 'A woman has the right to punish a husband guilty of adultery. If she actually discovers him in the act, she is expected to slash his scalp with a machete. She rarely attacks the other woman. The husband thus slashed goes to live at the house of his father, or of an avuncular relative called father, or of a brother. Usually after about a month, his wife sends him the message that if he wants to return to her, he should do so immediately or she will cut his head again. If [Page 177] she does not thus invite him to return, however, he remains separated.' <sup id="cite_ref-772" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-772">[772]</a></sup> 'If a man repeatedly commits adultery, his wife has the right to poison him. Of course, the brothers and other close relatives of the man will attempt to murder her in retaliation. Poisoning is also the sanction against a woman who deserts her husband. Desertion of a wife by a man is virtually unheard of, except when she is implacably hostile towards him, in which case it is proper for him to leave.' <sup id="cite_ref-773" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-773">[773]</a></sup> Adultery was also considered to be spiritually dangerous for young children: 'No couvade is observed by the new father. Rather, he can go forth daily to hunt game and, if he has no other wife, he takes on the responsibility of fetching water, digging up the manioc in the garden, washing it in the stream, and carrying it into the house. There it is cooked by his recuperating wife, who is not supposed to undertake other household or garden tasks for about two weeks. If she should fail to rest adequately for such a period, it is believed that she will be bedridden for a long time, due to becoming sick from “handling cold water,” such as when washing the manioc. In order to protect the health of the baby, both parents observe certain dietary restrictions, such as avoiding eating any birds that forage close to the ground, or consuming the entrails of any animal. It is also believed that if either parent engages in extramarital sexual relations during the child's infancy, the infant will die, vomiting.' <sup id="cite_ref-774" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-774">[774]</a></sup> Harner claims that adultery increased in the Ecuadorian and post-colonial periods: 'The rise in adultery is attributed to the tendency of young men not to work as hard as in former decades and instead to spend their time visiting other households to drink beer, look for sexual partners, and perhaps obtain trade goods through making “friends.” This increase in intra-neighborhood visiting and shamanism may be due to the greater leisure time available for the men since the introduction of steel cutting tools, but informants themselves primarily ascribe the trends in visiting and shamanism to the young men's fixation on the acquisition of the “white man's valuables,” particularly firearms, and a resultant de-emphasis on hard physical work, especially in land clearing.' <sup id="cite_ref-775" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-775">[775]</a></sup> We are unsure what to make of this statement. It is difficult to infer a 'typical' number of extramarital partners from the information provided above.</dd></dl>
<p><b>Legal rights are different on the basis of:</b>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>♠ Gender ♣ present ♥</b> Polygyny was common: 'Polygyny is common, with men preferring to have two or more wives who contribute to the subsistence productivity of the household primarily in terms of food production and the preparation of manioc beer. This emphasis on polygyny partly reflects the disproportionate ratio of adult females to males in the society (2:1) largely as a consequence of the high mortality of men as the result of warfare. A man's first wife, preferably an unmarried cross cousin of post-puberty age, is courted, and with her consent, the marriage is concluded with the payment of a bride price or by the performance of bride service to the girl's family. There is no formal marriage ceremony. Additional wives may be obtained by capture on a raid, or the man may purchase a pre-adolescent girl from her father or brother and raise her in his house prior to the actual consummation of the marriage. Sometimes a pregnant woman and her husband will agree to "reserve" their unborn child, if female, for the man as a future wife. This practice results in marriages with substantial age differences between husband and wife.' <sup id="cite_ref-776" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-776">[776]</a></sup> 'The basic domestic unit among the Jivaro is the polygynous family consisting of a man and his wife or wives and their children. Occasionally another relative such as a widowed mother or unmarried brother of the household head will also be included. In addition a married daughter and her husband may live in the household until the birth of their first child. Following the birth the family will be expected to move to a new dwelling nearby.' <sup id="cite_ref-777" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-777">[777]</a></sup> 'Assured and proud, the Jívaro moves in the consciousness of his freedom. The naked, well-proportioned forms of the men are handsome; the women, on the other hand, are small and heavy-set, but good-natured and at most seductive in their earliest youth, but with advancing age terribly ugly, and all the more so as they are then less modest and expose their bodies, disfigured by hard labor, more to the eye. The color of the well-tended skin is a light red-brown for all, as is peculiar to the Indians of the highlands. This difference is often ascribed to mixture with the women abducted during the destruction of the Spanish cities, 333 but the dirtiness of the Quechua Indians may play a not unimportant role in this. The facial expression is usually good-natured and intelligent. The wives were always treated with kindness, their advice sought in almost all negotiations, and the children are allowed to do what they please. I say wives, for seldom does a Jívaro content himself with one partner for life; he has two, three, or four and cannot understand at all that his polygamy is unlawful, since he takes care of his wives and children, whereas the moralistic Christian preachers all too gladly shun these duties. Sometimes several women with their children live in one and the same house; sometimes the lord and master has several houses far from one another and has his wife or wives in each of them. The bond of marriage is kept holy; in the case of adultery the husband has the right to kill his wife. The institution of polygyny, no matter how reprehensible it may be from our standpoint, surely is justified under the conditions that we find among the Jívaros. In the case of a wandering, warlike people which frequently changes residence and in which the individual tribes, indeed, even the individual families, live in war and conflict, the man must always be ready to defend his person and his property; he must [Page 12] 333 cont. practice the use of weapons, live for battle and the hunt. Because of the highly developed sense of freedom of this nation, no one wants to be a servant; there can be no prisoners of war reduced to slavery because of the method of warfare to be discussed forthwith. Who is supposed to till the fields? Who is to perform all the tasks which do not befit the dignity of a warrior? It seems to me that a number of recognized wives are better than a swarm of servant maids subject to the despotism of the master! The men fell the trees, erect the house, and prepare a piece of land for cultivation; the cultivation of the field, always lying in the forest at some distance from the dwelling, like all other work, falls to the women.' <sup id="cite_ref-778" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-778">[778]</a></sup> Levirate marriage was also practiced: 'The Jivaro also observe the practice of the levirate. At the death of a man, the brother who is closest to him in age takes care of the widow and children. Although it is not required that she become his wife, she frequently does so.' <sup id="cite_ref-779" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-779">[779]</a></sup> Labour was divided along gender lines: 'The division of labor falls along the usual gender lines. Men are responsible for protecting their families, house construction, basket making, different kinds of wood work, weapon manufacture, hunting and fishing, clearing the forest in preparation for the initial establishment of garden plots, and for cutting and bringing in fire wood. They also spin and weave and do some limited garden work. Women are responsible for the overwhelming majority of agricultural tasks, as well as for food and beer preparation, pottery making, fabric dyeing, child care, and the tending of the domestic animals (chiefly chickens and pigs).' <sup id="cite_ref-780" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-780">[780]</a></sup> “Why do women dig yuca and the men fell trees? were questions Johnston asked me. He laboured under the common misapprehension that the women were slaves, and did the hardest work; but I had to explain otherwise. The Jivaros carry their sense of the personal, not only to animals, but also to trees and inanimate objects. In their eyes all things are animated by human spirits, male or female. The yuca has a female soul, hence it is proper for the women to cultivate it. Clay is feminine, therefore women must fashion the simple pottery which they use. Women must also handle the vessels when it comes to cooking. Most trees are men, hence men must chop them down. Cotton is of the male gender, so men must spin thread and make their own ‘itipis’ and also the ‘tarachi,’ or garments worn by the women. It is the sex distinction which is all important. Man and woman's work is as distinct as night from day, and the duties of one never overlap those of the other. There is not even a question of comparison between the two. A man is a man, and a woman a woman. That is their final argument.” <sup id="cite_ref-781" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-781">[781]</a></sup> However, both men and women owned and inherited property: 'Property acquired during a man's lifetime generally consists of the house he has built, artifacts that he has made or received as gifts, game and fish that he has caught, and specific crops, such as maize, that he has raised. At his death these items are inherited by his son of post-puberty age, or if there is none, then by his eldest brother. This brother also has the right to inherit the deceased's wife or wives. If there is no surviving brother, then his eldest parallel cousin is entitled to inherit the wife or wives.' <sup id="cite_ref-782" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-782">[782]</a></sup> 'A woman's property also consists of the artifacts she has made or received as gifts, wild food she has gathered, the crops that she is cultivating or has harvested, the section of the garden in which these crops are grown (in the case of several wives), and the pigs and chickens that she raises. She may also own pottery clay deposits, if they are near her home, and is the discoverer and primary excavator of these deposits (Harner, 1973: 179). This property is inherited by her eldest daughter, but if there is none, the deceased woman's mother will inherit the possessions. In cases where there is no mother or daughter, a sister of the deceased may ask for the goods, otherwise the widower will retain the possessions to give to a future wife.' <sup id="cite_ref-783" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-783">[783]</a></sup> See also property and inheritance variables. It appears that there were no female headmen or warriors (for information on leadership, see variables on chief executive). Accordingly, the acquisition of arutam souls was considered to be less essential for women than for men: 'A person is not born with an arutam soul. Such a soul must be acquired, and in certain traditional ways. The acquisition of this type of soul is considered to be so important to an adult male's survival that a boy's parents do not expect him to live past puberty without one. Women sometimes obtain arutam souls, but it is not considered so essential for them. One reason is that intra-tribal killing, the most common source of violent death, is primarily directed at adult males rather than at women and children.' <sup id="cite_ref-784" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-784">[784]</a></sup> Accordingly, we have provisionally coded 'present', but this is open to review.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Social class ♣ absent ♥</b> Shuar society was organized in autonomous residential communities rather than social classes: 'Each community is politically independent with its own headman. Each is also located four or more kilometers from their nearest neighboring community. The community is made up of patrilineally and affinally related individuals, traditionally consisting of from 80 to 300 people (30 to 40 people in the twentieth century), living in one house called a JIVARIA. For defensive purposes, this house is built on a steep hill usually at the upper end of a stream. The house itself is approximately 13 meters by 26 meters in size, elliptical in shape, and has a thatched roof. In times of war, two or more communities united to fight a common enemy, as was the case when the Spanish attempted to conquer them.' <sup id="cite_ref-785" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-785">[785]</a></sup> 'The basic domestic unit among the Jivaro is the polygynous family consisting of a man and his wife or wives and their children. Occasionally another relative such as a widowed mother or unmarried brother of the household head will also be included. In addition a married daughter and her husband may live in the household until the birth of their first child. Following the birth the family will be expected to move to a new dwelling nearby.' <sup id="cite_ref-786" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-786">[786]</a></sup> Obligations to kin varied and were not organized through corporate kin groups: 'The basic Jivaro kin group is referred to as a "personal" bilateral kindred. In this type of kinship structure each person has a different kindred, with rights and obligations coinciding only with those of siblings of the same sex. Classification of kin, therefore, is spoken of as degrees of distance from ego, rather than in terms of membership or non-membership in a corporate unit as is quite often characteristic of unilineal descent societies. This form of kin group is probably the most insecure of the basic types of kinship systems for the individual, lacking defined descent groups affording protection from one's enemies and assistance in settling disputes among relatives (Harner, 1973: 97-98).' <sup id="cite_ref-787" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-787">[787]</a></sup> 'Information on the classification of Jivaro kinship terminology is scant in the anthropological literature. In a series of tables appearing in an article entitled "World Ethnographic Sample", in the American Anthropologist, 1957, George P. Murdock characterizes the Jivaro as having bifurcate merging avuncular terminology in which FaBr is equated with Fa, but MoBr is differentiated from both. He also states that cousin terminology is also unusual in that non-marriageable cross-cousins are equated with siblings, while marriageable cross-cousins are differentiated (Murdock, 1957: 673). In single-word or elementary kin terms the modifier "true" or "branch" is added to the term to pin down degrees of relationship to ego. Where specific relatives are involved the modifying terms can often be substituted for one another, depending on the degree of closeness of relationship that the speaker wishes to imply. "True" relationship modifiers are used for an individual's biological kin - grandparents, parents, siblings, children, cross-cousins, and fathers of his cross-cousins. Those relatives assigned the "branch" category are affinal kin who, prior to marrying, were not considered by ego to be relatives of any degree (Harner, 1973: 98).' <sup id="cite_ref-788" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-788">[788]</a></sup> Prestige could be obtained through hospitality: 'If a man clears the forest without the aid of neighbors, he tends to make small clearings at different times, while the rarer communal effort results in one large clearing. Whether [Page 49] the garden area is in a single clearing or several, its total size is heavily influenced by the number of wives a man has to cultivate the fields. A household with one wife tends to have a garden of about 50,000 square feet, while a second spouse increases the area to about 65,000, and a third to approximately 75,000. The areal increases are usually not simple multiples of the number of wives because the demand for food and beer to feed visitors tends to lag behind the increments in additional wives. These figures vary, of course, according to the consumption demands of the household, its number of visitors, and the industry of its inhabitants. A man who wishes to gain prestige may clear garden areas of larger size for each of his wives. In such a case, a household in which there are two wives may sometimes have a total garden of 100,000 square feet or more.' <sup id="cite_ref-789" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-789">[789]</a></sup> 'The importance of wives in producing food and beer goes far beyond the subsistence requirements of the household itself. Plural wives assure a surplus production which will make possible adequate entertainment of visitors from other households. The Jívaro place a high value on drinking beer and eating (perhaps in that order), so that one's status in a neighborhood is greatly affected by one's generosity with beer and food. No one can expect to have many friends unless he is a good host; and he cannot easily meet the requirements of good hospitality without plural wives as a labor force.' <sup id="cite_ref-790" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-790">[790]</a></sup> 'While the concept of the untä ideally encompasses all of the characteristics described, it is possible to acquire the designation with no formal qualifications other than simply having lived long enough to exhibit a few gray hairs and to have many grandchildren. Such an achievement receives respect as a sign of supernatural power, and an elderly untä of this sort is believed to have the ability to curse to death anyone who incurs his anger. No other kind of person is considered to possess this ability. Partly out of fear of being cursed, young men in the neighborhood assist him in land clearing and other tasks when he requests their aid. While the elderly untä's opinion is normally respected, he usually is not a real leader unless he is also outstanding as a killer, shaman, or good host. Thus the true “big men” are distinguished not only by longevity but by real leadership and generosity.' <sup id="cite_ref-791" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-791">[791]</a></sup> Warfare was also an important means of acquiring prestige: 'Given such factors as the absence of any formal political organization and even of unilineal descent groups, as well as the pervasive belief in shamanistically induced illness and death, the conflict over women, and the emphasis on retaliatory sanctions and feuding, it should not be unexpected that the leaders in Jívaro society are outstanding killers and shamans. Although such leadership is informal, almost all neighborhoods have at least one or two noted killers and a few superior shamans who are valued as protectors of their neighboring relatives, or at least of those with whom they are on friendly terms. Such leadership roles are earned and, in the case of the killers, acquired literally through life-and-death struggle.' <sup id="cite_ref-792" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-792">[792]</a></sup> 'It should be noted that the personal security which the Jívaro believe comes from killing has some social reality. A man who has killed repeatedly, called kakaram or “powerful one,” is rarely attacked because his enemies feel that the protection provided him by his constantly replaced souls would make any assassination attempt against him fruitless.' <sup id="cite_ref-793" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-793">[793]</a></sup> 'The outstanding killer gains prestige and social obligations by helping the people of his locality in eliminating their enemies. Such a man is known as kakaram (“powerful” or “powerful one”) and also, if he is not too youthful, as untä. He is believed to possess an unusually large quantity of arutam soul power (see pp. 135-43) (kakarma), which both protects him from death and is believed to drive him on to kill as often as possible.' <sup id="cite_ref-794" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-794">[794]</a></sup> 'The majority of young men interviewed expressed a strong desire to kill, not only to avenge the deaths of their fathers and other close relatives, but to acquire the arutam soul power and to become known, respected, and feared as kakaram. To be acknowledged as a kakaram, a man must have killed at least several persons. Early in his career, he does this by going on killing expeditions led by others, whether intra-tribal assassinations or the inter-tribal raids for tsantsa. As his reputation increases, he will eventually successfully organize and lead such an expedition himself, usually the more modest local assassination raid, probably against a specific personal enemy who is believed to have, sometime earlier, caused the death of a member of his immediate family. If he acquits himself well in achieving this assassination, especially as evidenced by firing the first shot into the victim, word will rapidly spread of his apparent power. Soon he will be approached by other men to lead them in killing expeditions against their own enemies. The kakaram, anxious to further his reputation as well as to gain additional supernatural power through more killing, rarely refuses such a request, even though it often means that he is agreeing to kill a fellow tribesman who is not even an enemy of his.' <sup id="cite_ref-795" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-795">[795]</a></sup> 'As his reputation grows, the kakaram tends to dress himself in elaborate feather headdresses and ornaments when visiting other households or receiving guests (see frontispiece). [Page 113] Similarly, he adopts an ever more forceful and aggressive style of speaking when receiving visitors, meeting others on the trail, or in visiting other men. He conveys the impression of being invincible in every aspect of his public demeanor. If he has a son, he encourages him to become a killer also, and instructs him to the extent of taking him on assassination expeditions even as early as the age of six or seven years. Although such a young boy will not yet take part in the actual killing, the father brings him up to the corpse after the murder and has him fire into it, with the father helping him hold the gun. The wives of such a kakaram also are expected to outperform other women in making superior pottery vessels, doing garden work and other aspects of household labor. Informants said that one way of looking at this was that since a kakaram is very much a man, his wives have to be very much women.' <sup id="cite_ref-796" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-796">[796]</a></sup> 'While a kakaram is greatly feared by his enemies, his neighbors usually look upon him as a great local asset, a deterrent to attacks upon them, and refer to him with the title untä (big) before his name, especially if he is also hospitable to them and generous with beer and food. Of course, there may be neighbors who get into a quarrel or other dispute with him; but they almost always move as soon as possible to another region of the tribe where they feel more secure. Thus there is a continual process of self-selection in terms of the composition of any neighborhood, which tends to reduce local antagonisms.' <sup id="cite_ref-797" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-797">[797]</a></sup> Harner provides a general description of informal leaders or 'big men': 'The most successful party-givers and hosts are those men who, in addition to having two or three wives to produce large amounts of beer and food, are respected by their neighbors for: their renown as killers in feuds and war, or as shamans; the achievement of age sufficient to have grand-children; and who are generally of an amiable, honest, and magnanimous nature when dealing with those who are not their enemies. A man who has most of these characteristics is referred to by the term untä, which means “big” or “old” man. The demeanor of party participants in the house of such a man tends to be more circumspect and respectful of the master of the house, and excesses such as arguments and brawls seem to occur less often.' <sup id="cite_ref-798" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-798">[798]</a></sup> Material possessions were considered to be indicative of prestige and power: 'Posts, beams, roof and walls are all lashed firmly together with strips of inner tree bark. Proceeding painstakingly, a man usually constructs a large and impressive structure capable of withstanding not only the natural elements and enemy attack, but also critical evaluation by his neighbors. The size and quality of a man's house is regarded as a serious indication of his personal “power,” kakarma.' <sup id="cite_ref-799" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-799">[799]</a></sup> But these differences in prestige and status did not translate into anything resembling a class system. Accordingly, this variable may not be applicable to the Shuar.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Ethnicity or race ♣ absent ♥</b> Dyott reports that on at least one occasion, Spanish women were abducted byShuar in the colonial period: 'In the sixteenth century, when a few Spanish settlements flourished in what is now called the Ecuadorean Oriente, the Indians resented the slavery imposed upon them by the Spanish invaders, and finally united in a combined effort to rid themselves of their common foe, who seemed to be endangering their existence. A wholesale revolt against the whites ensued, and several villages were completely annihilated. This, as I have already stated, was the fate that befell Sevilla de Oro, and the Spanish women living there were taken prisoners and carried off into the forest wilderness, where they became the mothers of subsequent Jivaro children. This infusion of Spanish blood shows itself in the bearded faces which are occasionally met with in this area.” <sup id="cite_ref-800" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-800">[800]</a></sup> We have found no indication that the offspring of these women were treated any differently from other Shuar.

<dd><b>♠ Education is available to both males and females ♣ ♥</b> Salesian missionaries established boarding schools, but it appears that this did not happen until the mid-20th century. Salazar provides a description of the history of the Salesian mission and their impact on the Shuar after the Ecuadorian period as defined here: 'The Salesians' rationale for the establishment of boarding schools was the supposedly “low moral level” that they saw in Shuar families, which made the separation of children from their parents not only desirable but necessary (Barrueco 1968:42). In the boarding school Shuar children (boys and girls) grew up in a communal atmosphere, learning the values of the Catholic religion and western civilization. The acculturation process was long and intensive, for children did not leave the boarding school until they were old enough to choose a partner for marriage, who was usually a school-mate. This type of marriage was often encouraged by the missionaries, who sometimes overlooked the fact that Shuar society prescribes cross-cousin marriage (Federación Shuar 1976:169). In any case, the married couple was acculturated enough so as to desire a permanent home near the mission center. Statistics for the late 1960s show that the Salesian mission was supporting 20 boarding schools with a total of 1,880 Shuar children (Barrueco 1968:57). Recently, however, the importance of these schools has decreased with the establishment of the federation, as I explain later.' <sup id="cite_ref-801" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-801">[801]</a></sup> 'A factor which may have favored the creation of the Shuar organization is the change presently affecting the structure of missionary work. Young missionaries realized that the prevailing framework of the indoctrination process is ethnocentric, and essentially traumatic to the native population. The Second National Congress of Missions held in Quito in 1973 was openly critical of the traditional methods of evangelization, and stressed the need for a policy aimed at the safeguard of aboriginal cultures (Congreso Nacional 1973). Indeed, it appears that the mission has arrived at a turning point where the perpetuation of archaic schemes would be self-destructive. Consequently, a “new mission” has emerged which advocates that the Christian religion must adapt to the cultural values of the native population. Along this line, it could be said that the nativistic movement presently taking shape among the Shuar may be related, to some extent, to this new attitude on the part of the missionaries.' <sup id="cite_ref-802" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-802">[802]</a></sup> 'The Salesian mission may consider this somewhat negative view of its activities to be unfair, considering that its missionaries are usually highly motivated individuals. Unfortunately, their religious fervor has often obscured the devastating effects of indoctrination policies upon Shuar culture. It must also be pointed out that the Salesians are now aware of their mistake, and they are willing to correct the wrongs done to the Shuar. As a consequence, the Salesians have [Page 606] been recently advocating the revival of Shuar culture through a new approach, sometimes called the “new mission” strategy. The “new mission” aims to create a “native church” through the enhancement of Shuar culture elements that can be adapted to Catholic religious principles, and through the establishment of a native ecclesiastical hierarchy that would, theoretically, culminate in priesthood (Broseghini et al. 1976).' <sup id="cite_ref-803" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-803">[803]</a></sup> 'This strategy requires a complete reversal of indoctrination procedures. For instance, missionaries do not bring the natives to the mission center (as was the case with the traditional methods); instead, they live and work with the people in their own familiar environment. Furthermore, missionaries must acquire a profound knowledge of the aboriginal language and culture, particularly mythology, which, in a way, constitutes the infrastructure upon which Christian elements can be introduced (Broseghini et al. 1976, Sainaghi 1976). It is my opinion that the Shuar are already too acculturated in western ways to accept the idea of a native church. Moreover, many acculturated individuals feel that revival of their traditional culture, as advocated by the Salesians, is largely unnecessary. For the moment, they find it difficult to understand why they have to adopt, under Salesian pressure, Shuar culture elements and values that the Salesians themselves had eradicated from the native population during the past half-century.' <sup id="cite_ref-804" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-804">[804]</a></sup> Accordingly, this variable may not be applicable to the Shuar.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Property can be owned by both males and females ♣ present ♥</b> Polygyny was common: 'Polygyny is common, with men preferring to have two or more wives who contribute to the subsistence productivity of the household primarily in terms of food production and the preparation of manioc beer. This emphasis on polygyny partly reflects the disproportionate ratio of adult females to males in the society (2:1) largely as a consequence of the high mortality of men as the result of warfare. A man's first wife, preferably an unmarried cross cousin of post-puberty age, is courted, and with her consent, the marriage is concluded with the payment of a bride price or by the performance of bride service to the girl's family. There is no formal marriage ceremony. Additional wives may be obtained by capture on a raid, or the man may purchase a pre-adolescent girl from her father or brother and raise her in his house prior to the actual consummation of the marriage. Sometimes a pregnant woman and her husband will agree to "reserve" their unborn child, if female, for the man as a future wife. This practice results in marriages with substantial age differences between husband and wife.' <sup id="cite_ref-805" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-805">[805]</a></sup> 'The basic domestic unit among the Jivaro is the polygynous family consisting of a man and his wife or wives and their children. Occasionally another relative such as a widowed mother or unmarried brother of the household head will also be included. In addition a married daughter and her husband may live in the household until the birth of their first child. Following the birth the family will be expected to move to a new dwelling nearby.' <sup id="cite_ref-806" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-806">[806]</a></sup> 'Assured and proud, the Jívaro moves in the consciousness of his freedom. The naked, well-proportioned forms of the men are handsome; the women, on the other hand, are small and heavy-set, but good-natured and at most seductive in their earliest youth, but with advancing age terribly ugly, and all the more so as they are then less modest and expose their bodies, disfigured by hard labor, more to the eye. The color of the well-tended skin is a light red-brown for all, as is peculiar to the Indians of the highlands. This difference is often ascribed to mixture with the women abducted during the destruction of the Spanish cities, 333 but the dirtiness of the Quechua Indians may play a not unimportant role in this. The facial expression is usually good-natured and intelligent. The wives were always treated with kindness, their advice sought in almost all negotiations, and the children are allowed to do what they please. I say wives, for seldom does a Jívaro content himself with one partner for life; he has two, three, or four and cannot understand at all that his polygamy is unlawful, since he takes care of his wives and children, whereas the moralistic Christian preachers all too gladly shun these duties. Sometimes several women with their children live in one and the same house; sometimes the lord and master has several houses far from one another and has his wife or wives in each of them. The bond of marriage is kept holy; in the case of adultery the husband has the right to kill his wife. The institution of polygyny, no matter how reprehensible it may be from our standpoint, surely is justified under the conditions that we find among the Jívaros. In the case of a wandering, warlike people which frequently changes residence and in which the individual tribes, indeed, even the individual families, live in war and conflict, the man must always be ready to defend his person and his property; he must [Page 12] 333 cont. practice the use of weapons, live for battle and the hunt. Because of the highly developed sense of freedom of this nation, no one wants to be a servant; there can be no prisoners of war reduced to slavery because of the method of warfare to be discussed forthwith. Who is supposed to till the fields? Who is to perform all the tasks which do not befit the dignity of a warrior? It seems to me that a number of recognized wives are better than a swarm of servant maids subject to the despotism of the master! The men fell the trees, erect the house, and prepare a piece of land for cultivation; the cultivation of the field, always lying in the forest at some distance from the dwelling, like all other work, falls to the women.' <sup id="cite_ref-807" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-807">[807]</a></sup> Levirate marriages were also practiced: 'The Jivaro also observe the practice of the levirate. At the death of a man, the brother who is closest to him in age takes care of the widow and children. Although it is not required that she become his wife, she frequently does so.' <sup id="cite_ref-808" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-808">[808]</a></sup> The Shuar observed a gendered division of labour: 'The division of labor falls along the usual gender lines. Men are responsible for protecting their families, house construction, basket making, different kinds of wood work, weapon manufacture, hunting and fishing, clearing the forest in preparation for the initial establishment of garden plots, and for cutting and bringing in fire wood. They also spin and weave and do some limited garden work. Women are responsible for the overwhelming majority of agricultural tasks, as well as for food and beer preparation, pottery making, fabric dyeing, child care, and the tending of the domestic animals (chiefly chickens and pigs).' <sup id="cite_ref-809" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-809">[809]</a></sup> “Why do women dig yuca and the men fell trees? were questions Johnston asked me. He laboured under the common misapprehension that the women were slaves, and did the hardest work; but I had to explain otherwise. The Jivaros carry their sense of the personal, not only to animals, but also to trees and inanimate objects. In their eyes all things are animated by human spirits, male or female. The yuca has a female soul, hence it is proper for the women to cultivate it. Clay is feminine, therefore women must fashion the simple pottery which they use. Women must also handle the vessels when it comes to cooking. Most trees are men, hence men must chop them down. Cotton is of the male gender, so men must spin thread and make their own ‘itipis’ and also the ‘tarachi,’ or garments worn by the women. It is the sex distinction which is all important. Man and woman's work is as distinct as night from day, and the duties of one never overlap those of the other. There is not even a question of comparison between the two. A man is a man, and a woman a woman. That is their final argument.” <sup id="cite_ref-810" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-810">[810]</a></sup> However, both men and women owned property (other than land): 'Property acquired during a man's lifetime generally consists of the house he has built, artifacts that he has made or received as gifts, game and fish that he has caught, and specific crops, such as maize, that he has raised. At his death these items are inherited by his son of post-puberty age, or if there is none, then by his eldest brother. This brother also has the right to inherit the deceased's wife or wives. If there is no surviving brother, then his eldest parallel cousin is entitled to inherit the wife or wives.' <sup id="cite_ref-811" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-811">[811]</a></sup> 'A woman's property also consists of the artifacts she has made or received as gifts, wild food she has gathered, the crops that she is cultivating or has harvested, the section of the garden in which these crops are grown (in the case of several wives), and the pigs and chickens that she raises. She may also own pottery clay deposits, if they are near her home, and is the discoverer and primary excavator of these deposits (Harner, 1973: 179). This property is inherited by her eldest daughter, but if there is none, the deceased woman's mother will inherit the possessions. In cases where there is no mother or daughter, a sister of the deceased may ask for the goods, otherwise the widower will retain the possessions to give to a future wife.' <sup id="cite_ref-812" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-812">[812]</a></sup> Men and women also inherited property: 'Clearly defined norms exist regarding the inheritance of [Page 178] both wives and material goods, although disputes regarding the latter category tend to be minor. The deceased man's eldest brother has the right to inherit his wife (wives). If there is no surviving brother of the deceased man, then his eldest parallel cousin is entitled to inherit the wife (wives). If the deceased man lacks sons of post-puberty age, his eldest brother also inherits his possessions. Otherwise, the eldest son receives these goods. There is a mild feeling that the eldest brother inheriting plural wives, or the eldest son inheriting material possessions, should distribute some of his new wealth to each of his younger brothers as they pass puberty.' <sup id="cite_ref-813" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-813">[813]</a></sup> 'A woman's property is inherited by her eldest daughter. If there is no daughter, the deceased girl's mother inherits the possessions. When there is neither a surviving daughter nor mother, a sister of the deceased girl may have the possessions if she asks for them. Otherwise, the widower keeps the things to give to a future wife.' <sup id="cite_ref-814" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-814">[814]</a></sup> For more information on property and inheritance, see property variables above.</dd></dl>

<dd><b>♠ Education is available to people from all social classes ♣ ♥</b> Salesian missionaries established boarding schools, but it appears that this did not happen until the mid-20th century. Salazar provides a description of the history of the Salesian mission and their impact on the Shuar after the Ecuadorian period as defined here: 'The Salesians' rationale for the establishment of boarding schools was the supposedly “low moral level” that they saw in Shuar families, which made the separation of children from their parents not only desirable but necessary (Barrueco 1968:42). In the boarding school Shuar children (boys and girls) grew up in a communal atmosphere, learning the values of the Catholic religion and western civilization. The acculturation process was long and intensive, for children did not leave the boarding school until they were old enough to choose a partner for marriage, who was usually a school-mate. This type of marriage was often encouraged by the missionaries, who sometimes overlooked the fact that Shuar society prescribes cross-cousin marriage (Federación Shuar 1976:169). In any case, the married couple was acculturated enough so as to desire a permanent home near the mission center. Statistics for the late 1960s show that the Salesian mission was supporting 20 boarding schools with a total of 1,880 Shuar children (Barrueco 1968:57). Recently, however, the importance of these schools has decreased with the establishment of the federation, as I explain later.' <sup id="cite_ref-815" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-815">[815]</a></sup> 'A factor which may have favored the creation of the Shuar organization is the change presently affecting the structure of missionary work. Young missionaries realized that the prevailing framework of the indoctrination process is ethnocentric, and essentially traumatic to the native population. The Second National Congress of Missions held in Quito in 1973 was openly critical of the traditional methods of evangelization, and stressed the need for a policy aimed at the safeguard of aboriginal cultures (Congreso Nacional 1973). Indeed, it appears that the mission has arrived at a turning point where the perpetuation of archaic schemes would be self-destructive. Consequently, a “new mission” has emerged which advocates that the Christian religion must adapt to the cultural values of the native population. Along this line, it could be said that the nativistic movement presently taking shape among the Shuar may be related, to some extent, to this new attitude on the part of the missionaries.' <sup id="cite_ref-816" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-816">[816]</a></sup> 'The Salesian mission may consider this somewhat negative view of its activities to be unfair, considering that its missionaries are usually highly motivated individuals. Unfortunately, their religious fervor has often obscured the devastating effects of indoctrination policies upon Shuar culture. It must also be pointed out that the Salesians are now aware of their mistake, and they are willing to correct the wrongs done to the Shuar. As a consequence, the Salesians have [Page 606] been recently advocating the revival of Shuar culture through a new approach, sometimes called the “new mission” strategy. The “new mission” aims to create a “native church” through the enhancement of Shuar culture elements that can be adapted to Catholic religious principles, and through the establishment of a native ecclesiastical hierarchy that would, theoretically, culminate in priesthood (Broseghini et al. 1976).' <sup id="cite_ref-817" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-817">[817]</a></sup> 'This strategy requires a complete reversal of indoctrination procedures.

<dd><b>♠ Property can be owned by people from all social classes ♣ present ♥</b> Shuar society was organized in autonomous residential communities rather than social classes: 'Each community is politically independent with its own headman. Each is also located four or more kilometers from their nearest neighboring community. The community is made up of patrilineally and affinally related individuals, traditionally consisting of from 80 to 300 people (30 to 40 people in the twentieth century), living in one house called a JIVARIA. For defensive purposes, this house is built on a steep hill usually at the upper end of a stream. The house itself is approximately 13 meters by 26 meters in size, elliptical in shape, and has a thatched roof. In times of war, two or more communities united to fight a common enemy, as was the case when the Spanish attempted to conquer them.' <sup id="cite_ref-819" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-819">[819]</a></sup> 'The basic domestic unit among the Jivaro is the polygynous family consisting of a man and his wife or wives and their children.

In addition a married daughter and her husband may live in the household until the birth of their first child. Following the birth the family will be expected to move to a new dwelling nearby.' <sup id="cite_ref-820" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-820">[820]</a></sup> Obligations to kin varied and were not organized through corporate kin groups: 'The basic Jivaro kin group is referred to as a "personal" bilateral kindred. In this type of kinship structure each person has a different kindred, with rights and obligations coinciding only with those of siblings of the same sex. Classification of kin, therefore, is spoken of as degrees of distance from ego, rather than in terms of membership or non-membership in a corporate unit as is quite often characteristic of unilineal descent societies. This form of kin group is probably the most insecure of the basic types of kinship systems for the individual, lacking defined descent groups affording protection from one's enemies and assistance in settling disputes among relatives (Harner, 1973: 97-98).' <sup id="cite_ref-821" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-821">[821]</a></sup> 'Information on the classification of Jivaro kinship terminology is scant in the anthropological literature. In a series of tables appearing in an article entitled "World Ethnographic Sample", in the American Anthropologist, 1957, George P. Murdock characterizes the Jivaro as having bifurcate merging avuncular terminology in which FaBr is equated with Fa, but MoBr is differentiated from both. He also states that cousin terminology is also unusual in that non-marriageable cross-cousins are equated with siblings, while marriageable cross-cousins are differentiated (Murdock, 1957: 673). In single-word or elementary kin terms the modifier "true" or "branch" is added to the term to pin down degrees of relationship to ego. Where specific relatives are involved the modifying terms can often be substituted for one another, depending on the degree of closeness of relationship that the speaker wishes to imply. "True" relationship modifiers are used for an individual's biological kin - grandparents, parents, siblings, children, cross-cousins, and fathers of his cross-cousins. Those relatives assigned the "branch" category are affinal kin who, prior to marrying, were not considered by ego to be relatives of any degree (Harner, 1973: 98).' <sup id="cite_ref-822" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-822">[822]</a></sup> Prestige could be obtained through hospitality: 'If a man clears the forest without the aid of neighbors, he tends to make small clearings at different times, while the rarer communal effort results in one large clearing. Whether [Page 49] the garden area is in a single clearing or several, its total size is heavily influenced by the number of wives a man has to cultivate the fields. A household with one wife tends to have a garden of about 50,000 square feet, while a second spouse increases the area to about 65,000, and a third to approximately 75,000. The areal increases are usually not simple multiples of the number of wives because the demand for food and beer to feed visitors tends to lag behind the increments in additional wives. These figures vary, of course, according to the consumption demands of the household, its number of visitors, and the industry of its inhabitants. A man who wishes to gain prestige may clear garden areas of larger size for each of his wives. In such a case, a household in which there are two wives may sometimes have a total garden of 100,000 square feet or more.' <sup id="cite_ref-823" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-823">[823]</a></sup> 'The importance of wives in producing food and beer goes far beyond the subsistence requirements of the household itself. Plural wives assure a surplus production which will make possible adequate entertainment of visitors from other households. The Jívaro place a high value on drinking beer and eating (perhaps in that order), so that one's status in a neighborhood is greatly affected by one's generosity with beer and food. No one can expect to have many friends unless he is a good host; and he cannot easily meet the requirements of good hospitality without plural wives as a labor force.' <sup id="cite_ref-824" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-824">[824]</a></sup> 'While the concept of the untä ideally encompasses all of the characteristics described, it is possible to acquire the designation with no formal qualifications other than simply having lived long enough to exhibit a few gray hairs and to have many grandchildren. Such an achievement receives respect as a sign of supernatural power, and an elderly untä of this sort is believed to have the ability to curse to death anyone who incurs his anger. No other kind of person is considered to possess this ability. Partly out of fear of being cursed, young men in the neighborhood assist him in land clearing and other tasks when he requests their aid. While the elderly untä's opinion is normally respected, he usually is not a real leader unless he is also outstanding as a killer, shaman, or good host. Thus the true “big men” are distinguished not only by longevity but by real leadership and generosity.' <sup id="cite_ref-825" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-825">[825]</a></sup> Warfare was also an important means of acquiring prestige: 'Given such factors as the absence of any formal political organization and even of unilineal descent groups, as well as the pervasive belief in shamanistically induced illness and death, the conflict over women, and the emphasis on retaliatory sanctions and feuding, it should not be unexpected that the leaders in Jívaro society are outstanding killers and shamans. Although such leadership is informal, almost all neighborhoods have at least one or two noted killers and a few superior shamans who are valued as protectors of their neighboring relatives, or at least of those with whom they are on friendly terms. Such leadership roles are earned and, in the case of the killers, acquired literally through life-and-death struggle.' <sup id="cite_ref-826" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-826">[826]</a></sup> 'It should be noted that the personal security which the Jívaro believe comes from killing has some social reality. A man who has killed repeatedly, called kakaram or “powerful one,” is rarely attacked because his enemies feel that the protection provided him by his constantly replaced souls would make any assassination attempt against him fruitless.' <sup id="cite_ref-827" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-827">[827]</a></sup> 'The outstanding killer gains prestige and social obligations by helping the people of his locality in eliminating their enemies. Such a man is known as kakaram (“powerful” or “powerful one”) and also, if he is not too youthful, as untä. He is believed to possess an unusually large quantity of arutam soul power (see pp. 135-43) (kakarma), which both protects him from death and is believed to drive him on to kill as often as possible.' <sup id="cite_ref-828" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-828">[828]</a></sup> 'The majority of young men interviewed expressed a strong desire to kill, not only to avenge the deaths of their fathers and other close relatives, but to acquire the arutam soul power and to become known, respected, and feared as kakaram. To be acknowledged as a kakaram, a man must have killed at least several persons. Early in his career, he does this by going on killing expeditions led by others, whether intra-tribal assassinations or the inter-tribal raids for tsantsa. As his reputation increases, he will eventually successfully organize and lead such an expedition himself, usually the more modest local assassination raid, probably against a specific personal enemy who is believed to have, sometime earlier, caused the death of a member of his immediate family. If he acquits himself well in achieving this assassination, especially as evidenced by firing the first shot into the victim, word will rapidly spread of his apparent power. Soon he will be approached by other men to lead them in killing expeditions against their own enemies. The kakaram, anxious to further his reputation as well as to gain additional supernatural power through more killing, rarely refuses such a request, even though it often means that he is agreeing to kill a fellow tribesman who is not even an enemy of his.' <sup id="cite_ref-829" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-829">[829]</a></sup> 'As his reputation grows, the kakaram tends to dress himself in elaborate feather headdresses and ornaments when visiting other households or receiving guests (see frontispiece). [Page 113] Similarly, he adopts an ever more forceful and aggressive style of speaking when receiving visitors, meeting others on the trail, or in visiting other men. He conveys the impression of being invincible in every aspect of his public demeanor. If he has a son, he encourages him to become a killer also, and instructs him to the extent of taking him on assassination expeditions even as early as the age of six or seven years. Although such a young boy will not yet take part in the actual killing, the father brings him up to the corpse after the murder and has him fire into it, with the father helping him hold the gun. The wives of such a kakaram also are expected to outperform other women in making superior pottery vessels, doing garden work and other aspects of household labor. Informants said that one way of looking at this was that since a kakaram is very much a man, his wives have to be very much women.' <sup id="cite_ref-830" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-830">[830]</a></sup> 'While a kakaram is greatly feared by his enemies, his neighbors usually look upon him as a great local asset, a deterrent to attacks upon them, and refer to him with the title untä (big) before his name, especially if he is also hospitable to them and generous with beer and food. Of course, there may be neighbors who get into a quarrel or other dispute with him; but they almost always move as soon as possible to another region of the tribe where they feel more secure. Thus there is a continual process of self-selection in terms of the composition of any neighborhood, which tends to reduce local antagonisms.' <sup id="cite_ref-831" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-831">[831]</a></sup> Harner provides a general description of informal leaders or 'big men': 'The most successful party-givers and hosts are those men who, in addition to having two or three wives to produce large amounts of beer and food, are respected by their neighbors for: their renown as killers in feuds and war, or as shamans; the achievement of age sufficient to have grand-children; and who are generally of an amiable, honest, and magnanimous nature when dealing with those who are not their enemies. A man who has most of these characteristics is referred to by the term untä, which means “big” or “old” man. The demeanor of party participants in the house of such a man tends to be more circumspect and respectful of the master of the house, and excesses such as arguments and brawls seem to occur less often.' <sup id="cite_ref-832" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-832">[832]</a></sup> Material possessions were considered to be indicative of prestige and power: 'Posts, beams, roof and walls are all lashed firmly together with strips of inner tree bark. Proceeding painstakingly, a man usually constructs a large and impressive structure capable of withstanding not only the natural elements and enemy attack, but also critical evaluation by his neighbors. The size and quality of a man's house is regarded as a serious indication of his personal “power,” kakarma.' <sup id="cite_ref-833" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-833">[833]</a></sup> But these differences in prestige and status did not translate into anything resembling a class system. In principle, property could be owned by anyone (see above).</dd></dl>

A wholesale revolt against the whites ensued, and several villages were completely annihilated. This, as I have already stated, was the fate that befell Sevilla de Oro, and the Spanish women living there were taken prisoners and carried off into the forest wilderness, where they became the mothers of subsequent Jivaro children.

In fact, the whole people is split up into a great number of tribes which in their turn are sub-divided into smaller clans or septs comprising a few families closely related to one another by blood. These sub-tribes do not form village communities; each family inhabits its own big communal house (héa), but these are not situated close to one another, they lie scattered here and there in the virgin forest. Generally one has to march for one or several hours to arrive at the next house. Each Jibaro house forms in fact a separate and independent social, political, and economic unit with its own household, its own plantations in the vicinity of the house, and its own ruler or chief, the oldest family father who, at any rate in time of peace, is not controlled by anybody. It is much the same feature that we meet in other parts of tropical South America, where the impenetrable virgin forests necessarily lead to social disintegration, which is further increased by the general anti-social tendencies of the Indians. The state of things found among the Jibaros, however, is in many respects unique.' <sup id="cite_ref-869" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-869">[869]</a></sup> Warfare was an important means of attaining prestige: “Among the Jibaros as we have seen each family father is theoretically absolute ruler over his house people, and in times of peace there is no recognized common chief even within the tribe, and still less any exercising authority over several tribes. The Jibaros have not even a proper name for a chief. The word capitu, which is sometimes used, is borrowed from the Spanish and is used principally to denote a white man of importance. It is only in times of war that a chieftainship exists; that is to say, during those great wars of extermination which are carried out against other Jibaro tribes. Such a temporary chief of war is generally only called únta, ‘the old one’, because the chiefs are nearly always old, experienced men who have killed many enemies and captured many heads. The small blood-feuds within the tribe, on the other hand, have a more private character and as a rule are not fought out under the leadership of a common chief.” <sup id="cite_ref-870" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-870">[870]</a></sup> “The authority of the chief elected for a war is very great. It is he alone who arranges everything for the expedition planned, who decides [268] about the time for and the mode of making the attack, and the younger warriors oblige themselves to obey him in everything. But as soon as a war has been carried to a successful end the power of the chief ceases, and he has, in spite of the great repute he always enjoys, no more authority or right to decide about the doings of his tribesmen than any other family-father among the Jibaros.” <sup id="cite_ref-871" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-871">[871]</a></sup> 'When a whole tribe, or perhaps several tribes together, prepare a war against one or more other tribes, the first thing done is to elect a common chief. He should be an elderly, experienced man, who has taken part in several wars, killed many enemies, and celebrated at least one victory feast. The rest of the warriors, who are generally younger men, swear him unlimited obedience. During the time the expedition is planned and the preparations are made, the warriors, and especially the chief, repeatedly drink maikoa or natéma to consult the spirits. They pay great attention to their dreams, even to those not produced under the direct influence of the narcotic drinks, tell them to each other, and discuss their possible significance. Only if they believe that they have received favourable answers and all omens are good are measures taken to carry out the war plan conceived. Meanwhile they try, through spies, to acquire as accurate a knowledge as possible about everything concerning the enemy: how many houses there are in the tract, how many fighting men in each house, if the houses are fortified, if the [283] men are well armed, and especially if they have firearms. All these and similar details the spies investigate by making trips into the country of the enemy and by stealing at night to the houses.

He conveys the impression of being invincible in every aspect of his public demeanor. If he has a son, he encourages him to become a killer also, and instructs him to the extent of taking him on assassination expeditions even as early as the age of six or seven years. Although such a young boy will not yet take part in the actual killing, the father brings him up to the corpse after the murder and has him fire into it, with the father helping him hold the gun. The wives of such a kakaram also are expected to outperform other women in making superior pottery vessels, doing garden work and other aspects of household labor. Informants said that one way of looking at this was that since a kakaram is very much a man, his wives have to be very much women.' <sup id="cite_ref-876" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-876">[876]</a></sup> 'While a kakaram is greatly feared by his enemies, his neighbors usually look upon him as a great local asset, a deterrent to attacks upon them, and refer to him with the title untä (big) before his name, especially if he is also hospitable to them and generous with beer and food. Of course, there may be neighbors who get into a quarrel or other dispute with him; but they almost always move as soon as possible to another region of the tribe where they feel more secure. Thus there is a continual process of self-selection in terms of the composition of any neighborhood, which tends to reduce local antagonisms.' <sup id="cite_ref-877" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-877">[877]</a></sup> Hospitality was also important: 'If a man clears the forest without the aid of neighbors, he tends to make small clearings at different times, while the rarer communal effort results in one large clearing. Whether [Page 49] the garden area is in a single clearing or several, its total size is heavily influenced by the number of wives a man has to cultivate the fields. A household with one wife tends to have a garden of about 50,000 square feet, while a second spouse increases the area to about 65,000, and a third to approximately 75,000. The areal increases are usually not simple multiples of the number of wives because the demand for food and beer to feed visitors tends to lag behind the increments in additional wives. These figures vary, of course, according to the consumption demands of the household, its number of visitors, and the industry of its inhabitants. A man who wishes to gain prestige may clear garden areas of larger size for each of his wives. In such a case, a household in which there are two wives may sometimes have a total garden of 100,000 square feet or more.' <sup id="cite_ref-878" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-878">[878]</a></sup> 'The importance of wives in producing food and beer goes far beyond the subsistence requirements of the household itself. Plural wives assure a surplus production which will make possible adequate entertainment of visitors from other households. The Jívaro place a high value on drinking beer and eating (perhaps in that order), so that one's status in a neighborhood is greatly affected by one's generosity with beer and food. No one can expect to have many friends unless he is a good host; and he cannot easily meet the requirements of good hospitality without plural wives as a labor force.' <sup id="cite_ref-879" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-879">[879]</a></sup> 'The most successful party-givers and hosts are those men who, in addition to having two or three wives to produce large amounts of beer and food, are respected by their neighbors for: their renown as killers in feuds and war, or as shamans; the achievement of age sufficient to have grand-children; and who are generally of an amiable, honest, and magnanimous nature when dealing with those who are not their enemies. A man who has most of these characteristics is referred to by the term untä, which means “big” or “old” man. The demeanor of party participants in the house of such a man tends to be more circumspect and respectful of the master of the house, and excesses such as arguments and brawls seem to occur less often.' <sup id="cite_ref-880" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-880">[880]</a></sup> 'While the concept of the untä ideally encompasses all of the characteristics described, it is possible to acquire the designation with no formal qualifications other than simply having lived long enough to exhibit a few gray hairs and to have many grandchildren. Such an achievement receives respect as a sign of supernatural power, and an elderly untä of this sort is believed to have the ability to curse to death anyone who incurs his anger. No other kind of person is considered to possess this ability. Partly out of fear of being cursed, young men in the neighborhood assist him in land clearing and other tasks when he requests their aid. While the elderly untä's opinion is normally respected, he usually is not a real leader unless he is also outstanding as a killer, shaman, or good host. Thus the true “big men” are distinguished not only by longevity but by real leadership and generosity.' <sup id="cite_ref-881" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-881">[881]</a></sup> The 'power' of an individual was thus reflected in his material possessions: 'Posts, beams, roof and walls are all lashed firmly together with strips of inner tree bark. Proceeding painstakingly, a man usually constructs a large and impressive structure capable of withstanding not only the natural elements and enemy attack, but also critical evaluation by his neighbors. The size and quality of a man's house is regarded as a serious indication of his personal “power,” kakarma.' <sup id="cite_ref-882" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-882">[882]</a></sup> However, these differences did not translate into a system of social classes or castes. Sons of leaders were considered to inherit the outstanding capacities of their fathers. However, this does not seem to imply a customary system of power transfer from father to son as individual achievement was still paramount: “The dignity of a chieftain is hereditary in a relative sense, in so far that the son of a chief is generally elected chief in time of war after his father has died or grown decrepit. This, however, can only take place if he has proved a valiant and skilled warrior and has killed enemies. No Jibaro is selected as a chief if he has not killed at least one enemy. The Jibaros have absolute faith in the heritability of prominent qualities, and ascribe extraordinary importance to education and the power of example. The son of a great chief, they say, must necessarily also become an able warrior because he is, as it were, a direct continuation of his father, has received a careful education for the deeds of war, and has always had the good example of his great father before his eyes.” <sup id="cite_ref-883" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-883">[883]</a></sup> Accordingly, this variable may not be applicable to the Shuar.</dd>

<p><b>♠ occupational mobility ♣ absent ♥</b> The Shuar were subsistence horticulturalists: 'The Jívaro have a tropical-forest agriculture, growing cassava, corn (maize), sweet potatoes, and other crops supplemented by the gathering of wild fruits, fishing, and hunting. The blowgun and poisoned darts are their chief weapons. Related families live in a single large community house rather than in a village.' <sup id="cite_ref-884" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-884">[884]</a></sup> 'Each household has either a single large garden or several smaller ones associated with it. In the latter case, the house itself is usually located in the largest. The Jivaro tend to cultivate slowly maturing tuberous plants, especially sweet manioc (Manihot Utilissima), all of which can be harvested over a long period of time providing agricultural products throughout the year.' <sup id="cite_ref-885" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-885">[885]</a></sup> 'In addition to sweet manioc, the Jivaro also grew maize, sweet potatoes, peanuts, tuber beans, macabo (Xanthosoma sp.), pumpkins, plantains, tobacco, cotton, and, later, the introduced species of banana, sugarcane, taro, and yam. To supplement their diet the Jivaro hunt, fish and forage for wild fruits, cacao, nuts, and other foods. At one time they hunted deer and tapir, but by the middle of the twentieth century they gave up eating these animals out of fear of the spirits residing in them. Hunting is done with bows and arrows, spears, atlatls, and blow guns for small game. Occasionally cheap trade guns, often muzzleloaders, are used in the chase. Larger game is hunted by groups of men accompanied by dogs. There is much magic associated with hunting, including the use of pepper in the eyes of hunters and dogs to improve vision. The Jivaro traditionally domesticated llamas and guinea pigs and later the introduced dog, chicken, and pig.' <sup id="cite_ref-886" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-886">[886]</a></sup> Division of labour was organized along gender lines: 'Men are responsible for protecting their families, house construction, basket making, different kinds of wood work, weapon manufacture, hunting and fishing, clearing the forest in preparation for the initial establishment of garden plots, and for cutting and bringing in fire wood. They also spin and weave and do some limited garden work. Women are responsible for the overwhelming majority of agricultural tasks, as well as for food and beer preparation, pottery making, fabric dyeing, child care, and the tending of the domestic animals (chiefly chickens and pigs).' <sup id="cite_ref-887" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-887">[887]</a></sup> 'Jivaro graphic art is limited and simple. Weaving and spinning is exclusively a man's task. Men spin yarn from home-grown cotton and dye it with vegetal solutions. The yarn is then woven on a back strap loom into  or cotton kilts that form the basis of men and women's clothing.' <sup id="cite_ref-888" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-888">[888]</a></sup> “Why do women dig yuca and the men fell trees? were questions Johnston asked me. He laboured under the common misapprehension that the women were slaves, and did the hardest work; but I had to explain otherwise. The Jivaros carry their sense of the personal, not only to animals, but also to trees and inanimate objects. In their eyes all things are animated by human spirits, male or female. The yuca has a female soul, hence it is proper for the women to cultivate it. Clay is feminine, therefore women must fashion the simple pottery which they use. Women must also handle the vessels when it comes to cooking. Most trees are men, hence men must chop them down. Cotton is of the male gender, so men must spin thread and make their own ‘itipis’ and also the ‘tarachi,’ or garments worn by the women. It is the sex distinction which is all important. Man and woman's work is as distinct as night from day, and the duties of one never overlap those of the other. There is not even a question of comparison between the two. A man is a man, and a woman a woman. That is their final argument.” <sup id="cite_ref-889" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-889">[889]</a></sup> Trade with Europeans operated through middlemen and was based on barter: 'The commercial activities of the Jivaro are very restricted. In the early days of European contact hogs and chickens were raised for sale to those of European background. Salt, a rare commodity in the region, was gathered in clay pots from a few brackish springs in the area, allowed to evaporate, and the resulting hardened ball of salt used in exchange transactions with neighboring tribal groups. The Jivaro were famous for the shrinking of the human heads (TSANTSA) of their enemies (actually only the skin). Passing out of Jivaro country through a series of exchanges, these heads eventually found their way into the hands of traders who brought them down the Amazon to Para where they were sold. Soon the traders had a burgeoning trade in these items, and the Jivaro were hard-put to keep up with the demand. The Indians were by no means particular as to whose head was used, and advance orders were taken and filled. Eventually this native "industry" was brought to a halt by the Ecuadorian and Peruvian governments although by the late twentieth century life-like replicas of the heads made from animal skins are still being sold commercially.' <sup id="cite_ref-890" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-890">[890]</a></sup> 'The few technological items that the Jivaro make are mostly used for their own subsistence needs, such as baskets, pottery, bows and arrows, blow guns, woven materials, etc. Any production of items above their immediate needs is employed in barter exchanges with neighboring people.' <sup id="cite_ref-891" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-891">[891]</a></sup> 'Much of the trade of the Jivaro is between the "interior", relatively isolated groups (particularly the Achuara) and those "frontier" groups living in close proximity to Ecuadorian settlements where they have easy access to Western industrialized products. Through a series of neighborhood-to-neighborhood relays by native trading partners (AMIGRI  ) these products were passed from the frontier Jivaro into the most remote parts of the tribal territory. Thus the interior Jivaro were supplied with steel cutting tools, firearms and ammunition without having to come into contact with the population of European ancestry. In exchange the frontier Jivaro, whose supply of local game was nearly exhausted, obtained hides, feathers and bird skins (used for ornaments), which were not readily available in their own territory.' <sup id="cite_ref-892" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-892">[892]</a></sup> Harner describes the development of trade relations between Shuar and frontier settlements: 'The Viceroy of Peru soon sent a new expedition of colonists, as well as soldiers, into the Jívaro territory. These newcomers engaged in trade with the Indians, made peace pacts with them, and began to exploit the rich placer gold deposits of the Paute, Zamora and Upano rivers and their tributaries. Experiencing great success in their gold mining activities, the Spaniards founded two major communities, described [Page 18] as “cities,” in 1552: Logroño, possibly at the junction of the Río Paute (and Río Upano) with the Río Zamora; and Sevilla del Oro, probably somewhere on the middle Río Upano.' <sup id="cite_ref-893" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-893">[893]</a></sup> 'With this initiation of trade relations between the two groups, Jívaro families soon migrated north from the Río Paute Valley to settle in the previously uninhabited land between the Rí Paute and Macas. These migrants began to act as middlemen in the barter of Jívaro products for steel machetes and other goods. The Macabeos at first traded mainly to secure pigs and salt obtained by the Jívaro from saline springs, but soon also began to attend tsantsa celebrations to purchase lard obtained from pigs slaughtered by the Jívaro on such occasions. As a consequence of their attendance at the feasts, the Macabeos started also to purchase tsantsa. This was the beginning of the “shrunken head” trade, and the first reported examples of tsantsa reached the outside world at about this time.' <sup id="cite_ref-894" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-894">[894]</a></sup> 'By 1956, the Jívaro west of the Cordillera de Cutucú were largely in direct, continuous contact with the Spanish-speaking Ecuadorian population. In this frontier zone, white soldiers and police had imposed the national laws on the Jívaro. White settlers had seized almost all of the land except that protected by the missionaries, and employed the Jívaro in wage labor. Missionaries, with the backing of law enforcement agencies, were putting the Jívaro children in boarding schools and enculturating them to the new, alien way of life. This direct, unremitted contact was tending to acculturate the frontier Jívaro to the national Ecuadorian way of life and the direction of the trend was towards eventual assimilation.' <sup id="cite_ref-895" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-895">[895]</a></sup> 'In contrast, the Jívaro beyond the frontier of colonization still were not yet in continuous first-hand contact with the white population at the time of the investigator's original fieldwork in 1956-57, and these are the people whose culture will be described here. Their territory, mainly east of the Cordillera de Cutucú, had been rarely, if ever, penetrated by any Spanish expedition or later group of Ecuadorian colonizers. This mountain barrier, which is traversed by an arduous [Page 35] journey of two or more days on foot, still discourages white penetration into the eastern interior.' <sup id="cite_ref-896" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-896">[896]</a></sup> 'Cases of contact between the interior Jívaro and whites are all very recent and highly localized in their occurrence. The largest intrusion was made by the Royal Dutch Shell Oil Corporation in the early 1940's as part of an ill-fated oil exploration project. The company constructed a small airstrip near the Río Pangui in the easternmost part of the Jívaro territory, but within a few years abandoned the site altogether when explorations failed to reveal economically exploitable oil deposits in the region. The project involved relatively limited interaction with the Jívaro.' <sup id="cite_ref-897" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-897">[897]</a></sup> 'The relative isolation of the interior Jívaro, however, had not prevented them from obtaining increasing quantities of machetes, steel axes, and shotguns. By means of neighborhood-to-neighborhood relays of native trading partners, these products of Western civilization were passed from the frontier Jívaro into the most remote parts of the tribal territory. All of the interior Jívaro neighborhoods were thus supplied with steel cutting tools, firearms, and ammunition without the necessity of coming into direct contact with the white population.' <sup id="cite_ref-898" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-898">[898]</a></sup> 'The growth of this trade in recent decades had been made possible by the increasing involvement of the frontier Jívaro in the Ecuadorian socio-economic structure. The frontier Jívaro, primarily through their employment by Ecuadorians in manual labor, had acquired quantities of factory-manufactured goods. At the same time, there was a shortage of native-type goods among the Jívaro on the frontier, partially because of the near exhaustion of local game, which supplied feathers and bird skins for ornament. The interior Jívaro, in contrast, had a much more abundant supply of game and native-produced goods, but a greater scarcity of steel cutting [Page 40] tools and firearms. These complementary inequalities in supply and demand between the frontier and interior Jívaro formed the basis for the trade that supplied the latter with European-type technological items. Such technological items constituted almost the sole aspects of Western civilization that had been adopted by the interior Jívaro in 1956-57.' <sup id="cite_ref-899" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-899">[899]</a></sup> 'The main variables introduced into interior Jívaro culture during the period studied were Western-manufactured trade goods, especially machetes, axes, and guns. Some machetes were acquired by the frontier Jívaro near Macas about a hundred years ago, but very few reached the interior Jívaro by intra-tribal trade until the turn of the century, and even these were so scarce and valued that their blades were each split into fragments to permit their utilization by several households. The more efficient steel blade fragments were at first used in the same manner as the aboriginal stone axe heads, each machete piece being mounted into a wooden handle. After the 1930's, however, machetes became sufficiently abundant so that the need to split the blades into small fragments was eliminated. They also largely replaced by then the traditional palm-wood “machetes” used in cutting down garden weeds. Despite their fair degree of availability at the present time, steel machetes are still highly valued and are used for many years, long after they have lost their handles and have become worn down to a fraction of their former size. Today they are considered to be utterly indispensable tools by the Jívaro, who also have been able to acquire some single-bitted steel axe-heads, although in much smaller numbers than the machetes.' <sup id="cite_ref-900" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-900">[900]</a></sup> 'Economic factors are also playing an important role in the rapidly changing life of these people. The Jívaro, as has been indicated earlier in this book, have long been anxious to acquire the technology and dress of Western civilization. Now that air transportation is available to most of the tribe, the only limit on Jívaro aspirations to acquire manufactured goods is their ability to acquire cash. Their model for such success is the cattle-raising Ecuadorian colonists west of the Cordillera de Cutucú, who have now converted most of the bottomlands of the Río Upano Valley into pasture with the aid of Jívaro labor. Air transport has made it profitable to ship beef to the highlands from there, and three local competing airlines are involved in the lucrative trade. Some Jívaro, with the strong encouragement of both Catholic and Protestant missionaries, are now clearing pasture land also for themselves to raise cattle and are starting to achieve success in acquiring substantial cash in exchange for beef.' <sup id="cite_ref-901" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-901">[901]</a></sup> 'Still, the Jívaro have clearly opted for adaptation to a Western life style and seem to have no brief for maintaining traditional features of their native life simply for tradition's sake alone. While they undoubtedly will wish to preserve and even revive certain aspects of their old culture within the context of a desire for an ethnic identity, at this moment in time they seem to be basically focused upon acquiring what they discern as the most positive features of the whites' life. Whether their eventual fate will parallel that of their North American counterparts, who went through similar attempts at adaptation in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, or whether the twentieth century will be kinder, is a question that remains to be answered.' <sup id="cite_ref-902" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-902">[902]</a></sup> The frontier Shuar became involved in rubber-tapping as well as unskilled temporary labour: 'There is no specific mention of direct involvement by Achuarä in rubber tapping at this time, although a census of the Pastaza and its tributaries in 1905 records two caucheros in residence on the Huasaga and an estimated 150 Achuarä in its vicinity (Fuentes 1908/I:194). However, it is clear that by 1917 at least some Achuarä were participating actively in such work. In that year, Rafael Karsten, a Scandinavian ethnographer, visited an Achuarä community in the company of their cauchero patrón, over a day's walk inland from another western tributary of the Pastaza, the Río Tunigrama (Karsten 1935:43).' <sup id="cite_ref-903" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-903">[903]</a></sup> 'Historically the most persistent external pressure on the entire area occupied by the Jivaroan populations has been along the western frontier of Shuarä territory in Ecuador, in the Upano River Valley where the town of Macas is situated. By 1887, the Upano was observed to be suffering a shortage of game as a result of the presence of collectors of cinchona bark (for quinine) and other tropical products, who descended into the region from the Ecuadorian highlands (Vacas Galindo 1895:28-29). Many of the collectors worked primarily out of Macas, employing its non-Indian residents but occasionally enlisting the labor of Jívaro inhabitants of the valley in exchange for guns and other trade items (Harner 1972:30). Shuarä who had migrated there earlier in efforts to establish direct access to Western manufactures at Macas, found that with the stepping up of commercial activity in the valley and the initiation of cattle ranching at Macas, there was reduced demand for items they had formerly provided in exchange-deer, pigs, and native salt-although shrunken heads were still a greatly desired commodity (Harner 1972:29; Karsten 1935:56). In order to sustain their supply of manufactured trade goods, some of the Indians cut pastures for the Macabeos (Harner 1972:29); others, as observed, engaged in the extractive industry.' <sup id="cite_ref-904" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-904">[904]</a></sup> Accordingly, that region was hit economically by the crash of the rubber market: 'However, with the crash of the rubber market, the commercial pressure on Indian populations-more attenuated here than elsewhere (Harner 1972:30)-was diminished. The cauchero whom Karsten encountered on the Pastaza working with inland Achuarä in 1917, was gone on Karsten's return trip in 1929 (Karsten 1935:41, 43, 78). Furthermore, numbers of Peruvian military outposts that had served to oversee commercial activity were withdrawn (Karsten 1935:43, 78; Zanabria Zamudio 1969:157, 159, 195), and access to the entire Pastaza region was gradually curtailed. A Catholic missionary reported in 1928 that “the steamships of Iquitos which periodically make the service to the Alto Marañon, do not enter [the Pastaza], since it is almost completely lacking in civilized people and all exploitation of goma [latex] has been suspended because of the depreciation” (Misiones Pasionistas 1943:264).' <sup id="cite_ref-905" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-905">[905]</a></sup> 'Many sources of Western goods did vanish when the sudden depreciation in the value of wild Amazonian latex resulted in a major cutback in foreign investment and in the cessation of steamship transport to the region gradually coming to be occupied by Achuarä in Peru. However, commercial contact with the area was not wholly terminated. Some rubber extractors and colonists chose to remain after the crash as frontier agriculturalists or patrones of the Indians in the exploitation of other natural products. Furthermore, neither Peru nor Ecuador was fully willing to relinquish a tenuous hold over the northern tributaries of the Marañon and the as yet untapped resources to be found there.' <sup id="cite_ref-906" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-906">[906]</a></sup> However, there was no professional specialization among the Shuar at the time.

<p><b>♠ Proportion of population enslaved ♣ 0 ♥</b>&nbsp;% Occasionally, women were taken captive during raids, but according to the sources reviewed so far, this was not a common occurrence in inter-tribal warfare: 'The victorious enemy wreaks his savage vengeance not only upon the fighting men, but also on old people, women, and small children, nay, sometimes even on the domestic animals. Although there are many statements-from the very time of the Spaniards-to the effect that younger women, and especially girls, are spared in the wars of the Jibaros, we must not take this to be the general rule. It is true that there is a scarcity of women in the Jibaro society and that in general they are held in great esteem on account of the work they do. But it must be remembered that the Jibaros are essentially endogamous, members of foreign tribes being detested and looked upon as natural enemies. Besides, experience has taught the Indians that full-grown women of a vanquished tribe cannot always be made to submit to a victor who has perhaps cruelly killed their husbands, fathers, or brothers, but that they retain an invincible hatred against him. There are, in consequence, instances of the wives of vanquished enemies being carried home by the victors only to be brutally massacred. Young girls can more easily be brought up to become loyal wives and members of the victor's tribe.' <sup id="cite_ref-907" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-907">[907]</a></sup> 'Closely connected with this antagonism between the different Jibaro tribes is their marked endogamy. Marriages are, as a rule, only contracted between persons belonging to families related to each other and socially united. When it has been said that they, like other Indians, particularly make war against other tribes for the sake of procuring women, ( ) the wives of the vanquished enemies regularly becoming the wives of their victors, this clearly involves an exaggeration. The Jibaros fear and detest strange tribes-especially of their own nation -and do not set foot in their dominions except with inimical intentions. How the Jibaros regard exogamous marriages, or sexual relations with members of strange tribes in general, may be inferred from the fact that if a widow or some other woman has been made pregnant by a man belonging to another tribe, the woman is compelled to kill the child as soon as it is born, if it is a boy, ‘in order that the strange man may not leave offspring within the tribe’. The relations to strange tribes will be dealt with again in connection with the wars of the Indians. For the moment it is important to point out that the Jibaros are not likely to take their wives from tribes whom they regard as mortal enemies; such cases rather form exceptions than the rule.' <sup id="cite_ref-908" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-908">[908]</a></sup>  'Heads are taken of all victims, regardless of age or sex. A man may seize an Achuara girl or woman as a captive to try to take her home to be an extra wife, but usually he is unsuccessful in this because one of his companions kills her on the homeward trail to secure a head trophy.' <sup id="cite_ref-909" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-909">[909]</a></sup> Dyott reports that on at least one occasion, Spanish women were taken captive by Shuar in the colonial period: 'In the sixteenth century, when a few Spanish settlements flourished in what is now called the Ecuadorean Oriente, the Indians resented the slavery imposed upon them by the Spanish invaders, and finally united in a combined effort to rid themselves of their common foe, who seemed to be endangering their existence. A wholesale revolt against the whites ensued, and several villages were completely annihilated. This, as I have already stated, was the fate that befell Sevilla de Oro, and the Spanish women living there were taken prisoners and carried off into the forest wilderness, where they became the mothers of subsequent Jivaro children. This infusion of Spanish blood shows itself in the bearded faces which are occasionally met with in this area.”' <sup id="cite_ref-910" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-910">[910]</a></sup> It appears that their offspring were not treated any differently from other Shuar. However, wife capture could be considered to be a form of sexual slavery. More material may be needed. We have coded 'absent' for the time being, but this is open to review.

And although the Jibaro Indian does not particularly practise [292] methods of torturing his vanquished enemy, caught in a war, he on the other hand does not content himself with merely taking his life. He wants to shed as much blood as possible and delights in mutilating the body of the slain enemy, being especially anxious to secure his head. The scene of a battle between Jibaro Indians therefore generally offers a dreadful spectacle of a savage lust of destruction and thirst for blood.' <sup id="cite_ref-911" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-911">[911]</a></sup> 'The primary motivation for warfare is to secure as many human heads as possible from an alien tribe, and secondarily to capture women. The acquisition of territory had never been a motive for engaging in warfare. The war party, consisting of approximately thirty or forty men, is recruited from the community itself or from friendly neighborhoods nearby, and is usually led by the  or  as war leader or chief. Actual warfare consists of preliminary ceremonies involving ritualized chanting, surprise attacks against one or two enemy houses, the killing and decapitation of the inhabitants or the occasional capture of a girl or woman as an extra wife, and the preparation of the  on the return to the home village. Unlike many of the warlike Amazon tribes captives are not tortured or sacrificed, nor is cannibalism practiced.' <sup id="cite_ref-912" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-912">[912]</a></sup> 'There is a “gray” area in which the patterns of feuding and war overlap to a limited degree. This seems to be a reflection of such factors as the absence of a tribal political structure, the intermittent escalation of intra-tribal feuding, and the relative isolation of many neighborhoods from one another. Thus, while full-fledged head-taking raids are only launched against other groups “that speak differently,” i.e., have different dialects or languages, such as the Achuara, the assassination of a man belonging to a very distant neighborhood within the tribe may be followed occasionally by the taking of his head or by taking hair from his head to make a tsantsa with a tree gourd (see pp. 147-48). The latter type of tsantsa may also be made with the hair of a victim from a closer neighborhood provided that enmity towards its population is extremely strong in the killer's own locality.' <sup id="cite_ref-913" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-913">[913]</a></sup></dd></dl>

</p><p><b>♠ Description of the Normative Ideology ♣ ♥</b> eHRAF provides a general summary: 'Jivaro religion is based on the idea of an impersonal supernatural power called TSARUTAMA  , a concept similar to the Polynesians belief in MANA  . Objects, persons, spirits, and especially the TSANTSAS   are all infused with varying degrees of TSARUTAMA   which can be used for either good or evil. The mountain Rain God, the Anaconda, the Sun, Moon, Earth, and the chonta palm, are all believed to possess great amounts of this power.' <sup id="cite_ref-914" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-914">[914]</a></sup> 'In addition to the above the Jivaro recognize three kinds of souls: the ARUTAM WAKANI  , which they believe to be the most significant; the MUISAK  , or avenging soul; and the NEKAS WAKANI  , the "true", "real", or "ordinary" soul. An individual is not born with an ARUTAM   soul but it is acquired through a vision quest in which fasting, cold water "bathing" and hallucinogenic drugs are used. This "quest" takes place for a boy about the age of six. The possessor of a single ARUTAM   soul is thought to be immune to death by physical means or sorcery, but can die of natural causes. Those individuals lucky enough to have two ARUTAM   souls cannot die of any cause.' <sup id="cite_ref-915" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-915">[915]</a></sup> 'There are no gods who play ethical or moral roles in the Jivaro pantheon, nor are there any priests or other religious specialist except the shaman (UWISIN  ) whose primary role in the society is magical curing, although he also has the power to send illness into an individual as a form of sorcery (Service, 1958: 196). Lacking true political organization, the shaman may be the most influential individual in the community frequently acting the role of KAKARAM   as well as shaman.' <sup id="cite_ref-916" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-916">[916]</a></sup> 'Beyond the ritualized chanting that takes place before a raiding expedition, as mentioned above, the only other major ceremony taking place among the Jivaro is the TSANTSA   feast, a great victory celebration taking place in the home village following a successful head-hunting raid. Since food and drink are offered to the invited guests at these celebrations in great quantity, a great strain is put on the economic resources of the head-takers and their families so frequently the TSANTSA   feast may be spread over a period of two to three years during which resources are rebuilt. From the Jivaro's point of view the primary purpose of the TSANTSA feast is not necessarily supernatural, although that is generally recognized as a secondary purpose; but to acquire prestige, friendship, and obligations through being recognized as an accomplished warrior, and through the feasting, by being a generous host to as many neighbors as possible (Harner, 1972: 191-192).' <sup id="cite_ref-917" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-917">[917]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Rulers are legitimated by gods ♣ absent ♥</b>
</p><p><b>♠ Rulers control supernatural energy ♣ present ♥</b> Shuar political authority was informal and decentralized: 'Local groups among the Jivaro are spread over such a large area in the Amazon basin that each has become completely independent of each other. Each JIVARIA or community is autonomous, although alliances between several JIVARIAS in a district may take place, but mostly for the purposes of warfare. There is a tendency for several communities to be related to each other by blood and affinal kinship ties because of the rule of local exogamy, which requires that a man marry a woman from a village other than his own. There is, therefore, a more or less natural grouping of contiguous communities into a loose tribe, but cooperation among them is almost entirely limited to collaboration in feuds or in head-hunting against more distant and unrelated communities (Service, 1958: 190).' <sup id="cite_ref-918" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-918">[918]</a></sup> 'Each community is politically independent with its own headman. Each is also located four or more kilometers from their nearest neighboring community. The community is made up of patrilineally and affinally related individuals, traditionally consisting of from 80 to 300 people (30 to 40 people in the twentieth century), living in one house called a JIVARIA. For defensive purposes, this house is built on a steep hill usually at the upper end of a stream. The house itself is approximately 13 meters by 26 meters in size, elliptical in shape, and has a thatched roof. In times of war, two or more communities united to fight a common enemy, as was the case when the Spanish attempted to conquer them.' <sup id="cite_ref-919" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-919">[919]</a></sup> “From the statements I have previously made as to the distribution of the Jibaro tribes it appears that their social organization is loose. In fact, the whole people is split up into a great number of tribes which in their turn are sub-divided into smaller clans or septs comprising a few families closely related to one another by blood. These sub-tribes do not form village communities; each family inhabits its own big communal house (héa), but these are not situated close to one another, they lie scattered here and there in the virgin forest. Generally one has to march for one or several hours to arrive at the next house. Each Jibaro house forms in fact a separate and independent social, political, and economic unit with its own household, its own plantations in the vicinity of the house, and its own ruler or chief, the oldest family father who, at any rate in time of peace, is not controlled by anybody. It is much the same feature that we meet in other parts of tropical South America, where the impenetrable virgin forests necessarily lead to social disintegration, which is further increased by the general anti-social tendencies of the Indians. The state of things found among the Jibaros, however, is in many respects unique.' <sup id="cite_ref-920" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-920">[920]</a></sup> Social control operated through fear of sorcery and retaliation: 'Fear of sorcery and incurring the wrath of the UNYÄ   act as restraining elements of social control in the Jivaro community. In this society the code of lex talionis holds true so that anti-social acts directed against members of the community will result in assured retaliation by the victim's family. Thus, the fear of reprisal also acts as a means of aggression control in the society.' <sup id="cite_ref-921" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-921">[921]</a></sup> More prominent leaders emerged during times of war, but their position was temporary: “There is no permanent chief for the different geographical groups. (Each cluster of houses is named after the rivulets where they are situated, as for instance the Patucas, the Yurupazas, the Yaupis.) The family head is the highest authority and his power is limited to the members of his house. Only in time of war are chiefs appointed for larger units, but their power is provisional and confined to the war-period only.” <sup id="cite_ref-922" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-922">[922]</a></sup>  “Among the Jibaros as we have seen each family father is theoretically absolute ruler over his house people, and in times of peace there is no recognized common chief even within the tribe, and still less any exercising authority over several tribes. The Jibaros have not even a proper name for a chief. The word capitu, which is sometimes used, is borrowed from the Spanish and is used principally to denote a white man of importance. It is only in times of war that a chieftainship exists; that is to say, during those great wars of extermination which are carried out against other Jibaro tribes. Such a temporary chief of war is generally only called únta, ‘the old one’, because the chiefs are nearly always old, experienced men who have killed many enemies and captured many heads. The small blood-feuds within the tribe, on the other hand, have a more private character and as a rule are not fought out under the leadership of a common chief.” <sup id="cite_ref-923" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-923">[923]</a></sup> “The authority of the chief elected for a war is very great. It is he alone who arranges everything for the expedition planned, who decides [268] about the time for and the mode of making the attack, and the younger warriors oblige themselves to obey him in everything. But as soon as a war has been carried to a successful end the power of the chief ceases, and he has, in spite of the great repute he always enjoys, no more authority or right to decide about the doings of his tribesmen than any other family-father among the Jibaros.” <sup id="cite_ref-924" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-924">[924]</a></sup> 'When a whole tribe, or perhaps several tribes together, prepare a war against one or more other tribes, the first thing done is to elect a common chief. He should be an elderly, experienced man, who has taken part in several wars, killed many enemies, and celebrated at least one victory feast. The rest of the warriors, who are generally younger men, swear him unlimited obedience. During the time the expedition is planned and the preparations are made, the warriors, and especially the chief, repeatedly drink maikoa or natéma to consult the spirits. They pay great attention to their dreams, even to those not produced under the direct influence of the narcotic drinks, tell them to each other, and discuss their possible significance. Only if they believe that they have received favourable answers and all omens are good are measures taken to carry out the war plan conceived. Meanwhile they try, through spies, to acquire as accurate a knowledge as possible about everything concerning the enemy: how many houses there are in the tract, how many fighting men in each house, if the houses are fortified, if the [283] men are well armed, and especially if they have firearms. All these and similar details the spies investigate by making trips into the country of the enemy and by stealing at night to the houses. Everything is prepared [Page 282-283] with the greatest secrecy possible, so that the enemy is caught unprepared, for otherwise he will have time to take measures of defence that may defeat the whole undertaking.” <sup id="cite_ref-925" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-925">[925]</a></sup> Leaders were thought to be spiritually powerful: 'It should be noted that the personal security which the Jívaro believe comes from killing has some social reality. A man who has killed repeatedly, called kakaram or “powerful one,” is rarely attacked because his enemies feel that the protection provided him by his constantly replaced souls would make any assassination attempt against him fruitless.' <sup id="cite_ref-926" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-926">[926]</a></sup> This 'power' was derived from their experience in warfare: 'Given such factors as the absence of any formal political organization and even of unilineal descent groups, as well as the pervasive belief in shamanistically induced illness and death, the conflict over women, and the emphasis on retaliatory sanctions and feuding, it should not be unexpected that the leaders in Jívaro society are outstanding killers and shamans. Although such leadership is informal, almost all neighborhoods have at least one or two noted killers and a few superior shamans who are valued as protectors of their neighboring relatives, or at least of those with whom they are on friendly terms. Such leadership roles are earned and, in the case of the killers, acquired literally through life-and-death struggle.' <sup id="cite_ref-927" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-927">[927]</a></sup> 'The outstanding killer gains prestige and social obligations by helping the people of his locality in eliminating their enemies. Such a man is known as kakaram (“powerful” or “powerful one”) and also, if he is not too youthful, as untä. He is believed to possess an unusually large quantity of arutam soul power (see pp. 135-43) (kakarma), which both protects him from death and is believed to drive him on to kill as often as possible.' <sup id="cite_ref-928" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-928">[928]</a></sup> 'The majority of young men interviewed expressed a strong desire to kill, not only to avenge the deaths of their fathers and other close relatives, but to acquire the arutam soul power and to become known, respected, and feared as kakaram. To be acknowledged as a kakaram, a man must have killed at least several persons. Early in his career, he does this by going on killing expeditions led by others, whether intra-tribal assassinations or the inter-tribal raids for tsantsa. As his reputation increases, he will eventually successfully organize and lead such an expedition himself, usually the more modest local assassination raid, probably against a specific personal enemy who is believed to have, sometime earlier, caused the death of a member of his immediate family. If he acquits himself well in achieving this assassination, especially as evidenced by firing the first shot into the victim, word will rapidly spread of his apparent power. Soon he will be approached by other men to lead them in killing expeditions against their own enemies. The kakaram, anxious to further his reputation as well as to gain additional supernatural power through more killing, rarely refuses such a request, even though it often means that he is agreeing to kill a fellow tribesman who is not even an enemy of his.' <sup id="cite_ref-929" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-929">[929]</a></sup> 'As his reputation grows, the kakaram tends to dress himself in elaborate feather headdresses and ornaments when visiting other households or receiving guests (see frontispiece). [Page 113] Similarly, he adopts an ever more forceful and aggressive style of speaking when receiving visitors, meeting others on the trail, or in visiting other men. He conveys the impression of being invincible in every aspect of his public demeanor. If he has a son, he encourages him to become a killer also, and instructs him to the extent of taking him on assassination expeditions even as early as the age of six or seven years. Although such a young boy will not yet take part in the actual killing, the father brings him up to the corpse after the murder and has him fire into it, with the father helping him hold the gun. The wives of such a kakaram also are expected to outperform other women in making superior pottery vessels, doing garden work and other aspects of household labor. Informants said that one way of looking at this was that since a kakaram is very much a man, his wives have to be very much women.' <sup id="cite_ref-930" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-930">[930]</a></sup> 'While a kakaram is greatly feared by his enemies, his neighbors usually look upon him as a great local asset, a deterrent to attacks upon them, and refer to him with the title untä (big) before his name, especially if he is also hospitable to them and generous with beer and food. Of course, there may be neighbors who get into a quarrel or other dispute with him; but they almost always move as soon as possible to another region of the tribe where they feel more secure. Thus there is a continual process of self-selection in terms of the composition of any neighborhood, which tends to reduce local antagonisms.' <sup id="cite_ref-931" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-931">[931]</a></sup> These qualities were thought to be hereditary: “The dignity of a chieftain is hereditary in a relative sense, in so far that the son of a chief is generally elected chief in time of war after his father has died or grown decrepit. This, however, can only take place if he has proved a valiant and skilled warrior and has killed enemies. No Jibaro is selected as a chief if he has not killed at least one enemy. The Jibaros have absolute faith in the heritability of prominent qualities, and ascribe extraordinary importance to education and the power of example. The son of a great chief, they say, must necessarily also become an able warrior because he is, as it were, a direct continuation of his father, has received a careful education for the deeds of war, and has always had the good example of his great father before his eyes.” <sup id="cite_ref-932" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-932">[932]</a></sup> 'Power' was also reflected in a man's material possessions and therefore his abilities as a host: 'Posts, beams, roof and walls are all lashed firmly together with strips of inner tree bark. Proceeding painstakingly, a man usually constructs a large and impressive structure capable of withstanding not only the natural elements and enemy attack, but also critical evaluation by his neighbors. The size and quality of a man's house is regarded as a serious indication of his personal “power,” kakarma.' <sup id="cite_ref-933" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-933">[933]</a></sup> 'If a man clears the forest without the aid of neighbors, he tends to make small clearings at different times, while the rarer communal effort results in one large clearing. Whether [Page 49] the garden area is in a single clearing or several, its total size is heavily influenced by the number of wives a man has to cultivate the fields. A household with one wife tends to have a garden of about 50,000 square feet, while a second spouse increases the area to about 65,000, and a third to approximately 75,000. The areal increases are usually not simple multiples of the number of wives because the demand for food and beer to feed visitors tends to lag behind the increments in additional wives. These figures vary, of course, according to the consumption demands of the household, its number of visitors, and the industry of its inhabitants. A man who wishes to gain prestige may clear garden areas of larger size for each of his wives. In such a case, a household in which there are two wives may sometimes have a total garden of 100,000 square feet or more.' <sup id="cite_ref-934" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-934">[934]</a></sup> 'The importance of wives in producing food and beer goes far beyond the subsistence requirements of the household itself. Plural wives assure a surplus production which will make possible adequate entertainment of visitors from other households. The Jívaro place a high value on drinking beer and eating (perhaps in that order), so that one's status in a neighborhood is greatly affected by one's generosity with beer and food. No one can expect to have many friends unless he is a good host; and he cannot easily meet the requirements of good hospitality without plural wives as a labor force.' <sup id="cite_ref-935" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-935">[935]</a></sup> 'The most successful party-givers and hosts are those men who, in addition to having two or three wives to produce large amounts of beer and food, are respected by their neighbors for: their renown as killers in feuds and war, or as shamans; the achievement of age sufficient to have grand-children; and who are generally of an amiable, honest, and magnanimous nature when dealing with those who are not their enemies. A man who has most of these characteristics is referred to by the term untä, which means “big” or “old” man. The demeanor of party participants in the house of such a man tends to be more circumspect and respectful of the master of the house, and excesses such as arguments and brawls seem to occur less often.' <sup id="cite_ref-936" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-936">[936]</a></sup> eHRAF and Harner provide general descriptions of 'big men': 'The Jivaro lack any formal political organization, although an informal form of leadership is found in the role of individuals referred to as UNYÄ  ("big" or "old" men) or KAKARAM   ("powerful" or "powerful ones") who are renown as killers in feuds or war, or exercise important shamanistic powers in the community. These individuals acquire their reputation in the community by being old enough to have grandchildren, and are friendly, honest, and generous in dealing with others in the society. Because of these characteristics the UNYÄ   or KAKARAM   are believed to possess great ARUTAM   soul power and the ability to curse to death anyone who incurs their anger. Generally most neighborhoods have at least one or two UNYÄ   as well as a few superior shamans who provide protection for their relatives or other individuals with whom they are on friendly terms.' <sup id="cite_ref-937" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-937">[937]</a></sup> 'While the concept of the untä ideally encompasses all of the characteristics described, it is possible to acquire the designation with no formal qualifications other than simply having lived long enough to exhibit a few gray hairs and to have many grandchildren. Such an achievement receives respect as a sign of supernatural power, and an elderly untä of this sort is believed to have the ability to curse to death anyone who incurs his anger. No other kind of person is considered to possess this ability. Partly out of fear of being cursed, young men in the neighborhood assist him in land clearing and other tasks when he requests their aid. While the elderly untä's opinion is normally respected, he usually is not a real leader unless he is also outstanding as a killer, shaman, or good host. Thus the true “big men” are distinguished not only by longevity but by real leadership and generosity.' <sup id="cite_ref-938" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-938">[938]</a></sup>

Occasionally another relative such as a widowed mother or unmarried brother of the household head will also be included. In addition a married daughter and her husband may live in the household until the birth of their first child. Following the birth the family will be expected to move to a new dwelling nearby.' <sup id="cite_ref-940" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-940">[940]</a></sup> Obligations to kin varied and were not organized through corporate kin groups: 'The basic Jivaro kin group is referred to as a "personal" bilateral kindred. In this type of kinship structure each person has a different kindred, with rights and obligations coinciding only with those of siblings of the same sex. Classification of kin, therefore, is spoken of as degrees of distance from ego, rather than in terms of membership or non-membership in a corporate unit as is quite often characteristic of unilineal descent societies. This form of kin group is probably the most insecure of the basic types of kinship systems for the individual, lacking defined descent groups affording protection from one's enemies and assistance in settling disputes among relatives (Harner, 1973: 97-98).' <sup id="cite_ref-941" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-941">[941]</a></sup> 'Information on the classification of Jivaro kinship terminology is scant in the anthropological literature. In a series of tables appearing in an article entitled "World Ethnographic Sample", in the American Anthropologist, 1957, George P. Murdock characterizes the Jivaro as having bifurcate merging avuncular terminology in which FaBr is equated with Fa, but MoBr is differentiated from both. He also states that cousin terminology is also unusual in that non-marriageable cross-cousins are equated with siblings, while marriageable cross-cousins are differentiated (Murdock, 1957: 673). In single-word or elementary kin terms the modifier "true" or "branch" is added to the term to pin down degrees of relationship to ego. Where specific relatives are involved the modifying terms can often be substituted for one another, depending on the degree of closeness of relationship that the speaker wishes to imply. "True" relationship modifiers are used for an individual's biological kin - grandparents, parents, siblings, children, cross-cousins, and fathers of his cross-cousins. Those relatives assigned the "branch" category are affinal kin who, prior to marrying, were not considered by ego to be relatives of any degree (Harner, 1973: 98).' <sup id="cite_ref-942" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-942">[942]</a></sup> Prestige could be obtained through hospitality: 'If a man clears the forest without the aid of neighbors, he tends to make small clearings at different times, while the rarer communal effort results in one large clearing.

Early in his career, he does this by going on killing expeditions led by others, whether intra-tribal assassinations or the inter-tribal raids for tsantsa.

Of course, there may be neighbors who get into a quarrel or other dispute with him; but they almost always move as soon as possible to another region of the tribe where they feel more secure.

A man who has most of these characteristics is referred to by the term untä, which means “big” or “old” man.

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Ideological thought equates rulers and commoners ♣ absent ♥</b> Authority was fluid and informal: “There is no permanent chief for the different geographical groups. (Each cluster of houses is named after the rivulets where they are situated, as for instance the Patucas, the Yurupazas, the Yaupis.) The family head is the highest authority and his power is limited to the members of his house. Only in time of war are chiefs appointed for larger units, but their power is provisional and confined to the war-period only.” <sup id="cite_ref-954" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-954">[954]</a></sup> 'Each community is politically independent with its own headman. Each is also located four or more kilometers from their nearest neighboring community. The community is made up of patrilineally and affinally related individuals, traditionally consisting of from 80 to 300 people (30 to 40 people in the twentieth century), living in one house called a JIVARIA. For defensive purposes, this house is built on a steep hill usually at the upper end of a stream. The house itself is approximately 13 meters by 26 meters in size, elliptical in shape, and has a thatched roof. In times of war, two or more communities united to fight a common enemy, as was the case when the Spanish attempted to conquer them.' <sup id="cite_ref-955" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-955">[955]</a></sup> '“From the statements I have previously made as to the distribution of the Jibaro tribes it appears that their social organization is loose. In fact, the whole people is split up into a great number of tribes which in their turn are sub-divided into smaller clans or septs comprising a few families closely related to one another by blood. These sub-tribes do not form village communities; each family inhabits its own big communal house (héa), but these are not situated close to one another, they lie scattered here and there in the virgin forest. Generally one has to march for one or several hours to arrive at the next house. Each Jibaro house forms in fact a separate and independent social, political, and economic unit with its own household, its own plantations in the vicinity of the house, and its own ruler or chief, the oldest family father who, at any rate in time of peace, is not controlled by anybody. It is much the same feature that we meet in other parts of tropical South America, where the impenetrable virgin forests necessarily lead to social disintegration, which is further increased by the general anti-social tendencies of the Indians. The state of things found among the Jibaros, however, is in many respects unique.' <sup id="cite_ref-956" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-956">[956]</a></sup> Warfare was an important means of attaining prestige: “Among the Jibaros as we have seen each family father is theoretically absolute ruler over his house people, and in times of peace there is no recognized common chief even within the tribe, and still less any exercising authority over several tribes. The Jibaros have not even a proper name for a chief. The word capitu, which is sometimes used, is borrowed from the Spanish and is used principally to denote a white man of importance. It is only in times of war that a chieftainship exists; that is to say, during those great wars of extermination which are carried out against other Jibaro tribes. Such a temporary chief of war is generally only called únta, ‘the old one’, because the chiefs are nearly always old, experienced men who have killed many enemies and captured many heads. The small blood-feuds within the tribe, on the other hand, have a more private character and as a rule are not fought out under the leadership of a common chief.” <sup id="cite_ref-957" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-957">[957]</a></sup> “The authority of the chief elected for a war is very great. It is he alone who arranges everything for the expedition planned, who decides [268] about the time for and the mode of making the attack, and the younger warriors oblige themselves to obey him in everything. But as soon as a war has been carried to a successful end the power of the chief ceases, and he has, in spite of the great repute he always enjoys, no more authority or right to decide about the doings of his tribesmen than any other family-father among the Jibaros.” <sup id="cite_ref-958" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-958">[958]</a></sup> 'When a whole tribe, or perhaps several tribes together, prepare a war against one or more other tribes, the first thing done is to elect a common chief. He should be an elderly, experienced man, who has taken part in several wars, killed many enemies, and celebrated at least one victory feast. The rest of the warriors, who are generally younger men, swear him unlimited obedience. During the time the expedition is planned and the preparations are made, the warriors, and especially the chief, repeatedly drink maikoa or natéma to consult the spirits. They pay great attention to their dreams, even to those not produced under the direct influence of the narcotic drinks, tell them to each other, and discuss their possible significance. Only if they believe that they have received favourable answers and all omens are good are measures taken to carry out the war plan conceived. Meanwhile they try, through spies, to acquire as accurate a knowledge as possible about everything concerning the enemy: how many houses there are in the tract, how many fighting men in each house, if the houses are fortified, if the [283] men are well armed, and especially if they have firearms. All these and similar details the spies investigate by making trips into the country of the enemy and by stealing at night to the houses. Everything is prepared [Page 282-283] with the greatest secrecy possible, so that the enemy is caught unprepared, for otherwise he will have time to take measures of defence that may defeat the whole undertaking.” <sup id="cite_ref-959" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-959">[959]</a></sup> Successful war-leaders were considered to be spiritually powerful: 'It should be noted that the personal security which the Jívaro believe comes from killing has some social reality.

Whether [Page 49] the garden area is in a single clearing or several, its total size is heavily influenced by the number of wives a man has to cultivate the fields. A household with one wife tends to have a garden of about 50,000 square feet, while a second spouse increases the area to about 65,000, and a third to approximately 75,000. The areal increases are usually not simple multiples of the number of wives because the demand for food and beer to feed visitors tends to lag behind the increments in additional wives. These figures vary, of course, according to the consumption demands of the household, its number of visitors, and the industry of its inhabitants. A man who wishes to gain prestige may clear garden areas of larger size for each of his wives. In such a case, a household in which there are two wives may sometimes have a total garden of 100,000 square feet or more.' <sup id="cite_ref-965" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-965">[965]</a></sup> 'The importance of wives in producing food and beer goes far beyond the subsistence requirements of the household itself. Plural wives assure a surplus production which will make possible adequate entertainment of visitors from other households. The Jívaro place a high value on drinking beer and eating (perhaps in that order), so that one's status in a neighborhood is greatly affected by one's generosity with beer and food. No one can expect to have many friends unless he is a good host; and he cannot easily meet the requirements of good hospitality without plural wives as a labor force.' <sup id="cite_ref-966" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-966">[966]</a></sup> 'The most successful party-givers and hosts are those men who, in addition to having two or three wives to produce large amounts of beer and food, are respected by their neighbors for: their renown as killers in feuds and war, or as shamans; the achievement of age sufficient to have grand-children; and who are generally of an amiable, honest, and magnanimous nature when dealing with those who are not their enemies.

Such an achievement receives respect as a sign of supernatural power, and an elderly untä of this sort is believed to have the ability to curse to death anyone who incurs his anger. No other kind of person is considered to possess this ability. Partly out of fear of being cursed, young men in the neighborhood assist him in land clearing and other tasks when he requests their aid. While the elderly untä's opinion is normally respected, he usually is not a real leader unless he is also outstanding as a killer, shaman, or good host. Thus the true “big men” are distinguished not only by longevity but by real leadership and generosity.' <sup id="cite_ref-968" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-968">[968]</a></sup> The 'power' of an individual was thus reflected in his material possessions: 'Posts, beams, roof and walls are all lashed firmly together with strips of inner tree bark.

The size and quality of a man's house is regarded as a serious indication of his personal “power,” kakarma.' <sup id="cite_ref-969" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-969">[969]</a></sup> However, these differences did not translate into a system of social classes or castes. Sons of leaders were considered to inherit the outstanding capacities of their fathers. However, this does not seem to imply a customary system of power transfer from father to son as individual achievement was still paramount: “The dignity of a chieftain is hereditary in a relative sense, in so far that the son of a chief is generally elected chief in time of war after his father has died or grown decrepit. This, however, can only take place if he has proved a valiant and skilled warrior and has killed enemies. No Jibaro is selected as a chief if he has not killed at least one enemy. The Jibaros have absolute faith in the heritability of prominent qualities, and ascribe extraordinary importance to education and the power of example. The son of a great chief, they say, must necessarily also become an able warrior because he is, as it were, a direct continuation of his father, has received a careful education for the deeds of war, and has always had the good example of his great father before his eyes.” <sup id="cite_ref-970" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-970">[970]</a></sup> The 'spirital' and 'powerful' qualities attributed to leaders militate against an 'ideological equation' of leaders and 'commoners', despite the absence of cearly defined social classes in Shuar society.</dd>

A wholesale revolt against the whites ensued, and several villages were completely annihilated. This, as I have already stated, was the fate that befell Sevilla de Oro, and the Spanish women living there were taken prisoners and carried off into the forest wilderness, where they became the mothers of subsequent Jivaro children. This infusion of Spanish blood shows itself in the bearded faces which are occasionally met with in this area.” <sup id="cite_ref-971" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-971">[971]</a></sup> It appears that the offspring of these women were not treated any differently from other Shuar.</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Ideological thought distinguishes men and women ♣ present ♥</b> Polygyny was common: 'Polygyny is common, with men preferring to have two or more wives who contribute to the subsistence productivity of the household primarily in terms of food production and the preparation of manioc beer. This emphasis on polygyny partly reflects the disproportionate ratio of adult females to males in the society (2:1) largely as a consequence of the high mortality of men as the result of warfare. A man's first wife, preferably an unmarried cross cousin of post-puberty age, is courted, and with her consent, the marriage is concluded with the payment of a bride price or by the performance of bride service to the girl's family. There is no formal marriage ceremony. Additional wives may be obtained by capture on a raid, or the man may purchase a pre-adolescent girl from her father or brother and raise her in his house prior to the actual consummation of the marriage. Sometimes a pregnant woman and her husband will agree to "reserve" their unborn child, if female, for the man as a future wife. This practice results in marriages with substantial age differences between husband and wife.' <sup id="cite_ref-972" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-972">[972]</a></sup> 'The basic domestic unit among the Jivaro is the polygynous family consisting of a man and his wife or wives and their children. Occasionally another relative such as a widowed mother or unmarried brother of the household head will also be included. In addition a married daughter and her husband may live in the household until the birth of their first child. Following the birth the family will be expected to move to a new dwelling nearby.' <sup id="cite_ref-973" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-973">[973]</a></sup> 'Assured and proud, the Jívaro moves in the consciousness of his freedom. The naked, well-proportioned forms of the men are handsome; the women, on the other hand, are small and heavy-set, but good-natured and at most seductive in their earliest youth, but with advancing age terribly ugly, and all the more so as they are then less modest and expose their bodies, disfigured by hard labor, more to the eye. The color of the well-tended skin is a light red-brown for all, as is peculiar to the Indians of the highlands. This difference is often ascribed to mixture with the women abducted during the destruction of the Spanish cities, 333 but the dirtiness of the Quechua Indians may play a not unimportant role in this. The facial expression is usually good-natured and intelligent. The wives were always treated with kindness, their advice sought in almost all negotiations, and the children are allowed to do what they please. I say wives, for seldom does a Jívaro content himself with one partner for life; he has two, three, or four and cannot understand at all that his polygamy is unlawful, since he takes care of his wives and children, whereas the moralistic Christian preachers all too gladly shun these duties. Sometimes several women with their children live in one and the same house; sometimes the lord and master has several houses far from one another and has his wife or wives in each of them. The bond of marriage is kept holy; in the case of adultery the husband has the right to kill his wife. The institution of polygyny, no matter how reprehensible it may be from our standpoint, surely is justified under the conditions that we find among the Jívaros. In the case of a wandering, warlike people which frequently changes residence and in which the individual tribes, indeed, even the individual families, live in war and conflict, the man must always be ready to defend his person and his property; he must [Page 12] 333 cont. practice the use of weapons, live for battle and the hunt. Because of the highly developed sense of freedom of this nation, no one wants to be a servant; there can be no prisoners of war reduced to slavery because of the method of warfare to be discussed forthwith. Who is supposed to till the fields? Who is to perform all the tasks which do not befit the dignity of a warrior? It seems to me that a number of recognized wives are better than a swarm of servant maids subject to the despotism of the master! The men fell the trees, erect the house, and prepare a piece of land for cultivation; the cultivation of the field, always lying in the forest at some distance from the dwelling, like all other work, falls to the women.' <sup id="cite_ref-974" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-974">[974]</a></sup> Levirate marriage was also practiced: 'The Jivaro also observe the practice of the levirate. At the death of a man, the brother who is closest to him in age takes care of the widow and children. Although it is not required that she become his wife, she frequently does so.' <sup id="cite_ref-975" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-975">[975]</a></sup> Labour was divided along gender lines: 'The division of labor falls along the usual gender lines. Men are responsible for protecting their families, house construction, basket making, different kinds of wood work, weapon manufacture, hunting and fishing, clearing the forest in preparation for the initial establishment of garden plots, and for cutting and bringing in fire wood. They also spin and weave and do some limited garden work. Women are responsible for the overwhelming majority of agricultural tasks, as well as for food and beer preparation, pottery making, fabric dyeing, child care, and the tending of the domestic animals (chiefly chickens and pigs).' <sup id="cite_ref-976" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-976">[976]</a></sup> “Why do women dig yuca and the men fell trees? were questions Johnston asked me. He laboured under the common misapprehension that the women were slaves, and did the hardest work; but I had to explain otherwise. The Jivaros carry their sense of the personal, not only to animals, but also to trees and inanimate objects. In their eyes all things are animated by human spirits, male or female. The yuca has a female soul, hence it is proper for the women to cultivate it. Clay is feminine, therefore women must fashion the simple pottery which they use. Women must also handle the vessels when it comes to cooking. Most trees are men, hence men must chop them down. Cotton is of the male gender, so men must spin thread and make their own ‘itipis’ and also the ‘tarachi,’ or garments worn by the women. It is the sex distinction which is all important. Man and woman's work is as distinct as night from day, and the duties of one never overlap those of the other. There is not even a question of comparison between the two. A man is a man, and a woman a woman. That is their final argument.” <sup id="cite_ref-977" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-977">[977]</a></sup> However, both men and women owned and inherited property: 'Property acquired during a man's lifetime generally consists of the house he has built, artifacts that he has made or received as gifts, game and fish that he has caught, and specific crops, such as maize, that he has raised. At his death these items are inherited by his son of post-puberty age, or if there is none, then by his eldest brother. This brother also has the right to inherit the deceased's wife or wives. If there is no surviving brother, then his eldest parallel cousin is entitled to inherit the wife or wives.' <sup id="cite_ref-978" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-978">[978]</a></sup> 'A woman's property also consists of the artifacts she has made or received as gifts, wild food she has gathered, the crops that she is cultivating or has harvested, the section of the garden in which these crops are grown (in the case of several wives), and the pigs and chickens that she raises. She may also own pottery clay deposits, if they are near her home, and is the discoverer and primary excavator of these deposits (Harner, 1973: 179). This property is inherited by her eldest daughter, but if there is none, the deceased woman's mother will inherit the possessions. In cases where there is no mother or daughter, a sister of the deceased may ask for the goods, otherwise the widower will retain the possessions to give to a future wife.' <sup id="cite_ref-979" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-979">[979]</a></sup> See also property and inheritance variables. It appears that there were no female headmen or warriors (for information on leadership, see variables on chief executive). Accordingly, the acquisition of arutam souls was considered to be less essential for women than for men: 'A person is not born with an arutam soul. Such a soul must be acquired, and in certain traditional ways. The acquisition of this type of soul is considered to be so important to an adult male's survival that a boy's parents do not expect him to live past puberty without one. Women sometimes obtain arutam souls, but it is not considered so essential for them. One reason is that intra-tribal killing, the most common source of violent death, is primarily directed at adult males rather than at women and children.' <sup id="cite_ref-980" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-980">[980]</a></sup> Accordingly, we have provisionally coded 'present', but this is open to review.</dd>

<p><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of inequality ♣ absent ♥</b>
</p><p><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of monogamy ♣ absent ♥</b> Obligations to kin varied and were not organized through corporate descent groups: 'The basic Jivaro kin group is referred to as a "personal" bilateral kindred. In this type of kinship structure each person has a different kindred, with rights and obligations coinciding only with those of siblings of the same sex. Classification of kin, therefore, is spoken of as degrees of distance from ego, rather than in terms of membership or non-membership in a corporate unit as is quite often characteristic of unilineal descent societies. This form of kin group is probably the most insecure of the basic types of kinship systems for the individual, lacking defined descent groups affording protection from one's enemies and assistance in settling disputes among relatives (Harner, 1973: 97-98).' <sup id="cite_ref-981" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-981">[981]</a></sup> 'Information on the classification of Jivaro kinship terminology is scant in the anthropological literature. In a series of tables appearing in an article entitled "World Ethnographic Sample", in the American Anthropologist, 1957, George P. Murdock characterizes the Jivaro as having bifurcate merging avuncular terminology in which FaBr is equated with Fa, but MoBr is differentiated from both. He also states that cousin terminology is also unusual in that non-marriageable cross-cousins are equated with siblings, while marriageable cross-cousins are differentiated (Murdock, 1957: 673). In single-word or elementary kin terms the modifier "true" or "branch" is added to the term to pin down degrees of relationship to ego. Where specific relatives are involved the modifying terms can often be substituted for one another, depending on the degree of closeness of relationship that the speaker wishes to imply. "True" relationship modifiers are used for an individual's biological kin - grandparents, parents, siblings, children, cross-cousins, and fathers of his cross-cousins. Those relatives assigned the "branch" category are affinal kin who, prior to marrying, were not considered by ego to be relatives of any degree (Harner, 1973: 98).' <sup id="cite_ref-982" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-982">[982]</a></sup> Polygyny was common: 'The basic domestic unit among the Jivaro is the polygynous family consisting of a man and his wife or wives and their children. Occasionally another relative such as a widowed mother or unmarried brother of the household head will also be included. In addition a married daughter and her husband may live in the household until the birth of their first child. Following the birth the family will be expected to move to a new dwelling nearby.' <sup id="cite_ref-983" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-983">[983]</a></sup> 'Polygyny is common, with men preferring to have two or more wives who contribute to the subsistence productivity of the household primarily in terms of food production and the preparation of manioc beer. This emphasis on polygyny partly reflects the disproportionate ratio of adult females to males in the society (2:1) largely as a consequence of the high mortality of men as the result of warfare. A man's first wife, preferably an unmarried cross cousin of post-puberty age, is courted, and with her consent, the marriage is concluded with the payment of a bride price or by the performance of bride service to the girl's family. There is no formal marriage ceremony. Additional wives may be obtained by capture on a raid, or the man may purchase a pre-adolescent girl from her father or brother and raise her in his house prior to the actual consummation of the marriage. Sometimes a pregnant woman and her husband will agree to "reserve" their unborn child, if female, for the man as a future wife. This practice results in marriages with substantial age differences between husband and wife.' <sup id="cite_ref-984" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-984">[984]</a></sup> 'Assured and proud, the Jívaro moves in the consciousness of his freedom. The naked, well-proportioned forms of the men are handsome; the women, on the other hand, are small and heavy-set, but good-natured and at most seductive in their earliest youth, but with advancing age terribly ugly, and all the more so as they are then less modest and expose their bodies, disfigured by hard labor, more to the eye. The color of the well-tended skin is a light red-brown for all, as is peculiar to the Indians of the highlands. This difference is often ascribed to mixture with the women abducted during the destruction of the Spanish cities, 333 but the dirtiness of the Quechua Indians may play a not unimportant role in this. The facial expression is usually good-natured and intelligent. The wives were always treated with kindness, their advice sought in almost all negotiations, and the children are allowed to do what they please. I say wives, for seldom does a Jívaro content himself with one partner for life; he has two, three, or four and cannot understand at all that his polygamy is unlawful, since he takes care of his wives and children, whereas the moralistic Christian preachers all too gladly shun these duties. Sometimes several women with their children live in one and the same house; sometimes the lord and master has several houses far from one another and has his wife or wives in each of them. The bond of marriage is kept holy; in the case of adultery the husband has the right to kill his wife. The institution of polygyny, no matter how reprehensible it may be from our standpoint, surely is justified under the conditions that we find among the Jívaros. In the case of a wandering, warlike people which frequently changes residence and in which the individual tribes, indeed, even the individual families, live in war and conflict, the man must always be ready to defend his person and his property; he must [Page 12] 333 cont. practice the use of weapons, live for battle and the hunt. Because of the highly developed sense of freedom of this nation, no one wants to be a servant; there can be no prisoners of war reduced to slavery because of the method of warfare to be discussed forthwith. Who is supposed to till the fields? Who is to perform all the tasks which do not befit the dignity of a warrior? It seems to me that a number of recognized wives are better than a swarm of servant maids subject to the despotism of the master! The men fell the trees, erect the house, and prepare a piece of land for cultivation; the cultivation of the field, always lying in the forest at some distance from the dwelling, like all other work, falls to the women.' <sup id="cite_ref-985" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-985">[985]</a></sup> Marriage to a group of sisters was preferred: 'Polygyny is preferred in the sororal form because sisters are reputed to get along better with one another. A man normally hopes that his father-in-law (iči) eventually will give him all the latter's daughters as wives. Accordingly, the son-in-law's conscientious post-marital bride-service is usually performed to keep his wife's father favorably impressed, so that he will provide such additional brides. Thus men occasionally may obtain several sisters as wives. In such cases, the man is assured of an outstanding production of beer and food and, presumably, a relatively tranquil polygynous family.' <sup id="cite_ref-986" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-986">[986]</a></sup> 'Wives who are sisters usually work out a hierarchical relationship, with the eldest (characteristically the first bride) assuming direction of activities within the house. The second wife, likewise, somewhat dominates the third, and so on. Still, each wife has her own section of the garden which she exclusively works, her own cook-fire, bed, and pottery vessels. Not uncommonly, when a man marries a widow who has an unmarried daughter, the daughter will eventually, and casually, become his second wife. In such cases of stepdaughter marriage, the mother tends to retain a relatively dominant position over her daughter. The situation is usually more individualistic in the case of wives who are not sisters or mothers and daughters. These tend to be too antagonistic to submit to a consistent dominant-subordinate relationship in household activities.' <sup id="cite_ref-987" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-987">[987]</a></sup> 'The most difficult situation tends to occur when a husband brings home a new wife who is not a sister of his pre-existing wife (wives). Since he is already married, he cannot practice temporary matrilocality at the house of his new wife's parents, and thus he must introduce her into a household where the other adult female(s) will tend to be antagonistic. Usually the husband attempts to bring the bride in unannounced so as to take his other wife (wives) by surprise, and tries to act as though the new wife is just a routine addition to the household. Reportedly, however, it is common for an irate pre-existing wife to unleash a temper tantrum, throwing pottery vessels and other handy artifacts at the husband. She may also soon be engaging in quarrels and hair-pullings with the new addition, but normally life in the dwelling gradually settles down, particularly after the new wife has a baby.' <sup id="cite_ref-988" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-988">[988]</a></sup> Cross-cousins were preferred as partners: 'The only kinswoman with whom marriage is formally sanctioned is a cross-cousin (wahe) from either parent's side of the family. A man does have the alternative of finding a marriage partner outside of his kindred, but this normally requires him to move out of his home neighborhood (because of the practice of temporary matrilocality) and consequently to live among strangers who may be intent on killing him for some earlier wrong by one of his kinsmen or simply because he took one of their own preferred potential mates. Slightly over half of actual marriages are with cross-cousins.' <sup id="cite_ref-989" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-989">[989]</a></sup> 'With the normatively unrestricted practice of polygyny creating a high demand for unattached women throughout interior Jívaro society, the preference for cross-cousin marriage promotes conflict in the nuclear family when brothers become old enough to marry, for they all share the same few preferred mates. Not surprisingly, many of the disputes among kinsmen thus arise between brothers over the question of [Page 96] wife acquisition, and the practice of matrilocal residence tends to isolate the brothers from one another. In fact, the norm is for a married man to side with his iči (father-in-law and father of cross-cousins) and sai (wife's brothers and male cross-cousins) in disputes against his own consanguineal relatives. The potential reward of obtaining more daughters as wives from his father-in-law often acts as an additional, but unspoken, inducement for a man to take the side of his in-laws in a quarrel.' <sup id="cite_ref-990" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-990">[990]</a></sup> Levirate marriage was also practiced: 'The Jivaro also observe the practice of the levirate. At the death of a man, the brother who is closest to him in age takes care of the widow and children. Although it is not required that she become his wife, she frequently does so.' <sup id="cite_ref-991" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-991">[991]</a></sup> Harner reports that adultery was common, but may have increased later on: 'While young single men are the chief philanderers, young married men also commonly have a penchant for such activities. Under the guise of going hunting, they may visit the houses of other men who are also away hunting and arrange to rendezvous regularly with a wife of the absent husband in the forest near the garden. This kind of activity is so common that husbands sometimes build a special kind of tampunčï “adulterer trap” near the garden of the suspected wife, which is so designed that a bent sapling will strike the unwanted visitor in the stomach or groin. However, this type of tampunčï, unlike that used against mortal enemies, does not have body-penetrating bamboo spikes.' <sup id="cite_ref-992" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-992">[992]</a></sup> 'Married women reportedly respond often with less enthusiasm when approached by a would-be lover who is also married, “because they do not want to share him with other women.” Thus, when a young man is visiting a distant neighborhood where he is relatively unknown, and a woman asks him if he is married, he commonly responds negatively.' <sup id="cite_ref-993" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-993">[993]</a></sup> 'When a man has a number of wives, his difficulty in preventing [Page 107] them from engaging in extramarital affairs is believed by the Jívaro to be proportional to their numbers. Of one man, who had a record six wives, an informant said, “He must have eyes in the back of his head.” A jealous husband, when he leaves the house, sometimes lectures his wives not to engage in sexual relations with any men, saying that he will learn of it if they do. It is not uncommon for such a man to leave a son or daughter in the house to spy on their own mother and to inform him if she speaks to any men.' <sup id="cite_ref-994" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-994">[994]</a></sup> 'The rise in adultery is attributed to the tendency of young men not to work as hard as in former decades and instead to spend their time visiting other households to drink beer, look for sexual partners, and perhaps obtain trade goods through making “friends.” This increase in intra-neighborhood visiting and shamanism may be due to the greater leisure time available for the men since the introduction of steel cutting tools, but informants themselves primarily ascribe the trends in visiting and shamanism to the young men's fixation on the acquisition of the “white man's valuables,” particularly firearms, and a resultant de-emphasis on hard physical work, especially in land clearing.' <sup id="cite_ref-995" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-995">[995]</a></sup> Harner claims that sexual licence was practiced during feasts: 'Since the head-taking raids are directed at the Achuara and others “who live far away,” the victim whose head is the focal point of the celebration normally is viewed by everyone in the head-taker's neighborhood as an “enemy.” Accordingly, it is the unique occasion for the members of many Jívaro households to get together to reaffirm their common identity and unity. Under such circumstances, it is not surprising that the tsantsa feast is participated in with great joy and a cumulative sense of euphoria. Of course, the huge quantities of strong manioc beer help, as do the ritual circle dances (wainči), which continue from dusk to dawn night after night. The bountiful quantities of meat and garden foods add to the sense of well-being. It is also a time of relative sexual license, as I had occasion to observe during the one tsantsa feast that I attended. Liaisons are arranged discreetly by both unmarried and married individuals, who rendezvous in the forest surrounding the house.' <sup id="cite_ref-996" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-996">[996]</a></sup> 'While such hansematä songs have a courtship function between single persons, they are sung by all the dancers, including married persons dancing with the spouses of others. As the drinking and dancing proceed, flirtatious behavior may become overt, extending to pinching and other familiarities in the dim light. The quantities of beer drunk require frequent exits from the house to urinate, and not uncommonly a female, exiting from the women's end of the house, will rendezvous secretly with a male, who has left from the opposite door, to satisfy a call of nature different from that [Page 110] which was their publicly implied intention. As the drunkenness develops, men may get into arguments over normally repressed grievances or over allegedly flirtatious behavior with someone else's wife. Wrestling may ensue, or even hitting with a convenient palm wood slat. However, most parties do not involve such unpleasantness and end rather calmly as some of the participants pass out from drinking and exhaustion. If the head of the household has thus collapsed, a wife or daughter of his may make her way to an unmarried visitor's bed and spend part of the night with him.' <sup id="cite_ref-997" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-997">[997]</a></sup> Adultery was punished through self-help justice and revenge: 'Sexual offenses, with the exception of wife-stealing, normally do not involve the sanction of homicide. The punishment varies in specific instances, but most commonly consists of slashing the forehead and scalp of the offender with a machete. [Page 175] Ordinarily, the aggrieved party administers the punishment personally while several relatives hold the victim. The slashing is usually done without much care, and sometimes the offender dies, although this result is not intended. In the case of premarital sexual intercourse, the punishment is administered to the girl and her lover by the girl's father. In the case of adultery, a man primarily punishes his wife's lover, and a woman primarily punishes her husband.' <sup id="cite_ref-998" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-998">[998]</a></sup> 'When a man learns that another has had sexual relations with his wife, he has the right to cut her lover's scalp whether he discovered him in the act or not. Unlike the punishment for murder, this cutting is usually administered immediately by the aggrieved party, accompanied by several of his kinsmen, normally brothers, parallel or cross-cousins, or his father. If the adulterer flees to a distant neighborhood or otherwise prevents them from punishing him, then the aggrieved party may, in his anger, kill the father of the adulterer, or, if he is not living, a brother or cousin (parallel or cross).' <sup id="cite_ref-999" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-999">[999]</a></sup> 'Even if the punishers are successful in their slashing of the offender's forehead or scalp, they and their close relatives usually remain angry with the family of the offender and refuse to speak to them. After about two years, the offender is also expected to pay the husband a toucan feather headband [Page 176] of the tawaspä type (worth approximately one shotgun) and strings of beads. This formally terminates the matter.' <sup id="cite_ref-1000" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1000">[1,000]</a></sup> 'Seduction of one's wife by one's brother usually does not seem to be considered quite as grave an offense as ordinary adultery. It still warrants a slashing of the offender's head, but the cutting sometimes is done with just a toucan beak instead of a machete. An offender who is a brother of the husband never has to pay anything in addition.' <sup id="cite_ref-1001" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1001">[1,001]</a></sup> 'In cases where the husband discovers the offense at the moment of commission, his anger affects the degree of variability from the norm in the actual manner of punishment. Thus sometimes the husband may kill the offender or mutilate the genitalia of the woman. Ordinarily, however, the wife is not punished, particularly when she is not caught in the act and when she is the one who informs the husband of the incident.' <sup id="cite_ref-1002" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1002">[1,002]</a></sup> 'Rape is not recognized as such and informants could recall no case of a woman violently resisting sexual intercourse. They said that a man would never commit such an act if the woman resisted, because she would tell her family and they would then punish him. Also, it seems that both men and women tend to regard adultery as a spicy diversion, whose attraction seems to be sufficient to make rape unnecessary.' <sup id="cite_ref-1003" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1003">[1,003]</a></sup> 'A woman has the right to punish a husband guilty of adultery. If she actually discovers him in the act, she is expected to slash his scalp with a machete. She rarely attacks the other woman. The husband thus slashed goes to live at the house of his father, or of an avuncular relative called father, or of a brother. Usually after about a month, his wife sends him the message that if he wants to return to her, he should do so immediately or she will cut his head again. If [Page 177] she does not thus invite him to return, however, he remains separated.' <sup id="cite_ref-1004" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1004">[1,004]</a></sup> 'If a man repeatedly commits adultery, his wife has the right to poison him. Of course, the brothers and other close relatives of the man will attempt to murder her in retaliation. Poisoning is also the sanction against a woman who deserts her husband. Desertion of a wife by a man is virtually unheard of, except when she is implacably hostile towards him, in which case it is proper for him to leave.' <sup id="cite_ref-1005" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1005">[1,005]</a></sup> Adultery was considered to be spiritually dangerous to young children: 'No couvade is observed by the new father. Rather, he can go forth daily to hunt game and, if he has no other wife, he takes on the responsibility of fetching water, digging up the manioc in the garden, washing it in the stream, and carrying it into the house. There it is cooked by his recuperating wife, who is not supposed to undertake other household or garden tasks for about two weeks. If she should fail to rest adequately for such a period, it is believed that she will be bedridden for a long time, due to becoming sick from “handling cold water,” such as when washing the manioc. In order to protect the health of the baby, both parents observe certain dietary restrictions, such as avoiding eating any birds that forage close to the ground, or consuming the entrails of any animal. It is also believed that if either parent engages in extramarital sexual relations during the child's infancy, the infant will die, vomiting.' <sup id="cite_ref-1006" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1006">[1,006]</a></sup> Occasionally, wives were acquired through raids, but according to the sources reviewed so far, this was not a common occurrence in inter-tribal warfare due to the normative status of endogamy: 'The victorious enemy wreaks his savage vengeance not only upon the fighting men, but also on old people, women, and small children, nay, sometimes even on the domestic animals. Although there are many statements-from the very time of the Spaniards-to the effect that younger women, and especially girls, are spared in the wars of the Jibaros, we must not take this to be the general rule. It is true that there is a scarcity of women in the Jibaro society and that in general they are held in great esteem on account of the work they do. But it must be remembered that the Jibaros are essentially endogamous, members of foreign tribes being detested and looked upon as natural enemies. Besides, experience has taught the Indians that full-grown women of a vanquished tribe cannot always be made to submit to a victor who has perhaps cruelly killed their husbands, fathers, or brothers, but that they retain an invincible hatred against him. There are, in consequence, instances of the wives of vanquished enemies being carried home by the victors only to be brutally massacred. Young girls can more easily be brought up to become loyal wives and members of the victor's tribe.' <sup id="cite_ref-1007" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1007">[1,007]</a></sup> 'Closely connected with this antagonism between the different Jibaro tribes is their marked endogamy. Marriages are, as a rule, only contracted between persons belonging to families related to each other and socially united. When it has been said that they, like other Indians, particularly make war against other tribes for the sake of procuring women, ( ) the wives of the vanquished enemies regularly becoming the wives of their victors, this clearly involves an exaggeration. The Jibaros fear and detest strange tribes-especially of their own nation -and do not set foot in their dominions except with inimical intentions. How the Jibaros regard exogamous marriages, or sexual relations with members of strange tribes in general, may be inferred from the fact that if a widow or some other woman has been made pregnant by a man belonging to another tribe, the woman is compelled to kill the child as soon as it is born, if it is a boy, ‘in order that the strange man may not leave offspring within the tribe’. The relations to strange tribes will be dealt with again in connection with the wars of the Indians. For the moment it is important to point out that the Jibaros are not likely to take their wives from tribes whom they regard as mortal enemies; such cases rather form exceptions than the rule.' <sup id="cite_ref-1008" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1008">[1,008]</a></sup>  'Heads are taken of all victims, regardless of age or sex. A man may seize an Achuara girl or woman as a captive to try to take her home to be an extra wife, but usually he is unsuccessful in this because one of his companions kills her on the homeward trail to secure a head trophy.' <sup id="cite_ref-1009" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1009">[1,009]</a></sup> But Dyott reports that Spanish women were taken captive in the 16th century: 'In the sixteenth century, when a few Spanish settlements flourished in what is now called the Ecuadorean Oriente, the Indians resented the slavery imposed upon them by the Spanish invaders, and finally united in a combined effort to rid themselves of their common foe, who seemed to be endangering their existence. A wholesale revolt against the whites ensued, and several villages were completely annihilated. This, as I have already stated, was the fate that befell Sevilla de Oro, and the Spanish women living there were taken prisoners and carried off into the forest wilderness, where they became the mothers of subsequent Jivaro children. This infusion of Spanish blood shows itself in the bearded faces which are occasionally met with in this area.” <sup id="cite_ref-1010" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1010">[1,010]</a></sup>

Each is also located four or more kilometers from their nearest neighboring community. The community is made up of patrilineally and affinally related individuals, traditionally consisting of from 80 to 300 people (30 to 40 people in the twentieth century), living in one house called a JIVARIA. For defensive purposes, this house is built on a steep hill usually at the upper end of a stream. The house itself is approximately 13 meters by 26 meters in size, elliptical in shape, and has a thatched roof. In times of war, two or more communities united to fight a common enemy, as was the case when the Spanish attempted to conquer them.' <sup id="cite_ref-1011" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1011">[1,011]</a></sup> 'The basic domestic unit among the Jivaro is the polygynous family consisting of a man and his wife or wives and their children.

In this type of kinship structure each person has a different kindred, with rights and obligations coinciding only with those of siblings of the same sex. Classification of kin, therefore, is spoken of as degrees of distance from ego, rather than in terms of membership or non-membership in a corporate unit as is quite often characteristic of unilineal descent societies. This form of kin group is probably the most insecure of the basic types of kinship systems for the individual, lacking defined descent groups affording protection from one's enemies and assistance in settling disputes among relatives (Harner, 1973: 97-98).' <sup id="cite_ref-1013" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1013">[1,013]</a></sup> 'Information on the classification of Jivaro kinship terminology is scant in the anthropological literature. In a series of tables appearing in an article entitled "World Ethnographic Sample", in the American Anthropologist, 1957, George P. Murdock characterizes the Jivaro as having bifurcate merging avuncular terminology in which FaBr is equated with Fa, but MoBr is differentiated from both. He also states that cousin terminology is also unusual in that non-marriageable cross-cousins are equated with siblings, while marriageable cross-cousins are differentiated (Murdock, 1957: 673). In single-word or elementary kin terms the modifier "true" or "branch" is added to the term to pin down degrees of relationship to ego. Where specific relatives are involved the modifying terms can often be substituted for one another, depending on the degree of closeness of relationship that the speaker wishes to imply. "True" relationship modifiers are used for an individual's biological kin - grandparents, parents, siblings, children, cross-cousins, and fathers of his cross-cousins. Those relatives assigned the "branch" category are affinal kin who, prior to marrying, were not considered by ego to be relatives of any degree (Harner, 1973: 98).' <sup id="cite_ref-1014" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1014">[1,014]</a></sup> Accordingly, we have assumed that self-help and informal assistance within the residential community were practiced rather than charity.

Whether [Page 49] the garden area is in a single clearing or several, its total size is heavily influenced by the number of wives a man has to cultivate the fields. A household with one wife tends to have a garden of about 50,000 square feet, while a second spouse increases the area to about 65,000, and a third to approximately 75,000. The areal increases are usually not simple multiples of the number of wives because the demand for food and beer to feed visitors tends to lag behind the increments in additional wives. These figures vary, of course, according to the consumption demands of the household, its number of visitors, and the industry of its inhabitants. A man who wishes to gain prestige may clear garden areas of larger size for each of his wives. In such a case, a household in which there are two wives may sometimes have a total garden of 100,000 square feet or more.' <sup id="cite_ref-1015" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1015">[1,015]</a></sup> 'The importance of wives in producing food and beer goes far beyond the subsistence requirements of the household itself. Plural wives assure a surplus production which will make possible adequate entertainment of visitors from other households. The Jívaro place a high value on drinking beer and eating (perhaps in that order), so that one's status in a neighborhood is greatly affected by one's generosity with beer and food. No one can expect to have many friends unless he is a good host; and he cannot easily meet the requirements of good hospitality without plural wives as a labor force.' <sup id="cite_ref-1016" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1016">[1,016]</a></sup> 'The most successful party-givers and hosts are those men who, in addition to having two or three wives to produce large amounts of beer and food, are respected by their neighbors for: their renown as killers in feuds and war, or as shamans; the achievement of age sufficient to have grand-children; and who are generally of an amiable, honest, and magnanimous nature when dealing with those who are not their enemies. A man who has most of these characteristics is referred to by the term untä, which means “big” or “old” man. The demeanor of party participants in the house of such a man tends to be more circumspect and respectful of the master of the house, and excesses such as arguments and brawls seem to occur less often.' <sup id="cite_ref-1017" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1017">[1,017]</a></sup> 'While the concept of the untä ideally encompasses all of the characteristics described, it is possible to acquire the designation with no formal qualifications other than simply having lived long enough to exhibit a few gray hairs and to have many grandchildren. Such an achievement receives respect as a sign of supernatural power, and an elderly untä of this sort is believed to have the ability to curse to death anyone who incurs his anger. No other kind of person is considered to possess this ability. Partly out of fear of being cursed, young men in the neighborhood assist him in land clearing and other tasks when he requests their aid. While the elderly untä's opinion is normally respected, he usually is not a real leader unless he is also outstanding as a killer, shaman, or good host. Thus the true “big men” are distinguished not only by longevity but by real leadership and generosity.' <sup id="cite_ref-1018" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1018">[1,018]</a></sup> 'A rough estimate of the average daily beer consumption of the adult male is three to four gallons; of the adult female, approximately one to two gallons; and of nine- to ten-year-old children, about half a gallon. The beer must ferment for four or five days to reach its maximum alcoholic content, but this is usually intentionally done only for feasts planned in advance. On the other hand, a jar or two of beer may reach such strength simply because it has not been consumed, in which case its availability provides an occasion to invite neighbors to come by for a drinking and dancing party.' <sup id="cite_ref-1019" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1019">[1,019]</a></sup> Communcal feasting was practiced during tsantsa festivals: 'Beyond the ritualized chanting that takes place before a raiding expedition, as mentioned above, the only other major ceremony taking place among the Jivaro is the TSANTSA   feast, a great victory celebration taking place in the home village following a successful head-hunting raid. Since food and drink are offered to the invited guests at these celebrations in great quantity, a great strain is put on the economic resources of the head-takers and their families so frequently the TSANTSA   feast may be spread over a period of two to three years during which resources are rebuilt. From the Jivaro's point of view the primary purpose of the TSANTSA   feast is not necessarily supernatural, although that is generally recognized as a secondary purpose; but to acquire prestige, friendship, and obligations through being recognized as an accomplished warrior, and through the feasting, by being a generous host to as many neighbors as possible (Harner, 1972: 191-192).' <sup id="cite_ref-1020" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1020">[1,020]</a></sup> 'When this first tsantsa feast is concluded, the head-takers return to their separate homes and begin to make preparations for the two subsequent feasts which each of them will host individually. Since enormous quantities of beer and food are consumed at these celebrations, the head-taker normally has to clear additional garden space for his wife or wives to plant to assure an ample supply of manioc. The first of these two celebrations, named suamak, normally takes place no sooner than after a year, to allow time for garden clearing and the growth of a large mature crop of manioc as well as for the raising of pigs to help provide meat for the feasting. Also the host may delay the celebration in order to build a new, larger house more worthy of the occasion. Thus, often two or three years pass before a man gives the feast. To assure a large quantity of wild game for the feast, men who are close relatives of the host separately go hunting long distances from the house for a period of approximately nine or ten days before the opening day. Lacking any mnemonic system for keeping count of the days accurately, they are able to time their return to coincide with the arrival of the guests at the feast with the aid of an ingenious device which might be called a “banana clock.” That is, the host gives each hunter a green cooking banana or plantain from the same stalk, which is one of those hanging in the house to ripen for the feast. When each of the hunters' plantains is almost fully ripe, they know that it is time to return for the celebration. The host also sends or delivers plantains from the same stalk to those invited guests living at some distance so that they, too, will arrive at the same time. The celebration lasts five days and is followed, about a month later, by the third feast (napiη). This is the largest of all, with the head-taker supplying food and drink for six days. He must be able to provide plentifully for all his guests or the [Page 191] occasion would cause him to lose, rather than to gain, prestige. Guests at the feasts usually number up to about 125-150 persons, and mainly come from the local neighborhoods. Since these last two feasts, totalling eleven days of unremitted hospitality, must be supplied from the same harvest, often little food remains in the gardens at the end of the celebrations. Not uncommonly, the host and his family are forced onto a relatively meager diet for some months thereafter until the gardens can recover from their near-exhaustion. Sometimes such a large amount of the gardens' supply of manioc is consumed that the host is unable to follow the second feast with the third. There is no stigma attached to this, but it means that the tsantsa never undergoes its final modification.' <sup id="cite_ref-1021" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1021">[1,021]</a></sup>//'The primary purpose of the tsantsa feast, from the Jívaro point of view, is not supernatural, although that is recognized by them as a secondary purpose; but is to acquire prestige, friendship, and obligations through being recognized as [Page 192] an accomplished warrior and, through the feasting, by being a generous host to as many neighbors as possible. One informant observed, “The desire of the Jívaro for heads is like the desire of the whites for gold.”' <sup id="cite_ref-1022" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1022">[1,022]</a></sup> 'Since the head-taking raids are directed at the Achuara and others “who live far away,” the victim whose head is the focal point of the celebration normally is viewed by everyone in the head-taker's neighborhood as an “enemy.” Accordingly, it is the unique occasion for the members of many Jívaro households to get together to reaffirm their common identity and unity. Under such circumstances, it is not surprising that the tsantsa feast is participated in with great joy and a cumulative sense of euphoria. Of course, the huge quantities of strong manioc beer help, as do the ritual circle dances (wainči), which continue from dusk to dawn night after night. The bountiful quantities of meat and garden foods add to the sense of well-being. It is also a time of relative sexual license, as I had occasion to observe during the one tsantsa feast that I attended. Liaisons are arranged discreetly by both unmarried and married individuals, who rendezvous in the forest surrounding the house. The supernatural and ritual aspects of the celebration contribute to the sense of solidarity by inhibiting fights between men who have become drunk and who may try to even a score with old enemies or with men who have offended them at the feast by flirting with their wives. That is, it is believed that the avenging soul (muisak) of the murdered man will be able to take advantage of any disruption of the binding ritual by escaping from the tsantsa to cause an ongoing fight to culminate in a death. Permitting the muisak to escape from the tsantsa would also be an affront to the host, since it would negate the major supernatural purpose of the feast, that is, to utilize the power of the muisak, while it is resident in the [Page 193] tsantsa, for increasing the power of women who are members of the host's household. Therefore, any fight that erupts is immediately stopped by the other male participants, led by the male master of ceremonies, the wea, who usually has been selected for the role because of his considerable ritual knowledge and prestige. Fights between females at the feast, although less common, are similarly halted by the women, led by the female ceremonial leader, the uhá, who is selected on a basis similar to that for the wea. Thus the religious, ritual, and social pressures of the occasion operate to make it the safest, most euphoric, and largest social gathering known to the Jívaro. It is not surprising, therefore, that the tsantsa feasts tend to be viewed by the Jívaro as the pinnacles of their social lives. It is also expectable, given the ethos of killing and counter-killing, that this, the greatest celebration, centers around the indisputable evidence of a triumph over a common enemy. The intimate interaction between the euphoria of the celebration and the awareness of the murdered enemy is illustrated by this tsantsa feast circle dance song: Today, today, let us greet the dawn only playing. Today, today, let us greet the dawn only playing. Čuwi5 tells me Čuwi tells me We are going to greet the dawn playing. Čuwi tells me Čuwi tells me We are going to greet the dawn. And they taught me previously, I cannot sleep easily, And I will meet the dawn together with Čuwi. And don't you sleep! And don't you sleep! For now it is dawning, for now it is dawning.' <sup id="cite_ref-1023" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1023">[1,023]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b>♠ Ideology forbids slavery universally ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> Occasionally, women were taken captive during raids, but according to the sources reviewed so far, this was not a common occurrence in inter-tribal warfare: 'The victorious enemy wreaks his savage vengeance not only upon the fighting men, but also on old people, women, and small children, nay, sometimes even on the domestic animals. Although there are many statements-from the very time of the Spaniards-to the effect that younger women, and especially girls, are spared in the wars of the Jibaros, we must not take this to be the general rule. It is true that there is a scarcity of women in the Jibaro society and that in general they are held in great esteem on account of the work they do. But it must be remembered that the Jibaros are essentially endogamous, members of foreign tribes being detested and looked upon as natural enemies. Besides, experience has taught the Indians that full-grown women of a vanquished tribe cannot always be made to submit to a victor who has perhaps cruelly killed their husbands, fathers, or brothers, but that they retain an invincible hatred against him. There are, in consequence, instances of the wives of vanquished enemies being carried home by the victors only to be brutally massacred. Young girls can more easily be brought up to become loyal wives and members of the victor's tribe.' <sup id="cite_ref-1024" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1024">[1,024]</a></sup> 'Closely connected with this antagonism between the different Jibaro tribes is their marked endogamy. Marriages are, as a rule, only contracted between persons belonging to families related to each other and socially united. When it has been said that they, like other Indians, particularly make war against other tribes for the sake of procuring women, ( ) the wives of the vanquished enemies regularly becoming the wives of their victors, this clearly involves an exaggeration. The Jibaros fear and detest strange tribes-especially of their own nation -and do not set foot in their dominions except with inimical intentions. How the Jibaros regard exogamous marriages, or sexual relations with members of strange tribes in general, may be inferred from the fact that if a widow or some other woman has been made pregnant by a man belonging to another tribe, the woman is compelled to kill the child as soon as it is born, if it is a boy, ‘in order that the strange man may not leave offspring within the tribe’. The relations to strange tribes will be dealt with again in connection with the wars of the Indians. For the moment it is important to point out that the Jibaros are not likely to take their wives from tribes whom they regard as mortal enemies; such cases rather form exceptions than the rule.' <sup id="cite_ref-1025" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1025">[1,025]</a></sup>  'Heads are taken of all victims, regardless of age or sex. A man may seize an Achuara girl or woman as a captive to try to take her home to be an extra wife, but usually he is unsuccessful in this because one of his companions kills her on the homeward trail to secure a head trophy.' <sup id="cite_ref-1026" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1026">[1,026]</a></sup> Dyott reports that on at least one occasion, Spanish women were taken captive by Jivaro in the colonial period: 'In the sixteenth century, when a few Spanish settlements flourished in what is now called the Ecuadorean Oriente, the Indians resented the slavery imposed upon them by the Spanish invaders, and finally united in a combined effort to rid themselves of their common foe, who seemed to be endangering their existence. A wholesale revolt against the whites ensued, and several villages were completely annihilated. This, as I have already stated, was the fate that befell Sevilla de Oro, and the Spanish women living there were taken prisoners and carried off into the forest wilderness, where they became the mothers of subsequent Jivaro children. This infusion of Spanish blood shows itself in the bearded faces which are occasionally met with in this area.”' <sup id="cite_ref-1027" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1027">[1,027]</a></sup> It appears that their offspring were not treated any differently from other Shuar. However, wife capture could be considered to be a form of sexual slavery. More material may be needed. We have found no material indicating that there was an explicit prohibition of slavery.</dd></dl>

Objects, persons, spirits, and especially the TSANTSAS   are all infused with varying degrees of TSARUTAMA   which can be used for either good or evil. The mountain Rain God, the Anaconda, the Sun, Moon, Earth, and the chonta palm, are all believed to possess great amounts of this power.' <sup id="cite_ref-1063" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1063">[1,063]</a></sup> 'In addition to the above the Jivaro recognize three kinds of souls: the ARUTAM WAKANI  , which they believe to be the most significant; the MUISAK  , or avenging soul; and the NEKAS WAKANI  , the "true", "real", or "ordinary" soul. An individual is not born with an ARUTAM   soul but it is acquired through a vision quest in which fasting, cold water "bathing" and hallucinogenic drugs are used. This "quest" takes place for a boy about the age of six. The possessor of a single ARUTAM   soul is thought to be immune to death by physical means or sorcery, but can die of natural causes. Those individuals lucky enough to have two ARUTAM   souls cannot die of any cause.'<sup id="cite_ref-1064" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1064">[1,064]</a></sup></dd>

The following, however, suggests that certain spirits were believed to come back from the dead to punish those guilty of "neglect of duty", in a context that suggests that the "duty" mostly consisted of showing proper respect to one's elders. 'The position of old people, and more particularly of old men, is of special interest. How the power of a man increases with age appears nowhere more clearly than in the Jibaro society. We have frequently noticed that at the great feasts the ceremonies are always conducted by some old man or woman (generally called whuéa and oháha) who, for instance, have to administer the juice of tobacco and other medicines taken on these occasions. The great victory feast, described in the next part of this work, will give us further instances of it. It is difficult to define more closely the true nature of the ‘power’ which, according to Indian belief, is increased in man with increasing age, and which explains the respect paid to old people and especially to old men. It is natural that, owing to their experience of life, they represent the wisdom of the tribe, just as they are the sole authorities on religion as well as on [253] custom. But ‘experience’ to the Indian means something more than to civilized man; it means mysterious magical or supernatural power. Every action of an old person, experienced in a particular sphere of activity, has therefore special emphasis, and every important rite or ceremony at a feast must consequently be performed by such aged persons, specially elected for the purpose. Even if an old man is not a professional medicine-man he is, according to Indian views, always more or less versed in magic. This to him means social influence and authority, or at any rate secures for him respectful treatment, although he may be physically decrepit and unable to work. Thus both the Jibaros and the Canelos [Page 252-253] Indians believe that old men may, after death or even in their lifetime, appear in the shape of jaguars, anacondas, or other formidable or dangerous animals and in this disguise punish their relatives for neglect of duty. -The peculiar view that the Jibaros have about old men will be referred to again in connection with their war chiefs.”<sup id="cite_ref-1074" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1074">[1,074]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of purity ♣ present ♥</b> Widows had to undergo ritual purification prior to remarriage in order to avoid misfortune caused by the jealous spirit of their former husband: “If a woman becomes a widow she cannot marry again at will but is bound by certain restrictions. First and foremost, owing to the close relationship assumed between brothers, she is believed naturally to belong to the eldest brother of her deceased husband, who is bound to marry her. If he had no brothers she may marry another man, generally in some way related to her former husband, but not at once. The prohibition of her remarriage when or with whom she likes is due to the superstitious ideas mentioned in the last chapter. Generally the widow has to wait for one year before she can marry again, or until the hair of her head which at the death of her husband was cut short, has again grown long. Besides this, she has to pass through a certain purificatory ceremony with fire. The widow has to sit down on a seat, her head is covered with a cloth, and a termite nest is set on fire, the smoke of which she has to receive in her face until she is nearly suffocated. This smoking ceremony is believed to purify her from the taboo attaching to her after the death of her husband and she can now remarry. If the woman marries before the year has elapsed, or does not pass through the purification ceremony just mentioned, the consequence may be that the new [213] husband will soon die and that the child she gives birth to will be a monster. The demon operating in this case is again the spirit or soul of the dead husband, who jealously watches his former wife. Among the Jibaros therefore untimely marriages of widows are as strictly prohibited as marriages between near relatives.”<sup id="cite_ref-1079" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1079">[1,079]</a></sup> Warriors were ritually purified after returning from successful expeditions, in order to escape vengeance from those they had slain. 'The aim of the feast Numbuimártinyu, as already mentioned, is to [306] purify the slayer from the blood which is attached to him after the killing of the enemy, and to protect him against the spirit of the latter, who is thirsting for revenge. The soul of the enemy is particularly supposed to be present in the blood. How this purification can be brought about with the two strokes of blood applied to the legs of the slayer, is something the Jibaros can not explain more closely. Nor can they explain why hen's blood must necessarily be used for this procedure, or why that blood must be kept in an old, broken clay pot. ‘Our ancestors have since times immemorial proceeded in this way,’ an old Jibaro, whom I asked about the custom, answered me, ‘and we have to keep up and follow their customs’. That a magical power and supernaturally purifying effects are ascribed to the hen's blood is, however, clear. The same purifying effects, in a magical or religious sense of the word, are ascribed to the bath in the river and to the washing of the mouth with guayusa, the object of the latter ceremony especially being to favourably prepare the slayer for the breaking of the fast. Again, the painting with the genipa is a direct protection against the spirit of the enemy. Body-painting among the Indians nearly always serves magical ends, being regarded as a protection against disease and witchcraft, and this is especially the case with the black painting. According [Page 302-307] to the ideas of the Jibaros and the Canelos Indians there is a demon (wakáni, supai) in the black genipa paint, and when the Indian paints his body or face black this is usually a sign that he is either going to kill an enemy or has already killed one. As we shall see, painting with genipa also takes place at the feast Suamártinyu and at the final great victory feast.'<sup id="cite_ref-1080" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1080">[1,080]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b>♠ in-group loyalty ♣ present ♥</b> Shuar lived in autonomous residential communities, the basic socioeconomic unit being the polygynous family, Accordingly, we have assumed that the in-grou coincided with the residential community and close kin: 'Each community is politically independent with its own headman. Each is also located four or more kilometers from their nearest neighboring community. The community is made up of patrilineally and affinally related individuals, traditionally consisting of from 80 to 300 people (30 to 40 people in the twentieth century), living in one house called a JIVARIA. For defensive purposes, this house is built on a steep hill usually at the upper end of a stream. The house itself is approximately 13 meters by 26 meters in size, elliptical in shape, and has a thatched roof. In times of war, two or more communities united to fight a common enemy, as was the case when the Spanish attempted to conquer them.' <sup id="cite_ref-1084" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1084">[1,084]</a></sup>  'The basic domestic unit among the Jivaro is the polygynous family consisting of a man and his wife or wives and their children. Occasionally another relative such as a widowed mother or unmarried brother of the household head will also be included. In addition a married daughter and her husband may live in the household until the birth of their first child. Following the birth the family will be expected to move to a new dwelling nearby.' <sup id="cite_ref-1085" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1085">[1,085]</a></sup> Obligations to kind varied and were not organized through corporate kin groups: 'The basic Jivaro kin group is referred to as a "personal" bilateral kindred. In this type of kinship structure each person has a different kindred, with rights and obligations coinciding only with those of siblings of the same sex. Classification of kin, therefore, is spoken of as degrees of distance from ego, rather than in terms of membership or non-membership in a corporate unit as is quite often characteristic of unilineal descent societies. This form of kin group is probably the most insecure of the basic types of kinship systems for the individual, lacking defined descent groups affording protection from one's enemies and assistance in settling disputes among relatives (Harner, 1973: 97-98).' <sup id="cite_ref-1086" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1086">[1,086]</a></sup> 'Information on the classification of Jivaro kinship terminology is scant in the anthropological literature. In a series of tables appearing in an article entitled "World Ethnographic Sample", in the American Anthropologist, 1957, George P. Murdock characterizes the Jivaro as having bifurcate merging avuncular terminology in which FaBr is equated with Fa, but MoBr is differentiated from both. He also states that cousin terminology is also unusual in that non-marriageable cross-cousins are equated with siblings, while marriageable cross-cousins are differentiated (Murdock, 1957: 673). In single-word or elementary kin terms the modifier "true" or "branch" is added to the term to pin down degrees of relationship to ego. Where specific relatives are involved the modifying terms can often be substituted for one another, depending on the degree of closeness of relationship that the speaker wishes to imply. "True" relationship modifiers are used for an individual's biological kin - grandparents, parents, siblings, children, cross-cousins, and fathers of his cross-cousins. Those relatives assigned the "branch" category are affinal kin who, prior to marrying, were not considered by ego to be relatives of any degree (Harner, 1973: 98).' <sup id="cite_ref-1087" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1087">[1,087]</a></sup>  Men's property in structures and movables was inherited by the eldest son, eldest brother or eldest parallel cousin. The latter two could also inherit wives: 'Property acquired during a man's lifetime generally consists of the house he has built, artifacts that he has made or received as gifts, game and fish that he has caught, and specific crops, such as maize, that he has raised. At his death these items are inherited by his son of post-puberty age, or if there is none, then by his eldest brother. This brother also has the right to inherit the deceased's wife or wives.

The deceased man's eldest brother has the right to inherit his wife (wives). If there is no surviving brother of the deceased man, then his eldest parallel cousin is entitled to inherit the wife (wives). If the deceased man lacks sons of post-puberty age, his eldest brother also inherits his possessions. Otherwise, the eldest son receives these goods. There is a mild feeling that the eldest brother inheriting plural wives, or the eldest son inheriting material possessions, should distribute some of his new wealth to each of his younger brothers as they pass puberty.' <sup id="cite_ref-1089" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1089">[1,089]</a></sup> 'Property is transmitted from male to male, generally from father to son.

Stealing, for example, is virtually unheard of with the exception [Page 179] of household looting following the assassination of an enemy. In such cases, the assassins are practicing behavior which is supposed to be reserved for acts of war against non-untsuri šuarä. Such behavior is thus in the nature of an additional indignity inflicted upon the victim's household, and is normally considered very bad form within the tribe. Inheritance of property does not always go entirely smoothly, however, because younger siblings may be angered if the eldest does not share some of the inheritance. Since, however, the eldest has the legal right to keep all the parent's possessions, the younger siblings do not have any recourse to any formalized sanctions. They usually just refuse to visit the elder brother.' <sup id="cite_ref-1091" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1091">[1,091]</a></sup> Women's property was passed on to the eldest daugher, mother, sister, or husband: 'A woman's property also consists of the artifacts she has made or received as gifts, wild food she has gathered, the crops that she is cultivating or has harvested, the section of the garden in which these crops are grown (in the case of several wives), and the pigs and chickens that she raises. She may also own pottery clay deposits, if they are near her home, and is the discoverer and primary excavator of these deposits (Harner, 1973: 179). This property is inherited by her eldest daughter, but if there is none, the deceased woman's mother will inherit the possessions.

<dd><b>♠ respect for authority ♣ present ♥</b> Shuar political authority was informal and decentralized: 'Local groups among the Jivaro are spread over such a large area in the Amazon basin that each has become completely independent of each other. Each JIVARIA or community is autonomous, although alliances between several JIVARIAS in a district may take place, but mostly for the purposes of warfare. There is a tendency for several communities to be related to each other by blood and affinal kinship ties because of the rule of local exogamy, which requires that a man marry a woman from a village other than his own. There is, therefore, a more or less natural grouping of contiguous communities into a loose tribe, but cooperation among them is almost entirely limited to collaboration in feuds or in head-hunting against more distant and unrelated communities (Service, 1958: 190).' <sup id="cite_ref-1094" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1094">[1,094]</a></sup> 'Each community is politically independent with its own headman. Each is also located four or more kilometers from their nearest neighboring community. The community is made up of patrilineally and affinally related individuals, traditionally consisting of from 80 to 300 people (30 to 40 people in the twentieth century), living in one house called a JIVARIA. For defensive purposes, this house is built on a steep hill usually at the upper end of a stream. The house itself is approximately 13 meters by 26 meters in size, elliptical in shape, and has a thatched roof. In times of war, two or more communities united to fight a common enemy, as was the case when the Spanish attempted to conquer them.' <sup id="cite_ref-1095" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1095">[1,095]</a></sup> '“From the statements I have previously made as to the distribution of the Jibaro tribes it appears that their social organization is loose. In fact, the whole people is split up into a great number of tribes which in their turn are sub-divided into smaller clans or septs comprising a few families closely related to one another by blood. These sub-tribes do not form village communities; each family inhabits its own big communal house (héa), but these are not situated close to one another, they lie scattered here and there in the virgin forest. Generally one has to march for one or several hours to arrive at the next house. Each Jibaro house forms in fact a separate and independent social, political, and economic unit with its own household, its own plantations in the vicinity of the house, and its own ruler or chief, the oldest family father who, at any rate in time of peace, is not controlled by anybody. It is much the same feature that we meet in other parts of tropical South America, where the impenetrable virgin forests necessarily lead to social disintegration, which is further increased by the general anti-social tendencies of the Indians. The state of things found among the Jibaros, however, is in many respects unique.' <sup id="cite_ref-1096" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1096">[1,096]</a></sup>  Social control was based on fear of witchcraft and retaliation: 'Fear of sorcery and incurring the wrath of the UNYÄ   act as restraining elements of social control in the Jivaro community. In this society the code of lex talionis holds true so that anti-social acts directed against members of the community will result in assured retaliation by the victim's family. Thus, the fear of reprisal also acts as a means of aggression control in the society.' <sup id="cite_ref-1097" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1097">[1,097]</a></sup> War-leaders were appointed on a temporary basis only: “There is no permanent chief for the different geographical groups. (Each cluster of houses is named after the rivulets where they are situated, as for instance the Patucas, the Yurupazas, the Yaupis.) The family head is the highest authority and his power is limited to the members of his house. Only in time of war are chiefs appointed for larger units, but their power is provisional and confined to the war-period only.” <sup id="cite_ref-1098" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1098">[1,098]</a></sup> “Among the Jibaros as we have seen each family father is theoretically absolute ruler over his house people, and in times of peace there is no recognized common chief even within the tribe, and still less any exercising authority over several tribes. The Jibaros have not even a proper name for a chief. The word capitu, which is sometimes used, is borrowed from the Spanish and is used principally to denote a white man of importance. It is only in times of war that a chieftainship exists; that is to say, during those great wars of extermination which are carried out against other Jibaro tribes. Such a temporary chief of war is generally only called únta, ‘the old one’, because the chiefs are nearly always old, experienced men who have killed many enemies and captured many heads. The small blood-feuds within the tribe, on the other hand, have a more private character and as a rule are not fought out under the leadership of a common chief.” <sup id="cite_ref-1099" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1099">[1,099]</a></sup> “The authority of the chief elected for a war is very great. It is he alone who arranges everything for the expedition planned, who decides [268] about the time for and the mode of making the attack, and the younger warriors oblige themselves to obey him in everything. But as soon as a war has been carried to a successful end the power of the chief ceases, and he has, in spite of the great repute he always enjoys, no more authority or right to decide about the doings of his tribesmen than any other family-father among the Jibaros.” <sup id="cite_ref-1100" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1100">[1,100]</a></sup> 'When a whole tribe, or perhaps several tribes together, prepare a war against one or more other tribes, the first thing done is to elect a common chief. He should be an elderly, experienced man, who has taken part in several wars, killed many enemies, and celebrated at least one victory feast. The rest of the warriors, who are generally younger men, swear him unlimited obedience. During the time the expedition is planned and the preparations are made, the warriors, and especially the chief, repeatedly drink maikoa or natéma to consult the spirits. They pay great attention to their dreams, even to those not produced under the direct influence of the narcotic drinks, tell them to each other, and discuss their possible significance. Only if they believe that they have received favourable answers and all omens are good are measures taken to carry out the war plan conceived. Meanwhile they try, through spies, to acquire as accurate a knowledge as possible about everything concerning the enemy: how many houses there are in the tract, how many fighting men in each house, if the houses are fortified, if the [283] men are well armed, and especially if they have firearms. All these and similar details the spies investigate by making trips into the country of the enemy and by stealing at night to the houses. Everything is prepared [Page 282-283] with the greatest secrecy possible, so that the enemy is caught unprepared, for otherwise he will have time to take measures of defence that may defeat the whole undertaking.” <sup id="cite_ref-1101" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1101">[1,101]</a></sup> Warfare was an important means of attaining prestige: 'The outstanding killer gains prestige and social obligations by helping the people of his locality in eliminating their enemies. Such a man is known as kakaram (“powerful” or “powerful one”) and also, if he is not too youthful, as untä. He is believed to possess an unusually large quantity of arutam soul power (see pp. 135-43) (kakarma), which both protects him from death and is believed to drive him on to kill as often as possible.' <sup id="cite_ref-1102" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1102">[1,102]</a></sup> 'The majority of young men interviewed expressed a strong desire to kill, not only to avenge the deaths of their fathers and other close relatives, but to acquire the arutam soul power and to become known, respected, and feared as kakaram. To be acknowledged as a kakaram, a man must have killed at least several persons. Early in his career, he does this by going on killing expeditions led by others, whether intra-tribal assassinations or the inter-tribal raids for tsantsa. As his reputation increases, he will eventually successfully organize and lead such an expedition himself, usually the more modest local assassination raid, probably against a specific personal enemy who is believed to have, sometime earlier, caused the death of a member of his immediate family. If he acquits himself well in achieving this assassination, especially as evidenced by firing the first shot into the victim, word will rapidly spread of his apparent power. Soon he will be approached by other men to lead them in killing expeditions against their own enemies. The kakaram, anxious to further his reputation as well as to gain additional supernatural power through more killing, rarely refuses such a request, even though it often means that he is agreeing to kill a fellow tribesman who is not even an enemy of his.' <sup id="cite_ref-1103" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1103">[1,103]</a></sup> 'As his reputation grows, the kakaram tends to dress himself in elaborate feather headdresses and ornaments when visiting other households or receiving guests (see frontispiece). [Page 113] Similarly, he adopts an ever more forceful and aggressive style of speaking when receiving visitors, meeting others on the trail, or in visiting other men. He conveys the impression of being invincible in every aspect of his public demeanor. If he has a son, he encourages him to become a killer also, and instructs him to the extent of taking him on assassination expeditions even as early as the age of six or seven years. Although such a young boy will not yet take part in the actual killing, the father brings him up to the corpse after the murder and has him fire into it, with the father helping him hold the gun. The wives of such a kakaram also are expected to outperform other women in making superior pottery vessels, doing garden work and other aspects of household labor. Informants said that one way of looking at this was that since a kakaram is very much a man, his wives have to be very much women.' <sup id="cite_ref-1104" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1104">[1,104]</a></sup> 'While a kakaram is greatly feared by his enemies, his neighbors usually look upon him as a great local asset, a deterrent to attacks upon them, and refer to him with the title untä (big) before his name, especially if he is also hospitable to them and generous with beer and food. Of course, there may be neighbors who get into a quarrel or other dispute with him; but they almost always move as soon as possible to another region of the tribe where they feel more secure. Thus there is a continual process of self-selection in terms of the composition of any neighborhood, which tends to reduce local antagonisms.' <sup id="cite_ref-1105" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1105">[1,105]</a></sup> 'Big men' were considered to be spiritually powerful: 'The Jivaro lack any formal political organization, although an informal form of leadership is found in the role of individuals referred to as UNYÄ  ("big" or "old" men) or KAKARAM   ("powerful" or "powerful ones") who are renown as killers in feuds or war, or exercise important shamanistic powers in the community. These individuals acquire their reputation in the community by being old enough to have grandchildren, and are friendly, honest, and generous in dealing with others in the society. Because of these characteristics the UNYÄ   or KAKARAM   are believed to possess great ARUTAM   soul power and the ability to curse to death anyone who incurs their anger. Generally most neighborhoods have at least one or two UNYÄ   as well as a few superior shamans who provide protection for their relatives or other individuals with whom they are on friendly terms.' <sup id="cite_ref-1106" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1106">[1,106]</a></sup> 'It should be noted that the personal security which the Jívaro believe comes from killing has some social reality. A man who has killed repeatedly, called kakaram or “powerful one,” is rarely attacked because his enemies feel that the protection provided him by his constantly replaced souls would make any assassination attempt against him fruitless.' <sup id="cite_ref-1107" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1107">[1,107]</a></sup> 'While the concept of the untä ideally encompasses all of the characteristics described, it is possible to acquire the designation with no formal qualifications other than simply having lived long enough to exhibit a few gray hairs and to have many grandchildren. Such an achievement receives respect as a sign of supernatural power, and an elderly untä of this sort is believed to have the ability to curse to death anyone who incurs his anger. No other kind of person is considered to possess this ability. Partly out of fear of being cursed, young men in the neighborhood assist him in land clearing and other tasks when he requests their aid. While the elderly untä's opinion is normally respected, he usually is not a real leader unless he is also outstanding as a killer, shaman, or good host. Thus the true “big men” are distinguished not only by longevity but by real leadership and generosity.' <sup id="cite_ref-1108" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1108">[1,108]</a></sup> These attributes were reflected in material wealth and hospitality: 'Posts, beams, roof and walls are all lashed firmly together with strips of inner tree bark. Proceeding painstakingly, a man usually constructs a large and impressive structure capable of withstanding not only the natural elements and enemy attack, but also critical evaluation by his neighbors. The size and quality of a man's house is regarded as a serious indication of his personal “power,” kakarma.' <sup id="cite_ref-1109" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1109">[1,109]</a></sup> 'If a man clears the forest without the aid of neighbors, he tends to make small clearings at different times, while the rarer communal effort results in one large clearing. Whether [Page 49] the garden area is in a single clearing or several, its total size is heavily influenced by the number of wives a man has to cultivate the fields. A household with one wife tends to have a garden of about 50,000 square feet, while a second spouse increases the area to about 65,000, and a third to approximately 75,000. The areal increases are usually not simple multiples of the number of wives because the demand for food and beer to feed visitors tends to lag behind the increments in additional wives. These figures vary, of course, according to the consumption demands of the household, its number of visitors, and the industry of its inhabitants. A man who wishes to gain prestige may clear garden areas of larger size for each of his wives. In such a case, a household in which there are two wives may sometimes have a total garden of 100,000 square feet or more.' <sup id="cite_ref-1110" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1110">[1,110]</a></sup> 'The importance of wives in producing food and beer goes far beyond the subsistence requirements of the household itself. Plural wives assure a surplus production which will make possible adequate entertainment of visitors from other households. The Jívaro place a high value on drinking beer and eating (perhaps in that order), so that one's status in a neighborhood is greatly affected by one's generosity with beer and food. No one can expect to have many friends unless he is a good host; and he cannot easily meet the requirements of good hospitality without plural wives as a labor force.' <sup id="cite_ref-1111" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1111">[1,111]</a></sup> 'The most successful party-givers and hosts are those men who, in addition to having two or three wives to produce large amounts of beer and food, are respected by their neighbors for: their renown as killers in feuds and war, or as shamans; the achievement of age sufficient to have grand-children; and who are generally of an amiable, honest, and magnanimous nature when dealing with those who are not their enemies. A man who has most of these characteristics is referred to by the term untä, which means “big” or “old” man. The demeanor of party participants in the house of such a man tends to be more circumspect and respectful of the master of the house, and excesses such as arguments and brawls seem to occur less often.' <sup id="cite_ref-1112" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1112">[1,112]</a></sup> These qualities were thought to be hereditary: “The dignity of a chieftain is hereditary in a relative sense, in so far that the son of a chief is generally elected chief in time of war after his father has died or grown decrepit. This, however, can only take place if he has proved a valiant and skilled warrior and has killed enemies. No Jibaro is selected as a chief if he has not killed at least one enemy. The Jibaros have absolute faith in the heritability of prominent qualities, and ascribe extraordinary importance to education and the power of example. The son of a great chief, they say, must necessarily also become an able warrior because he is, as it were, a direct continuation of his father, has received a careful education for the deeds of war, and has always had the good example of his great father before his eyes.” <sup id="cite_ref-1113" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1113">[1,113]</a></sup> Elders in general were thought of as 'powerful' and treated accordingly: 'The position of old people, and more particularly of old men, is of special interest. How the power of a man increases with age appears nowhere more clearly than in the Jibaro society. We have frequently noticed that at the great feasts the ceremonies are always conducted by some old man or woman (generally called whuéa and oháha) who, for instance, have to administer the juice of tobacco and other medicines taken on these occasions. The great victory feast, described in the next part of this work, will give us further instances of it. It is difficult to define more closely the true nature of the ‘power’ which, according to Indian belief, is increased in man with increasing age, and which explains the respect paid to old people and especially to old men. It is natural that, owing to their experience of life, they represent the wisdom of the tribe, just as they are the sole authorities on religion as well as on [253] custom. But ‘experience’ to the Indian means something more than to civilized man; it means mysterious magical or supernatural power. Every action of an old person, experienced in a particular sphere of activity, has therefore special emphasis, and every important rite or ceremony at a feast must consequently be performed by such aged persons, specially elected for the purpose. Even if an old man is not a professional medicine-man he is, according to Indian views, always more or less versed in magic. This to him means social influence and authority, or at any rate secures for him respectful treatment, although he may be physically decrepit and unable to work. Thus both the Jibaros and the Canelos [Page 252-253] Indians believe that old men may, after death or even in their lifetime, appear in the shape of jaguars, anacondas, or other formidable or dangerous animals and in this disguise punish their relatives for neglect of duty. -The peculiar view that the Jibaros have about old men will be referred to again in connection with their war chiefs.” <sup id="cite_ref-1114" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1114">[1,114]</a></sup> Accordingly, we have provisionally coded 'present', but this is open to review.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ purity ♣ present ♥</b> Widows had to undergo ritual purification prior to remarriage: “If a woman becomes a widow she cannot marry again at will but is bound by certain restrictions. First and foremost, owing to the close relationship assumed between brothers, she is believed naturally to belong to the eldest brother of her deceased husband, who is bound to marry her. If he had no brothers she may marry another man, generally in some way related to her former husband, but not at once. The prohibition of her remarriage when or with whom she likes is due to the superstitious ideas mentioned in the last chapter. Generally the widow has to wait for one year before she can marry again, or until the hair of her head which at the death of her husband was cut short, has again grown long. Besides this, she has to pass through a certain purificatory ceremony with fire. The widow has to sit down on a seat, her head is covered with a cloth, and a termite nest is set on fire, the smoke of which she has to receive in her face until she is nearly suffocated. This smoking ceremony is believed to purify her from the taboo attaching to her after the death of her husband and she can now remarry. If the woman marries before the year has elapsed, or does not pass through the purification ceremony just mentioned, the consequence may be that the new [213] husband will soon die and that the child she gives birth to will be a monster. The demon operating in this case is again the spirit or soul of the dead husband, who jealously watches his former wife. Among the Jibaros therefore untimely marriages of widows are as strictly prohibited as marriages between near relatives.” <sup id="cite_ref-1115" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1115">[1,115]</a></sup> Warriors were ritually purified after returning from successful expeditions. Harners describes the ceremony: “Immediately after their return the victor or victors have to pass through the purification procedure, connected with a small feast, which the Jibaros call Numbuimártinyu (from númba, blood, and mártinyu, to paint, to coat), the principal ceremony of which consists in their legs being coated with hen's blood. If the victors are many, this ceremony is first performed with the one who cut off the head of the enemy, and thereafter in turns with each of those who took part in the killing. Before the victors, who travel slowly and stop at various houses on the way, arrive home, a message has been sent that the warriors are coming, that a head has been captured, and that preparations for the feast Numbuimártinyu shall begin at once. This feast therefore always has a more or less improvised character." <sup id="cite_ref-1116" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1116">[1,116]</a></sup> "The first slayer stops in the house of some relations in the neighbourhood of his home until the trophy is definitely prepared. It is not until then that his solemn entrance into his own house can take place. He is in the dress of a penitent, has his hair untied, and wears no body-painting or other ornaments. At his side stands the chief or some other old warrior, who will lead the ceremonies at the following feasts and in this capacity is called whuéa. Behind these two men the rest of the warriors arrange themselves in a row. The whuéa first gives the slayer juice of tobacco through the nose. Thereafter the latter disengages the trophy from the cloth in which it has been wrapped up and with the aid of the old man hangs it round his neck, over the breast. Followed [Page 301-302] by the rest of the men, he now slowly and ceremoniously, and continually smoothing the hair of the trophy with the hand, proceeds toward the house, stopping outside the door. From within all the women come to meet him, arranged in a row and holding each other by the hands, all in festive dresses and with rattles of snail's shells round the cinctures. On each side of the women the men arrange themselves in two rows [302]inside the house. The introductory dance with the trophy which is called Ihiámbrama, and which is performed by the victor together with the women, now takes place. From among the women two step forth who have been standing at the head of the rest. Those are the wife and daughter of the victor. For the following dance the daughter grasps him from behind at the cincture with both hands; the wife gives him her hand, standing at the head of the other women. The slayer again seizes the tsantsa with the right hand, holding it up with the arm stretched out; with the left he grasps the hand of his wife. All now pass, dancing or hopping sideways, into the interior of the house, to the accompaniment of drums and the rattles of the women, and immediately return to the entrance. The same manoeuvre is repeated twice. Each time the slayer, led by the women, returns to the entrance of the house. The aim of this dance is to paralyze the danger threatening the victor from the spirit of the murdered enemy at the first entrance into the house, which is regarded as particularly critical (Pl. XXVIII).” <sup id="cite_ref-1117" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1117">[1,117]</a></sup> “The slayer now takes off the tsantsa and the latter is tied to a chonta lance which is fixed in the ground close to the door on the inner side. The lance must be made of the hard wood of the chonta palm, to which the Indians ascribe a supernatural power. Another kind of lance, for instance one having an iron point, would not do. In this way the tsantsa is kept at the following feasts also during the time it is not needed for the ceremonies. The trophy being tied to the chonta lance, the spirit of the enemy attached to it is brought into subjection and kept at bay." <sup id="cite_ref-1118" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1118">[1,118]</a></sup> 'The whuéa lays his hand upon the shoulder of the slayer and takes him round in the house, as if to manifest that he can now move about there without danger.' <sup id="cite_ref-1119" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1119">[1,119]</a></sup> 'Meanwhile, close to the lance with the tsantsa tied to it, two small vessels have been placed.

Around them the women form a semicircle, having their rattles round the cincture as before. They are led by an old woman, called oháha, who at the feasts directs all those ceremonies at which the women play the main part. The whuéa first gives the slayer tobacco juice through the nose. Then he grasps him by the hand, brings it down to the vessel containing the hen's blood, lets him dip the index finger into it, and subsequently with the blood draw a broad line 2 or 3 inches in length along the front of one of his legs, from below upward. Thereafter the slayer, with the aid of the whuéa, applies a similar stroke with the blood to his other leg.

The slayer as well as his wife and daughter together grasp a small clay pot, called yukúnda, pour water into it from a larger vessel, and together place it on the fire.

As soon as the palm top is sufficiently roasted the women move over to this fire, take a dish with beans, and another dish with boiled manioc (nauma). The three principal persons, the slayer himself and his wife and daughter, now have to break the fast after the ‘washing of the blood.’ The whuéa at first gives tobacco juice to the slayer through the nose.

The soul of the enemy is particularly supposed to be present in the blood. How this purification can be brought about with the two strokes of blood applied to the legs of the slayer, is something the Jibaros can not explain more closely. Nor can they explain why hen's blood must necessarily be used for this procedure, or why that blood must be kept in an old, broken clay pot. ‘Our ancestors have since times immemorial proceeded in this way,’ an old Jibaro, whom I asked about the custom, answered me, ‘and we have to keep up and follow their customs’. That a magical power and supernaturally purifying effects are ascribed to the hen's blood is, however, clear. The same purifying effects, in a magical or religious sense of the word, are ascribed to the bath in the river and to the washing of the mouth with guayusa, the object of the latter ceremony especially being to favourably prepare the slayer for the breaking of the fast. Again, the painting with the genipa is a direct protection against the spirit of the enemy. Body-painting among the Indians nearly always serves magical ends, being regarded as a protection against disease and witchcraft, and this is especially the case with the black painting. According [Page 302-307] to the ideas of the Jibaros and the Canelos Indians there is a demon (wakáni, supai) in the black genipa paint, and when the Indian paints his body or face black this is usually a sign that he is either going to kill an enemy or has already killed one. As we shall see, painting with genipa also takes place at the feast Suamártinyu and at the final great victory feast.' <sup id="cite_ref-1138" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1138">[1,138]</a></sup> 'In regard to the question why the hen's blood used at the purification ought to be kept in an old broken clay vessel (hakáchi), it may be mentioned that the Jibaros make use of broken clay pots at certain cathartic rites, when they try to get rid of something that is impure, horrible, and dangerous. Since the hen's blood which has purified the slayer is afterwards impure and harmful matter and accordingly is thrown away at once, it is consonant with ritualistic principles that it should be kept in a useless vessel, worthy of being thrown away, like the piece of a broken clay pot. It seems to be due to similar considerations that the Jibaros use a hakáchi for heating the sand with which the trophy is reduced at the preparation.' <sup id="cite_ref-1139" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1139">[1,139]</a></sup> 'Again, if one asks what ideas underlie the choice of the slayer's food-palm top, beans, mashed manioc, etc.-the Indians only give the explanation that he ought to eat such light kinds of food that remain in [307] his stomach and which he does not run the risk of throwing up, which evidently would be regarded as dangerous for him. Their idea is, no doubt, that a very indigestible or irritating food could become a means through [Page 302-307] which the invisible, supernatural enemy of the slayer-the spirit of the killed enemy-could get an opportunity to harm him, perhaps cause his death. That the guests mainly eat chicken at the feast is probably only due to the fact that Numbuimártinyu is an improvised feast, and that, therefore, such kinds of food is given them as is most easy to procure.” <sup id="cite_ref-1140" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1140">[1,140]</a></sup> “It may be observed that the practices and rites of the feast Numbuimártinyu and the rules observed afterwards may vary in certain details among different tribes. Thus among the Jibaros of the Pastaza and the Canelos Indians the diet of the slayer after the ‘washing of the blood’ consists mainly of the fruit and the leaves of the plant mandi (called sangu by the Jibaros). For a whole year the slayer has to abstain from cohabiting with his wife. The lance among these Indians is not washed at the ceremonial bath in the river, but the point of it is roasted in the fire so that the blood is dried or burned.' <sup id="cite_ref-1141" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1141">[1,141]</a></sup> 'The lance or the rifle with which an enemy has been killed is always looked upon with superstitious fear by the Indians, and is never again used in hunting. If, for instance, a wild hog is killed with such a lance or rifle, the flesh of the animal is supposed to get the same taste as human flesh, and would not therefore be eaten by anybody. The Jibaro warrior is therefore anxious to exchange as soon as possible the lance with which he has killed an enemy. The rifle he generally keeps, but no longer uses it in hunting, only in wars.' <sup id="cite_ref-1142" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1142">[1,142]</a></sup> 'Immediately after the feast Numbuimártinyu the slayer repairs to a natural waterfall in the forest (paccha or sasa), situated at a distance from his home, and takes some baths to further purify himself. He remains here alone for three days, fasting and taking tobacco water, sleeping at night in a small shelter and paying particular attention to his dreams. After the lapse of the three days he returns to his home, but [Page 309] passes the first two nights not in his house but in a small shelter made on the bank of the river.

Before he can make use of the greater liberty with regard to his mode of life which is conceded to him after the said feast, it is considered necessary that the black painting applied to his body at the feast shall have completely disappeared. The black dye prepared of the fruit of the Genipa americana, owing to its richness in tannin, is very astringent, and in spite of much washing remains for four or five days. The slayer as usual retires to the forest, staying in the neighbourhood of a sasa, where he bathes repeatedly and sleeps at night in a small shelter made close by. After the lapse of some days, when there are no traces left on his body of the painting, [315] he returns to his home, where he, in the main, resumes his former normal life, the only exception being the fasting which he is still bound to observe.” <sup id="cite_ref-1144" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1144">[1,144]</a></sup></dd>

Each is also located four or more kilometers from their nearest neighboring community. The community is made up of patrilineally and affinally related individuals, traditionally consisting of from 80 to 300 people (30 to 40 people in the twentieth century), living in one house called a JIVARIA. For defensive purposes, this house is built on a steep hill usually at the upper end of a stream. The house itself is approximately 13 meters by 26 meters in size, elliptical in shape, and has a thatched roof. In times of war, two or more communities united to fight a common enemy, as was the case when the Spanish attempted to conquer them.' <sup id="cite_ref-1145" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1145">[1,145]</a></sup>  'The basic domestic unit among the Jivaro is the polygynous family consisting of a man and his wife or wives and their children. Occasionally another relative such as a widowed mother or unmarried brother of the household head will also be included. In addition a married daughter and her husband may live in the household until the birth of their first child. Following the birth the family will be expected to move to a new dwelling nearby.' <sup id="cite_ref-1146" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1146">[1,146]</a></sup> Obligations to kind varied and were not organized through corporate kin groups: 'The basic Jivaro kin group is referred to as a "personal" bilateral kindred. In this type of kinship structure each person has a different kindred, with rights and obligations coinciding only with those of siblings of the same sex. Classification of kin, therefore, is spoken of as degrees of distance from ego, rather than in terms of membership or non-membership in a corporate unit as is quite often characteristic of unilineal descent societies. This form of kin group is probably the most insecure of the basic types of kinship systems for the individual, lacking defined descent groups affording protection from one's enemies and assistance in settling disputes among relatives (Harner, 1973: 97-98).' <sup id="cite_ref-1147" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1147">[1,147]</a></sup> 'Information on the classification of Jivaro kinship terminology is scant in the anthropological literature. In a series of tables appearing in an article entitled "World Ethnographic Sample", in the American Anthropologist, 1957, George P. Murdock characterizes the Jivaro as having bifurcate merging avuncular terminology in which FaBr is equated with Fa, but MoBr is differentiated from both. He also states that cousin terminology is also unusual in that non-marriageable cross-cousins are equated with siblings, while marriageable cross-cousins are differentiated (Murdock, 1957: 673). In single-word or elementary kin terms the modifier "true" or "branch" is added to the term to pin down degrees of relationship to ego. Where specific relatives are involved the modifying terms can often be substituted for one another, depending on the degree of closeness of relationship that the speaker wishes to imply. "True" relationship modifiers are used for an individual's biological kin - grandparents, parents, siblings, children, cross-cousins, and fathers of his cross-cousins. Those relatives assigned the "branch" category are affinal kin who, prior to marrying, were not considered by ego to be relatives of any degree (Harner, 1973: 98).' <sup id="cite_ref-1148" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1148">[1,148]</a></sup>  Men's property in structures and movables was inherited by the eldest son, eldest brother or eldest parallel cousin. The latter two could also inherit wives: 'Property acquired during a man's lifetime generally consists of the house he has built, artifacts that he has made or received as gifts, game and fish that he has caught, and specific crops, such as maize, that he has raised. At his death these items are inherited by his son of post-puberty age, or if there is none, then by his eldest brother. This brother also has the right to inherit the deceased's wife or wives. If there is no surviving brother, then his eldest parallel cousin is entitled to inherit the wife or wives.' <sup id="cite_ref-1149" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1149">[1,149]</a></sup> 'Clearly defined norms exist regarding the inheritance of [Page 178] both wives and material goods, although disputes regarding the latter category tend to be minor. The deceased man's eldest brother has the right to inherit his wife (wives). If there is no surviving brother of the deceased man, then his eldest parallel cousin is entitled to inherit the wife (wives). If the deceased man lacks sons of post-puberty age, his eldest brother also inherits his possessions. Otherwise, the eldest son receives these goods. There is a mild feeling that the eldest brother inheriting plural wives, or the eldest son inheriting material possessions, should distribute some of his new wealth to each of his younger brothers as they pass puberty.' <sup id="cite_ref-1150" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1150">[1,150]</a></sup> 'Property is transmitted from male to male, generally from father to son. When the husband dies, the wives of the deceased take off all their ornaments, cut their hair, and stop painting their faces and body, as a sign of mourning. In a word, they renounce all elegance. It is not true, nowadays at least, that the favorite wife follows the head of the family to the grave.' <sup id="cite_ref-1151" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1151">[1,151]</a></sup> Eldest sons were morally expected to share their inherited possessions with their younger brothers: 'Offenses involving material property are not common. Stealing, for example, is virtually unheard of with the exception [Page 179] of household looting following the assassination of an enemy. In such cases, the assassins are practicing behavior which is supposed to be reserved for acts of war against non-untsuri šuarä. Such behavior is thus in the nature of an additional indignity inflicted upon the victim's household, and is normally considered very bad form within the tribe. Inheritance of property does not always go entirely smoothly, however, because younger siblings may be angered if the eldest does not share some of the inheritance. Since, however, the eldest has the legal right to keep all the parent's possessions, the younger siblings do not have any recourse to any formalized sanctions. They usually just refuse to visit the elder brother.' <sup id="cite_ref-1152" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1152">[1,152]</a></sup> Women's property was passed on to the eldest daugher, mother, sister, or husband: 'A woman's property also consists of the artifacts she has made or received as gifts, wild food she has gathered, the crops that she is cultivating or has harvested, the section of the garden in which these crops are grown (in the case of several wives), and the pigs and chickens that she raises. She may also own pottery clay deposits, if they are near her home, and is the discoverer and primary excavator of these deposits (Harner, 1973: 179). This property is inherited by her eldest daughter, but if there is none, the deceased woman's mother will inherit the possessions.

Because of the retaliatory nature of legal sanctions in the society, the application of avenging action frequently initiates long and drawn out hostilities between two groups of kinsmen. This pattern of repeated application of sanctions by two families against one another is a dominant preoccupation especially among the interior Jivaro. These feuds may be formally ended by payment to the deceased's relatives, or when one of the eldest men on one side is killed, or when each group of kinsmen has lost a man.' <sup id="cite_ref-1155" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1155">[1,155]</a></sup> 'The primary motivation for warfare is to secure as many human heads as possible from an alien tribe, and secondarily to capture women. The acquisition of territory had never been a motive for engaging in warfare. The war party, consisting of approximately thirty or forty men, is recruited from the community itself or from friendly neighborhoods nearby, and is usually led by the UNYÄ   or KAKARAM   as war leader or chief. Actual warfare consists of preliminary ceremonies involving ritualized chanting, surprise attacks against one or two enemy houses, the killing and decapitation of the inhabitants or the occasional capture of a girl or woman as an extra wife, and the preparation of the TSANTSAS   on the return to the home village. Unlike many of the warlike Amazon tribes captives are not tortured or sacrificed, nor is cannibalism practiced.' <sup id="cite_ref-1156" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1156">[1,156]</a></sup> 'It may therefore be justly said that in their wars the Jibaros know no mercy. And although the Jibaro Indian does not particularly practise [292] methods of torturing his vanquished enemy, caught in a war, he on the other hand does not content himself with merely taking his life. He wants to shed as much blood as possible and delights in mutilating the body of the slain enemy, being especially anxious to secure his head.

Thus, while full-fledged head-taking raids are only launched against other groups “that speak differently,” i.e., have different dialects or languages, such as the Achuara, the assassination of a man belonging to a very distant neighborhood within the tribe may be followed occasionally by the taking of his head or by taking hair from his head to make a tsantsa with a tree gourd (see pp. 147-48). The latter type of tsantsa may also be made with the hair of a victim from a closer neighborhood provided that enmity towards its population is extremely strong in the killer's own locality.' <sup id="cite_ref-1158" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1158">[1,158]</a></sup> Spears were valued as insignia of masculinity: 'While the blowgun is their hunting weapon, the spear is their war weapon.

It is the weapon that signifies masculine dignity.' <sup id="cite_ref-1159" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1159">[1,159]</a></sup> 'Spears with iron points were generally in use when I visited the Indians.

They are said to obtain the iron points by way of barter from the Indians along the upper Senepa. The points are said to come from Ecuador. The spear with the iron point is called nánki by the Indians. Formerly spears were used shaped out of the wood of the chonta palm, and they still occur in isolated instances. The shape of their point is the same as the iron one, but its cross-section shows a somewhat concave outline. Shaft and point are made out of one piece. These chonta lances are called angös.' <sup id="cite_ref-1160" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1160">[1,160]</a></sup> Warfare was an important means of attaining prestige: 'The outstanding killer gains prestige and social obligations by helping the people of his locality in eliminating their enemies. Such a man is known as kakaram (“powerful” or “powerful one”) and also, if he is not too youthful, as untä. He is believed to possess an unusually large quantity of arutam soul power (see pp. 135-43) (kakarma), which both protects him from death and is believed to drive him on to kill as often as possible.' <sup id="cite_ref-1161" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1161">[1,161]</a></sup> 'The majority of young men interviewed expressed a strong desire to kill, not only to avenge the deaths of their fathers and other close relatives, but to acquire the arutam soul power and to become known, respected, and feared as kakaram. To be acknowledged as a kakaram, a man must have killed at least several persons. Early in his career, he does this by going on killing expeditions led by others, whether intra-tribal assassinations or the inter-tribal raids for tsantsa. As his reputation increases, he will eventually successfully organize and lead such an expedition himself, usually the more modest local assassination raid, probably against a specific personal enemy who is believed to have, sometime earlier, caused the death of a member of his immediate family. If he acquits himself well in achieving this assassination, especially as evidenced by firing the first shot into the victim, word will rapidly spread of his apparent power. Soon he will be approached by other men to lead them in killing expeditions against their own enemies. The kakaram, anxious to further his reputation as well as to gain additional supernatural power through more killing, rarely refuses such a request, even though it often means that he is agreeing to kill a fellow tribesman who is not even an enemy of his.' <sup id="cite_ref-1162" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1162">[1,162]</a></sup> 'As his reputation grows, the kakaram tends to dress himself in elaborate feather headdresses and ornaments when visiting other households or receiving guests (see frontispiece). [Page 113] Similarly, he adopts an ever more forceful and aggressive style of speaking when receiving visitors, meeting others on the trail, or in visiting other men. He conveys the impression of being invincible in every aspect of his public demeanor. If he has a son, he encourages him to become a killer also, and instructs him to the extent of taking him on assassination expeditions even as early as the age of six or seven years. Although such a young boy will not yet take part in the actual killing, the father brings him up to the corpse after the murder and has him fire into it, with the father helping him hold the gun. The wives of such a kakaram also are expected to outperform other women in making superior pottery vessels, doing garden work and other aspects of household labor. Informants said that one way of looking at this was that since a kakaram is very much a man, his wives have to be very much women.' <sup id="cite_ref-1163" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1163">[1,163]</a></sup> 'While a kakaram is greatly feared by his enemies, his neighbors usually look upon him as a great local asset, a deterrent to attacks upon them, and refer to him with the title untä (big) before his name, especially if he is also hospitable to them and generous with beer and food. Of course, there may be neighbors who get into a quarrel or other dispute with him; but they almost always move as soon as possible to another region of the tribe where they feel more secure.

These individuals acquire their reputation in the community by being old enough to have grandchildren, and are friendly, honest, and generous in dealing with others in the society. Because of these characteristics the UNYÄ   or KAKARAM   are believed to possess great ARUTAM   soul power and the ability to curse to death anyone who incurs their anger.

No other kind of person is considered to possess this ability. Partly out of fear of being cursed, young men in the neighborhood assist him in land clearing and other tasks when he requests their aid.

This form of kin group is probably the most insecure of the basic types of kinship systems for the individual, lacking defined descent groups affording protection from one's enemies and assistance in settling disputes among relatives (Harner, 1973: 97-98).' <sup id="cite_ref-1168" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1168">[1,168]</a></sup> 'Information on the classification of Jivaro kinship terminology is scant in the anthropological literature. In a series of tables appearing in an article entitled "World Ethnographic Sample", in the American Anthropologist, 1957, George P. Murdock characterizes the Jivaro as having bifurcate merging avuncular terminology in which FaBr is equated with Fa, but MoBr is differentiated from both. He also states that cousin terminology is also unusual in that non-marriageable cross-cousins are equated with siblings, while marriageable cross-cousins are differentiated (Murdock, 1957: 673). In single-word or elementary kin terms the modifier "true" or "branch" is added to the term to pin down degrees of relationship to ego. Where specific relatives are involved the modifying terms can often be substituted for one another, depending on the degree of closeness of relationship that the speaker wishes to imply. "True" relationship modifiers are used for an individual's biological kin - grandparents, parents, siblings, children, cross-cousins, and fathers of his cross-cousins. Those relatives assigned the "branch" category are affinal kin who, prior to marrying, were not considered by ego to be relatives of any degree (Harner, 1973: 98).' <sup id="cite_ref-1169" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1169">[1,169]</a></sup> The basic socioeconomic unit was the polygynous family: 'The basic domestic unit among the Jivaro is the polygynous family consisting of a man and his wife or wives and their children. Occasionally another relative such as a widowed mother or unmarried brother of the household head will also be included. In addition a married daughter and her husband may live in the household until the birth of their first child. Following the birth the family will be expected to move to a new dwelling nearby.' <sup id="cite_ref-1170" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1170">[1,170]</a></sup> Land ownership was not formally acknowledged: 'There is no individual or communal ownership of land or natural resources, except in the sense that a garden plot is owned by a woman as long as it is being cultivated, but probably not more than five years. However even in this case it is the capital improvement of the land that is owned, not the land itself. There are no territorial boundaries recognized for hunting, fishing or other purposes at a tribal, neighborhood, or household level.' <sup id="cite_ref-1171" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1171">[1,171]</a></sup> The notion of personal and heritable property encompassed movables, structures and crops: 'Property acquired during a man's lifetime generally consists of the house he has built, artifacts that he has made or received as gifts, game and fish that he has caught, and specific crops, such as maize, that he has raised. At his death these items are inherited by his son of post-puberty age, or if there is none, then by his eldest brother. This brother also has the right to inherit the deceased's wife or wives. If there is no surviving brother, then his eldest parallel cousin is entitled to inherit the wife or wives.' <sup id="cite_ref-1172" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1172">[1,172]</a></sup> 'Clearly defined norms exist regarding the inheritance of [Page 178] both wives and material goods, although disputes regarding the latter category tend to be minor. The deceased man's eldest brother has the right to inherit his wife (wives). If there is no surviving brother of the deceased man, then his eldest parallel cousin is entitled to inherit the wife (wives). If the deceased man lacks sons of post-puberty age, his eldest brother also inherits his possessions. Otherwise, the eldest son receives these goods. There is a mild feeling that the eldest brother inheriting plural wives, or the eldest son inheriting material possessions, should distribute some of his new wealth to each of his younger brothers as they pass puberty.' <sup id="cite_ref-1173" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1173">[1,173]</a></sup> 'Property is transmitted from male to male, generally from father to son. When the husband dies, the wives of the deceased take off all their ornaments, cut their hair, and stop painting their faces and body, as a sign of mourning. In a word, they renounce all elegance. It is not true, nowadays at least, that the favorite wife follows the head of the family to the grave.' <sup id="cite_ref-1174" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1174">[1,174]</a></sup> 'A woman's property also consists of the artifacts she has made or received as gifts, wild food she has gathered, the crops that she is cultivating or has harvested, the section of the garden in which these crops are grown (in the case of several wives), and the pigs and chickens that she raises. She may also own pottery clay deposits, if they are near her home, and is the discoverer and primary excavator of these deposits (Harner, 1973: 179). This property is inherited by her eldest daughter, but if there is none, the deceased woman's mother will inherit the possessions. In cases where there is no mother or daughter, a sister of the deceased may ask for the goods, otherwise the widower will retain the possessions to give to a future wife.' <sup id="cite_ref-1175" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1175">[1,175]</a></sup> 'A woman's property is inherited by her eldest daughter. If there is no daughter, the deceased girl's mother inherits the possessions. When there is neither a surviving daughter nor mother, a sister of the deceased girl may have the possessions if she asks for them. Otherwise, the widower keeps the things to give to a future wife.' <sup id="cite_ref-1176" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1176">[1,176]</a></sup> According to Rivet, theft was uncommon: 'Offenses involving material property are not common. Stealing, for example, is virtually unheard of with the exception [Page 179] of household looting following the assassination of an enemy. In such cases, the assassins are practicing behavior which is supposed to be reserved for acts of war against non-untsuri šuarä. Such behavior is thus in the nature of an additional indignity inflicted upon the victim's household, and is normally considered very bad form within the tribe. Inheritance of property does not always go entirely smoothly, however, because younger siblings may be angered if the eldest does not share some of the inheritance. Since, however, the eldest has the legal right to keep all the parent's possessions, the younger siblings do not have any recourse to any formalized sanctions. They usually just refuse to visit the elder brother.' <sup id="cite_ref-1177" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1177">[1,177]</a></sup> We are unsure of what to make of this material in relation to 'respect for property'. We have provisionally coded 'present', but this is open to review.</dd></dl>
<p><b>♠ Moralistic punishment by human religious agents ♣ absent ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. Shamans acted as healers and sorcerers and were in contact with spirits: 'Jivaro religion is based on the idea of an impersonal supernatural power called TSARUTAMA  , a concept similar to the Polynesians belief in MANA  . Objects, persons, spirits, and especially the TSANTSAS   are all infused with varying degrees of TSARUTAMA   which can be used for either good or evil. The mountain Rain God, the Anaconda, the Sun, Moon, Earth, and the chonta palm, are all believed to possess great amounts of this power.' <sup id="cite_ref-1178" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1178">[1,178]</a></sup> 'In addition to the above the Jivaro recognize three kinds of souls: the ARUTAM WAKANI  , which they believe to be the most significant; the MUISAK  , or avenging soul; and the NEKAS WAKANI  , the "true", "real", or "ordinary" soul. An individual is not born with an ARUTAM   soul but it is acquired through a vision quest in which fasting, cold water "bathing" and hallucinogenic drugs are used. This "quest" takes place for a boy about the age of six. The possessor of a single ARUTAM   soul is thought to be immune to death by physical means or sorcery, but can die of natural causes. Those individuals lucky enough to have two ARUTAM   souls cannot die of any cause.' <sup id="cite_ref-1179" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1179">[1,179]</a></sup> Gods did not employ moralistic punishment: 'There are no gods who play ethical or moral roles in the Jivaro pantheon, nor are there any priests or other religious specialist except the shaman (UWISIN  ) whose primary role in the society is magical curing, although he also has the power to send illness into an individual as a form of sorcery (Service, 1958: 196). Lacking true political organization, the shaman may be the most influential individual in the community frequently acting the role of KAKARAM   as well as shaman.' <sup id="cite_ref-1180" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1180">[1,180]</a></sup> 'Beyond the ritualized chanting that takes place before a raiding expedition, as mentioned above, the only other major ceremony taking place among the Jivaro is the TSANTSA   feast, a great victory celebration taking place in the home village following a successful head-hunting raid. Since food and drink are offered to the invited guests at these celebrations in great quantity, a great strain is put on the economic resources of the head-takers and their families so frequently the TSANTSA   feast may be spread over a period of two to three years during which resources are rebuilt. From the Jivaro's point of view the primary purpose of the TSANTSA   feast is not necessarily supernatural, although that is generally recognized as a secondary purpose; but to acquire prestige, friendship, and obligations through being recognized as an accomplished warrior, and through the feasting, by being a generous host to as many neighbors as possible (Harner, 1972: 191-192).' <sup id="cite_ref-1181" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1181">[1,181]</a></sup> Shamans may have participated in retaliation through sorcery, but we have found no evidence of explicit moralistic punishment by shamans: “From what has been stated about the medicine-men in the previous pages, for instance in connection with the demons appearing in the shape of wild animals, birds, and reptiles, we may conclude that they form a class of extraordinary importance in the Jibaro community. Among the Jibaros, as among the Canelos Indians, the medicine-man is the physician of the community, not a priest. His chief bussiness [sic] is to kill or harm other people—his own enemies or those of his tribe—with sorcery, and to cure evils sent by enemy sorcerers. He is not particularly a ‘weather-doctor’, i.e. a man that professes to influence the weather for good or evil. Although magical practices of this kind occur among the Jibaros, they can be performed by any member of the community and do not form part of the special functions of the medicine-men. Nor do they concern themselves with such ceremonies as are of a marked religious character, as for instance the rites and incantations performed in honour of Nungüi and her husband Shakaëma for agriculture. Divination consisting of drinking the narcotics natéma or maikoa is continually practised by the medicine-men, but chiefly in connection with their medical treatment.” <sup id="cite_ref-1182" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1182">[1,182]</a></sup> “… priests in the proper sense of the word do not exist, unless—as indeed I have done myself—we choose to give this name to the old man (whuéa) who conducts the ceremonies at the most important religious feasts. In this sense there may even be said to exist priestesses among the Jibaros, since old women perform similar duties at certain feasts.” <sup id="cite_ref-1183" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1183">[1,183]</a></sup> “I frequently use the expression ‘medicine-man and sorcerer’, indicating thereby that these conceptions are not exactly synonymous. A medicine-man is certainly always a sorcerer, but a sorcerer need not necessarily be a professional medicine-man. Thus old warriors and chiefs are generally more or less initiated in the magic art; in fact, they [400] fight their enemies not only with their natural weapons but also with their magical ‘arrows’ (tunchi). Yet they do not exercise the art of sorcery professionally and are seldom seen curing persons bewitched by other sorcerers. In this account I shall as a rule use the words ‘sorcerer’ or ‘wizard’ with reference to black or nefarious magic, whereas ‘medicine-man’ is a general appellation for a person practising the magic art. The Jibaros have only one word for denoting a medicine-man or sorcerer; wishinyu.” <sup id="cite_ref-1184" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1184">[1,184]</a></sup> Harner also describes 'bewitching' shamans: 'Roughly speaking, about one out of every four adult men is a shaman, so that, in any given locality, the shamans constitute a significant proportion of the male population. A few women are shamans, but among the Jívaro this is basically a man's occupation. The shamans in any particular neighborhood are ordinarily linked together by secret partnerships. These partnerships are also hierarchical in nature, and often a single shaman is the formally recognized leader of all the shamans in a specific neighborhood. These secret [Page 123] [Page 124] partnerships often link together four or five or more shamans in the same neighborhood, the higher partner supplying tsentsak, and his lower partners reciprocating with native and Western trade goods (kuit). Since bewitchers can create only bewitchers, while curers can create both bewitchers and curers (see pp. 155-56), the local hierarchies tend to have the forms shown in Figure 4.' <sup id="cite_ref-1185" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1185">[1,185]</a></sup> 'Ex-shamans have testified that intra-neighborhood shaman partners who are bewitchers sometimes even go to the length of mildly bewitching disliked neighbors so that their curing shaman partners can profit in trade goods from treating the induced illness. The bewitching partner expects his curing shaman associate, in turn, never to tell a layman that the former was responsible for an illness or death. The curing shaman may even give his bewitching partner an occasional gift from his accumulated store of wealth, thus reversing the usual flow of kuit (see Figure 4, B). More frequently, [Page 125] the curing shaman covertly reciprocates by later supplying his bewitching partner with a new supply of supernatural power in exchange for only a minor payment, instead of the normally major gift of a shotgun.' <sup id="cite_ref-1186" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1186">[1,186]</a></sup> 'A local bewitching shaman hierarchy also sometimes acts in concert as a “raiding party” to go together to kill, through witchcraft, a common enemy in another neighborhood. Using the method indicated elsewhere (see pp. 157-58), they secretly shoot their tsentsak from hiding near the house of their intended victim and then return home. Frequently, they remain together a few days in the house of their higher partner to await word that the enemy has become ill. Informants claimed that such concerted action “always” resulted in the intended victim immediately becoming ill.' <sup id="cite_ref-1187" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1187">[1,187]</a></sup> The above material does not provide evidence for moralistic punishment by shamans.
</p><p><b>Type of punishment this typically entailed (can be more than one):</b>
</p>
<dl><dd> <b>♠ physical punishment ♣ present ♥</b> The Shuar did not have a formal legal system, but had established means of responding to offenses. The murder of a kinsman had to be avenged: '“When a murder committed by tribesman is to be avenged, the social morality of the Jibaros requires that the punishment shall be meted out with justice, in so far that for one life which has been taken only one life should be taken in retaliation. Thereupon the blood-guilt is atoned for (tumáshi akérkama) and the offended family is satisfied. Consequently, if a Jibaro Indian wishes to avenge the murder of his brother, it may well happen that he, if the slayer himself cannot be caught and punished, will assassinate his brother or father instead of him, but he does not take the life of more than one member of the family, even if he has an opportunity of killing more. If he, for instance, killed not only the murderer himself but also one of his brothers, this would awaken indignation in the whole tribe, and it would be considered just that the family thus offended in its turn should take revenge. The blood guilt in such a case has passed to the original avenger. This principle, which requires that there shall be justice in the retaliation so that life is weighed against life, in itself of course has a tendency to limit blood-revenge. It happens, however, in many cases, and especially when supposed witchery is in question, that the person accused of the crime does not admit the guilt, but asserts that he and his family are innocently persecuted by the relatives of the dead. If then he or a member of his family is murdered, his relatives try, in their turn, to take revenge, and so on, in which case the blood feud tends to become prolonged indefinitely.”' <sup id="cite_ref-1188" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1188">[1,188]</a></sup> 'It seemed that this uncle had beaten one of his wives to death because she was unfaithful to him, and the woman's family, considering the treatment unnecessarily harsh, had murdered the husband in retaliation. Custom said that Kuashu's family must also take a life in order to satisfy the Jivaro sense of justice. With this end in view, the spirit of revenge was being kept alive, and almost every day the young men of the household were reminded of the duty which they inherited, and how they would eventually have to kill some member of the family who were responsible for their uncle's murder. The boys listened to the tale, which had already been told them hundreds of times, with as much interest as if they had never heard it before, and I wondered how long it would be ere their hands were stained with blood. They saw nothing wrong in this lust for vengeance, for their creed taught them that the spirit [158] of their uncle could not rest till justice had been meted out. Furthermore, if they failed to take reprisals they and their families would be the ones to suffer.” ' <sup id="cite_ref-1189" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1189">[1,189]</a></sup> Accordingly, kinsmen of the dead, not judges, decided on the course of action taken: 'Feuding or warfare is endemic among the Jivaro. Because of the retaliatory nature of legal sanctions in the society, the application of avenging action frequently initiates long and drawn out hostilities between two groups of kinsmen. This pattern of repeated application of sanctions by two families against one another is a dominant preoccupation especially among the interior Jivaro. These feuds may be formally ended by payment to the deceased's relatives, or when one of the eldest men on one side is killed, or when each group of kinsmen has lost a man.' <sup id="cite_ref-1190" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1190">[1,190]</a></sup> 'After this idea took hold, they travelled upriver to the settlement of Bupátä's brother Ungúmï, a húndach, or old one (although he is only about 45 years old), to seek his counsel. Then, Santü journeyed further north into Ecuador to converse with Mukwíngü, the mother's brother of Bupátä and Ungúmï. Such counsel, as I have indicated, forms an important part of the protocol that characterizes the pattern of Achuarä hostilities. Not every death attributed to sorcery is avenged, especially in the case of young children. But, once a homicide is committed in retaliation for perceived sorcery-related deaths, it inevitably calls forth a revenge raid sometime in the future on the part of close relatives-brothers-in-law or sons-in-law, usually-of the victims. Should their retaliation prove successful, close relatives of the person whose death initiated the feud also become obligated to avenge the more recent killing. Each successive death draws greater numbers of relatives into the feud on each side, and more and more lives are placed in jeopardy.' <sup id="cite_ref-1191" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1191">[1,191]</a></sup> Deaths by sorcery had to be avenged as well: 'Fear of sorcery and incurring the wrath of the  act as restraining elements of social control in the Jivaro community. In this society the code of lex talionis holds true so that anti-social acts directed against members of the community will result in assured retaliation by the victim's family. Thus, the fear of reprisal also acts as a means of aggression control in the society.' <sup id="cite_ref-1192" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1192">[1,192]</a></sup> '“Their unbounded sense of liberty and their desire to be independent, not only of the whites but also of each other, is one of the reasons why they do not live in villages but each family separately, for in this way conflicts are more easily avoided. It may for instance, happen that the swine, the most important domestic animals, who during the day are allowed to roam about freely in the forest, penetrate into the plantations of a neighbouring family and devastate the crops. The owner gets angry and claims compensation for the damage done. In this way quarrels easily arise which may develop into bloody fights; at any rate there arises general discord and distrust between the two families. Some time later it may happen that one or more members of either family fall ill with some of the diseases which the Jibaros ascribe to witchcraft. When trying to find out the author of the evil the head of that family is most likely to attribute it to the malicious art of a neighbour with whom he has had such a quarrel. If the patient dies he has recourse to divination by means of the narcotic natéma, which generally leads to his suspicions of the neighbour being confirmed. The family's sense of justice as well as the duty to the deceased now require that revenge shall be taken, and the supposed wizard is assassinated. This murder naturally awakens the desire for blood-revenge on the part of the family thus outraged, and so a blood-feud is begun, which, as is easily understood, has a tendency to make itself permanent.”' <sup id="cite_ref-1193" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1193">[1,193]</a></sup> The obligation to avenge could be avoided through gift-giving: 'It seems that among the Aguaruna Indians there is a sort of murderous revenge, though there is a way of redeeming it with gifts. I heard of one case where the gift of a blowgun eliminated the necessity for bloody revenge.' <sup id="cite_ref-1194" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1194">[1,194]</a></sup>  Blood vengeance was less common within families, conflicts being solved informally: '“Though, as we have seen, among the Jibaros blood-revenge takes place with regard to members of the same sub-tribe, this is not so when a crime is committed within the family. Among these Indians it sometimes occurs that a man kills his brother, if the latter, for instance, has seduced his wife or bewitched one of his children. But in this case blood-revenge is not generally taken, inasmuch as the natural avengers-that is, the father and the remaining brothers-abstain from carrying it out. ‘It is enough that one member of our family has died,’ they say, ‘why should we deprive ourselves of one more?’ The slayer is consequently pardoned. The absence of blood-revenge in a case like this is due to the natural sympathy which the avengers feel for the slayer, as well as to the consideration that by killing him they would only harm themselves, by weakening the power and influence of the family.”' <sup id="cite_ref-1195" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1195">[1,195]</a></sup> Stirling describes recognized extenuating circumstances: 'In the same way the Jivaros are apt to recognize extenuating circumstances in other cases where the crime has not been caused willfully, as for example, when someone in a state of intoxication or under the influence of a narcotic drink has been the cause of another person's death. However, in any of these instances, if the [117] evildoer refuses to pay to compensation asked, he becomes liable to blood revenge.”' <sup id="cite_ref-1196" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1196">[1,196]</a></sup> The material suggests that the Shuar population was not pulled into the settler court system during the early Ecuadorian period: 'In retaliation against the ravages of whites and such client Amerindians, some groups responded with force to outside efforts at settlement and exploitation. It is within this general context that our knowledge of Jivaroan warfare and feuding exists; and while the causes of Jívaro conflict lie in good part in environmental factors, this wider dimension cannot be ignored. As early as 1599, the Jivaroan peoples razed the Spanish gold-mining towns of eastern Ecuador and northern Peru, where Indian labor was being exploited to fill the coffers of the Spanish crown (Harner 1972:18-26; Izaguirre 1929/XI:11-19). Subsequent efforts to reestablish mines in the same region of the upper Santiago River have been persistently resisted as have other forms of occupation that have been attempted in or around the Jivaroan area.' <sup id="cite_ref-1197" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1197">[1,197]</a></sup></dd>

The blowgun and poisoned darts are their chief weapons. Related families live in a single large community house rather than in a village.' <sup id="cite_ref-1198" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1198">[1,198]</a></sup> 'Each household has either a single large garden or several smaller ones associated with it. In the latter case, the house itself is usually located in the largest. The Jivaro tend to cultivate slowly maturing tuberous plants, especially sweet manioc (Manihot Utilissima  ), all of which can be harvested over a long period of time providing agricultural products throughout the year.' <sup id="cite_ref-1199" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1199">[1,199]</a></sup> 'In addition to sweet manioc, the Jivaro also grew maize, sweet potatoes, peanuts, tuber beans, macabo (Xanthosoma sp.), pumpkins, plantains, tobacco, cotton, and, later, the introduced species of banana, sugarcane, taro, and yam. To supplement their diet the Jivaro hunt, fish and forage for wild fruits, cacao, nuts, and other foods. At one time they hunted deer and tapir, but by the middle of the twentieth century they gave up eating these animals out of fear of the spirits residing in them. Hunting is done with bows and arrows, spears, atlatls, and blow guns for small game. Occasionally cheap trade guns, often muzzleloaders, are used in the chase. Larger game is hunted by groups of men accompanied by dogs. There is much magic associated with hunting, including the use of pepper in the eyes of hunters and dogs to improve vision. The Jivaro traditionally domesticated llamas and guinea pigs and later the introduced dog, chicken, and pig.' <sup id="cite_ref-1200" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1200">[1,200]</a></sup> Division of labour was organized along gender lines: 'Men are responsible for protecting their families, house construction, basket making, different kinds of wood work, weapon manufacture, hunting and fishing, clearing the forest in preparation for the initial establishment of garden plots, and for cutting and bringing in fire wood. They also spin and weave and do some limited garden work. Women are responsible for the overwhelming majority of agricultural tasks, as well as for food and beer preparation, pottery making, fabric dyeing, child care, and the tending of the domestic animals (chiefly chickens and pigs).' <sup id="cite_ref-1201" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1201">[1,201]</a></sup> 'Jivaro graphic art is limited and simple. Weaving and spinning is exclusively a man's task. Men spin yarn from home-grown cotton and dye it with vegetal solutions. The yarn is then woven on a back strap loom into  or cotton kilts that form the basis of men and women's clothing.' <sup id="cite_ref-1202" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1202">[1,202]</a></sup> “Why do women dig yuca and the men fell trees? were questions Johnston asked me. He laboured under the common misapprehension that the women were slaves, and did the hardest work; but I had to explain otherwise. The Jivaros carry their sense of the personal, not only to animals, but also to trees and inanimate objects. In their eyes all things are animated by human spirits, male or female. The yuca has a female soul, hence it is proper for the women to cultivate it. Clay is feminine, therefore women must fashion the simple pottery which they use. Women must also handle the vessels when it comes to cooking. Most trees are men, hence men must chop them down. Cotton is of the male gender, so men must spin thread and make their own ‘itipis’ and also the ‘tarachi,’ or garments worn by the women. It is the sex distinction which is all important. Man and woman's work is as distinct as night from day, and the duties of one never overlap those of the other. There is not even a question of comparison between the two. A man is a man, and a woman a woman. That is their final argument.” <sup id="cite_ref-1203" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1203">[1,203]</a></sup> Trade with Europeans operated through middlemen and was based on barter: 'The commercial activities of the Jivaro are very restricted. In the early days of European contact hogs and chickens were raised for sale to those of European background. Salt, a rare commodity in the region, was gathered in clay pots from a few brackish springs in the area, allowed to evaporate, and the resulting hardened ball of salt used in exchange transactions with neighboring tribal groups. The Jivaro were famous for the shrinking of the human heads (TSANTSA  ) of their enemies (actually only the skin). Passing out of Jivaro country through a series of exchanges, these heads eventually found their way into the hands of traders who brought them down the Amazon to Para where they were sold. Soon the traders had a burgeoning trade in these items, and the Jivaro were hard-put to keep up with the demand. The Indians were by no means particular as to whose head was used, and advance orders were taken and filled. Eventually this native "industry" was brought to a halt by the Ecuadorian and Peruvian governments although by the late twentieth century life-like replicas of the heads made from animal skins are still being sold commercially.' <sup id="cite_ref-1204" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1204">[1,204]</a></sup> 'The few technological items that the Jivaro make are mostly used for their own subsistence needs, such as baskets, pottery, bows and arrows, blow guns, woven materials, etc. Any production of items above their immediate needs is employed in barter exchanges with neighboring people.' <sup id="cite_ref-1205" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1205">[1,205]</a></sup> 'Much of the trade of the Jivaro is between the "interior", relatively isolated groups (particularly the Achuara) and those "frontier" groups living in close proximity to Ecuadorian settlements where they have easy access to Western industrialized products. Through a series of neighborhood-to-neighborhood relays by native trading partners (AMIGRI  ) these products were passed from the frontier Jivaro into the most remote parts of the tribal territory. Thus the interior Jivaro were supplied with steel cutting tools, firearms and ammunition without having to come into contact with the population of European ancestry. In exchange the frontier Jivaro, whose supply of local game was nearly exhausted, obtained hides, feathers and bird skins (used for ornaments), which were not readily available in their own territory.' <sup id="cite_ref-1206" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1206">[1,206]</a></sup> Harner describes the development of trade relations between Jivaro and frontier settlements: 'The Viceroy of Peru soon sent a new expedition of colonists, as well as soldiers, into the Jívaro territory. These newcomers engaged in trade with the Indians, made peace pacts with them, and began to exploit the rich placer gold deposits of the Paute, Zamora and Upano rivers and their tributaries. Experiencing great success in their gold mining activities, the Spaniards founded two major communities, described [Page 18] as “cities,” in 1552: Logroño, possibly at the junction of the Río Paute (and Río Upano) with the Río Zamora; and Sevilla del Oro, probably somewhere on the middle Río Upano.' <sup id="cite_ref-1207" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1207">[1,207]</a></sup> 'With this initiation of trade relations between the two groups, Jívaro families soon migrated north from the Río Paute Valley to settle in the previously uninhabited land between the Rí Paute and Macas. These migrants began to act as middlemen in the barter of Jívaro products for steel machetes and other goods. The Macabeos at first traded mainly to secure pigs and salt obtained by the Jívaro from saline springs, but soon also began to attend tsantsa celebrations to purchase lard obtained from pigs slaughtered by the Jívaro on such occasions. As a consequence of their attendance at the feasts, the Macabeos started also to purchase tsantsa. This was the beginning of the “shrunken head” trade, and the first reported examples of tsantsa reached the outside world at about this time.' <sup id="cite_ref-1208" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1208">[1,208]</a></sup> 'By 1956, the Jívaro west of the Cordillera de Cutucú were largely in direct, continuous contact with the Spanish-speaking Ecuadorian population. In this frontier zone, white soldiers and police had imposed the national laws on the Jívaro. White settlers had seized almost all of the land except that protected by the missionaries, and employed the Jívaro in wage labor. Missionaries, with the backing of law enforcement agencies, were putting the Jívaro children in boarding schools and enculturating them to the new, alien way of life. This direct, unremitted contact was tending to acculturate the frontier Jívaro to the national Ecuadorian way of life and the direction of the trend was towards eventual assimilation.' <sup id="cite_ref-1209" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1209">[1,209]</a></sup> 'In contrast, the Jívaro beyond the frontier of colonization still were not yet in continuous first-hand contact with the white population at the time of the investigator's original fieldwork in 1956-57, and these are the people whose culture will be described here. Their territory, mainly east of the Cordillera de Cutucú, had been rarely, if ever, penetrated by any Spanish expedition or later group of Ecuadorian colonizers. This mountain barrier, which is traversed by an arduous [Page 35] journey of two or more days on foot, still discourages white penetration into the eastern interior.' <sup id="cite_ref-1210" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1210">[1,210]</a></sup> 'Cases of contact between the interior Jívaro and whites are all very recent and highly localized in their occurrence. The largest intrusion was made by the Royal Dutch Shell Oil Corporation in the early 1940's as part of an ill-fated oil exploration project. The company constructed a small airstrip near the Río Pangui in the easternmost part of the Jívaro territory, but within a few years abandoned the site altogether when explorations failed to reveal economically exploitable oil deposits in the region. The project involved relatively limited interaction with the Jívaro.' <sup id="cite_ref-1211" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1211">[1,211]</a></sup> 'The relative isolation of the interior Jívaro, however, had not prevented them from obtaining increasing quantities of machetes, steel axes, and shotguns. By means of neighborhood-to-neighborhood relays of native trading partners, these products of Western civilization were passed from the frontier Jívaro into the most remote parts of the tribal territory. All of the interior Jívaro neighborhoods were thus supplied with steel cutting tools, firearms, and ammunition without the necessity of coming into direct contact with the white population.' <sup id="cite_ref-1212" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1212">[1,212]</a></sup> 'The growth of this trade in recent decades had been made possible by the increasing involvement of the frontier Jívaro in the Ecuadorian socio-economic structure. The frontier Jívaro, primarily through their employment by Ecuadorians in manual labor, had acquired quantities of factory-manufactured goods. At the same time, there was a shortage of native-type goods among the Jívaro on the frontier, partially because of the near exhaustion of local game, which supplied feathers and bird skins for ornament. The interior Jívaro, in contrast, had a much more abundant supply of game and native-produced goods, but a greater scarcity of steel cutting [Page 40] tools and firearms. These complementary inequalities in supply and demand between the frontier and interior Jívaro formed the basis for the trade that supplied the latter with European-type technological items. Such technological items constituted almost the sole aspects of Western civilization that had been adopted by the interior Jívaro in 1956-57.' <sup id="cite_ref-1213" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1213">[1,213]</a></sup> 'The main variables introduced into interior Jívaro culture during the period studied were Western-manufactured trade goods, especially machetes, axes, and guns. Some machetes were acquired by the frontier Jívaro near Macas about a hundred years ago, but very few reached the interior Jívaro by intra-tribal trade until the turn of the century, and even these were so scarce and valued that their blades were each split into fragments to permit their utilization by several households. The more efficient steel blade fragments were at first used in the same manner as the aboriginal stone axe heads, each machete piece being mounted into a wooden handle. After the 1930's, however, machetes became sufficiently abundant so that the need to split the blades into small fragments was eliminated. They also largely replaced by then the traditional palm-wood “machetes” used in cutting down garden weeds. Despite their fair degree of availability at the present time, steel machetes are still highly valued and are used for many years, long after they have lost their handles and have become worn down to a fraction of their former size. Today they are considered to be utterly indispensable tools by the Jívaro, who also have been able to acquire some single-bitted steel axe-heads, although in much smaller numbers than the machetes.' <sup id="cite_ref-1214" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1214">[1,214]</a></sup> 'Economic factors are also playing an important role in the rapidly changing life of these people. The Jívaro, as has been indicated earlier in this book, have long been anxious to acquire the technology and dress of Western civilization. Now that air transportation is available to most of the tribe, the only limit on Jívaro aspirations to acquire manufactured goods is their ability to acquire cash. Their model for such success is the cattle-raising Ecuadorian colonists west of the Cordillera de Cutucú, who have now converted most of the bottomlands of the Río Upano Valley into pasture with the aid of Jívaro labor. Air transport has made it profitable to ship beef to the highlands from there, and three local competing airlines are involved in the lucrative trade. Some Jívaro, with the strong encouragement of both Catholic and Protestant missionaries, are now clearing pasture land also for themselves to raise cattle and are starting to achieve success in acquiring substantial cash in exchange for beef.' <sup id="cite_ref-1215" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1215">[1,215]</a></sup> 'Still, the Jívaro have clearly opted for adaptation to a Western life style and seem to have no brief for maintaining traditional features of their native life simply for tradition's sake alone. While they undoubtedly will wish to preserve and even revive certain aspects of their old culture within the context of a desire for an ethnic identity, at this moment in time they seem to be basically focused upon acquiring what they discern as the most positive features of the whites' life. Whether their eventual fate will parallel that of their North American counterparts, who went through similar attempts at adaptation in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, or whether the twentieth century will be kinder, is a question that remains to be answered.' <sup id="cite_ref-1216" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1216">[1,216]</a></sup> The frontier Jivaro became involved in rubber-tapping as well as unskilled temporary labour: 'There is no specific mention of direct involvement by Achuarä in rubber tapping at this time, although a census of the Pastaza and its tributaries in 1905 records two caucheros in residence on the Huasaga and an estimated 150 Achuarä in its vicinity (Fuentes 1908/I:194). However, it is clear that by 1917 at least some Achuarä were participating actively in such work. In that year, Rafael Karsten, a Scandinavian ethnographer, visited an Achuarä community in the company of their cauchero patrón, over a day's walk inland from another western tributary of the Pastaza, the Río Tunigrama (Karsten 1935:43).' <sup id="cite_ref-1217" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1217">[1,217]</a></sup> 'Historically the most persistent external pressure on the entire area occupied by the Jivaroan populations has been along the western frontier of Shuarä territory in Ecuador, in the Upano River Valley where the town of Macas is situated. By 1887, the Upano was observed to be suffering a shortage of game as a result of the presence of collectors of cinchona bark (for quinine) and other tropical products, who descended into the region from the Ecuadorian highlands (Vacas Galindo 1895:28-29). Many of the collectors worked primarily out of Macas, employing its non-Indian residents but occasionally enlisting the labor of Jívaro inhabitants of the valley in exchange for guns and other trade items (Harner 1972:30). Shuarä who had migrated there earlier in efforts to establish direct access to Western manufactures at Macas, found that with the stepping up of commercial activity in the valley and the initiation of cattle ranching at Macas, there was reduced demand for items they had formerly provided in exchange-deer, pigs, and native salt-although shrunken heads were still a greatly desired commodity (Harner 1972:29; Karsten 1935:56). In order to sustain their supply of manufactured trade goods, some of the Indians cut pastures for the Macabeos (Harner 1972:29); others, as observed, engaged in the extractive industry.' <sup id="cite_ref-1218" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1218">[1,218]</a></sup> Accordingly, that region was hit economically by the crash of the rubber market: 'However, with the crash of the rubber market, the commercial pressure on Indian populations-more attenuated here than elsewhere (Harner 1972:30)-was diminished. The cauchero whom Karsten encountered on the Pastaza working with inland Achuarä in 1917, was gone on Karsten's return trip in 1929 (Karsten 1935:41, 43, 78). Furthermore, numbers of Peruvian military outposts that had served to oversee commercial activity were withdrawn (Karsten 1935:43, 78; Zanabria Zamudio 1969:157, 159, 195), and access to the entire Pastaza region was gradually curtailed. A Catholic missionary reported in 1928 that “the steamships of Iquitos which periodically make the service to the Alto Marañon, do not enter [the Pastaza], since it is almost completely lacking in civilized people and all exploitation of goma [latex] has been suspended because of the depreciation” (Misiones Pasionistas 1943:264).' <sup id="cite_ref-1219" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1219">[1,219]</a></sup> 'Many sources of Western goods did vanish when the sudden depreciation in the value of wild Amazonian latex resulted in a major cutback in foreign investment and in the cessation of steamship transport to the region gradually coming to be occupied by Achuarä in Peru. However, commercial contact with the area was not wholly terminated. Some rubber extractors and colonists chose to remain after the crash as frontier agriculturalists or patrones of the Indians in the exploitation of other natural products. Furthermore, neither Peru nor Ecuador was fully willing to relinquish a tenuous hold over the northern tributaries of the Marañon and the as yet untapped resources to be found there.' <sup id="cite_ref-1220" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1220">[1,220]</a></sup> However, there was no professional specialization among the Shuar at the time.********According to SCCS variable 17 'Money (Media of Exchange) and Credit', ‘1’ or 'No media of exchange or money' was present, not 'Domestically used articles as media of exchange' or 'Tokens of conventional value as media of exchange' or 'Foreign coinage or paper coinage', or 'Indigenous coinage or paper currency'. Exchange was not monetized. Instead, gold dust was used in trade and (short-lived) tribute relations with Spanish intruders in the colonial period: 'The first reported white penetration of Jivaro territory was made in 1549 by a Spanish expedition under Hernando de Benavente. Later expeditions of colonists and soldiers soon followed. These newcomers traded with the Jivaro, made peace pacts with them, and soon began to exploit the gold found in alluvial or glacial deposits in the region. Eventually the Spaniards were able to obtain the co-operation of some of the Indians in working the gold deposits, but others remained hostile, killing many of the colonists and soldiers at every opportunity. Under the subjection of the Spaniards, the Jivaro were required to pay tribute in gold dust; a demand that increased yearly. Finally, in 1599, the Jivaro rebelled en masse, killing many thousands of Spaniards in the process and driving them from the region. After 1599, until nearly the middle of the nineteenth century, Jivaro-European relations remained intermittent and mostly hostile. A few missionary and military expeditions entered the region from the Andean highlands, but these frequently ended in disaster and no permanent colonization ever resulted. One of the few "friendly" gestures reported for the tribe during this time occurred in 1767, when they gave a Spanish missionizing expedition "gifts", which included the skulls of Spaniards who had apparently been killed earlier by the Jivaro (Harner, 1953: 26). Thus it seems that the Jivaros are the only tribe known to have successfully revolted against the Spanish Empire and to have been able to thwart all subsequent attempts by the Spaniards to conquer them. They have withstood armies of gold seeking Inkas as well as Spaniards, and defied the bravado of the early conquistadors.' <sup id="cite_ref-1221" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1221">[1,221]</a></sup> Trade with Europeans and other Amerindians operated through middlemen and was mostly in the form of barter: 'The commercial activities of the Jivaro are very restricted. In the early days of European contact hogs and chickens were raised for sale to those of European background. Salt, a rare commodity in the region, was gathered in clay pots from a few brackish springs in the area, allowed to evaporate, and the resulting hardened ball of salt used in exchange transactions with neighboring tribal groups. The Jivaro were famous for the shrinking of the human heads (TSANTSA  ) of their enemies (actually only the skin). Passing out of Jivaro country through a series of exchanges, these heads eventually found their way into the hands of traders who brought them down the Amazon to Para where they were sold. Soon the traders had a burgeoning trade in these items, and the Jivaro were hard-put to keep up with the demand. The Indians were by no means particular as to whose head was used, and advance orders were taken and filled. Eventually this native "industry" was brought to a halt by the Ecuadorian and Peruvian governments although by the late twentieth century life-like replicas of the heads made from animal skins are still being sold commercially.' <sup id="cite_ref-1222" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1222">[1,222]</a></sup> 'The few technological items that the Jivaro make are mostly used for their own subsistence needs, such as baskets, pottery, bows and arrows, blow guns, woven materials, etc. Any production of items above their immediate needs is employed in barter exchanges with neighboring people.' <sup id="cite_ref-1223" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1223">[1,223]</a></sup> 'Much of the trade of the Jivaro is between the "interior", relatively isolated groups (particularly the Achuara) and those "frontier" groups living in close proximity to Ecuadorian settlements where they have easy access to Western industrialized products.

But since the Indians most of the time do not have any [72] shot to go with it, these rifles are for the most part ornamental pieces. As a matter of fact, the Indians are not too fond of rifles since, they maintain, their report chases the game off.' <sup id="cite_ref-1225" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1225">[1,225]</a></sup> 'Spears with iron points were generally in use when I visited the Indians. The point (see Figure 7) has a socket at the bottom. The shaft is fastened into the socket with the help of resin. The spear or lance has a length of 2 1/2 - 3 1/2 meters. They are said to obtain the iron points by way of barter from the Indians along the upper Senepa. The points are said to come from Ecuador. The spear with the iron point is called nánki by the Indians. Formerly spears were used shaped out of the wood of the chonta palm, and they still occur in isolated instances.

[Shuar parties would occasionally travel to colono settlements to trade , and even travel up to Andean cities to trade gold powder against metal tools. There are records of such incursions in last quarter of 18th century and again between 1850 and 1880.] 'In order to get articles that were valuable to them the Indians started to collect the products of their forests. In exchange for rubber, various resins, canoes, Maní, yucca, bananas, tamed animals and parrots the Indians ask for Winchester repeating arms, rifles and the necessary ammunition, axes, knives, scissors, needles, fishhooks, mirrors, cotton wares, sewing thread, etc. At that time the rate of exchange was the following: For a small canoe for six people they would receive an ordinary single-barrelled rifle (European value perhaps 10 Marks). For a hen or a large bunch of bananas they would receive one vara (84 cm.) of Tocuyo (thin, unbleached cotton, muslin?). In exchange for a basket (15 liter) of ground-nuts (maní) they could barter 4 vara (336 cm.) of Tocuyo. I have witnessed it several times in Nazaret that the Indians were terribly cheated with regard to weight when they made their rubber deliveries to the white men, and I could see it from the expression on their faces that they were aware of the fraud.' <sup id="cite_ref-1228" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1228">[1,228]</a></sup> Rivet reports some monetization of the tsantsa trade: 'The first tsantsas coming to Europe had their hour [72] of renown and attained extraordinary prices. In 1865, one of them was sold for 1500 francs ( ). Ten years ago another was sold at auction for 500 francs at the Hotél Drouot ( ). Actually, these objects are much less rare and have lost a part of their commercial value. At Macas, at Gualaquiza and at Zamora, the whites buy them directly from the Indians for ten sucres, that is 25 francs, and take them to Cuenca, Riobamba and Loja, where they resell them for 30 to 50 sucres, that is 75 to 125 francs. In Europe, the best examples are worth 200 and 300 francs and there is not an important museum that does not possess at least one. In Paris, the Museum of Natural History has five of them, the Anthropological Society one, the Ethnographic Museum of the Trocadero three, the Army Museum one, and also there are a good number in private collections.' <sup id="cite_ref-1229" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1229">[1,229]</a></sup> It remains to be confirmed how common this was in direct exchanges between settlers/traders and Indians. We have provisionally assumed that most exchanges were based on barter regardless. More material may be needed.</dd>

I have witnessed it several times in Nazaret that the Indians were terribly cheated with regard to weight when they made their rubber deliveries to the white men, and I could see it from the expression on their faces that they were aware of the fraud.' <sup id="cite_ref-1243" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1243">[1,243]</a></sup> In most cases, barter trade operated through intermediaries or patrones rather than established markets in white settlements. [By and large this is true, but shuar parties would occasionally travel to colono settlements to trade , and even travel up to Andean cities to trade gold powder against metal tools. There are records of such incursions in last quarter of 18th century and again between 1850 and 1880.] 'The first reported white penetration of Jivaro territory was made in 1549 by a Spanish expedition under Hernando de Benavente. Later expeditions of colonists and soldiers soon followed. These newcomers traded with the Jivaro, made peace pacts with them, and soon began to exploit the gold found in alluvial or glacial deposits in the region. Eventually the Spaniards were able to obtain the co-operation of some of the Indians in working the gold deposits, but others remained hostile, killing many of the colonists and soldiers at every opportunity. Under the subjection of the Spaniards, the Jivaro were required to pay tribute in gold dust; a demand that increased yearly. Finally, in 1599, the Jivaro rebelled en masse, killing many thousands of Spaniards in the process and driving them from the region. After 1599, until nearly the middle of the nineteenth century, Jivaro-European relations remained intermittent and mostly hostile. A few missionary and military expeditions entered the region from the Andean highlands, but these frequently ended in disaster and no permanent colonization ever resulted. One of the few "friendly" gestures reported for the tribe during this time occurred in 1767, when they gave a Spanish missionizing expedition "gifts", which included the skulls of Spaniards who had apparently been killed earlier by the Jivaro (Harner, 1953: 26). Thus it seems that the Jivaros are the only tribe known to have successfully revolted against the Spanish Empire and to have been able to thwart all subsequent attempts by the Spaniards to conquer them. They have withstood armies of gold seeking Inkas as well as Spaniards, and defied the bravado of the early conquistadors.' <sup id="cite_ref-1244" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1244">[1,244]</a></sup> 'Frontier' communities would act as intermediaries between settlers and 'interior' groups: 'Much of the trade of the Jivaro is between the "interior", relatively isolated groups (particularly the Achuara) and those "frontier" groups living in close proximity to Ecuadorian settlements where they have easy access to Western industrialized products. Through a series of neighborhood-to-neighborhood relays by native trading partners (AMIGRI  ) these products were passed from the frontier Jivaro into the most remote parts of the tribal territory. Thus the interior Jivaro were supplied with steel cutting tools, firearms and ammunition without having to come into contact with the population of European ancestry. In exchange the frontier Jivaro, whose supply of local game was nearly exhausted, obtained hides, feathers and bird skins (used for ornaments), which were not readily available in their own territory.' <sup id="cite_ref-1245" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1245">[1,245]</a></sup> Given the 'occasional' nature of incursion into market towns, we have provisionally coded the variable absent.</dd></dl>

One, while serving as its “governor,” induced its abandonment in 1887 after personally directing an attack upon inland Achuarä not far to the west. Fearful of Achuarä retaliation, the Andoans themselves razed their town, then fled eastward under the direction of their patrón to exploit rubber for him on the Tigre River (Vacas Galindo 1895:211; 1905:427).' <sup id="cite_ref-1246" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1246">[1,246]</a></sup> 'Many sources of Western goods did vanish when the sudden depreciation in the value of wild Amazonian latex resulted in a major cutback in foreign investment and in the cessation of steamship transport to the region gradually coming to be occupied by Achuarä in Peru. However, commercial contact with the area was not wholly terminated. Some rubber extractors and colonists chose to remain after the crash as frontier agriculturalists or patrones of the Indians in the exploitation of other natural products. Furthermore, neither Peru nor Ecuador was fully willing to relinquish a tenuous hold over the northern tributaries of the Marañon and the as yet untapped resources to be found there.' <sup id="cite_ref-1247" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1247">[1,247]</a></sup> 'Peru, in 1907, offered a concession of several years duration to a corporation of over 20 merchants from Iquitos (numbers of whom had become powerful figures during the rubber era), for the exploration of gold reserves in the Santiago Basin (Larrabure i Correa 1905/XVIII:219-220). In 1918, private entrepreneurs initiated the exploitation of finewood as in industry in the Peruvian Department of Loreto with the installation of the first regional sawmill in Iquitos (Rumrrill 1974:11). Lumber extraction was to prove such a steadily profitable venture that by 1970, there were over 30 sawmills in and around Iquitos alone (Nichols 1970:8). Several of these have become linked through a series of commercial relations to the Achuarä, among whom cutting cedar (Watson Cisneros 1964:24) is one of the major economic associations with outsiders. Involvement both in lumbering and in preparing skins for trade-chiefly those of the peccary, ocelot, and nutria-is the means by which relatively isolated Achuarä communities currently maintain access to such Western manufactures as machetes, shotguns, and shells, which have become essential to indigenous subsistence practices and to defense. This has entailed, however, an increasing dependence on relations with river traders, patrones, and itinerant [Page 96] mestizo lumbermen, with consequences for the Achuarä pattern of continuing revenge hostilities that are considered below.' <sup id="cite_ref-1248" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1248">[1,248]</a></sup> We may presume relations of debt between white patrones and Shuar clients, although they were probably little formalized: 'Contact with constituents of an advancing capitalism and nationalist frontier has altered virtually all the Amerindian populations of lowland South America, through the debilitating effects of epidemics, as a result of enslavement and debt peonage, and through territorial retrenchment or dislocation. Other, less morbid and more readily accepted changes include the introduction of novel cultigens (such as plantains and sugar cane), metal tools (machetes, axes, fishhooks) and, in many cases, the shotgun or carbine. Such influences and innovations have not been uniform, nor the rates and degrees of change identical, but their ultimate consequence of increasing economic dependence on Euroamerican commerce has almost universally created a situation in which fundamental aspects of production and exchange are tied to highly problematic and frequently exploitative relations with mestizo settlements, river traders, and missionaries.' <sup id="cite_ref-1249" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1249">[1,249]</a></sup> We are unsure whether the trade relationships between Shuar communities and middlemen constitute a form of patronage.

Yuca, for instance, is ready in six months; Indian corn in three months; yams (a potato which grows three to four feet in length and fifty pounds in weight) in a year; sweet potatoes, peanuts, and tobacco are also cultivated in large quantities.”' <sup id="cite_ref-1250" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1250">[1,250]</a></sup> Karsten reports only household-level food storage. [There were no collective storage facilities. In fact the only crops stored in households were/are peanuts and maize. Since the Jivaroans only use sweet manioc, they do not manufacture manioc flour.] '“The truth is that the married Jibaro woman is not only completely independent within her own sphere of activity, but exercises a remarkable social influence and authority even in matters which mainly concern the husband. It is interesting to state in this respect that a family-father never sells fruit or other articles of food without the consent of his wife. There are, I think, few civilized societies where the man so unfailingly asks his wife's advice, even in unimportant matters, as among these savages. It occurred very frequently during my travels in the forest that I paid visits to the Jibaro houses to buy manioc or bananas, and received from the ‘autocrat’ of the house the answer: ‘I must first ask [254] my wife.’ Frequently the wife happened to be absent for the moment and then the answer was: ‘Wait a while until my wife arrives.’ I saw that there was a store of manioc and bananas in the house, and it would have been an easy thing for the man to give me immediately what I wanted to buy; yet he compelled me to wait for a long while, perhaps for hours, only to be able to ask his wife's permission to make the insignificant bargain. Still one can understand this consideration for the housewife when articles of food are in question. Since the wife is the keeper of the food and is responsible for the existence of a store sufficient for the needs of the family, it is natural that she should also be allowed to decide how much of it can be given to strangers.' <sup id="cite_ref-1251" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1251">[1,251]</a></sup>

They do it perhaps because there is no suitable land close to the river, where the huts are set up, or for some other reason. As they go along, they collect the material for their permanent home.

<p><b>♠ Health infrastructure ♣ absent ♥</b> There was no public health infrastructure. Notions of illness and health were centred on shamanism and  herbal medicines: 'The vast majority of illnesses and non-violent deaths are believed to be caused by witchcraft. The only diseases not attributed to witchcraft are "white man's diseases", such as whooping cough, measles, colds, smallpox, and mild forms of diarrhea, which are treated by the "laymen" of the community with herbal medicines. Shamans never use herbal remedies, but depend on their ability to manipulate the supernatural world in the diagnosis of a disease. This process involves their taking of hallucinogenic drugs to induce a trance state during which they enter the spirit world and determine the cause of the disease. If the disease is caused by particular spirits, as the Jivaro usually believe, the shaman ritually treats the affliction by a process of singing and sucking.' <sup id="cite_ref-1256" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1256">[1,256]</a></sup> Shamans performed witchcraft and healing rituals in the case of illness. Trance and spirits were important. Harner describes both bewitching and curing: 'Shamans prefer to use natemä rather than maikua (Datura arborea) for going into trances, because the potency of the latter is too great for the shaman to be able to function ritually in singing, sucking, and the accompanying social interaction. Also, since the shaman must go into trances with frequency, he does not like to use Datura for that purpose because the strength of the plant is such that its repeated use is believed to lead to insanity. As an illustration of this [Page 154] danger, one informant said, “My father told me that a long time ago a man took maikua all the time. As a result, he lost his mind and would go walking in the forest to speak with the spirits.” For these reasons, the shaman tends to use the less strong Banisteriopsis drink natemä. In arutam seeking, however, a person in a trance does not need to perform ritual or interact with others, and therefore Datura, precisely because of its strength to produce visions, is the drug of choice.' <sup id="cite_ref-1257" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1257">[1,257]</a></sup> 'The use of the hallucinogenic natemä drink among the Jívaro makes it possible for almost anyone to achieve the trance state essential for the practice of shamanism. Given the presence of the drug and the felt need to contact the “real,” or supernatural, world, it is not surprising that approximately one out of every four Jívaro men is a shaman. Any adult, male or female, who desires to become such a practitioner, simply presents a gift to an already practicing shaman, who administers the Banisteriopsis drink and gives some of his own supernatural power-in the form of spirit helpers, or tsentsak-to the apprentice. These spirit helpers, or “darts,” are the main supernatural forces believed to cause illness and death in daily life. To the non-shaman they are normally invisible, and even shamans can perceive them only under the influence of natemä.' <sup id="cite_ref-1258" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1258">[1,258]</a></sup> 'During the period of sexual abstinence, the new shaman collects all kinds of insects, plants, and other objects, which he now has the power to convert into tsentsak. Almost any object, including living insects and worms, can become a tsentsak if it is small enough to be swallowed by a shaman. Certain small spiders become tunčï, a special kind of tsentsak. Different types of tsentsak are used to cause different kinds and degrees of illness, and the greater the variety of these objects that a shaman has in his body, the greater is his ability.' <sup id="cite_ref-1259" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1259">[1,259]</a></sup> 'A special kind of spirit helper, called a pasuk, can aid the bewitching shaman by remaining near the victim in the guise of an insect or animal of the forest after the bewitcher has left. This spirit helper has his own objects to shoot into the victim should a curing shaman succeed in sucking out the tsentsak sent earlier by the bewitcher who is the owner of the pasuk.' <sup id="cite_ref-1260" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1260">[1,260]</a></sup> 'After he returns home from bewitching, the shaman may send a wakanï bird to perch near the house of the victim. Then, if a curing shaman sucks out the intruding object, the bewitching shaman sends the wakanï bird more tsentsak to throw from its beak into the victim. By continually resupplying the wakanï bird with new tsentsak, the sorcerer makes it impossible for the curer to rid his patient permanently of the magical darts.' <sup id="cite_ref-1261" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1261">[1,261]</a></sup> 'The degree of illness produced in a witchcraft victim is a function of both the force with which the tsentsak is shot into the body, and also of the character of the magical dart itself. If a tsentsak is shot all the way through the body of a victim, then “there is nothing for a curing shaman to suck out,” and the patient dies. If the magical dart lodges within the body, however, it is theoretically possible to cure the victim by sucking. But in actual practice, the sucking is not always considered successful.' <sup id="cite_ref-1262" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1262">[1,262]</a></sup> 'The work of the curing shaman is complementary to that of a bewitcher. When a curing shaman is called in to treat a patient, his first task is to see if the illness is due to witchcraft. The usual diagnosis and treatment begin with the curing shaman drinking natemä, tobacco water, and pirípiri in the late afternoon and early evening. These drugs permit him to see into the body of the patient as though it were glass. If the illness is due to sorcery, the curing shaman will see the intruding object within the patient's body clearly enough to determine whether or not he can cure the sickness (see Plate 23).' <sup id="cite_ref-1263" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1263">[1,263]</a></sup> 'A shaman sucks magical darts from a patient's body only at night, and in a dark area of the house, for it is only in the dark that he can perceive the drug-induced visions that are the supernatural reality. With the setting of the sun, [Page 161] he alerts his tsentsak by whistling the tune of the curing song; after about a quarter of an hour, he starts singing. A shaman's curing songs tend to be self-encouraging exhortations  [...].' <sup id="cite_ref-1264" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1264">[1,264]</a></sup> 'When he is ready to suck, the shaman regurgitates two tsentsak into the sides of his throat and mouth. These must be identical to the one he has seen in the patient's body. He holds one of these in the front of the mouth and the other in the rear. They are expected to catch the supernatural aspect of the magical dart that the shaman sucks out of the patient's body. The tsentsak nearest the shaman's lips is supposed to incorporate the sucked-out tsentsak essence within itself. If, however, this supernatural essence should get past it, the second magical dart in the mouth blocks the throat so that the intruder cannot enter the interior of the shaman's body. If the curer's two tsentsak were to fail to catch the supernatural essence of the tsentsak, it would pass down into the shaman's stomach and kill him. Trapped thus within the mouth, this essence is shortly caught by, and incorporated into, the material substance of one of the curing shaman's tsentsak. He then “vomits” out this object and displays [Page 163] it to the patient and his family, saying, “Now I have sucked it out. Here it is.”' <sup id="cite_ref-1265" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1265">[1,265]</a></sup> 'The non-shamans think that the material object itself is what has been sucked out, and the shaman does not disillusion them. At the same time, he is not lying, because he knows that the only important thing about a tsentsak is its supernatural aspect, or essence, which he sincerely believes he has removed from the patient's body. To explain to the layman that he already had these objects in his mouth would serve no fruitful purpose and would prevent him from displaying such an object as proof that he had cured the patient. Without incontrovertible evidence, he would not be able to convince the patient and his family that he had effected the cure and must be paid.' <sup id="cite_ref-1266" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1266">[1,266]</a></sup> 'The ability of the shaman to suck depends largely upon the quantity and strength of his own tsentsak, of which he may have hundreds. His magical darts assume their supernatural aspect as spirit helpers when he is under the influence of natemä, and he sees them as a variety of zoomorphic forms hovering over him, perching on his shoulders, sticking out of his skin, and helping to suck the patient's body. He must drink tobacco water every few hours to “keep them fed” so that they will not leave him. He will also appear, to another shaman under the influence of natemä, to have a gold, red and greenish “crown” above his head (see Plate 24).' <sup id="cite_ref-1267" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1267">[1,267]</a></sup> 'The curing shaman must also deal with any pasuk that may be in the patient's vicinity for the purpose of casting more darts. He drinks additional amounts of natemä in order to see them and engages in tsentsak duels with them if they are present. While the pasuk is enclosed in iron armor, the shaman himself has his own armor, composed of his many tsentsak. As long as he is under the influence of [Page 164] natemä, these magical darts cover his body as a protective shield, and are on the lookout for any enemy tsentsak headed towards their master. When these tsentsak see such a missile coming, they immediately close up together at the point where the enemy dart is attempting to penetrate, and thereby repel it.' <sup id="cite_ref-1268" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1268">[1,268]</a></sup> 'If the curer finds tsentsak entering the body of his patient after he has killed the pasuk, he suspects the presence of a wakanï bird. The shaman drinks maikua (Datura), since it is more powerful than natemä, as well as tobacco water, and silently sneaks into the forest to hunt and kill the bird with tsentsak. When he succeeds, the curer returns to the patient's home, blows all over the house to get rid of the “atmosphere” created by the numerous tsentsak sent by the bird, and completes his sucking of the patient. Even after all the tsentsak are extracted, the shaman may remain another night at the house to suck out any “dirtiness” (pahuri) still inside. In the cures which I have witnessed, this sucking is a most noisy process, accompanied by deep, but dry, vomiting.' <sup id="cite_ref-1269" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1269">[1,269]</a></sup> 'After sucking out a tsentsak, the shaman puts it into a little container. He does not swallow it, because it is not his own magical dart and would therefore kill him. Later, he throws the tsentsak into the air, and it flies back to the shaman who sent it originally into the patient. Tsentsak also fly back to a shaman at the death of a former apprentice who had originally received them from him. Besides receiving “old” magical darts unexpectedly in this manner, the shaman may have tsentsak thrown at him by a bewitcher. Accordingly, shamans constantly drink tobacco water at all hours of the day and night. Although the tobacco water is not truly hallucinogenic, it produces a narcotized state, which is believed necessary to keep one's tsentsak ready to repel any other magical [Page 165] darts. A shaman does not even dare go for a walk without taking along the green tobacco leaves with which he prepares the juice that keeps his spirit helpers alert. Less frequently, but regularly, he must drink natemä for the same purpose and to keep in touch with the supernatural reality.' <sup id="cite_ref-1270" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1270">[1,270]</a></sup> Brüning and Dyott also provide descriptions of shamanistic healing practices: 'The ordinary sicknesses are cured by the brujo. This is the general Peruvian name for quack and sorcerer. I have not been able to find out what the Aguaruna term was. In a tambo in Huaracayo I had an opportunity to watch a brujo at work. One evening we were assembled in the house of several rubber collectors when we heard a strange singing from a nearby Indian tambo. I was informed that this meant that a brujo was at work. Immediately I went over to witness the procedure. The tambo was completely dark. Nothing could be heard except the forceful voice of the brujo mixed with the whimpering of a woman. I was told that the woman had pains in the leg. The brujo sang with a loud voice. Next he smoked a strong cigar, inhaling the smoke. In between he sucked the aching part of the woman's leg. Then he gnashed his teeth, pretended that he had to vomit and spit, as if to give the impression that he had sucked some foreign matter from the leg. I can not tell how often he repeated this, nor how long the treatment lasted. The brujo acted so realistically, that I was sickened by it and had to leave the hut in order not to vomit myself.' <sup id="cite_ref-1271" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1271">[1,271]</a></sup> 'Mihanda had a bad swelling on his left arm which, judging from its ugly appearance, must have been extremely painful. Napi [KS: medicine man] was called in for consultation. He examined it critically, nodding his head to and fro as if to say, why that is easily cured. He did not express himself one way or the other in words but stepped out of the house for a few moments, returning with a handful of leaves which I could not identify. These he chopped up carefully, as if making mint sauce, and then put on one side. Once more he examined Mihanda's arm, rubbed it, squeezed it, punched it, and generally went through the usual movements of an experienced masseur. His patient put up with the rough handling stolidly and without flinching. The medicine-man's next move was to suck the wound with his mouth. For some minutes he continued doing this, pausing to take breath and then returning to his task with renewed vigour as if he were having quite a struggle to withdraw something from his patient's arm. Suddenly he stopped and sat back as if his efforts had been successful. ‘Look,’ he said to Mihanda, ‘no wonder your arm was sore. Just see what I have taken out of it.’ With which he took out of his mouth a fair sized pebble and handed it over for the astonished Mihanda to examine.//'The treatment did not end here, for next the wizard took the minced-up leaves, smeared them carefully over the sore spot, then taking a stick from the fire, one end of which was so much red-hot charcoal, he proceeded to touch the patient's arm and so cauterize the wound. The pain must have been excruciating but Mihanda did not utter a sound; he only made a wry face.//'Napi's methods might sound a trifle crude to the modern doctor, but it shows, nevertheless, that he had a wonderful fund of knowledge. First of all, note the manipulation of the arm; secondly, the removal of undesirable matter by the simple process of suction. The trick played on the patient's credulity is exceptionally interesting, because it indicates that Napi vaguely realized certain fundamental laws of suggestion. The stone had not come out of Mihanda's arm but out of Napi's wallet which he had slung over his shoulder. I have seen beetles, sticks and all kinds of things taken out of wounds before now, so I was used to this part of the procedure. The final application of the herb and the cauterizing of the wound showed that Napi was not only a good conjurer, but one who understood the medicinal value of plants and the need of making the wound antiseptic. When we last saw Mihanda, thirty-six hours later, the swelling had subsided, the inflammation had gone, and the wound was healing over nicely.' <sup id="cite_ref-1272" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1272">[1,272]</a></sup> It appears that public health services were restricted to colonists during the Ecuadorian period: 'The last, but not the least, concern of the federation is in the area of health. Kroeger and Ileckova (1976) report that the major problems affecting the Shuar population are a high infant mortality rate (14.5% in 1971) and malnutrition, particularly owing to low consumption of basic foods such as eggs, milk, and meat. Typically fatal diseases in Shuar children are measles, bronchitis, and parasite-induced diarrhea. Among adults, tuberculosis is becoming increasingly frequent as the colonization frontier advances further into Shuar territory. The federation maintains that government attention to Shuar health has been minimal, since medical care in lowland towns is largely a privilege of the colonist population. Consequently, the federation's Health Commission has established its own program with the help of the Salesian mission and the German Volunteers, both of which have organized training courses for health volunteers, nurses, and social workers. The emphasis of the Shuar health program is on preventive medicine, and fostering of hygienic habits is of primary importance. Information on health matters is provided by radio broadcasts and health workers who manage the program in each Shuar centro. First-aid kits provided by the federation are available in all centros. In the event of outbursts of contagious disease, each asociación has a special team of health officials to carry out vaccination campaigns. The entire health program is managed from the health center built by the federation in Sucúa. The Ministerio de Salúd provides technical assistance to the program.' <sup id="cite_ref-1273" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1273">[1,273]</a></sup>

Against smallpox, which so often burst out in deadly epidemics in Christians' settlements, the Indians know only one remedy, dispersion and abandonment of the sick. The Aguarunas, however, take care of their sick in little houses separated from the communal habitation.' <sup id="cite_ref-1274" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1274">[1,274]</a></sup></dd>

<p><b>♠ State pensions for elites ♣ absent ♥</b> Shuar political authority was informal and decentralized: 'Each community is politically independent with its own headman. Each is also located four or more kilometers from their nearest neighboring community. The community is made up of patrilineally and affinally related individuals, traditionally consisting of from 80 to 300 people (30 to 40 people in the twentieth century), living in one house called a JIVARIA. For defensive purposes, this house is built on a steep hill usually at the upper end of a stream. The house itself is approximately 13 meters by 26 meters in size, elliptical in shape, and has a thatched roof. In times of war, two or more communities united to fight a common enemy, as was the case when the Spanish attempted to conquer them.' <sup id="cite_ref-1275" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1275">[1,275]</a></sup> 'Local groups among the Jivaro are spread over such a large area in the Amazon basin that each has become completely independent of each other. Each JIVARIA or community is autonomous, although alliances between several JIVARIAS in a district may take place, but mostly for the purposes of warfare. There is a tendency for several communities to be related to each other by blood and affinal kinship ties because of the rule of local exogamy, which requires that a man marry a woman from a village other than his own. There is, therefore, a more or less natural grouping of contiguous communities into a loose tribe, but cooperation among them is almost entirely limited to collaboration in feuds or in head-hunting against more distant and unrelated communities (Service, 1958: 190).' <sup id="cite_ref-1276" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1276">[1,276]</a></sup> 'The Jivaro lack any formal political organization, although an informal form of leadership is found in the role of individuals referred to as UNYÄ  ("big" or "old" men) or KAKARAM   ("powerful" or "powerful ones") who are renown as killers in feuds or war, or exercise important shamanistic powers in the community. These individuals acquire their reputation in the community by being old enough to have grandchildren, and are friendly, honest, and generous in dealing with others in the society. Because of these characteristics the UNYÄ   or KAKARAM   are believed to possess great ARUTAM   soul power and the ability to curse to death anyone who incurs their anger. Generally most neighborhoods have at least one or two UNYÄ   as well as a few superior shamans who provide protection for their relatives or other individuals with whom they are on friendly terms.' <sup id="cite_ref-1277" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1277">[1,277]</a></sup> “From the statements I have previously made as to the distribution of the Jibaro tribes it appears that their social organization is loose. In fact, the whole people is split up into a great number of tribes which in their turn are sub-divided into smaller clans or septs comprising a few families closely related to one another by blood. These sub-tribes do not form village communities; each family inhabits its own big communal house (héa), but these are not situated close to one another, they lie scattered here and there in the virgin forest. Generally one has to march for one or several hours to arrive at the next house. Each Jibaro house forms in fact a separate and independent social, political, and economic unit with its own household, its own plantations in the vicinity of the house, and its own ruler or chief, the oldest family father who, at any rate in time of peace, is not controlled by anybody. It is much the same feature that we meet in other parts of tropical South America, where the impenetrable virgin forests necessarily lead to social disintegration, which is further increased by the general anti-social tendencies of the Indians. The state of things found among the Jibaros, however, is in many respects unique.' <sup id="cite_ref-1278" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1278">[1,278]</a></sup> Accordingly, social control was informal and based on witchcraft beliefs and revenge: 'Fear of sorcery and incurring the wrath of the UNYÄ   act as restraining elements of social control in the Jivaro community. In this society the code of lex talionis holds true so that anti-social acts directed against members of the community will result in assured retaliation by the victim's family. Thus, the fear of reprisal also acts as a means of aggression control in the society.' <sup id="cite_ref-1279" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1279">[1,279]</a></sup> Some more prominent leaders emerged as well: 'Four or five years ago there was a strong chief on the Upano River named Tuki, known to the Ecuadoreans as José Grande. In the manner previously described, all of the curakas from Macas on the Upano River to Mendez on the Paute River became subchiefs under him until he was generally recognized as the strongest of all of the Jivaro curakas. However, he was beginning to grow old by this time and some of his subcurakas were strong men in their own right. About 2 years ago, Ambusha, who had been gradually gaining in power and becoming famous for his head-hunting activities, split off with his own group, taking several curakas and their men with him. A little later Utita did the same thing. At the time of the writer's visit (1931), although Tuki was recognized by the Government of Ecuador as being head chief of the Macas-Mendez region, actually he had lost all power excepting that over his own family group and was in reality no more than a capito. These divisions of the organization, if it may be termed such, took place apparently without any ill-feeling or formal announcements.' <sup id="cite_ref-1280" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1280">[1,280]</a></sup> The Shuar bartered with whites and other Amerindians: 'The commercial activities of the Jivaro are very restricted. In the early days of European contact hogs and chickens were raised for sale to those of European background. Salt, a rare commodity in the region, was gathered in clay pots from a few brackish springs in the area, allowed to evaporate, and the resulting hardened ball of salt used in exchange transactions with neighboring tribal groups. The Jivaro were famous for the shrinking of the human heads () of their enemies (actually only the skin). Passing out of Jivaro country through a series of exchanges, these heads eventually found their way into the hands of traders who brought them down the Amazon to Para where they were sold. Soon the traders had a burgeoning trade in these items, and the Jivaro were hard-put to keep up with the demand. The Indians were by no means particular as to whose head was used, and advance orders were taken and filled. Eventually this native "industry" was brought to a halt by the Ecuadorian and Peruvian governments although by the late twentieth century life-like replicas of the heads made from animal skins are still being sold commercially.' <sup id="cite_ref-1281" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1281">[1,281]</a></sup> While Ecuador claimed nominal sovereignty over the Oriente, bureaucratic control was low and no regular governmental officials were present in Jivaro communities. The Shuar themselves did not recognize Ecuadorian rule: “Rising in the western foothills of the Cordillera Oriental the Rio Zamora flows through Loja, where it is joined by the Rio Malacatos. ( ) Ten miles farther north, in confluence with the Rio de las Juntas, it breaks through the Andes and enters the province of Oriente, the Amazon region of Ecuador, comprising a northwestern part of the basin of the great river. Vast in extent and largely unknown, unexplored and unmapped, this territory has always been a bone of contention among the republics of Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru. But although the particular portion of it which I visited, on a reconnaissance of the Rio Zamora, was supposedly under the sovereignty of Ecuador, no evidence of administrative authority was to be found there, nor did the savages of the Jíbaro tribe who live there acknowledge allegiance to the government at Quito.” <sup id="cite_ref-1282" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1282">[1,282]</a></sup> The same seems to be true for missionary attempts: 'Since all attempts to win back the lost territories by force of arms were unsuccessful, there was recourse to the cross in order to bend the Indians again under the yoke of slavery by this apparently gentle means. The missionaries were successful among some tribes, but the Jívaros turned away all intruders and have maintained their freedom up to our time. Only the small mission of Mácas, inhabited by the Quichua Indians, is located in their territory, and neither the secular clergy nor the Jesuit fathers, who have alternately tried their luck there, have been successful in making converts.' <sup id="cite_ref-1283" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1283">[1,283]</a></sup> Accordingly, there was no state structure to pay pensions.

<p><b>♠ Funding for festivals ♣ absent ♥</b> Festivals were the result of communal cooperation rather than 'publicly funded'. Tsantsa feasts were important: 'Beyond the ritualized chanting that takes place before a raiding expedition, as mentioned above, the only other major ceremony taking place among the Jivaro is the TSANTSA   feast, a great victory celebration taking place in the home village following a successful head-hunting raid. Since food and drink are offered to the invited guests at these celebrations in great quantity, a great strain is put on the economic resources of the head-takers and their families so frequently the TSANTSA   feast may be spread over a period of two to three years during which resources are rebuilt. From the Jivaro's point of view the primary purpose of the TSANTSA   feast is not necessarily supernatural, although that is generally recognized as a secondary purpose; but to acquire prestige, friendship, and obligations through being recognized as an accomplished warrior, and through the feasting, by being a generous host to as many neighbors as possible (Harner, 1972: 191-192).' <sup id="cite_ref-1284" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1284">[1,284]</a></sup> Harner describes the process: 'When this first tsantsa feast is concluded, the head-takers return to their separate homes and begin to make preparations for the two subsequent feasts which each of them will host individually. Since enormous quantities of beer and food are consumed at these celebrations, the head-taker normally has to clear additional garden space for his wife or wives to plant to assure an ample supply of manioc. The first of these two celebrations, named suamak, normally takes place no sooner than after a year, to allow time for garden clearing and the growth of a large mature crop of manioc as well as for the raising of pigs to help provide meat for the feasting. Also the host may delay the celebration in order to build a new, larger house more worthy of the occasion. Thus, often two or three years pass before a man gives the feast. To assure a large quantity of wild game for the feast, men who are close relatives of the host separately go hunting long distances from the house for a period of approximately nine or ten days before the opening day. Lacking any mnemonic system for keeping count of the days accurately, they are able to time their return to coincide with the arrival of the guests at the feast with the aid of an ingenious device which might be called a “banana clock.” That is, the host gives each hunter a green cooking banana or plantain from the same stalk, which is one of those hanging in the house to ripen for the feast. When each of the hunters' plantains is almost fully ripe, they know that it is time to return for the celebration. The host also sends or delivers plantains from the same stalk to those invited guests living at some distance so that they, too, will arrive at the same time. The celebration lasts five days and is followed, about a month later, by the third feast (napiη). This is the largest of all, with the head-taker supplying food and drink for six days. He must be able to provide plentifully for all his guests or the [Page 191] occasion would cause him to lose, rather than to gain, prestige. Guests at the feasts usually number up to about 125-150 persons, and mainly come from the local neighborhoods. Since these last two feasts, totalling eleven days of unremitted hospitality, must be supplied from the same harvest, often little food remains in the gardens at the end of the celebrations. Not uncommonly, the host and his family are forced onto a relatively meager diet for some months thereafter until the gardens can recover from their near-exhaustion. Sometimes such a large amount of the gardens' supply of manioc is consumed that the host is unable to follow the second feast with the third. There is no stigma attached to this, but it means that the tsantsa never undergoes its final modification.' <sup id="cite_ref-1285" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1285">[1,285]</a></sup>//'The primary purpose of the tsantsa feast, from the Jívaro point of view, is not supernatural, although that is recognized by them as a secondary purpose; but is to acquire prestige, friendship, and obligations through being recognized as [Page 192] an accomplished warrior and, through the feasting, by being a generous host to as many neighbors as possible. One informant observed, “The desire of the Jívaro for heads is like the desire of the whites for gold.”' <sup id="cite_ref-1286" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1286">[1,286]</a></sup>//'Since the head-taking raids are directed at the Achuara and others “who live far away,” the victim whose head is the focal point of the celebration normally is viewed by everyone in the head-taker's neighborhood as an “enemy.” Accordingly, it is the unique occasion for the members of many Jívaro households to get together to reaffirm their common identity and unity. Under such circumstances, it is not surprising that the tsantsa feast is participated in with great joy and a cumulative sense of euphoria. Of course, the huge quantities of strong manioc beer help, as do the ritual circle dances (wainči), which continue from dusk to dawn night after night. The bountiful quantities of meat and garden foods add to the sense of well-being. It is also a time of relative sexual license, as I had occasion to observe during the one tsantsa feast that I attended. Liaisons are arranged discreetly by both unmarried and married individuals, who rendezvous in the forest surrounding the house. The supernatural and ritual aspects of the celebration contribute to the sense of solidarity by inhibiting fights between men who have become drunk and who may try to even a score with old enemies or with men who have offended them at the feast by flirting with their wives. That is, it is believed that the avenging soul (muisak) of the murdered man will be able to take advantage of any disruption of the binding ritual by escaping from the tsantsa to cause an ongoing fight to culminate in a death. Permitting the muisak to escape from the tsantsa would also be an affront to the host, since it would negate the major supernatural purpose of the feast, that is, to utilize the power of the muisak, while it is resident in the [Page 193] tsantsa, for increasing the power of women who are members of the host's household. Therefore, any fight that erupts is immediately stopped by the other male participants, led by the male master of ceremonies, the wea, who usually has been selected for the role because of his considerable ritual knowledge and prestige. Fights between females at the feast, although less common, are similarly halted by the women, led by the female ceremonial leader, the uhá, who is selected on a basis similar to that for the wea. Thus the religious, ritual, and social pressures of the occasion operate to make it the safest, most euphoric, and largest social gathering known to the Jívaro. It is not surprising, therefore, that the tsantsa feasts tend to be viewed by the Jívaro as the pinnacles of their social lives. It is also expectable, given the ethos of killing and counter-killing, that this, the greatest celebration, centers around the indisputable evidence of a triumph over a common enemy. The intimate interaction between the euphoria of the celebration and the awareness of the murdered enemy is illustrated by this tsantsa feast circle dance song: Today, today, let us greet the dawn only playing. Today, today, let us greet the dawn only playing. Čuwi5 tells me Čuwi tells me We are going to greet the dawn playing. Čuwi tells me Čuwi tells me We are going to greet the dawn. And they taught me previously, I cannot sleep easily, And I will meet the dawn together with Čuwi. And don't you sleep! And don't you sleep! For now it is dawning, for now it is dawning.' <sup id="cite_ref-1287" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1287">[1,287]</a></sup>

This war dance of the women, which is called Ihiámbrama, is supposed to have the power of protecting their fathers, husbands, and sons against the lances and bullets of the enemy, of lulling the latter into security so that he will not apprehend the danger before it is too late, and lastly of preventing him from taking revenge (ayam-bruamáktinyu) for the defeat inflicted upon him. The dance Ihiámbrana thus has much the same magical significance as the war dance Enéma and the war song Anendrata.”' <sup id="cite_ref-1288" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1288">[1,288]</a></sup> But Reiss reports festival houses: 'When the supplies are gone and the intoxication slept off, the house built for the festival is deserted and left to decay - unless after some time another family moves in and undertakes the repairs.' <sup id="cite_ref-1289" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1289">[1,289]</a></sup> Residential areas were deserted after a death in the family: 'A house must be deserted after a death, just as after such a festival.

<p><b>♠ Full-time entertainment specialists ♣ absent ♥</b> Music and dances were performed by community members rather than specialists: 'The Jivaro are very fond of singing and instrumental music. Group singing frequently occurs at dances and ceremonies, and talented singers are often asked to do solos. There are a great variety of songs in the Jivaro repertoire which include love songs, songs for war and mourning, etc. Flutes of bamboo, trumpets of shell, and drums made from hollowed-out logs, are the primary instruments, although a small primitive violin called a QUER-QUER   is sometimes used.' <sup id="cite_ref-1291" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1291">[1,291]</a></sup> 'When we returned from our trip we witnessed a phantastic scene in Huaracayo, in the house of our Curaca Laichape, who had accompanied us on our journey. Inside the house the men with their war decorations moved pairwise in a circle, each one playing the flute, and occasionally singing, too. All of them were slightly tipsy due to the masato. The women, likewise under the influence of masato, accompanied the men by their singing and exhorted them to drink more and more. Some were seated or lying on their beds or in their seats, overcome by too much masato. Since the brujo had given us up as a total loss, they now celebrated our happy return.' <sup id="cite_ref-1292" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1292">[1,292]</a></sup> 'When the expedition arrives in its home territory, the first feast of the tsantsa is held immediately. This feast is later followed by at least one and sometimes two others. At all these feasts or dances great care is taken to prevent arguments and fights between the inebriated celebrants out of fear that the muisak might take advantage of such an interruption of the magically-binding ritual to slip from the head trophy to cause a quarrel to result in a murder. If the feasts are conducted properly, however, the muisak will be kept inside of the tsantsa until the end of the last feast. At that time, the celebrants expel it from the head trophy and send it back to its neighborhood of origin. This neighborhood is typically at a considerable distance because head trophies are normally taken only of members of other tribes. As part of this final ritual the women sing: Now, now, go back to your house where you lived. Your wife is there calling you from your house. You have come here to make us happy. Finally we have finished. So return.' <sup id="cite_ref-1293" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1293">[1,293]</a></sup> 'During the three feasts the celebrants had been concerned with utilizing the power of the muisak as well as containing it. As in the case of the arutam [Page 266] soul, the muisak emits power, but it is believed that the muisak's power is directly transmissible to other persons. The man who took the head holds the tsantsa aloft in the ritual dance while two female relatives whom he wants to benefit, most frequently a wife and sister, hold on to him. In this manner the power of the muisak is believed to be transmitted to the women who, ordinarily, lack power-giving arutam souls. This power, transmitted from the muisak to the women through the “filtering” mechanism of the head-taker, is believed to make it possible for them to work harder and to be more successful in crop production and in the raising of domesticated animals, both of which being primarily the responsibilities of women in Jívaro society.' <sup id="cite_ref-1294" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1294">[1,294]</a></sup> The same was true of weaving: 'Jivaro graphic art is limited and simple. Weaving and spinning is exclusively a man's task. Men spin yarn from home-grown cotton and dye it with vegetal solutions. The yarn is then woven on a back strap loom into ITIPI   or cotton kilts that form the basis of men and women's clothing.' <sup id="cite_ref-1295" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1295">[1,295]</a></sup> 'Weaving, done in almost all houses, is exclusively a man's task. Men, compared to women in Jívaro society, tend to have much more leisure time, which may help account for the fact that they do the spinning, dyeing, and weaving. When not hunting or clearing forest, a man likes to sit in his end of the house, either quietly alone or conversing with visitors. In either case, spinning and weaving allow him to occupy his hands with a pleasant craft which can be interrupted or picked up again as he desires. The textiles he makes are extremely durable and thus there is usually no urgency attached [Page 69] to the task. A man normally takes pride in his ability as a weaver, as evidenced by this yarn-spinning song: For me it is very easy To spin yarn, For I am a man-spider. I am a man-spider. Therefore I am adept.

They are seldom punished and enjoy great liberty in their activities. As they grow older girls spend much time with the women of the village learning those skills which will be needed as an adult in the society. Small boys stay with the men, accompanying them on hunts, and even on war parties after they reach the age of 7 or 8. The boys, however, do not actually participate in the fighting until much older. There are rituals for both boys and girls upon reaching puberty.' <sup id="cite_ref-1297" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1297">[1,297]</a></sup> 'Training in work and skills conforms to the adult sexual division of labor. A girl from about the age of four to six is not expected to do much more than care for the baby, if any, while the mother is working in the garden or preparing beer in the house. She is instructed, among other things, to keep the infant from eating dirt and from being bitten by ants, and to rock it in its hammock.

When he is about six, his father presents him with a real miniature blowgun and a dart quiver. Then, while his mother works in the garden, he wanders about, shooting at the hummingbirds coming to feed at the flowers of the manioc plants. Those that he kills, he brings to her to cook, which she does gravely. He is not allowed to eat them himself, it being believed that he cannot kill again if he does so. By approximately nine years of age, his skill normally has advanced to the stage that he is killing larger birds lurking in the trees around the garden. His father then takes him hunting and gives him his first formal instruction in killing game, and has him assist by carrying it home.

The donning of this head-band has significant overtones since it is used by men not only to keep their hair in place but also in war to hang a human head from the shoulder. He may also now carve a round stool for himself, although he usually does not do this until, or unless, he has participated in a regular killing expedition.

The supernatural aspect of this “coming out” celebration [Page 94] centers around the girl drinking water mixed with crushed green tobacco leaves in order to enter the supernatural world while sleeping in a nearby lean-to and to have dreams that will augur success in raising garden crops and domesticated animals. The feasts are known as nua tsaŋu (woman tobacco) or kasakü.' <sup id="cite_ref-1304" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1304">[1,304]</a></sup> There was no public education system. Boys went on soul journeys: 'The most important use of hallucinogens in child-rearing, from the Jívaro point of view, is to assist a boy in seeing an arutam at a sacred waterfall, since his life is believed to depend upon it. This will be discussed in detail later (see pp. 135-39). Of all a boy's childhood experiences, nothing is considered to compare in importance with the experience. The power deriving from the acquired arutam soul is seen in Jívaro terms as an enculturating and socializing device, since its force is believed to promote almost all the valued aspects of character, including honesty, inclination to work, and intelligence; as well as to increase the actual knowledge of the child.' <sup id="cite_ref-1305" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1305">[1,305]</a></sup> 'A person is not born with an arutam soul. Such a soul must be acquired, and in certain traditional ways. The acquisition of this type of soul is considered to be so important to an adult male's survival that a boy's parents do not expect him to live past puberty without one. Women sometimes obtain arutam souls, but it is not considered so essential for them. One reason is that intra-tribal killing, the most common source of violent death, is primarily directed at adult males rather than at women and children. A boy begins seeking an arutam soul at about the age of six years. Accompanied most commonly by his father, he makes a pilgrimage to the sacred waterfall in his neighborhood. This is always the highest waterfall within a few days' travel. It is believed to be the rendezvous of these souls or spirits which wander about as breezes, scattering the spray of the long cascade. During the day, the vision seekers “bathe” in the waterfall by striding back and forth under its cold and drenching canopy, actually walking between the downpour and the cliff from which it is dropping. They walk naked and shivering, and in some danger from falling logs which may  be swept over the cliff with the current. Each paces with the aid of a magical balsa wood staff carved for the occasion, and chants, “tau, tau, tau, ” continually. By night the pilgrims  sleep near the falls in a simple lean-to. Here they fast, drink tobacco water (made by steeping green tobacco leaves in cold water), and await the appearance of an arutam. They may keep up this fasting, “bathing,” and tobacco water drinking for as long as five days. If unsuccessful, they return home to make another attempt at a later date. More likely, though, is that before the five days are up, one of the members of the party will have recourse to drinking hallucinogenic maikua (Datura arborea) juice. Usually this is a person who has failed to see an arutam  on a previous vision quest or who feels an urgent need to see one without delay. Upon acquiring this arutam  soul, the person feels a sudden power surge into his body, accompanied by a new self-confidence. The arutam soul is supposed to increase a person's power in the most general sense. This power, called   kakarma, is believed to increase one's intelligence as well as simple physical strength, and also to make it difficult for the soul possessor to lie or commit other dishonorable acts.  His newly acquired power increases his resistance to contagious disease to some degree, but most important, it makes it impossible for him to die as a result of any physical violence or sorcery. Most of his relatives and acquaintances shortly know that he has acquired an arutam   soul simply because of the change in his personality. For example, he especially tends to speak with great forcefulness.' <sup id="cite_ref-1306" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1306">[1,306]</a></sup> 'Maikua, of which the Jívaro distinguish and use six different types, is recognized by them to be the most powerful and also the most dangerous hallucinogen with which they are familiar. [...] Preparations from these plants tend to produce, in large dosages, a state of excitation, delirium, and hallucinations, followed by a state of narcosis. The Jívaro obtain their hallucinatory experiences with Datura by ingesting the raw juice of the green bark of the stems. The effects begin to be felt within about three to four minutes of ingestion, probably because of the fast action of the atropine. The arutam seeker ingesting the Datura juice is never supposed to do it without the presence of an adult who is not taking the drug. It is the responsibility of the latter to provide psychological support or, in Jívaro terms, to “encourage” him, and also to hold him down, if necessary, during the first phase of the intoxication, when the drug taker tends to become delirious and is in danger of running off into the forest in his highly agitated state and, as a result, [Page 138] possibly falling off a cliff or into a river and drowning. The other pilgrims in the party do not take the substance themselves, partially so that they can protect the maikua drinker from running off. They also believe that an arutam is not likely to come to a vision seeker if he is a coward, which would be evidenced if he were unwilling to take Datura alone and enter the normally invisible world unaccompanied.' <sup id="cite_ref-1307" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1307">[1,307]</a></sup> 'If the arutam seeker is fortunate, he will awaken at about midnight to find the stars gone from the sky, the earth trembling, and a great wind felling the trees of the forest amid thunder and lightning. To keep from being blown down, he grasps a tree trunk and awaits the arutam. Shortly the arutam appears from the depths of the forest, often in the form of a pair of large creatures. The particular animal forms can vary considerably, but some of the most common arutam include a pair of giant jaguars fighting one another as they roll over and over towards the vision seeker, or two anacondas doing the same. Often the vision may simply be a single huge disembodied human head or a ball of fire drifting through the forest towards the arutam seeker. When the apparition arrives to within twenty or thirty feet, the Jívaro must run forward and touch it, either with a small stick or his hand. This is said to require a good deal of courage, and sometimes the person flees the arutam instead. But if he does run forward and touch the vision, it instantly explodes like dynamite and disappears. Upon thus achieving success in encountering an arutam, the person returns to his house, but tells no one that he has accomplished the purpose of his quest. Arriving home, he goes alone to sleep that night on the bank of the nearest river. After nightfall, the soul of the same arutam he touched comes to him as he dreams. His dream visitor is in the form of an old Jívaro man who says to him, “I am your ancestor. Just as I have lived a long time, so will you. Just as I have [Page 139] killed many times, so will you.” Without another word the old man disappears and immediately the arutam soul of this unknown ancestor enters the body of the dreamer, where it is lodged in his chest.' <sup id="cite_ref-1308" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1308">[1,308]</a></sup> 'Upon acquiring this arutam soul, the person feels a sudden power surge into his body, accompanied by a new self-confidence.

For example, he especially tends to speak with great forcefulness. However, he must not tell anyone that he has acquired such a soul, or it will desert him. When one has thus obtained an arutam soul, he generally is seized with a tremendous desire to kill, and it is ordinarily only a matter of a few months before he joins a killing expedition. If he is a young boy, he will accompany his father. The rare women who possess arutam souls kill primarily by means of poisoning food or manioc beer. Jívaro killing expeditions usually attack the victim's house just before dawn. Late in the afternoon of the day prior to the attack, the expedition halts in the forest about a quarter of a mile from its intended objective. There, in their concealed location, the participants must “declare” what kind of arutam they had each seen. The younger men form a circle around several of the most experienced killers, who then ask [Page 140] each man in turn to describe the arutam that he had seen. As each man, young and old, does this, the soul of his arutam leaves his body forever, to roam the forest again as a wind, for arutam souls “are satisfied with one killing.” The departing arutam souls reportedly generate winds, thunder, and lightning. Eventually, at some time in the indefinite future, each soul is expected once more to enter the body of another Jívaro.' <sup id="cite_ref-1309" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1309">[1,309]</a></sup> Salesian missionaries established boarding schools, but it appears that this did not happen until the mid-20th century. Salazar provides a description of the history of the Salesian mission and their impact on the Jivaro after the Ecuadorian period as defined here: 'The Salesians' rationale for the establishment of boarding schools was the supposedly “low moral level” that they saw in Shuar families, which made the separation of children from their parents not only desirable but necessary (Barrueco 1968:42). In the boarding school Shuar children (boys and girls) grew up in a communal atmosphere, learning the values of the Catholic religion and western civilization. The acculturation process was long and intensive, for children did not leave the boarding school until they were old enough to choose a partner for marriage, who was usually a school-mate. This type of marriage was often encouraged by the missionaries, who sometimes overlooked the fact that Shuar society prescribes cross-cousin marriage (Federación Shuar 1976:169). In any case, the married couple was acculturated enough so as to desire a permanent home near the mission center. Statistics for the late 1960s show that the Salesian mission was supporting 20 boarding schools with a total of 1,880 Shuar children (Barrueco 1968:57).

The proof of that is that one of my friends who lived in Gualaquiza for a long time, where he was known and loved by the savages, and who had occasion to pass an evening with one of them without drinking, gave an entirely different opinion: “In the middle of the entertainment”, he wrote me, “I asked that the two wives of Santiago (so the Indian was called) let us hear some songs. Santiago agreed and even joined his voice with theirs. I hear even now the harmony of this song; it was so gentle and so melodious that I had them repeat it two or three times.

Chicham is devoted to accounts of the activities of the federation, as well as general information on such varied subjects as acculturation, government policies, and the situation of Indian groups in Ecuador and South America as a whole. The Shuar have already established contact with native American movements throughout the American continent. Furthermore, the federation has sponsored about 30 publications of different kinds, including scientific subjects (technology, social structure, and mythology of the Shuar), school books (literacy booklets and school texts), and religious works (prayer books, gospel translations). Particular attention must be drawn to the publication of the Mundo Shuar booklets, which represents the greatest effort so far to diffuse Shuar culture in printed form. The collection includes seven series of publications, each series covering a broad aspect of Shuar culture (e.g. ethnohistory, technology, linguistics). Authors include missionaries, white teachers, and Shuar intellectuals who contribute to the recently established Center for Documentation and Research on Shuar Culture. The collection as a whole is printed at the Salesian Publishing House in Quito, and is also directed by a Salesian priest, Father Juan Botasso. Mundo Shuar thus appears as a Salesian effort to rescue what is left of a rich culture that almost disintegrated as a result of more than half a century of Salesian administration of the Shuar people. The works so far published show, as could be expected, a varying degree of scholarship, but on the whole Mundo Shuar has been well accepted in the country, and promises to be an indispensable research tool for anthropologists interested in Shuar culture.' <sup id="cite_ref-1319" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1319">[1,319]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<dd> <b>♠ Infant mortality ♣ 14.5% ♥</b> Writing in the second half of the 20th century, Salazar claims an infant mortality rate of 14.5%: 'The last, but not the least, concern of the federation is in the area of health. Kroeger and Ileckova (1976) report that the major problems affecting the Shuar population are a high infant mortality rate (14.5% in 1971) and malnutrition, particularly owing to low consumption of basic foods such as eggs, milk, and meat. Typically fatal diseases in Shuar children are measles, bronchitis, and parasite-induced diarrhea. Among adults, tuberculosis is becoming increasingly frequent as the colonization frontier advances further into Shuar territory. The federation maintains that government attention to Shuar health has been minimal, since medical care in lowland towns is largely a privilege of the colonist population. Consequently, the federation's Health Commission has established its own program with the help of the Salesian mission and the German Volunteers, both of which have organized training courses for health volunteers, nurses, and social workers. The emphasis of the Shuar health program is on preventive medicine, and fostering of hygienic habits is of primary importance. Information on health matters is provided by radio broadcasts and health workers who manage the program in each Shuar centro. First-aid kits provided by the federation are available in all centros. In the event of outbursts of contagious disease, each asociación has a special team of health officials to carry out vaccination campaigns.

<p><b>Disease</b>
</p>
<dl><dd> <b>♠ Endemic disease ♣ present ♥</b> Malaria was endemic: 'Malaria is endemic, but is recognized by elderly informants as being an anciently introduced disease “brought by Jívaro coming back from Peru.” The Jívaro believe that it is transmitted when sharing the bowl in which manioc beer is served. It would seem highly likely that malaria, an Old World disease, which possibly has been present among the Jívaro since the sixteenth century, has had substantial effects on their rate of mortality and thus upon their long-range population size and density. Again, however, the lack of [Page 38] relevant written records makes it almost impossible to judge its actual demographic effects.' <sup id="cite_ref-1321" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1321">[1,321]</a></sup> Karsten reports another (unidentified) endemic disease: 'Although the category ‘disease’ nowadays chiefly comprises illnesses that have been introduced by the whites, there is also a kind of súngura which is endemic among the Indians and which they have thus known before the white man arrived. This kind of súngura arises directly from their own evil iguánchi. Such a case of ‘disease’ came under my notice among the Indians of Arapicos, where several young persons and children had been attacked by an insidious fever, apparently epidemical, which made them slowly pine away. The demons always outdo living men, even the most experienced sorcerers, as senders of supernatural evils. The medicine-men, therefore, generally profess their inability to cure the kind of suńgura which is sent by the iguanchi.”' <sup id="cite_ref-1322" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1322">[1,322]</a></sup> Contact with Europeans was a major cause of epidemics:  “On the other hand, in the category ‘disease’ (súngura) most illnesses are reckoned which are not particularly connected with pains and which the Indians have learnt to know through the whites; first of all fever and infectious diseases such as small-pox, scarlet-fever, dysentery, and venereal disease. Whereas the Indian medicine-men are often able to cure witchcraft sent by other medicine-men, they are completely powerless against ‘disease’ imported by the whites. Thus when an epidemic of small-pox-a disease that has at times made terrible ravages among the natives of South America-breaks out in an Indian village, the inhabitants generally see no other way to rid themselves of the evil than to burn and abandon the whole village, or at least to leave it for some time. Under such circumstances it is easy to understand the anxiety with which the Indians always, when a strange white man arrives, ask whether he ‘brings disease’ with him (súngura itáches?). A traveller who falls seriously ill while staying in an Indian house incurs great danger. If the Indians feel sufficiently strong they may kill him; if not, they will at least go off and leave him alone in the house. The first visit of white men among Indians living in unexplored parts of the country is, for the same reason, particularly critical: the Indians think that the strange new-comers infect their houses and villages by their mere presence. By their personal contact as well as by their clothes, their medicines, and the many other mysterious things that they bring with them they are believed to spread germs of death-bringing diseases.' <sup id="cite_ref-1323" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1323">[1,323]</a></sup> 'Secondly, epidemiological factors exert a powerful influence on settlement pattern. The dispersion, isolation, and small size of contemporary communities serve to dampen the spread and potential gravity of epidemic infections such as measles and whooping cough. Nevertheless, Western infections continue to represent a serious health hazard for contemporary Jivaroans. Measles, whooping cough, and respiratory infections alone may account for over 50% of Achuarä disease deaths. Sixty percent of the children in the mortality sample succumbed to such ailments. A lower percentage of adult deaths (30.4%) was actually attributed to such causes; but many of the deaths blamed on sorcery, for which a specific organic cause could not be determined, may represent their complications, primarily respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia.' <sup id="cite_ref-1324" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1324">[1,324]</a></sup> 'Direct, although intermittent, contact with mestizos has persistently introduced these diseases into the Achuarä region, aggravating indigenous hostilities. While the Achuarä recognize whooping cough, measles, and influenza as white men's diseases-some indigenous shamans readily admit to having no power to cure them-the increasing introduction of these afflictions by river traders and mestizo woodworkers has led to their incorporation within the traditional supernatural framework of disease causation. This has been associated, as well, with a tendency among Achuarä to attribute greater supernatural power to persons from outside their territory where such diseases originate. Harner (1972:120), for example, has noted the desire of Ecuadorian Shuarä and Achuarä shamans to obtain their supernatural training and power directly from Canelos shamans who reside in a long acculturated zone to the north through which many epidemic diseases have passed into Jívaro lands.' <sup id="cite_ref-1325" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1325">[1,325]</a></sup> The same was true of the rubber boom: 'The most violent impact of the rubber boom was experienced by native populations elsewhere, along the lower Marañón, Putumayo, Napo, and Madeira rivers, and throughout the entire Jurúa-Purús drainage (Steward 1963:513). But along the Pastaza and Tigre rivers, flowing into the Marañón from the north, nucleated communities of missionized Indians-Canelos, Pevas, Andoans, and others-were nevertheless not immune to the events of this era. Here, as elsewhere, they served as the principal source of labor and food supplies. Many were depopulated or disappeared entirely as a consequence of disease, dislocation, and sheer exploitative decimation (cf. Izaguirre 1929/XXIII: 167; Vacas Galindo 1895:319).' <sup id="cite_ref-1326" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1326">[1,326]</a></sup> 'Informants report that a significant new disease in the interior is gonorrhea, which they say was brought to the Upano Valley Jívaro by Colombians during the rubber boom at the beginning of this century and has only recently crossed the Cutucú range. The Colombians were also said to have brought mumps. Interestingly, although smallpox epidemics are known in the Upano region, the interior Jívaro east of the Cordillera de Cutucú do not recall the disease ever having spread to them. Tuberculosis is said to have been completely unknown anywhere in the Jívaro country until the colonists from Azuay moved in, but is now common.' <sup id="cite_ref-1327" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1327">[1,327]</a></sup> Accordingly, frontier communities frequently suffered disease outbreaks: 'Illnesses are rare, because of the robustness of the individuals and the healthy life that they lead, and, as the savages say, thanks to the daily washing of the stomach. Against smallpox, which so often burst out in deadly epidemics in Christians' settlements, the Indians know only one remedy, dispersion and abandonment of the sick. The Aguarunas, however, take care of their sick in little houses separated from the communal habitation.' <sup id="cite_ref-1328" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1328">[1,328]</a></sup> But it appears that communities in the interior were also affected: 'The picture is less clear with regard to the demographic effects of disease upon the interior Jívaro. Epidemics of contagious disease, especially measles and whooping cough, appear to have had devastating effects in the twentieth century among these people. Informants claim that in some cases half of the populations of their neighborhoods were wiped out in a single epidemic. It is difficult to evaluate such statements, but they are not inconsistent with what we know of the effects of such diseases on other South American forest Indians under observation at times when they were struck by measles and smallpox. In addition, common colds and similar respiratory ailments easily reach epidemic proportions among the Jívaro, with complications of a fatal nature being common, especially among infants and the elderly. The fear of colds is great that it can act as a barrier to acceptance of the anthropological fieldworker, who must, of course, take every precaution to be sure that he and his companions are not, in fact, bringing the disease.' <sup id="cite_ref-1329" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1329">[1,329]</a></sup> Some sources claim that experience of epidemics transformed the settlement pattern among the Jivaro: 'In spite of their apparent isolation the Jívaro live socially; but up to the present time they have put up great resistance against grouping themselves in villages. It must be said that this repugnance can be explained not only by the desire for independence which is so well developed in them, but also by the fear of the diseases brought in by [614] the whites, especially smallpox which breaks out in fatal epidemics in Indian groups.' <sup id="cite_ref-1330" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1330">[1,330]</a></sup> Salazar provides information on the second half of the 20th century: 'The last, but not the least, concern of the federation is in the area of health. Kroeger and Ileckova (1976) report that the major problems affecting the Shuar population are a high infant mortality rate (14.5% in 1971) and malnutrition, particularly owing to low consumption of basic foods such as eggs, milk, and meat. Typically fatal diseases in Shuar children are measles, bronchitis, and parasite-induced diarrhea. Among adults, tuberculosis is becoming increasingly frequent as the colonization frontier advances further into Shuar territory. The federation maintains that government attention to Shuar health has been minimal, since medical care in lowland towns is largely a privilege of the colonist population. Consequently, the federation's Health Commission has established its own program with the help of the Salesian mission and the German Volunteers, both of which have organized training courses for health volunteers, nurses, and social workers.

<dd> <b>♠ Disease outbreaks ♣ present ♥</b> Malaria was endemic: 'Malaria is endemic, but is recognized by elderly informants as being an anciently introduced disease “brought by Jívaro coming back from Peru.” The Jívaro believe that it is transmitted when sharing the bowl in which manioc beer is served. It would seem highly likely that malaria, an Old World disease, which possibly has been present among the Jívaro since the sixteenth century, has had substantial effects on their rate of mortality and thus upon their long-range population size and density. Again, however, the lack of [Page 38] relevant written records makes it almost impossible to judge its actual demographic effects.' <sup id="cite_ref-1332" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1332">[1,332]</a></sup> Karsten reports another (unidentified) endemic disease: 'Although the category ‘disease’ nowadays chiefly comprises illnesses that have been introduced by the whites, there is also a kind of súngura which is endemic among the Indians and which they have thus known before the white man arrived. This kind of súngura arises directly from their own evil iguánchi. Such a case of ‘disease’ came under my notice among the Indians of Arapicos, where several young persons and children had been attacked by an insidious fever, apparently epidemical, which made them slowly pine away. The demons always outdo living men, even the most experienced sorcerers, as senders of supernatural evils. The medicine-men, therefore, generally profess their inability to cure the kind of suńgura which is sent by the iguanchi.”' <sup id="cite_ref-1333" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1333">[1,333]</a></sup> Contact with Europeans was a major cause of epidemics:  “On the other hand, in the category ‘disease’ (súngura) most illnesses are reckoned which are not particularly connected with pains and which the Indians have learnt to know through the whites; first of all fever and infectious diseases such as small-pox, scarlet-fever, dysentery, and venereal disease. Whereas the Indian medicine-men are often able to cure witchcraft sent by other medicine-men, they are completely powerless against ‘disease’ imported by the whites. Thus when an epidemic of small-pox-a disease that has at times made terrible ravages among the natives of South America-breaks out in an Indian village, the inhabitants generally see no other way to rid themselves of the evil than to burn and abandon the whole village, or at least to leave it for some time. Under such circumstances it is easy to understand the anxiety with which the Indians always, when a strange white man arrives, ask whether he ‘brings disease’ with him (súngura itáches?). A traveller who falls seriously ill while staying in an Indian house incurs great danger. If the Indians feel sufficiently strong they may kill him; if not, they will at least go off and leave him alone in the house. The first visit of white men among Indians living in unexplored parts of the country is, for the same reason, particularly critical: the Indians think that the strange new-comers infect their houses and villages by their mere presence. By their personal contact as well as by their clothes, their medicines, and the many other mysterious things that they bring with them they are believed to spread germs of death-bringing diseases.' <sup id="cite_ref-1334" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1334">[1,334]</a></sup> 'Secondly, epidemiological factors exert a powerful influence on settlement pattern. The dispersion, isolation, and small size of contemporary communities serve to dampen the spread and potential gravity of epidemic infections such as measles and whooping cough. Nevertheless, Western infections continue to represent a serious health hazard for contemporary Jivaroans. Measles, whooping cough, and respiratory infections alone may account for over 50% of Achuarä disease deaths. Sixty percent of the children in the mortality sample succumbed to such ailments. A lower percentage of adult deaths (30.4%) was actually attributed to such causes; but many of the deaths blamed on sorcery, for which a specific organic cause could not be determined, may represent their complications, primarily respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia.' <sup id="cite_ref-1335" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1335">[1,335]</a></sup> 'Direct, although intermittent, contact with mestizos has persistently introduced these diseases into the Achuarä region, aggravating indigenous hostilities. While the Achuarä recognize whooping cough, measles, and influenza as white men's diseases-some indigenous shamans readily admit to having no power to cure them-the increasing introduction of these afflictions by river traders and mestizo woodworkers has led to their incorporation within the traditional supernatural framework of disease causation. This has been associated, as well, with a tendency among Achuarä to attribute greater supernatural power to persons from outside their territory where such diseases originate. Harner (1972:120), for example, has noted the desire of Ecuadorian Shuarä and Achuarä shamans to obtain their supernatural training and power directly from Canelos shamans who reside in a long acculturated zone to the north through which many epidemic diseases have passed into Jívaro lands.' <sup id="cite_ref-1336" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1336">[1,336]</a></sup> The same was true of the rubber boom: 'The most violent impact of the rubber boom was experienced by native populations elsewhere, along the lower Marañón, Putumayo, Napo, and Madeira rivers, and throughout the entire Jurúa-Purús drainage (Steward 1963:513). But along the Pastaza and Tigre rivers, flowing into the Marañón from the north, nucleated communities of missionized Indians-Canelos, Pevas, Andoans, and others-were nevertheless not immune to the events of this era. Here, as elsewhere, they served as the principal source of labor and food supplies. Many were depopulated or disappeared entirely as a consequence of disease, dislocation, and sheer exploitative decimation (cf. Izaguirre 1929/XXIII: 167; Vacas Galindo 1895:319).' <sup id="cite_ref-1337" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1337">[1,337]</a></sup> 'Informants report that a significant new disease in the interior is gonorrhea, which they say was brought to the Upano Valley Jívaro by Colombians during the rubber boom at the beginning of this century and has only recently crossed the Cutucú range. The Colombians were also said to have brought mumps. Interestingly, although smallpox epidemics are known in the Upano region, the interior Jívaro east of the Cordillera de Cutucú do not recall the disease ever having spread to them. Tuberculosis is said to have been completely unknown anywhere in the Jívaro country until the colonists from Azuay moved in, but is now common.' <sup id="cite_ref-1338" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1338">[1,338]</a></sup> Accordingly, frontier communities frequently suffered disease outbreaks: 'Illnesses are rare, because of the robustness of the individuals and the healthy life that they lead, and, as the savages say, thanks to the daily washing of the stomach. Against smallpox, which so often burst out in deadly epidemics in Christians' settlements, the Indians know only one remedy, dispersion and abandonment of the sick. The Aguarunas, however, take care of their sick in little houses separated from the communal habitation.' <sup id="cite_ref-1339" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1339">[1,339]</a></sup> But it appears that communities in the interior were also affected: 'The picture is less clear with regard to the demographic effects of disease upon the interior Jívaro. Epidemics of contagious disease, especially measles and whooping cough, appear to have had devastating effects in the twentieth century among these people. Informants claim that in some cases half of the populations of their neighborhoods were wiped out in a single epidemic. It is difficult to evaluate such statements, but they are not inconsistent with what we know of the effects of such diseases on other South American forest Indians under observation at times when they were struck by measles and smallpox. In addition, common colds and similar respiratory ailments easily reach epidemic proportions among the Jívaro, with complications of a fatal nature being common, especially among infants and the elderly.

In the latter case, the house itself is usually located in the largest. Such gardens constitute almost the exclusive source of carbohydrates for the Jívaro, providing, in terms of calories, perhaps about 65 per cent of the diet. The cultivation of slowly maturing tuberous plants, especially sweet manioc (Manihot utilissima), which can be harvested over long periods of time, the absence of a distinct dry [Page 48] season, and a diversified crop inventory all contribute to making a continual supply of agricultural products possible throughout the year.' <sup id="cite_ref-1343" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1343">[1,343]</a></sup> However, Salazar, writing in the second half of the 20th century, reports malnutrition: 'The last, but not the least, concern of the federation is in the area of health.

<p><b>♠ Volunteering ♣ absent ♥</b> Shuar society was made up of autonomous residential communities: 'Each community is politically independent with its own headman. Each is also located four or more kilometers from their nearest neighboring community. The community is made up of patrilineally and affinally related individuals, traditionally consisting of from 80 to 300 people (30 to 40 people in the twentieth century), living in one house called a JIVARIA. For defensive purposes, this house is built on a steep hill usually at the upper end of a stream. The house itself is approximately 13 meters by 26 meters in size, elliptical in shape, and has a thatched roof. In times of war, two or more communities united to fight a common enemy, as was the case when the Spanish attempted to conquer them.' <sup id="cite_ref-1349" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1349">[1,349]</a></sup> 'The basic domestic unit among the Jivaro is the polygynous family consisting of a man and his wife or wives and their children. Occasionally another relative such as a widowed mother or unmarried brother of the household head will also be included. In addition a married daughter and her husband may live in the household until the birth of their first child. Following the birth the family will be expected to move to a new dwelling nearby.' <sup id="cite_ref-1350" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1350">[1,350]</a></sup> Obligations towards kin varied and were not organized through membership in corporate kin groups: 'The basic Jivaro kin group is referred to as a "personal" bilateral kindred. In this type of kinship structure each person has a different kindred, with rights and obligations coinciding only with those of siblings of the same sex. Classification of kin, therefore, is spoken of as degrees of distance from ego, rather than in terms of membership or non-membership in a corporate unit as is quite often characteristic of unilineal descent societies. This form of kin group is probably the most insecure of the basic types of kinship systems for the individual, lacking defined descent groups affording protection from one's enemies and assistance in settling disputes among relatives (Harner, 1973: 97-98).' <sup id="cite_ref-1351" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1351">[1,351]</a></sup> 'Information on the classification of Jivaro kinship terminology is scant in the anthropological literature. In a series of tables appearing in an article entitled "World Ethnographic Sample", in the American Anthropologist, 1957, George P. Murdock characterizes the Jivaro as having bifurcate merging avuncular terminology in which FaBr is equated with Fa, but MoBr is differentiated from both. He also states that cousin terminology is also unusual in that non-marriageable cross-cousins are equated with siblings, while marriageable cross-cousins are differentiated (Murdock, 1957: 673). In single-word or elementary kin terms the modifier "true" or "branch" is added to the term to pin down degrees of relationship to ego. Where specific relatives are involved the modifying terms can often be substituted for one another, depending on the degree of closeness of relationship that the speaker wishes to imply. "True" relationship modifiers are used for an individual's biological kin - grandparents, parents, siblings, children, cross-cousins, and fathers of his cross-cousins. Those relatives assigned the "branch" category are affinal kin who, prior to marrying, were not considered by ego to be relatives of any degree (Harner, 1973: 98).' <sup id="cite_ref-1352" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1352">[1,352]</a></sup> Accordingly, we have assumed that self-help and informal assistance within the residential community were practiced rather than charity.

Each JIVARIA or community is autonomous, although alliances between several JIVARIAS in a district may take place, but mostly for the purposes of warfare. There is a tendency for several communities to be related to each other by blood and affinal kinship ties because of the rule of local exogamy, which requires that a man marry a woman from a village other than his own. There is, therefore, a more or less natural grouping of contiguous communities into a loose tribe, but cooperation among them is almost entirely limited to collaboration in feuds or in head-hunting against more distant and unrelated communities (Service, 1958: 190).' <sup id="cite_ref-1354" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1354">[1,354]</a></sup> 'The Jivaro lack any formal political organization, although an informal form of leadership is found in the role of individuals referred to as UNYÄ  ("big" or "old" men) or KAKARAM   ("powerful" or "powerful ones") who are renown as killers in feuds or war, or exercise important shamanistic powers in the community. These individuals acquire their reputation in the community by being old enough to have grandchildren, and are friendly, honest, and generous in dealing with others in the society. Because of these characteristics the UNYÄ   or KAKARAM   are believed to possess great ARUTAM   soul power and the ability to curse to death anyone who incurs their anger. Generally most neighborhoods have at least one or two UNYÄ   as well as a few superior shamans who provide protection for their relatives or other individuals with whom they are on friendly terms.' <sup id="cite_ref-1355" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1355">[1,355]</a></sup> “From the statements I have previously made as to the distribution of the Jibaro tribes it appears that their social organization is loose. In fact, the whole people is split up into a great number of tribes which in their turn are sub-divided into smaller clans or septs comprising a few families closely related to one another by blood. These sub-tribes do not form village communities; each family inhabits its own big communal house (héa), but these are not situated close to one another, they lie scattered here and there in the virgin forest. Generally one has to march for one or several hours to arrive at the next house. Each Jibaro house forms in fact a separate and independent social, political, and economic unit with its own household, its own plantations in the vicinity of the house, and its own ruler or chief, the oldest family father who, at any rate in time of peace, is not controlled by anybody. It is much the same feature that we meet in other parts of tropical South America, where the impenetrable virgin forests necessarily lead to social disintegration, which is further increased by the general anti-social tendencies of the Indians. The state of things found among the Jibaros, however, is in many respects unique.' <sup id="cite_ref-1356" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1356">[1,356]</a></sup> Some more prominent leaders emerged as well: 'Four or five years ago there was a strong chief on the Upano River named Tuki, known to the Ecuadoreans as José Grande. In the manner previously described, all of the curakas from Macas on the Upano River to Mendez on the Paute River became subchiefs under him until he was generally recognized as the strongest of all of the Jivaro curakas. However, he was beginning to grow old by this time and some of his subcurakas were strong men in their own right. About 2 years ago, Ambusha, who had been gradually gaining in power and becoming famous for his head-hunting activities, split off with his own group, taking several curakas and their men with him. A little later Utita did the same thing. At the time of the writer's visit (1931), although Tuki was recognized by the Government of Ecuador as being head chief of the Macas-Mendez region, actually he had lost all power excepting that over his own family group and was in reality no more than a capito. These divisions of the organization, if it may be termed such, took place apparently without any ill-feeling or formal announcements.' <sup id="cite_ref-1357" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1357">[1,357]</a></sup> Social control was informal and relied on fear of sorcery as well as retaliation and self-help justice: 'Fear of sorcery and incurring the wrath of the UNYÄ   act as restraining elements of social control in the Jivaro community. In this society the code of lex talionis holds true so that anti-social acts directed against members of the community will result in assured retaliation by the victim's family. Thus, the fear of reprisal also acts as a means of aggression control in the society.' <sup id="cite_ref-1358" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1358">[1,358]</a></sup> The Shuar bartered with whites and other Amerindians: 'The commercial activities of the Jivaro are very restricted. In the early days of European contact hogs and chickens were raised for sale to those of European background. Salt, a rare commodity in the region, was gathered in clay pots from a few brackish springs in the area, allowed to evaporate, and the resulting hardened ball of salt used in exchange transactions with neighboring tribal groups. The Jivaro were famous for the shrinking of the human heads () of their enemies (actually only the skin). Passing out of Jivaro country through a series of exchanges, these heads eventually found their way into the hands of traders who brought them down the Amazon to Para where they were sold. Soon the traders had a burgeoning trade in these items, and the Jivaro were hard-put to keep up with the demand. The Indians were by no means particular as to whose head was used, and advance orders were taken and filled. Eventually this native "industry" was brought to a halt by the Ecuadorian and Peruvian governments although by the late twentieth century life-like replicas of the heads made from animal skins are still being sold commercially.' <sup id="cite_ref-1359" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1359">[1,359]</a></sup> While Ecuador claimed nominal sovereignty over the Oriente, bureaucratic control was low and no regular governmental officials were present in Jivaro communities. The Shuar themselves did not recognize Ecuadorian rule: '“Rising in the western foothills of the Cordillera Oriental the Rio Zamora flows through Loja, where it is joined by the Rio Malacatos. ( ) Ten miles farther north, in confluence with the Rio de las Juntas, it breaks through the Andes and enters the province of Oriente, the Amazon region of Ecuador, comprising a northwestern part of the basin of the great river. Vast in extent and largely unknown, unexplored and unmapped, this territory has always been a bone of contention among the republics of Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru. But although the particular portion of it which I visited, on a reconnaissance of the Rio Zamora, was supposedly under the sovereignty of Ecuador, no evidence of administrative authority was to be found there, nor did the savages of the Jíbaro tribe who live there acknowledge allegiance to the government at Quito.”' <sup id="cite_ref-1360" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1360">[1,360]</a></sup> The same seems to be true for missionary attempts: 'Since all attempts to win back the lost territories by force of arms were unsuccessful, there was recourse to the cross in order to bend the Indians again under the yoke of slavery by this apparently gentle means. The missionaries were successful among some tribes, but the Jívaros turned away all intruders and have maintained their freedom up to our time. Only the small mission of Mácas, inhabited by the Quichua Indians, is located in their territory, and neither the secular clergy nor the Jesuit fathers, who have alternately tried their luck there, have been successful in making converts.' <sup id="cite_ref-1361" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1361">[1,361]</a></sup> Accordingly, the below variables may not apply to the Shuar.

<p><b>♠ Wages ♣ ♥</b> Note: The Shuar were subsistence horticulturalists: 'The Jívaro have a tropical-forest agriculture, growing cassava, corn (maize), sweet potatoes, and other crops supplemented by the gathering of wild fruits, fishing, and hunting. The blowgun and poisoned darts are their chief weapons. Related families live in a single large community house rather than in a village.' <sup id="cite_ref-1362" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1362">[1,362]</a></sup> 'Each household has either a single large garden or several smaller ones associated with it. In the latter case, the house itself is usually located in the largest. The Jivaro tend to cultivate slowly maturing tuberous plants, especially sweet manioc (Manihot Utilissima  ), all of which can be harvested over a long period of time providing agricultural products throughout the year.' <sup id="cite_ref-1363" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1363">[1,363]</a></sup> 'In addition to sweet manioc, the Jivaro also grew maize, sweet potatoes, peanuts, tuber beans, macabo (Xanthosoma sp.), pumpkins, plantains, tobacco, cotton, and, later, the introduced species of banana, sugarcane, taro, and yam. To supplement their diet the Jivaro hunt, fish and forage for wild fruits, cacao, nuts, and other foods. At one time they hunted deer and tapir, but by the middle of the twentieth century they gave up eating these animals out of fear of the spirits residing in them. Hunting is done with bows and arrows, spears, atlatls, and blow guns for small game. Occasionally cheap trade guns, often muzzleloaders, are used in the chase. Larger game is hunted by groups of men accompanied by dogs. There is much magic associated with hunting, including the use of pepper in the eyes of hunters and dogs to improve vision. The Jivaro traditionally domesticated llamas and guinea pigs and later the introduced dog, chicken, and pig.' <sup id="cite_ref-1364" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1364">[1,364]</a></sup> Division of labour was organized along gender lines: 'Men are responsible for protecting their families, house construction, basket making, different kinds of wood work, weapon manufacture, hunting and fishing, clearing the forest in preparation for the initial establishment of garden plots, and for cutting and bringing in fire wood. They also spin and weave and do some limited garden work. Women are responsible for the overwhelming majority of agricultural tasks, as well as for food and beer preparation, pottery making, fabric dyeing, child care, and the tending of the domestic animals (chiefly chickens and pigs).' <sup id="cite_ref-1365" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1365">[1,365]</a></sup> 'Jivaro graphic art is limited and simple. Weaving and spinning is exclusively a man's task. Men spin yarn from home-grown cotton and dye it with vegetal solutions. The yarn is then woven on a back strap loom into  or cotton kilts that form the basis of men and women's clothing.' <sup id="cite_ref-1366" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1366">[1,366]</a></sup> “Why do women dig yuca and the men fell trees? were questions Johnston asked me. He laboured under the common misapprehension that the women were slaves, and did the hardest work; but I had to explain otherwise. The Jivaros carry their sense of the personal, not only to animals, but also to trees and inanimate objects. In their eyes all things are animated by human spirits, male or female. The yuca has a female soul, hence it is proper for the women to cultivate it. Clay is feminine, therefore women must fashion the simple pottery which they use. Women must also handle the vessels when it comes to cooking. Most trees are men, hence men must chop them down. Cotton is of the male gender, so men must spin thread and make their own ‘itipis’ and also the ‘tarachi,’ or garments worn by the women. It is the sex distinction which is all important. Man and woman's work is as distinct as night from day, and the duties of one never overlap those of the other. There is not even a question of comparison between the two. A man is a man, and a woman a woman. That is their final argument.” <sup id="cite_ref-1367" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1367">[1,367]</a></sup> Trade with Europeans operated through middlemen and was based on barter: 'The commercial activities of the Jivaro are very restricted. In the early days of European contact hogs and chickens were raised for sale to those of European background. Salt, a rare commodity in the region, was gathered in clay pots from a few brackish springs in the area, allowed to evaporate, and the resulting hardened ball of salt used in exchange transactions with neighboring tribal groups. The Jivaro were famous for the shrinking of the human heads (TSANTSA  ) of their enemies (actually only the skin). Passing out of Jivaro country through a series of exchanges, these heads eventually found their way into the hands of traders who brought them down the Amazon to Para where they were sold. Soon the traders had a burgeoning trade in these items, and the Jivaro were hard-put to keep up with the demand. The Indians were by no means particular as to whose head was used, and advance orders were taken and filled. Eventually this native "industry" was brought to a halt by the Ecuadorian and Peruvian governments although by the late twentieth century life-like replicas of the heads made from animal skins are still being sold commercially.' <sup id="cite_ref-1368" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1368">[1,368]</a></sup> 'The few technological items that the Jivaro make are mostly used for their own subsistence needs, such as baskets, pottery, bows and arrows, blow guns, woven materials, etc. Any production of items above their immediate needs is employed in barter exchanges with neighboring people.' <sup id="cite_ref-1369" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1369">[1,369]</a></sup> 'Much of the trade of the Jivaro is between the "interior", relatively isolated groups (particularly the Achuara) and those "frontier" groups living in close proximity to Ecuadorian settlements where they have easy access to Western industrialized products. Through a series of neighborhood-to-neighborhood relays by native trading partners (AMIGRI  ) these products were passed from the frontier Jivaro into the most remote parts of the tribal territory. Thus the interior Jivaro were supplied with steel cutting tools, firearms and ammunition without having to come into contact with the population of European ancestry. In exchange the frontier Jivaro, whose supply of local game was nearly exhausted, obtained hides, feathers and bird skins (used for ornaments), which were not readily available in their own territory.' <sup id="cite_ref-1370" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1370">[1,370]</a></sup> Harner describes the development of trade relations between Jivaro and frontier settlements: 'The Viceroy of Peru soon sent a new expedition of colonists, as well as soldiers, into the Jívaro territory. These newcomers engaged in trade with the Indians, made peace pacts with them, and began to exploit the rich placer gold deposits of the Paute, Zamora and Upano rivers and their tributaries. Experiencing great success in their gold mining activities, the Spaniards founded two major communities, described [Page 18] as “cities,” in 1552: Logroño, possibly at the junction of the Río Paute (and Río Upano) with the Río Zamora; and Sevilla del Oro, probably somewhere on the middle Río Upano.' <sup id="cite_ref-1371" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1371">[1,371]</a></sup> 'With this initiation of trade relations between the two groups, Jívaro families soon migrated north from the Río Paute Valley to settle in the previously uninhabited land between the Rí Paute and Macas. These migrants began to act as middlemen in the barter of Jívaro products for steel machetes and other goods. The Macabeos at first traded mainly to secure pigs and salt obtained by the Jívaro from saline springs, but soon also began to attend tsantsa celebrations to purchase lard obtained from pigs slaughtered by the Jívaro on such occasions. As a consequence of their attendance at the feasts, the Macabeos started also to purchase tsantsa. This was the beginning of the “shrunken head” trade, and the first reported examples of tsantsa reached the outside world at about this time.' <sup id="cite_ref-1372" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1372">[1,372]</a></sup> 'By 1956, the Jívaro west of the Cordillera de Cutucú were largely in direct, continuous contact with the Spanish-speaking Ecuadorian population. In this frontier zone, white soldiers and police had imposed the national laws on the Jívaro. White settlers had seized almost all of the land except that protected by the missionaries, and employed the Jívaro in wage labor. Missionaries, with the backing of law enforcement agencies, were putting the Jívaro children in boarding schools and enculturating them to the new, alien way of life. This direct, unremitted contact was tending to acculturate the frontier Jívaro to the national Ecuadorian way of life and the direction of the trend was towards eventual assimilation.' <sup id="cite_ref-1373" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1373">[1,373]</a></sup> 'In contrast, the Jívaro beyond the frontier of colonization still were not yet in continuous first-hand contact with the white population at the time of the investigator's original fieldwork in 1956-57, and these are the people whose culture will be described here. Their territory, mainly east of the Cordillera de Cutucú, had been rarely, if ever, penetrated by any Spanish expedition or later group of Ecuadorian colonizers. This mountain barrier, which is traversed by an arduous [Page 35] journey of two or more days on foot, still discourages white penetration into the eastern interior.' <sup id="cite_ref-1374" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1374">[1,374]</a></sup> 'Cases of contact between the interior Jívaro and whites are all very recent and highly localized in their occurrence. The largest intrusion was made by the Royal Dutch Shell Oil Corporation in the early 1940's as part of an ill-fated oil exploration project. The company constructed a small airstrip near the Río Pangui in the easternmost part of the Jívaro territory, but within a few years abandoned the site altogether when explorations failed to reveal economically exploitable oil deposits in the region. The project involved relatively limited interaction with the Jívaro.' <sup id="cite_ref-1375" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1375">[1,375]</a></sup> 'The relative isolation of the interior Jívaro, however, had not prevented them from obtaining increasing quantities of machetes, steel axes, and shotguns. By means of neighborhood-to-neighborhood relays of native trading partners, these products of Western civilization were passed from the frontier Jívaro into the most remote parts of the tribal territory. All of the interior Jívaro neighborhoods were thus supplied with steel cutting tools, firearms, and ammunition without the necessity of coming into direct contact with the white population.' <sup id="cite_ref-1376" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1376">[1,376]</a></sup> 'The growth of this trade in recent decades had been made possible by the increasing involvement of the frontier Jívaro in the Ecuadorian socio-economic structure. The frontier Jívaro, primarily through their employment by Ecuadorians in manual labor, had acquired quantities of factory-manufactured goods. At the same time, there was a shortage of native-type goods among the Jívaro on the frontier, partially because of the near exhaustion of local game, which supplied feathers and bird skins for ornament. The interior Jívaro, in contrast, had a much more abundant supply of game and native-produced goods, but a greater scarcity of steel cutting [Page 40] tools and firearms. These complementary inequalities in supply and demand between the frontier and interior Jívaro formed the basis for the trade that supplied the latter with European-type technological items. Such technological items constituted almost the sole aspects of Western civilization that had been adopted by the interior Jívaro in 1956-57.' <sup id="cite_ref-1377" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1377">[1,377]</a></sup> 'The main variables introduced into interior Jívaro culture during the period studied were Western-manufactured trade goods, especially machetes, axes, and guns. Some machetes were acquired by the frontier Jívaro near Macas about a hundred years ago, but very few reached the interior Jívaro by intra-tribal trade until the turn of the century, and even these were so scarce and valued that their blades were each split into fragments to permit their utilization by several households. The more efficient steel blade fragments were at first used in the same manner as the aboriginal stone axe heads, each machete piece being mounted into a wooden handle. After the 1930's, however, machetes became sufficiently abundant so that the need to split the blades into small fragments was eliminated. They also largely replaced by then the traditional palm-wood “machetes” used in cutting down garden weeds. Despite their fair degree of availability at the present time, steel machetes are still highly valued and are used for many years, long after they have lost their handles and have become worn down to a fraction of their former size. Today they are considered to be utterly indispensable tools by the Jívaro, who also have been able to acquire some single-bitted steel axe-heads, although in much smaller numbers than the machetes.' <sup id="cite_ref-1378" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1378">[1,378]</a></sup> 'Economic factors are also playing an important role in the rapidly changing life of these people. The Jívaro, as has been indicated earlier in this book, have long been anxious to acquire the technology and dress of Western civilization. Now that air transportation is available to most of the tribe, the only limit on Jívaro aspirations to acquire manufactured goods is their ability to acquire cash. Their model for such success is the cattle-raising Ecuadorian colonists west of the Cordillera de Cutucú, who have now converted most of the bottomlands of the Río Upano Valley into pasture with the aid of Jívaro labor. Air transport has made it profitable to ship beef to the highlands from there, and three local competing airlines are involved in the lucrative trade. Some Jívaro, with the strong encouragement of both Catholic and Protestant missionaries, are now clearing pasture land also for themselves to raise cattle and are starting to achieve success in acquiring substantial cash in exchange for beef.' <sup id="cite_ref-1379" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1379">[1,379]</a></sup> 'Still, the Jívaro have clearly opted for adaptation to a Western life style and seem to have no brief for maintaining traditional features of their native life simply for tradition's sake alone. While they undoubtedly will wish to preserve and even revive certain aspects of their old culture within the context of a desire for an ethnic identity, at this moment in time they seem to be basically focused upon acquiring what they discern as the most positive features of the whites' life. Whether their eventual fate will parallel that of their North American counterparts, who went through similar attempts at adaptation in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, or whether the twentieth century will be kinder, is a question that remains to be answered.' <sup id="cite_ref-1380" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1380">[1,380]</a></sup> The frontier Jivaro became involved in rubber-tapping as well as unskilled temporary labour: 'There is no specific mention of direct involvement by Achuarä in rubber tapping at this time, although a census of the Pastaza and its tributaries in 1905 records two caucheros in residence on the Huasaga and an estimated 150 Achuarä in its vicinity (Fuentes 1908/I:194). However, it is clear that by 1917 at least some Achuarä were participating actively in such work. In that year, Rafael Karsten, a Scandinavian ethnographer, visited an Achuarä community in the company of their cauchero patrón, over a day's walk inland from another western tributary of the Pastaza, the Río Tunigrama (Karsten 1935:43).' <sup id="cite_ref-1381" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1381">[1,381]</a></sup> 'Historically the most persistent external pressure on the entire area occupied by the Jivaroan populations has been along the western frontier of Shuarä territory in Ecuador, in the Upano River Valley where the town of Macas is situated. By 1887, the Upano was observed to be suffering a shortage of game as a result of the presence of collectors of cinchona bark (for quinine) and other tropical products, who descended into the region from the Ecuadorian highlands (Vacas Galindo 1895:28-29). Many of the collectors worked primarily out of Macas, employing its non-Indian residents but occasionally enlisting the labor of Jívaro inhabitants of the valley in exchange for guns and other trade items (Harner 1972:30). Shuarä who had migrated there earlier in efforts to establish direct access to Western manufactures at Macas, found that with the stepping up of commercial activity in the valley and the initiation of cattle ranching at Macas, there was reduced demand for items they had formerly provided in exchange-deer, pigs, and native salt-although shrunken heads were still a greatly desired commodity (Harner 1972:29; Karsten 1935:56). In order to sustain their supply of manufactured trade goods, some of the Indians cut pastures for the Macabeos (Harner 1972:29); others, as observed, engaged in the extractive industry.' <sup id="cite_ref-1382" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1382">[1,382]</a></sup> Accordingly, that region was hit economically by the crash of the rubber market: 'However, with the crash of the rubber market, the commercial pressure on Indian populations-more attenuated here than elsewhere (Harner 1972:30)-was diminished. The cauchero whom Karsten encountered on the Pastaza working with inland Achuarä in 1917, was gone on Karsten's return trip in 1929 (Karsten 1935:41, 43, 78). Furthermore, numbers of Peruvian military outposts that had served to oversee commercial activity were withdrawn (Karsten 1935:43, 78; Zanabria Zamudio 1969:157, 159, 195), and access to the entire Pastaza region was gradually curtailed. A Catholic missionary reported in 1928 that “the steamships of Iquitos which periodically make the service to the Alto Marañon, do not enter [the Pastaza], since it is almost completely lacking in civilized people and all exploitation of goma [latex] has been suspended because of the depreciation” (Misiones Pasionistas 1943:264).' <sup id="cite_ref-1383" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1383">[1,383]</a></sup> 'Many sources of Western goods did vanish when the sudden depreciation in the value of wild Amazonian latex resulted in a major cutback in foreign investment and in the cessation of steamship transport to the region gradually coming to be occupied by Achuarä in Peru. However, commercial contact with the area was not wholly terminated. Some rubber extractors and colonists chose to remain after the crash as frontier agriculturalists or patrones of the Indians in the exploitation of other natural products. Furthermore, neither Peru nor Ecuador was fully willing to relinquish a tenuous hold over the northern tributaries of the Marañon and the as yet untapped resources to be found there.' <sup id="cite_ref-1384" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1384">[1,384]</a></sup> However, there was no professional specialization among the Shuar at the time. Accordingly, the below variables may not be applicable among the Shuar.
