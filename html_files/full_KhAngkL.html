The Hindu temple complex, and an architectural tradition of brick and/or stone based upon Gupta prototypes. Statuary representing gods, kings and the Buddha. Cremation burial, at least of the upper stratum of society. Rectilineal town and city plans.

So severe was the ensuing fragmentation that by 1340, as noted, at least 23 mainland kingdoms were independent in the sense that they paid no regular tribute to other Southeast Asian rulers (see Figure 1.4).41 Most would survive into the 16th century.'<sup id="cite_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-74">[74]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-75">[75]</a></sup>

That landscape could have fed between 300,000 and 750,000 human beings (see Fletcher et al. 2003:117 for assessment by Lustig).'<sup id="cite_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-77">[77]</a></sup> 'Angkor.

'<sup id="cite_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-78">[78]</a></sup> 'Although it is likely that Groslier’s original population estimate was too high, Angkor was probably the largest pre-industrial city in the world. The most recent archaeological work indicates that one million is a reasonable estimate of the city’s size.'<sup id="cite_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-79">[79]</a></sup> 'Acker has given detailed consideration to the area that could have been irrigated, the water requirement, likely yields, and the location of the barays relative to one another and the land below them. His calculations were based on Groslier’s estimate of a population at Angkor in the vicinity of 1,900,000 people, of whom 600,000 were supported by 86,000 hectares (215,000 acres) of irrigated rice fields. In the dry season, a hectare would require 15,000 cubic meters (525,000 cu. ft.) of water. Assuming all the major barays at Angkor were full to a depth of three meters (9.9 ft.), they could have supplied 7,000 hectares (17,500 acres). If they yielded 1.46 tons of rice per hectare and annual consumption was 220 kilograms (484 lbs.) of rice per capita, the dry season yield would have maintained about 44,500 people, about 2.5 percent of the estimated population. This calculation is based only on the amount of water available when the barays were three meters deep. It does not take into account the possibility that the barays were constantly replenished with water from the Siem Reap River throughout the dry season. There is also the possibility that the reservoirs were used to supplement water supplies to the fields when there was insufficient rainfall during the wet sea- son. If so, then a further 9,000 metric tons (9,900 tons) over and above anticipated wet-season production could have been obtained, making the total irrigated yield 19,200 tons, sufficient to feed nearly 100,000 people.'<sup id="cite_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-80">[80]</a></sup> 'At its peak, the population of the impe- rial core may have exceeded 1.5 million.'<sup id="cite_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-81">[81]</a></sup> 'At its height, Angkor was the largest premodern settlement in the world, a city of more than 700,000 spread over a larger area than modern Los Angeles. Its crowning achievement was Angkor Wat, built at the kingdom’s height in the early twelfth century. Topped by five towers, arranged in an “X” pattern like the dots on a die, Angkor Wat was designed as a microcosmic representation of Mount Meru, the center of the universe in Hindu and Buddhist cosmology. This vast complex, still the largest religious building in the world, remains a powerful representation of Angkor’s military, artistic, and economic might, as well as the absolute rule of the God Kings, who were said to “eat their kingdom,” ruling with an iron fist.'<sup id="cite_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-82">[82]</a></sup>  <sup id="cite_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-83">[83]</a></sup>

'According to George Groslier, and in the atlas of Lunet de Lajonquiere, there is visible evidence of six major arteries in the system, as follows: [...] Angkor to Phimai, crossing the Dangrek Range: 210 km (130 miles).'<sup id="cite_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-84">[84]</a></sup> 'From the capital city, Angkor, there were at least two roads to the east and two to the west. One of the latter ran across the Dangrek Mountains to Phimai, and another went due west toward Sisophon, which means toward the only lowland pass from Cambodia into eastern Thailand in the direc- tion of Lophburi or Ayutthaya.Toward the east, one road has been traced almost to the Mekong, and according to an inscription in which these roads are described, it may have continued as far as the capital of Champa.'<sup id="cite_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-85">[85]</a></sup> 'Moreover, given the maximum extent of the Angkorian Empire, at over 350 km from the centre, a single communication may have taken one to two weeks to reach the recipient, rendering administered prices difficult to sustain for extended periods.'<sup id="cite_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-86">[86]</a></sup> 'At its zenith, Angkor was to control an empire that stretched from the South China Sea to the Isthmus of Kra and the Andaman Sea, and northwards into what is today Laos. As historians Ian Mabbett and David Chandler have pointed out, many of the subjects of this vast empire lived at remote distances to the capital city; even if they had obtained permission to travel, an elephant journey of only 50 miles from Battambang to Angkor would have taken five days, as it still did in the 19th century.'<sup id="cite_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-87">[87]</a></sup> Angkor after the 1400s was probably reduced to the space currently occupied by Cambodia. So the figure may work for the beginning of the Post-Angkor period, but not for the end. It is more likely that for later periods the largest communication distance between the capital and the provinces would have been between the area of Phnom Penh and Sisophon, around 366km.

<p>'Because all the Classic inscriptions deal with matters that are fundamentally religious in nature [...] we have much information on the central religious hierarchy, but little about the secular one. [...] The religious authorities and functionaries in the royal court were certainly almost entirely Brahmin caste [Level 2], although some priests in the provinces and villages [Level 1] may not have been so. Most of them may have received the honorific Khmer title of sten an, reserved for learned men. We already run across the purohita [Level 4]. In peninsular India, this Sanskrit word indicated a family priest or chaplain; in Classic Angkor, this important individual was the chaplain and chief priest of the king and, at least according to the self-serving Sdok Kak Thom stela, was a hereditary officer charged with maintaining the cult of the devajara. The Sanskrit title of hotar or 'sacrificer' occurs frequently in the texts; this is also supposed to indicate 'royal chaplain' - but the exact scope of the term is unclear since while the royal purohita of the devaraja was a hotar, there were other hotars [Level 3]. Most of these may have had important administrative roles. There were many religious functionaries who received the Sanskrit title of acharya, a learned priest who acted as teacher and spiritual guide; or pandit, someone versed in sacred lore; or of upadhyaya, a teacher and preceptor learned in the vedas [Level 2].

These men commanded the loyalty of peasant groups in their particular locality. If the king conquered a region, a new captain of militia would be enrolled and put under an oath of allegiance. The captains were simply headmen of the outlying regions, but their connection with the king enhanced their status. In time of war they were expected to conscript the peasants in their district and to lead them to Angkor to join the Khmer army. If the captains disobeyed the king they were put to death.

<p><b> ♠ Full-time bureaucrats ♣ present ♥ </b> 'One major feature of the 'imperial state' was its maintenance of a large court and a corps of officials. Angkor has a sizeable bureaucracy staffed by officials of many sorts. Like so much about the Khmer kingdom in ancient times, the structure of government and the categories of the civil service are known to us through temple inscriptions, which frequently name various types of official or local dignitary in listing those present to witness the formal demarcation of land bestowed upon religious foundations; they mention a variety of grades and titles, some of them obscure. The khlon rajakarya was responsible for the administration of 'royal work', probably corvee among other things. The tamrvac was an inspector; the officials who swore allegiance to Suryavarman I had this title, for example. The gunadosadarsin (assessor of virtues and defects) was concerned with temple property. A variety of functionaries were called khlon (inspector) and had responsibilities in various areas such as grain, temple dues, management of religious foundations and several aspects of court proceedings. Revenue was usually in kind, being paid in grain, but some special districts paid in other commodities such as honey and wax. There is evidence that some of the categories in which officials were placed were not types of professional specialisation but divisions of the government service placed under the patronage of particular chiefs belonging to the royal family, a system that was indeed known in later centuries. Some of the groups of dignitaries in named in the inscriptions, again, appear to have been the bearers of hereditary privileges in the royal household; the term varna, for example, designates any of a number of orders of dignity, which have such official functions as religious teachers, performers of rites, door guardians, garden keepers, palace servants, bearers of flywhisks, and artists.'<sup id="cite_ref-110" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-110">[110]</a></sup> 'In its heyday, the temple {Ta Prohm] was administered by 18 high priests and 2,740 officials. There were 2,202 assistants and 615 female dancers. In all, 12,640 are listed as serving the temple, of which perhaps 1,000-2,000 were entitled to live within its walls. 66,625 people from rural villages were assigned to supply the temple, which involved mosquito nets, fine cloth, rice, honey, molasses, millet, beans, butter, milt, salt and vegetables.'<sup id="cite_ref-111" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-111">[111]</a></sup>

At least some administrative posts were hereditary, especially in the Angkorian period. For example, the purohita and the yājaka usually seem to have been hereditary officials and a single family was said to have been in charge of the devarāja cult for a period of 250 years (ibid., 24-25). A number of positions close to the kings (purohita, hotar, guru, ācārya and guṇadośadarśi) are referred to in Angkorian period inscriptions written by officials. These tend to be Sanskrit terms which had religious connotations, but as Vickery (2002: 93) points out, some of these became secular, as in India, and perhaps were so in Cambodia from the start. Researchers are not in agreement on issues such as whether certain roles and titles had to be held by Brahmins, could be held by women or were hereditary (Mabbett 1978: 33; Sahai 1978: 28; Chakravarti 1980: 53).'<sup id="cite_ref-115" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-115">[115]</a></sup>

These are sometimes able to provide alternative views of the society in which they were produced and can be compared with the temple inscription texts.

With this personage, who was not necessarily connected with the client's territory, there were mutual obligations: the client owed the patron deference, and respect, services, occasional labour, and the usual small gifts, while the latter gave aid and protection (even legal) to the freeman and accommodation when he had to travel to the capital.

This is an estimate based on the estimates of individuals involved in the construction of Ta Phrom, a more modest structure (80,000 individuals x 32 years = 2,560,000 people-years). ‘The monument [Angkor Wat] was begun by Surayarman II, probably early in his reign, but was probably not completed until after his death. Some believe it was designed by his great minister Divakarapandita, and that echoes of its construction are found in the inscriptions of the early part of Suryavarman II's reign, such as the statement in the inscription of Preach Vihear (IV) that in 1119 Suryavarman gave the order “to raise the corveable workmen of the second and third (and probably fourth) categories. They erected towards, dug basins” (6, 2, 213-216; 742, st. 20-22). The erection of the Sanakara-Narayana in the “Vat Prang,” or holy pyramid, in 1122, and the erection of the Vrah Vishnu in 1127, mentioned in the inscription of Vat Phu (p.193), seem much more applicable to a Vishnuite pyramid-temple like Angkor Wat than to a flat Sivaist temple like Vat Phu.’ <sup id="cite_ref-163" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-163">[163]</a></sup></dd>

'At Angkor Wat [...] the measurements of both parts and whole contain calendrically and cosmologically significant totals. As an illustration of the part/whole relationship, the circumference of the fourth (outer) enclosure at Angkor Wat measures 1 lunar year expressed as 354.36 units. (There are 354.36 days in 12 lunar months). The circumference also includes a 28-unit ritual path through the triad of eastern, northern, and southern entrances. One lunar month is often expressed as 28 days of length and is a subdivision the lunar year. In other words, the 28-unit path is contained within the 354.36-unit circumference, and the 28-day month is contained within the 354-day year.

The biggest variation is on the north with about 40 metres, due seemingly to the error of an angular layout which shows one grade south-west.

'Understanding communications is a key to understanding strategies for administration, as well as trade, ideological control and defence. Maps of the transport links help researchers both define the extent of the Khmer empire at different stages of its existence and model transportation times (Drennan 1984; Hendrickson 2007: 55-56). It has been estimated that people could have travelled about 20 km per day on foot (Deloche and Walker 1993: 284), while carts drawn by oxen or pack-oxen on dirt roads may have covered 12-19 km per day (ibid., 245; 251) or up to 24 km per day using buffaloes (ibid., 246).34 On water, with favourable currents, the time and effort involved would have been considerably less (Leighton 1972: 161; 164-64; Dobson 2005).35'<sup id="cite_ref-230" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-230">[230]</a></sup> 'The maximum distance for direct communication has been taken as normally no further than one day’s travel, 20-25 km on land. Direct central administration therefore probably functioned to a radius of 25 km from Angkor, which can be defined as the city’s core region. From there out to 150 km, where the centre exerted less influence, could be regarded as the city’s hinterland, containing strategic resources and sites (Sections 6.3; 6.4; 6.9), mostly within the major communication corridors. Where formalised roads were constructed radiating from the capital, they were important for the state. Given the seemingly abrupt endings of some, they appear to have served primarily to access Angkor’s hinterland (Section 3.3.1).'<sup id="cite_ref-231" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-231">[231]</a></sup> 'The nature of state control of Khmer territories varied according to distance from the capital, and over the Angkorian period. There is a high concentration of royal inscriptions in the inner Angkor area. Elsewhere, central influence dropped off in two stages: fairly rapidly outside Angkor’s core area of about 25 km radius, about a day’s journey, remaining reasonably steady up to 150 km. These two distances appear to mark respectively the core area of Angkor the city and the strategic hinterland of the city, which contained much of the formalised roads. From 150 km, Angkor’s influence again diminishes, and it is minimal beyond 350 km.'<sup id="cite_ref-232" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-232">[232]</a></sup> 'At its zenith, Angkor was to control an empire that stretched from the South China Sea to the Isthmus of Kra and the Andaman Sea, and northwards into what is today Laos. As historians Ian Mabbett and David Chandler have pointed out, many of the subjects of this vast empire lived at remote distances to the capital city; even if they had obtained permission to travel, an elephant journey of only 50 miles from Battambang to Angkor would have taken five days, as it still did in the 19th century.'<sup id="cite_ref-233" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-233">[233]</a></sup></dd></dl>

The king would be surrounded by Brahmins who conducted ritual ablutions, and by soothsayers who were consulted on the placement of military camps and for auspicious days for military operations.'<sup id="cite_ref-317" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-317">[317]</a></sup>

'The Khmer army on the march must have been an impressive sight - and sound. It was accompanied by military music produced by a huge gong struck by a dwarfish person, long trumpets, bronze castanets, and blasts from conch shells. The ark of the Sacred Fire, under the care of Brahmin priests, was carried into battle, and there were parasols, banners and battle standards.'<sup id="cite_ref-319" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-319">[319]</a></sup> 'The Indian combat manual Kautiliya Arthashastra gives an idea of the ideal battle array, specifying 'three combat foot-soldiers per horsemen, fifteen per chariot (which in fact were not in combat use in Cambodia) or for an elephant plus five horse.'

According to Lustig (2009), 'Supplies and food for the army were brought in covered wagons drawn by bullocks, and even on pack elephants, while pigs were driven along the route of march. There were many camp-followers, perhaps the wives and children of soldiers.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ court procession ♥</b> 'Nowhere is this more apparent than in the great state processions of South and Southeast Asia, such as the impressive Perahera still celebrated annually in the old Sinhalese capital of Kandy in Sri Lanka (and attended by more than a million citizens). This is what the celebrated reliefs on Angkor Wat's South Gallery are all about: the political, religious and military structure of Suryavarman's empire were laid out for all to see in a  grand and thrilling public display that must have been saved in the parade ground immediately in front of the 300-m (984-ft) long Elephant Terrace. Here is the unforgettable testimony of Zhou Daguan, who actually witnessed such an event: "When the King [Jayavarman VIII] leaves his palace, the procession is headed by the soldiery; then come the flags, the banners, the music. Girls of the palace, three or five hundred in number, gaily dressed, with flowers in their hair and tapers in their hands, are massed together in a separate column. The tapers are lighted even in the broad daylight. Then come other girls holding gold and silver vessels from the palace and a whole galaxy of ornaments, of very special design, the uses of which are strange to me. Then came still more girls, the bodyguard of the palace, holding shields and lances. These, too, were separately aligned. Following them came chariots drawn by goats and horses, all adorned with gold; ministers and princes, mounted on elephants, were preceded by bearers of scarlet parasols, without number. Close behind came the royal wives and concubines, in palanquins and chariots, or mounted on horses or elephants, to whom were signed at least a hundred parasols mottled with gold. Finally the sovereign appeared, standing erect on an elephant and holding in his hand the Sacred Sword. This elephant, his tusks sheathed with gold, was accompanied by bearers of twenty parasols with golden shafts. All around was a bodyguard of elephants, drawn close together, and still more soldiers for complete protection, marching in close order." As for the music, in processions shown on the base reliefs, the Classic marching band was mainly composed of percussion instruments and long trumpets. A passage from a steale in the Ta Prohm complex has an exhortation: "Let the procession that surrounds them be full of banners, parasols; let the struck musical instruments make great sounds that charm the spirit; let the male and female dancers all around here.'<sup id="cite_ref-355" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-355">[355]</a></sup> 'Procession of Suryavarman II (S Gallery, W section). In contrast to Angkor Wat's other bas-reliefs, this 94m-long military procession has an historical basis, as it shows King Suryavarman II, the temple's builder, and his army. It begins at the W edge, with two registers: the upper is a royal audience before the army sets off, in the lower a procession. 10m from the start, on the upper register, is the kind, seated (in keeping with his rank, larger than any other figure). Below, princesses and ladies of the court are carried on palanquins. On the other side of the king are his ministers and army commanders, and after the audience they rise and leave, descending steps to rejoin the army. From here to the end, the army marches in a single register, its 20 commanders riding war elephants, their rank identified by the number of parasols and name identified in small inscriptions. The 12th elephant, exactly halfway along the bas-relief, carries the king, again the largest figure, with 15 parasols. The royal standard, a small statue of Vishnu on Garuda, precedes him. Military processions continued just like this throughout the different reigns; the Chinese diplomat from a century and a half later reads, "The ministers and princes are all on elephant back; from afar their innumerable red parasols can be seen... Behind them at last comes the king, standing on the back of an elephant and holding in his hand the precious sword." 18m in front of Suryavarman II, the royal sacrificer or Rajahotar, a brahmin, rides in a palanquin among priests, just behind the Sacred Fire on its ark (each end decorated with naga heads). A band precedes this: note the horns, conch shells, flute and a gong carried by two men. The small group of standard bearers just in front is excellent. The head of the procession is taken over by more troops. 8m before the end Prince Jayasimhavarman on an elephant commands a provincial contingent from Louvo (now Lopburi in Central Thailand). Sloping out of step in front of these disciplined troops is a rag-tag body of Siamese mercenaries, wild-looking and armed with spears; their commander also rides an elephant.'<sup id="cite_ref-356" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-356">[356]</a></sup> 'I have heard it said that, with previous rulers, the imprints of the wheels of their chariots never left the palace threshold; and that was to prevent untoward incidents. The present monarch is the son-in-law of the previous ruler. At first he was the supreme commander of the troops. On the death of the father-in-law, his [the father-in-law's] daughter stole the golden sword [of state] and brought it to her husband. The true son and heir was deprived of his succession. He plotted to raise troops, but the new ruler heard about it, cut off his toes and kept him in a secrete chamber. A sliver of sacred iron has been inserted in the body of the new ruler, so that he is invulnerable to knives and arrows which may strike his body. Assured of this, the new ruler dares leave his palace. I have spent more than a year in the country, and have seen him go out for or five times. When the sovereign goes out, troops are at the head of the procession. After them come the standard bearers, the flag-bearers, and the musicians. Just the palace women, numbering between three and five hundred, in clothes with floral designs, flowers in their hair, holding candles in their hands, form a battalion. Even in the broad daylight they light their tapers. Then come the palace maidens carrying the gold and silver royal utensils and a whole panoply of ornaments, all very special; I do not know their purpose. Then come the female palace guards holding in their hands lances and shields; they too form a section by themselves. Next come carts drawn by goats and horses, all decorated in gold. The ministers and the princes are all mounted on elephants. In from of them one can see from afar their innumerable red parasols. After them come the kings wives and concubines, in palanquins, chariots, on horseback, and on elephants; they have certainly more than a hundred parasols flecked with gold. Behind them comes the sovereign himself, standing on an elephant and holding in his hand the precious sword [of state]. The tusks of the elephants are also sheathed in gold. [Around him] are more than twenty white parasols flecked with gold and with gold handles. Numerous elephants surround him, and there are more troops to protect him. If the sovereign goes to a place nearby, he only uses gold palanquins, carried by palace women. Most frequently, the king on leaving goes to see a small gold tower in which there is a golden Buddha [statue]. Those who see the king must crouch down and touch their heads on the ground; this is what is called the sanba [san-pa]; otherwise, they are seized by the procession organisers who do not let them go for nothing.'<sup id="cite_ref-357" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-357">[357]</a></sup></dd>

It begins at the W edge, with two registers: the upper is a royal audience before the army sets off, in the lower a procession. 10m from the start, on the upper register, is the kind, seated (in keeping with his rank, larger than any other figure). Below, princesses and ladies of the court are carried on palanquins. On the other side of the king are his ministers and army commanders, and after the audience they rise and leave, descending steps to rejoin the army.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ court procession ♥</b> 'Nowhere is this more apparent than in the great state processions of South and Southeast Asia, such as the impressive Perahera still celebrated annually in the old Sinhalese capital of Kandy in Sri Lanka (and attended by more than a million citizens). This is what the celebrated reliefs on Angkor Wat's South Gallery are all about: the political, religious and military structure of Suryavarman's empire were laid out for all to see in a  grand and thrilling public display that must have been saved in the parade ground immediately in front of the 300-m (984-ft) long Elephant Terrace. Here is the unforgettable testimony of Zhou Daguan, who actually witnessed such an event: "When the King [Jayavarman VIII] leaves his palace, the procession is headed by the soldiery; then come the flags, the banners, the music. Girls of the palace, three or five hundred in number, gaily dressed, with flowers in their hair and tapers in their hands, are massed together in a separate column. The tapers are lighted even in the broad daylight. Then come other girls holding gold and silver vessels from the palace and a whole galaxy of ornaments, of very special design, the uses of which are strange to me. Then came still more girls, the bodyguard of the palace, holding shields and lances. These, too, were separately aligned. Following them came chariots drawn by goats and horses, all adorned with gold; ministers and princes, mounted on elephants, were preceded by bearers of scarlet parasols, without number. Close behind came the royal wives and concubines, in palanquins and chariots, or mounted on horses or elephants, to whom were signed at least a hundred parasols mottled with gold. Finally the sovereign appeared, standing erect on an elephant and holding in his hand the Sacred Sword. This elephant, his tusks sheathed with gold, was accompanied by bearers of twenty parasols with golden shafts. All around was a bodyguard of elephants, drawn close together, and still more soldiers for complete protection, marching in close order." As for the music, in processions shown on the base reliefs, the Classic marching band was mainly composed of percussion instruments and long trumpets. A passage from a steale in the Ta Prohm complex has an exhortation: "Let the procession that surrounds them be full of banners, parasols; let the struck musical instruments make great sounds that charm the spirit; let the male and female dancers all around here.'<sup id="cite_ref-535" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-535">[535]</a></sup> 'Procession of Suryavarman II (S Gallery, W section). In contrast to Angkor Wat's other bas-reliefs, this 94m-long military procession has an historical basis, as it shows King Suryavarman II, the temple's builder, and his army. It begins at the W edge, with two registers: the upper is a royal audience before the army sets off, in the lower a procession. 10m from the start, on the upper register, is the kind, seated (in keeping with his rank, larger than any other figure). Below, princesses and ladies of the court are carried on palanquins. On the other side of the king are his ministers and army commanders, and after the audience they rise and leave, descending steps to rejoin the army. From here to the end, the army marches in a single register, its 20 commanders riding war elephants, their rank identified by the number of parasols and name identified in small inscriptions. The 12th elephant, exactly halfway along the bas-relief, carries the king, again the largest figure, with 15 parasols. The royal standard, a small statue of Vishnu on Garuda, precedes him. Military processions continued just like this throughout the different reigns; the Chinese diplomat from a century and a half later reads, "The ministers and princes are all on elephant back; from afar their innumerable red parasols can be seen... Behind them at last comes the king, standing on the back of an elephant and holding in his hand the precious sword." 18m in front of Suryavarman II, the royal sacrificer or Rajahotar, a brahmin, rides in a palanquin among priests, just behind the Sacred Fire on its ark (each end decorated with naga heads). A band precedes this: note the horns, conch shells, flute and a gong carried by two men. The small group of standard bearers just in front is excellent. The head of the procession is taken over by more troops. 8m before the end Prince Jayasimhavarman on an elephant commands a provincial contingent from Louvo (now Lopburi in Central Thailand). Sloping out of step in front of these disciplined troops is a rag-tag body of Siamese mercenaries, wild-looking and armed with spears; their commander also rides an elephant.'<sup id="cite_ref-536" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-536">[536]</a></sup> 'I have heard it said that, with previous rulers, the imprints of the wheels of their chariots never left the palace threshold; and that was to prevent untoward incidents. The present monarch is the son-in-law of the previous ruler. At first he was the supreme commander of the troops. On the death of the father-in-law, his [the father-in-law's] daughter stole the golden sword [of state] and brought it to her husband. The true son and heir was deprived of his succession. He plotted to raise troops, but the new ruler heard about it, cut off his toes and kept him in a secrete chamber. A sliver of sacred iron has been inserted in the body of the new ruler, so that he is invulnerable to knives and arrows which may strike his body. Assured of this, the new ruler dares leave his palace. I have spent more than a year in the country, and have seen him go out for or five times. When the sovereign goes out, troops are at the head of the procession. After them come the standard bearers, the flag-bearers, and the musicians. Just the palace women, numbering between three and five hundred, in clothes with floral designs, flowers in their hair, holding candles in their hands, form a battalion. Even in the broad daylight they light their tapers. Then come the palace maidens carrying the gold and silver royal utensils and a whole panoply of ornaments, all very special; I do not know their purpose. Then come the female palace guards holding in their hands lances and shields; they too form a section by themselves. Next come carts drawn by goats and horses, all decorated in gold. The ministers and the princes are all mounted on elephants. In from of them one can see from afar their innumerable red parasols. After them come the kings wives and concubines, in palanquins, chariots, on horseback, and on elephants; they have certainly more than a hundred parasols flecked with gold. Behind them comes the sovereign himself, standing on an elephant and holding in his hand the precious sword [of state]. The tusks of the elephants are also sheathed in gold. [Around him] are more than twenty white parasols flecked with gold and with gold handles. Numerous elephants surround him, and there are more troops to protect him. If the sovereign goes to a place nearby, he only uses gold palanquins, carried by palace women. Most frequently, the king on leaving goes to see a small gold tower in which there is a golden Buddha [statue]. Those who see the king must crouch down and touch their heads on the ground; this is what is called the sanba [san-pa]; otherwise, they are seized by the procession organisers who do not let them go for nothing.'<sup id="cite_ref-537" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-537">[537]</a></sup></dd>

'Procession of Suryavarman II (S Gallery, W section). In contrast to Angkor Wat's other bas-reliefs, this 94m-long military procession has an historical basis, as it shows King Suryavarman II, the temple's builder, and his army. It begins at the W edge, with two registers: the upper is a royal audience before the army sets off, in the lower a procession. 10m from the start, on the upper register, is the kind, seated (in keeping with his rank, larger than any other figure). Below, princesses and ladies of the court are carried on palanquins. On the other side of the king are his ministers and army commanders, and after the audience they rise and leave, descending steps to rejoin the army. From here to the end, the army marches in a single register, its 20 commanders riding war elephants, their rank identified by the number of parasols and name identified in small inscriptions.'<sup id="cite_ref-546" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-546">[546]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ oath of allegiance ♥</b> 'In total, 28 kings ruled over this vast and powerful empire for over 600 years. Although in theory kingship was hereditary and monarchs were devarajas, or god-kings, in practice usurpers were common enough, the qualification being that they had to prove they were blood descen- dents of Jayavarman II, the founder of Angkor. It was for this reason that dignitaries and military leaders were required to swear an oath of loyalty to the reigning king, on pain of horrible punishments. One such oath is recorded in an inscription translated by Coedès, and promises eternal punishment in hell if it is broken. As the writers Mabbett and Chandler remarked, although Angkorean society was hier- archical, the fact of usurpation indicates that the rulers were not ‘worshipped as gods and given unquestioning obedience by all their subjects’. The extraordinary security measures described by Zhou Daguan above attest to this.'<sup id="cite_ref-627" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-627">[627]</a></sup> '"933 śaka, the ninth day of the crescent moon of Bhadrapada, Sunday. Here is (our) oath: We all who belong to the division of the tamrvāc of the first (second, second, third, fourth) category, swear, cutting our hands and offering our lives and our devotion gratefully and unerringly, to His Majesty Śrī Sūryavarman, who has enjoyed the legitimate monarchy since 924 śaka, in the presence of the sacred Fire, of the holy Jewel of the Brahmans and the ācāryas. We will not revere any other sovereign; we will not be hostile to him, we will not comply with his enemies; we will not commit any act which might do him harm. All these acts which are the fruit of our grateful devotion towards His Majesty Śri Sūryavarman, we will endeavour to accomplish. In case of war we will strive to fight with all our hearts, not to bind ourselves to life; by devotion (to the king) we will not run away from combat. If, in times of no war, we die of disease, may we obtain the reward of people devoted to their master. If our existence remains in the service of the king, when the time to die (in service) arrives, we will do it in devotion....." K. 292 (1011 CE) [...] The above oath of allegiance made to Sūryavarman I by 4,000 members of the taṃrvāc corps from 200 different sruk was formulated to affirm that their loyalty was wholly and willingly to their revered king. The inscription conveys a notion of a king with absolute power.'<sup id="cite_ref-628" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-628">[628]</a></sup> 'TELAGABATU. Name of a seventh-century inscription found at Sabukingking, Palembang, south Sumatra, erected by the ruler of Srivijaya. It was meant to be used in a ceremony in which water was poured over the heads of seven nagas carved at the top of the stone, flowed over the words carved below, and drained into a trough with a spout at the bottom. The inscription says that if anyone drank “im- precation water” and then broke the oath of loyalty the text contains, he would be poisoned by the water of the curse. The practice of “drinking oaths” was common in Southeast Asia until recent times. The inscription reads in part as follows: Om! Success! . . . All of you, as many as you are—sons of kings, . . . chiefs, army commanders, confidants of the king, judges, surveyors of groups of workmen, surveyors of low castes, cutlers, . . . clerks, sculp- tors, naval captains, merchants, . . . and you—washermen of the king and slaves of the king—all of you will be killed by the curse of this im- precation; if you are not faithful to me, you will be killed by the curse. . . . However, if you are submissive, faithful and straight to me and do not commit these crimes, an immaculate tantra will be my recom- pense. You will not be swallowed with your children and wives. . . . [E]ternal peace will be the fruit produced by this curse which is drunk by you. (condensed from a translation by J. G. de Casparis). Other versions of the same oath have been found at Karangber- ahi, far upstream in modern Jambi; at Kota Kapur, Bangka Island; and at two sites in the province of Lampung at the south end of Sumatra.

<p><b>♠ Private property (land) ♣ present ♥</b>  “In many instances the donor family rather than the temple staff managed family land assigned to a temple, the temple receiving only a designated share of the income. What was transferred by donors was not 'ownership' of land, but the right to income from land. Control over labour and production rather than ownership of land was critical for the development of early Southeast Asian states. To Khmer elites, 'landholding' meant rights to the production and labour service of the inhabitants of a parcel of land rather than absolute possession of it. In land donations to temples, only certain rights over the land were transferred; while inhabitants of the assigned land normally continued to farm the land, the recipient temple collected much or all of their production. Donated property was usually subject to a combination of claims, those of the temple receiving the donation as well as those of the donor's family, who retained certain personal rights to the property—for example, the right to a share of the land's production as well as administrative or political rights over the inhabitants.” <sup id="cite_ref-696" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-696">[696]</a></sup> Donors had property rights.

A total of 12,460 people lived within the walls of the temple compound. The sum of rice consumed annually was thus 2,512,406 kilograms, of which only 366,800 kilograms were delivered by villages assigned to the temple and 42,157 kilograms from royal storehouses, together covering less than one-fifth of the temple's rice consumption.” <sup id="cite_ref-702" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-702">[702]</a></sup> Note: Example is from an earlier period, but only two years before start of polity.</dd>

<p><b>♠ Rulers are legitimated by gods ♣ present ♥</b> 'Since the emergence of Theravada Buddhism as the dominant religious tradition, the Cambodian king has been regarded as “one who has merits” (neak mean bon), a notion connected to the doctrine of karma, which sees present worldly merit as the result of the accumulation of beneficial deeds in previous existences. Kingship was largely hereditary, yet the practice of primogeniture was not always applied. It seems that “election” of a new king by a committee of royal family members, senior officials, and monks probably predates the modern period (Osborne 1973, 169). In the Theravada ideology of kingship the right to rule is a consequence of spiritual maturity. From this perspective, the prerogatives of the king, once appointed, may not easily be challenged by thisworldly considerations, such as political expediency. The king also possesses the power to “master the earth spirits” (Forest 1980, 57). Therefore he may bend the forces of nature to his will. In this way rain will fall at the correct time, good harvests are guaranteed, and calamity is avoided. The king’s possession of a set of powerful fetish weapons, most likely fashioned toward the end of the Angkorian period (Boisselier 1966, 357), reinforced this supernatural authority.<sup id="cite_ref-730" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-730">[730]</a></sup>  'There was a watershed, dated to the year 802, whereby a series of competing polities were joined into one enduring and powerful central state. This transition involved a process of contralization instituted by the overlord Jayavarman II (ruled 802 to 834). Jayavarman seems to have identified a means of unifying formerly competing overlords that was rooted first in military conquest, then by placing his followers in positions of authority. This had the effect of establishing a central rule through replacing independent polities by provinces. He also must have appreciated the importance of stressing the mystical properties of kingship by instituting the cult of the kamraten jagat ta raja, meaning "the god who is king." Deification of the ruler, linked with vesting the rights to consecrate a new god-king in successive members of a given family, meant that the succession should be assured. Remarkably, the ensuing five centuries witnessed a considerable degree of legitimacy in the succession, being largely confined to members of the aristocratic lineage of Aninditapura.'<sup id="cite_ref-731" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-731">[731]</a></sup> 'In the Angkor Cambodia realm, a symbolic ‘‘Mount Mahendra/Meru’’ temple mountain became the ritual home of the devaraja in the cult of Jayavarman II in the early ninth century—a cult that inclusively incorporated and subordinated worship of local deities to the king’s worship of Siva (see chapter 6). As the traditional abode of ancestor spirits, mountains were already considered sacred by indigenous tradition. By patronizing the external god Siva, who was known in Indian philosophy as the Lord of the Mountains and for his association with fertility, the kings reinforced their local stature. It remained for Cambodian kings to link themselves ritually with this mountain, the domicile of the ancestors and Siva, and thereby make a profound statement about their ability to guarantee the flow of life-power from the realm of the ancestors—and Siva—to their subjects.'<sup id="cite_ref-732" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-732">[732]</a></sup>

Ambrosia also meant prosperous times, ample food, and well-deserved rest after the rigours of labour in the fields or construction sites.

Consequently, Buddhism’s ethical system emerged resting squarely on a body of preestablished forms of family practice, and supported by a fairly codified sociolegal system that had already taken form under the aegis of the Brahmanical tradition, sometime before the sixth-century bce. Thus, as a relatively late arriver, Buddhism accepted, tacitly, many of the given forms of social praxis in India. And, even when Buddhism sought to redefine religious goals and family values, these efforts were manifested vis-a-vis patterns that had already been in place for centuries.

<p><b>Supernatural Enforcement of Morality</b>
</p>
<dl><dd>For this section, include any type of supernatural punishment or reward either in this lifetime (e.g., curses, good fortune) or in the afterlife (e.g., hell, reincarnation). This includes generalized impersonal punishment/reward (e.g., karma, mana) as well as punishment by specific supernatural beings. Include specific details of the nature and extent of punishment/reward in the description. Code “compound” moral actions (e.g., filial piety = kin + respect) in multiple categories as necessary. Morality categories are based on Moral Foundations Theory (Haidt &amp; Graham, 2007) and Morality-As-Cooperation theory (Curry, 2016).</dd>
<dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement against harm ♣ present ♥</b> “The heart of Buddhist spiritual life, whether lay or monastic, is puṇya (Pali puñña ). This term is usually translated as ‘merit’ and refers to certain significant kinds of action that are regarded as auspicious and potent deeds. Essentially, merit is good ‘karma’ ( karman/kamma)&nbsp;: wholesome ( kuśla/kusala ) deeds which plant seeds that bear fortunate and pleasant fruits, whether in this life or lives to come, and thereby create conditions for further meritorious action in the future.

<dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of in-group loyalty ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> “As mentioned before, the development of a loving mind towards all beings, whether friend or foe, is the aim of one of the meditative practices of early Buddhism (see above p. 53f ). In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsāric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f ). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21).” <sup id="cite_ref-794" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-794">[794]</a></sup> “[...] Buddhism maintained a fairly flexible posture vis-a-vis competing religions and never sought to require laity to identify themselves exclusively as Buddhist or to rely singularly on the Buddhist clergy for all their spiritual needs.” <sup id="cite_ref-795" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-795">[795]</a></sup></dd>

Some texts affirm that even killing in self-defence, or in defence of family or friends, is wrongful, and in general an attitude of non-resistance in the face of violence is commended. The commentary to the Dhammapada relates how on one occasion when the Buddha's kinsmen, the Sakyas, were under attack, they allowed themselves to be slaughtered rather than break the First Precept.

With this personage, who was not necessarily connected with the client's territory, there were mutual obligations: the client owed the patron deference, and respect, services, occasional labour, and the usual small gifts, while the latter gave aid and protection (even legal) to the freeman and accommodation when he had to travel to the capital.

The dominant Khmer kinship pattern is one that has confused outsiders for many decades. Because the Brahmin ritual office of Purohita was passed matrilineally from a man to his sister’s son and much was made of this inheritance pattern, some outsiders have assumed that all Khmer kinship was based on matrilineal descent. This idea has not been borne out by research, which clearly indicates no organized kin groupings beyond the nuclear family such as exist in any lineage system; all individuals recognize both their mother’s and father’s relatives equally. Each individual shares rights and responsibilities with a bong p’on or circle of relatives gained through bilateral descent and marriage.

The ruling elites owed their position to birthright and the lower orders by and large accepted their status as natural, particularly as it was closely bound up with the religious idea of one’s station in this life being a reward or punishment for deeds in past lives. Liberty was an alien condition beyond the social imagination, without words to express it, although some ‘plebeian’ revolts do appear to have broken out before being brutally suppressed. The doctrine of reincarnation at least held out the promise of better luck next time, if one had lived an honest, obedient and virtuous life. As we shall see, life for the common people and slaves was onerous indeed and legends such as the Churning of the Sea of Milk gave hope to the downtrodden. This legend, depicted on the bas-reliefs of Angkor Wat, shows lines of people pulling a rope backwards and forwards, looped around a pole which is resting on the back of Kurma the tortoise. The aim of the exercise was to recover lost objects from the sea, foremost of which was ambrosia, the gift of immortality. Ambrosia also meant prosperous times, ample food, and well-deserved rest after the rigours of labour in the fields or construction sites. The strict stratification of Khmer society was reflected in the division of the common people themselves into different categories; the knum who were bound to the monasteries, temples and religious orders; the peasants or the soldier-builder-farmer class; and slaves.'<sup id="cite_ref-851" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-851">[851]</a></sup> 'In addition both Buddhist beliefs about attaining merit through avoiding telling lies, stealing, drinking alcohol, or killing and beliefs in supernatural retribution in the form of illness or other misfortune also kept most Khmers within the bounds of acceptable community behavior. Today such informal community sanctions have been joined by a bureaucratic police and judicial system, but among rural Khmers informal methods of social control and dealing with infractions remain more common and popular.'<sup id="cite_ref-852" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-852">[852]</a></sup> 'Ponchaud links this to differences in prior religious out-look.

For Ponchaud, both of these ideas contribute to a Khmer tendency toward violent and exemplary punishment, in the hope that this might mitigate future torments. After hearing many reports from refugees, he concluded that “one cannot help observing a certain complicity between the executioner and his victims, each of them accepting the tragic rules of the game by which they were governed” (Ponchaud, 1990, 236).'<sup id="cite_ref-853" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-853">[853]</a></sup> 'In his pioneering work on Buddhism in Cambodia, Leclere (1899, 399-400) distinguishes four categories of monastery slave: those condemned for an act of sacrilege (pol preah), prisoners of war (komlas preah), those donated by their masters (bamros preah), and individuals who had taken the role voluntarily (nhom preah), perhaps as a penance. Children born to monastery slaves would generally become slaves in their turn (Leclere 1890, 279). Monks could also become pagoda slaves if found guilty of committing a variety of offenses, including killing and stealing sacred objects. For fornication, adultery, incest, bestiality, administering a drug to bring about an abortion, falsely claiming to have achieved various spiritual powers, plus a number of other heinous offenses, the monk was obliged to become a slave in a royal monastery (Leclere 1890, 241-242).'<sup id="cite_ref-854" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-854">[854]</a></sup> 'Slavery flourished in Post-Classic Cambodia, until abolished by the French. Most slaves (khnum) seem to have fallen into this condition through debt, along with their families, and many sold themselves to avoid poverty. Hereditary slaves seem to have been somewhat fewer, although even the Buddhist pagodas could possess such underfortunates, donated to the monasteries by pious laymen. The reverse could also take place: some the Middle Khmer inscriptions in Angkor Wat describe the manumission of khnum as 'meritorious acts', with individuals or even entire families being freed in this way; this might be conditional, though, for instance committing the former slaves to enter the service of the monastery.'<sup id="cite_ref-855" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-855">[855]</a></sup></dd></dl>

The inscriptions indicate that they were seen as incapable of breaking religious laws, and they were the source of all legal power in the empire. The law itself was administered via a hierarchy of courts and legal officials. The lower courts dealt with routine matters, but the royal court itself could deal with even the pettiest of matters. Zhou Daguan records that every day the king held two audiences, for which no agenda was provided and which could be attended by both ‘functionaries and ordinary people’ for the adjudication of disputes. The inscriptions show that commoners could bring lawsuits against one another and a common method of ascertaining who was in the wrong was to place the plaintiff and the accused in stone towers for a period of three to four days. It was held that the person in the wrong would always develop an illness, such as catarrh, fever or ulcers. The penalties for convicted malefactors were often draconian. For the gravest crimes the punishment was death, possibly by decapitation with a sharp sword, as in the 19th century, but it was possible for felons to be buried alive.'<sup id="cite_ref-856" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-856">[856]</a></sup></dd>
