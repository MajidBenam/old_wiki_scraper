<dl><dd>During the New Kingdom, the Egyptian king acquired the title of 'pharaoh', meaning 'great house'.

<p>"There was a distinct heirarchy of settlements. The cities were Memphis, Thebes and (later) Pi-Ramesse. Elsewhere, in any given region, the provincial capital was usually the most important administratively and probably the largest in population. It was surrounded by a zone of fairly large and densely concentrated villages (interspersed by rare towns intermediate in administrative function (and size?) between the villages and the capital. Unfortunately, it is impossible to equate this hierarchy with any certainty to Egyptian nomenclature; 'cities', 'towns' and 'villages' (respectively niwt, dmi and whyt) were distinguished from each other, but the terms appear to be used with great looseness. Slightly less ambiguous are smaller units, such as 'nobleman's estate' (bhm) and 'house (hamlet? of X' ('tnx)."<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup>

<dl><dd> "We note, that the interrogation of local urban officials takes place in the bureau of the vizier ... It is evident, that interrogations and hearings of urban authorities entailed their journeying to the seat of the vizier: for the vizier, a perfect means of exercising effective control over his urban officials. For the functionaries involved, the possibility of being called back to the residence-city meant a check on possibile irregularities, also support for their local politics in having the opportunity to consult the vizier and knowing that they were backed. On the practical side, it entailed a great deal of traveling. Moreover, it presupposes a local apparatus managing affairs in their absence."<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup></dd>
<dd> The knbty n w was the "'councillor of the district' the official responsible for the rural district. As Luft aply remarks ... these officials are apparently treated as members of a collective of officials, as members of a knbt, instead of being treated as individual officials with an individual title. It would seem possible, therefore, to assume the existence of an overall 'council of the district(s)' in which these officials were group as a separate echelon of the local government (parallel to the 'urban authorities'?) or perhaps according to some geographical principle. At present, there seems to be no evidence for the existence of such a council. ... he has definite and direct ties to the vizier and his executive departments ... This would seem to contradict the viewpoint held by Helck to the effect that the councillor of the district was subordinate to the mayor ... He is known to have at his disposal a 'bodyguard' and a scribe ... they clearly operate on their own behalf, independent from the mayor, as representatives of their own administrative area."<sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup> <i>knbty n w mainly Middle Kingdom but also early New Kingdom<sup id="cite_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup></i></dd></dl>

<dl><dd>  "We want to stress that the vizier apparently does not pronounce a verdict on the dispute itself. He only orders a re-assessment to be carried out by the local officials in charge and stipulates its duration. Therefore, the petitioner's request is not for a trial or re-trial, his appeal is concerned with obtaining legal permission for a re-assessment by the local authorities. Ultimately, the matter will be settled locally."<sup id="cite_ref-129" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-129">[129]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Opet ♥</b> "The processions of images of the holy family of Thebes and of other sanctified beings (including statues of kings of olden times) setting forth from the huge brightly painted temples, and making their slow progress along formally arranged avenues with carefully stage-managed halts at intermediate way-stations, and the occasional excitement of a 'miracle': all this brought to the city as a whole spectacle and munificence which regularly reinforced the physical and economic dominance of the temples. And for the greatest of the festivals the king came to Thebes in person to be at the centre, and to absorb some of the power that the occasion generated. "This most important of festivals was the Festival of Opet. It came round every year, in the second month of the season of Inundation. In the mid-18th Dynasty it lasted for eleven days. By the end of the reign of Rameses III in the 20th it had been lengthened to no less than twenty-seven days. At that time at Medinet Habu the festival was celebrated by the distribution of 11,341 loaves, 85 cakes, and 385 jars of beer. The core of the festival was an unusually long procession of images of the holy family of Thebes. The route lay between Karnak itself and the temple of Luxor (Figure 97, p. 266). In the time of Hatsheput the outward journey was made by land, using the newly built southward extension of courts and pylons at Karnak, pausing at six way-stations, whilst the return journey was by river. By the late 18th Dynasty both the outward and the return journeys were being made by river. Each of the deities travelled in a separate barge, towed by smaller boats and by gangs of men on the bank, who could include high court officials, hauling on ropes. It was one of the occasions when the public could present pleas to the gods before their portable barques, and before colossal <i>ka</i>-statues of the king (see below for the meaning of <i>ka</i> [divine essence - EC]). Detailed scenes of the processions, depicting also the soldiers, dancers and musicians who followed the progress of the barges from the bank, were carved on the walls of Luxor temple, the destination of the festival. "[...] The procession of the Opet Festival took the king to the temple. Leaving the crowds outside he entered and proceeded in the company of priests to the enlcosed chambers at the back. There, in a charges incense-laden atmosphere and the mystic presence of the god Amun (and his ithyphallic manifestation Amun-Min), the king and his <i>ka</i> were merged, and the king's person transformed. When the king reappeared, he did so miraculously transformed into a divine being, 'Foremost of all the living <i>Kas</i>.' His reappearance in public freshly transfigured was the real climax, the moment of cheering which implied that the miracle had worked and had been accepted as having worked." <sup id="cite_ref-335" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-335">[335]</a></sup> The following relates to festivals more generally: "Commoners could participate by witnessing a sacred performance, by communing with the gods through prayer and oracles, or simply by singing, dancing, and feasting. For ordinary Egyptians, festivals were a time of sensory stimulation through sound movements, scents, and the nervous anticipation of being in the company of the divine. Festivals were community affairs, a time for the residents of a village or town to abandon their daily tasks and come together in celebration. [...] Their repeated commemoration was part of the rhythm of life, providing security through predictability. This was particularly true of the celebrations marking the renewal of the king (such as the Opet or the Decade Festival), which symbolized the victory of order over chaos. [...] "Festivals also served to bolster state control and promote royal ideology. [...] The Opet and Sed (jubilee) festivals specifically commemorated the renewal of the king's power. [...]. "Festivals presented logistical and economic challenges. They required huge amounts of bread, beer, wine, and precious incense, and the preparation for the larger festivals involved massive mobilization of people and resources. If the king was to attend, the additional needs of the members of the royal court had to be met. This apparently meant that citizens could be subject to an unreasonable requisitioning of supplies. The Edict of Hormheb (Dynasty 18) expressly forbade the 'agents of the queen's estate' from harassing the 'local mayors, oppressing them and searching for the [supplies] for the trip downstream ... each year during the [festival of Opet].' According to the decree, 'The agents of the royal quarters would approach the mayors saying 'give the supplies which are lacking for the journey, for look, pharaoh is making the trip to the festival of Opet.'" <sup id="cite_ref-336" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-336">[336]</a></sup></dd>

<p><b>♠ Name ♣ Khoiak ♥</b> "Osiris, the primary deity of the dead and the legendary first ruler of Egypt, was a god who symbolized eternal rebirth through the story of his own resurrection. His festival was celebrated in the fourth month of inundation, from the twelfth to the thirtieth day, when the Nile receded and crops began to sprout - a potent natural symbol of resurrection. The festival is known as Khoiak, after the name of the month in which it was celebrated. It is known from Middle Kingdom texts (the Ikhernofert stela and texts of King Neferhotep) and from a great number of private stelae and Middle Kingdom monuments from Abydos. Though we lack the overall 'script' for the festival, because the earlier records refer only to isolated events, later records, including Roman-era texts from the walls of the rooftop chapels of the Temple of Hathor at Dendera (Fi. 21), provide a fuller account of the Khoiak festival. "[...] "Unlike the localized Opet or Decade festivals, which were celebrated only in Thebes, the Khoiak Festival was celebrated throughout the country. The broad geographic spread of the festivities commemorated the dispersal of the parts of Osiris's body across all parts of Egypt. [...] "The festival had two major components, both of which provided opportunities for public participation. The first part of the festival was a dramatic reenactment of the death and resurrection of Osiris and the defeat of his foes. This was performed before the public, much like a Christian passion play. [...] The religious drama followed a set script, laid down on a papyrus scroll that kings could cite to prove the authenticity of the festivals they held.  [...] The second aspect of the festival was the manufacture, procession, and ceremonial internment of Osiris figurines. New images of Osiris, his ennead (the eight gods associated with him), and the jackal god Wapwawet were made, and sacred boats, sledges, and shrines were constructed to convey the divine statues through the necropolis. "During the festival, the king was supposed to play the role of Horus, the faithful son who avenged the murder of Osiris. However, Middle Kingdom accounts indicate that the king appointed a surrogate to represent him during the festival, just as the First Priest of the god acted on behalf of the king in daily temple rituals (see Chapter 3). At Abydos, the priests claim to have played the role of deities, but we do not know whether they donned costumes or simply stood as representatives of the gods. Some parts of the ritual enactment took place in the temple to which the public had no access. Other parts took place where the gathered crowds could watch and participate. "The festival began with the arrival of the royal delegation. Within the dark confines of the Osiris Temple, a priest offered myrrh, wine, and other 'divine products' to 'Osiris, in all his identities.' The official Ikhernofert claimed that within the temple of the statue of Osiris was embellished with lapis, turquoise, gold, and 'all precious stones' and was clothed with garments. The statue was then placed in a new naos of gold, silver, copper, <i>sesnedjem</i>-wood, and cedar. Construction of the naos and of the god's boat was overseen by Ikernofert himself. "These preliminary acts complete, the procession set out from the temple and made itself visible to the waiting throngs. It set out through the necropolis, led by the statue of Wepwawet (especially appropriate, because his name means 'Opener of the Ways'), who acted as the protector of the gods. Dramatic tension was fueled by a reenactment of the attack on Osiris by the company of Seth, which retold the story of Osiris's murder on 'the sandbanks of Nedit.' [...] One can imagine the screams and groans from the assembled onlookers as the two factions clashed and Osiris was slain. As in passion plays, this sequence always concluded with the triumph of good, as the priest representing Horus defeated Seth's company. In his speech of victory, he proclaimed: 'I avenged Wennofer (Osiris) on that day of great fighting, and I felled all his enemies in the sandbanks of Nedit.' "The victory of Horus was followed by a 'great procession' simulating the sorrowful funeral of Osiris. [...] "Once at the tomb of Osiris, participants enacted the funeral rites and recited an invocation to Re - 'Come down to me!' - to bring the life-giving forces of the sun back to the dead god. Several references to dancing suggest that some of the ritual dance, perhaps to celebrate the victories of Horus and Thoth, was performed. Finally, the procession returned to the Osiris Temple, and the statue of the god was restored to its shrine. "The public participated in the festivals of Osiris through their observation of the procession presented during Khoiak but also in more personal and intimate ways, especially through the creation and manipulation of images of the mummiform god. [...] "Some of these figurines were made during the Khoiak Festival, kept for a year, and then ritually buried, whereas others became a part of an individual's funerary equipment." <sup id="cite_ref-388" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-388">[388]</a></sup>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ daily offering ♥</b> "The daily offering ritual was performed in every functioning temple three times a day, in imitation of human meal times. [...] The offering ritual is known from the Old Kingdom, from the Pyramid Texts and the economic records of Neferirkare at Abu Sir, and it continued to be the essential temple ritual throughout Egyptian history. "The ritual consisted of the physical maintenance of the god, followed by the presentation of food and drink. All ritual actions were made in the name of the king, and it is he who is shown in the temple reliefs, although in reality a priest acted in his stead. Each morning as the sun rose, the temple staff would assemble for duty. The daily ritual involved a variety of ranks of priests - <i>wabs</i>, lector priests, and God's Fathers are specifically mentioned. The Chief Priest would be specially purified in a section of the temple called the <i>per duat</i> or 'the house of morning.' There, he washed his body with water, was purifed with incense, and rinsed his mouth with natron. Texts record, 'There was performed for him all ceremonies that are performed for the king,' transforming him from a priest into a proper surrogate for the king. He then joined the other priests, who had also undergone purification. They gathered the materials needed for the ritual and proceeded to the temple's sanctuary. Before entering, they began a series of recitations that accompanied their preparations - the utterance for lighting the fire; the utterances for taking the incense, putting the brazier on the censer, and putting incense on the fire; and, finally, the 'utterance for advancing to the holy place.' The sense that the ritual was in theory performed by the king is evidence in the Chief Priest's first ritual words: 'It is the king who sends me.' "Each step of the ritual was highly symbolic, referred to mythic events, and was accompanied by a set liturgy. To begin the ritual, the priest awakened the god who slept in the sealed shrine. Holding a candle, he entered the sanctuary, chanting, 'Awake in peace! May your awakening be peaceful!' He broke the seals of the door bolts of the shrine, and drew back the bolts - an action that was equated with removing the fingers of Seth from the eye of Horus. The priest then 'opened the sight of the god' as he swung open the doors of the shrine, and he 'kissed the ground,' prostrating himself before the god's shrine. Each ritual step was punctuated with a specific recitation and an offering of incense and adoration of the deity. In preparation for removing the god from his shrine, the priest scattered pure white sand on the floor of the sanctuary, symbolizing the mound of creation from which all life sprang. He then recited a liturgy for 'Laying Hands Upon the God,' and removed the statue from the shrine, placing it on the sand. After more purifications, the priest removed the deity's outer linen garments and jewelry and wiped away the unguents from the previous day's ritual. Once the statue was suitably cleansed, the priest offered the god lengths of red, white, and green cloth that symbolized the blood of Isis, the uraeus, and fertility. This was followed by the presentation of green and black eye cosmetics. The god was adorned with bracelets, a broad collar, and anklets, and given the appropriate scepters and headdress. The statue was then wrapped in his 'great garment', probably a linen wrapper such as those that were found with the divine statues in the tomb of Tutankhamun. "Now fully awakened and ready for the day, the god was presented with flowers, food, and drink. Economic texts specify that the food offerings consisted of grain, vegetables, wine, and cuts of meat and fowl. When the god was considered to be done, an interval that is not specified in the texts, the food was taken away and the god was readied for sleep. After further purifications, the god was returned to his shrine, the doors closed and seal. As a final ritual, the king performed the 'Bringing of the Foot,' in which he grasped a broomlike <i>had</i>-plant and backed out of the sanctuary, sweeping his footprints from the room. This procedure not only left the sanctuary in good order, but, it was believed, also prevented evil from approaching the god, presumably by following the footprints of the priest-king. "A version of this ritual was repeated at midday and in the evening. The evidence for how elaborate these other two daily rituals were is inconclusive, but it is clear that the morning service was the most complete. The evening service may have been essentially food offerings, but the shrine was not opened, and the activity took place in the antechamber rather than directly before the god." <sup id="cite_ref-426" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-426">[426]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Feast of the Valley ♥</b> "The 'Beautiful Feast of the Valley' was celebrated only in Thebes (Map 2). [...] "The Feast of the Valley was observed once a year, on the first day of the second month of summer in conjunction with the appearance of the new moon. It lasted for two days. The first record of the feast dates to Dynasty 11. The festival was most popular in the New Kingdom, the Ramesside Period, and Dynasties 25-26, but there are references to the festival as late as 117 BC during the reign of Ptolemy VIII. By that time, however, the festival had likely changed character, taking on more Osirian overtones. [...] "The focus of the festival was the parade of statues portraying the gods and deceased royalty (Plate VIII). [...]  The procession, led by the king, was accompanied by throngs of priests who carried the great fans signifying the presence of the deity and by huge crowds of locals. [...] "Graffiti note that priests watched for the procession from the heights of the west bank. It must have been an exciting and prestigious duty, for some of the priests recorded that they stood lookout for several years in a row. One the flotilla was spotted, mobs of people who lived on the west bank joined the crowd that had followed the procession from the east. Everyone was dressed in his or her finest white linen clothing, clutching flowers and food offerings as they greeted the 'divine arrival' as it moored on the west bank. "[...] People crowded around the pageant clamoring for a view of the gods. One can imagine the roadways and canals of the west bank lined with people laden with bouquets of flowers and baskets of offerings, and crying out in honor of the gods. "[...] "During the first day of the festival, the procession wound its way through the necropolis. The musicians and onlookers made - intentionally - a lot of noise, for according to the texts, those buried in the western necropolis harkened to the sound of the procession. The clamor enlivened them and caused them to emerge from their tombs to see Amun and to meet with their families. "During the festival, priests could participate by carrying the divine boat or walking alongside it, holding the broad fans that announced the divine presence. A much larger number of ordinary people took part as well, by observing the procession and enacting rituals at the family tombs. For them, the most important aspect of the Feast of the Valley was the sensual communion between the living and the dead that took place at the tombs. "[...] The properties of smell, sound, and taste were thought to be capable of transcending the barrier between life and death to reach the deceased and bring him or her into the celebration. These senses were further stimulated by copious amounts of beer and wine, which created an ecstatic state and brought the living closer to he dead. The revelers called on Hathor, addressing her as the 'Lady of Drunkenness.' The families encouraged each other: 'For your <i>ka</i>! Drink the intoxicating drink! Celebrate a beautiful day ... may your heart be refreshed in your house [i.e., tomb].' "The necropolis was filled with activity, noise, smells, and music. Fueled by alcohol and the excitement of the festival, the living recited hymns to their ancestors' statues to encourage the spirits of the deceased to enliven them; 'Emerge from the earth! Behold Ra and follow Amun in his beautiful Feast of the Valley!' The spirits were encouraged to join the procession: 'May you be in the crew of the royal boat and may you hear the clamor in the temples in wester Thebes. May you see Amun in the Beautiful Feast of the Valley and follow him to the temple precincts.' "Bands of musicians circulated through the necropolis visiting individual tombs. Women shook beaded necklaces (<i>menat</i>) and clanged their metallic rattles (sistra) (see Plate III) both instruments sacred to Hathor, while male musicians clapped and sang, creating a hypnotic rhythm that reverberated among the tombs. Their refrains continued into the night[...]" "The odor of food filled the necropolis. The dead were presented with fragrant roasted birds and meat. Sweet myrrh oil was poured on the meats, making the scents even more alluring. [...] "Another source of sensory stimulation was the enormous, fragrant bouquet of flowers, called an <i>ankh</i> (a pun on the word <i>ankh</i> that also means 'life'), that each family presented to its deceased ancestors (Plate X). [...] "All these rituals were enacted to produce an ecstatic union of the dead and the living - to bring the living into the realm of the dead and the dead back to the living." <sup id="cite_ref-466" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-466">[466]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Festival of Amuhotep I ♥</b> "Not all Egyptian festivals were celebrations of joy and rebirth. The festival of Amunhotep I, celebrated by the residents of Deir el Medina on the Theban west bank, commemorated the death of King Amunhotep I. It was a somber occasion, akin to the Shiite Muslim commemoration in the month of Muharram of the death of Imam Hussein. "Amunhotep I, the second king of Dynasty 18 (ca. 1526-1505 BC), was especially revered by the workmen of Deir el Medina. He had institited the state-supported organization of those workmen who, under his successor, Thutmose I, settled in the village of western Thebes. The festival of Amunhotep I is attested from the reign of Amunhotep III (ca. 1350 BC), and it continued as late as Dynasty 25. The festival started on the accession day of Thutmose I - the day his father, Amnuhotep, died. The festival lasted for four days, with each day dedicated to a different activity. Although the festival focused on the workmen and on their association with Amunhotep, the texts clearly indicate that the men's wives and children also took part. "On the first day of the festival, Amunhotep's statue was brought out of its shrine on the west bank to 'greet' the public. The next day was devoted to a feast in the necropolis. This was followed by a 'feast of meditation' as the residents of the village reflected on the deified king and his death. The last day was for the 'appearing' of the king; it was probably on this day that the statue was transported to the Valley of the Kings. Scenes of the procession show the statue being carried or dragged over the sand on a sledge pulled by four pairs of men; one of these wears a leopard-head ornament on his cloak. Two other priests, holding the large feather fans that indicated the divinity of the image, stand beside the statue. Other scenes show a larger procession made up of twelve men. "[...] "As the procession passed the onlookers, they struck their faces with their hands and wept, intoning: 'They make mourning for you oh, Amunhotep the one for whom it is blessed to weep!' Texts from Deir el Medina indicate that this was an official holiday for the workers, and they were issued special rations of cream and fat. As with the Feast of the Valley, copious amounts of beer and wine were consumed over the four days of the festival. "An important part of the festival was the consultation of the oracle of the deceased king (see Chapter 6). The close association of the villagers of Deir el Medina with Amunhotep made the deified king a trusted mediator of local disputes. In the community, the deceased king was referred to as 'the vizier who looks into hearts, whose abomination is falsehood.' The oracle of Amunhotep took the form of a statue of the king, and so - unlike most other oracles housed in shrouded shrines - Amunhotep's oracle was especially approachable. "The royal statue as oracle was used to determine administrative issues, such as the appointment of officials. In such a small community, the oracle may have been perceived as an impartial way of making such decisions." <sup id="cite_ref-507" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-507">[507]</a></sup></dd>

However, religious institutions became a powerful constraint on the executive in the subsequent Rammeside period of the New Kingdom. Another interpretation of the Armana revolution might be that it was an attempt by the Pharoah to wrest power away from the established religious institutions that had been growing in power (perhaps on a regional basis), and thereby refocus attention on the Pharoah.

<p><b>♠ Rulers are legitimated by gods ♣ present ♥</b> The ideology of state was a 'social contract' between the king and his subjects. This contract was, however, not one made between the ruler and the people (and e.g. enshrined in a written constitution); it was one signed with the gods. The king who failed to carry through his side of the contract would expect to lose favour with the gods. The people, for their part, could not legitimately rebel on their own evaluation of the king's performance; only given signs that the gods did not consider the king legitimate. "In the case of Ancient Egypt, the ideology of the state, promoted through religious, artistic and literary texts, was centred around the divine right of the king to secure the submission of his subjects to his royal will in return for their right to expect protection, subsistence and the preservation of Maat (order, justice, righteousness) in society."<sup id="cite_ref-718" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-718">[718]</a></sup> "The story of Thutmose IV's elevation to the kingship related by the Giza Sphinx Stele inscription has been interpreted in the past to suggest that he was not the legitimate heir, but it need tell us no more than the royal ideology often drew upon divine legitimization in the New Kingdom."<sup id="cite_ref-719" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-719">[719]</a></sup> "The form of this government was a unique quasi-divine kingship".<sup id="cite_ref-720" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-720">[720]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Rulers control supernatural energy ♣ present ♥</b> Rulers did not jealously control supernatural energy, but they were probably believed to control more of it than anyone else. regular worshippers could directly access deities in this period - if the trend from the Middle Kingdom to this effect was maintained. "The 'h-palace mst be intended as a holy locality as well as the temples because the Horus-king is the holder of religious and magical power. The 'h would have been the place where all the ceremonies connected to the transition of the magical power of the sun-god to the king were performed: here the king took over the role of Horus and was legitimated as his successor."<sup id="cite_ref-721" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-721">[721]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Rulers are descendants of gods ♣ present ♥</b> Amun, the god of Thebes, became "associated with the sun-god Ra and as Amun-Ra King of the Gods was worshipped in every major temple in Egypt, including Memphis. The king was the bodily son of Amun born from the union of the god with the queen mother in a sacred marriage that was ritually reenacted during the Opet Festival in Amun's temple at Luxor. During the great processions that formed part of this important festival, the king was publicly acclaimed as the earthly embodiment of Amun; thus the king and the god were intimately linked by a powerful amalgam of religious and political ties."<sup id="cite_ref-722" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-722">[722]</a></sup> However, Akhenaten worshipped a different sun-god whose title was: "The living one, Ra-Horus of the horizon who rejoices in the horizon in his identity of light which is in the sun-disc".<sup id="cite_ref-723" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-723">[723]</a></sup> "The Aten is the 'divine father' who rules Egypt as the celestial co-regent of his earthly incarnation, his son."<sup id="cite_ref-724" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-724">[724]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Rulers are gods ♣ present ♥</b> Amenhotep III (1390-1352 BCE) "took the idea of self-deification further than any previous pharaoh and was the first to present himself as a divine being during his lifetime.

</p><p><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of monogamy ♣ absent ♥</b> “Egyptian terminology for marriage and divorce reflects the informal and home-centered nature of the relationship. Phrases translated as “to marry” include “to establish a household” (grg pr), “to enter a household” (ʿq r pr n) and, in later periods, “to live together” (ḥms jrm) with someone. [...] Given the definitions of marriage in ancient Egyptian society, there was nothing inherent in the relationship to prevent polygamy—a man could, in theory, cohabit with more than one woman in pursuit of offspring. Polyandry, in which one woman has multiple husbands at the same time, is unattested. In practice, however, polygamy was uncommon outside of the royal family; cases of polygamy among nonroyals are uncommon and often ambiguous. The Egyptians tended toward multiple marriage in the form of serial monogamy rather than polygamy, since the ease and acceptance of divorce—as well as the mortality rate—made marriage and remarriage the most common pattern for individuals with multiple spouses. The infrequency of polygamy may also be a function of the expense of keeping additional wives and their children; the domestic dynamics of having multiple wives and the physical limitations of the home could also be limiting factors.

From the fact that he doesn’t provide specific dates, it seems reasonable to infer that Te Velde’s statement applies to the whole of Ancient Egyptian history. Unfortunately, Te Velde does not provide information regarding the specific categories of people that were deemed to be suitable for sacrifice, though he does express skepticism that this fate was reserved for prisoners of war: “Schulman believes that conquered enemies who were the prisoners of war of the victorious army on its return were ceremonially sacrificed as thank offerings. The Egyptians certainly condemned rebels to death and undoubtedly practiced war with sometimes barbaric methods. However, the regular killing of people during temple rituals is rather different to killing in the heat of battle or execution after a legal trial. For the time being, I believe that the rebels or enemies of the pharaoh were generally symbolically killed, for example in representations. [...] However, I do not want to imply that in the thousands of years of Egyptian history there were no instances when attitudes hardened, when men turned symbolism into reality and literally rather than symbolically sacrificed other men.” <sup id="cite_ref-778" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-778">[778]</a></sup>.

Four Nubians were almost certainly killed in connection with the burial of Mentuherkhepeshef. Furthermore, killing humans was likely a part of the tekenu rite. The tekenu rite was depicted in at least 26 burials in Thebes and el-Kab alone during this dynasty. Additionally, Amenhotep II and Tutankhamun almost certainly ritually slew enemies and hung them from the prows of their ships, and Thutmosis I possibly did the same. These total to at least nine people killed in this ritual. Moreover, more were slain by Amenhotep II at his accession. Finally, a ritual slaying also appears certain at Avaris, as a human became part of an execration rite. If all of these events actually occurred, then we know of at least 40 ritual sacrifices in the Eighteenth Dynasty. If Akhenaten’s slaying of prisoners of war was also performed in a ritual context, and if his numbers are reliable, then 225 more can be added to this tally. Furthermore, with three kings having slain prisoners for a water parade celebrating a victory over enemies, and four other rulers, two from this dynasty, depicting boats with smiting scenes on them, this was possibly a rite engaged in by all eighteenth-dynasty rulers.

<p><b>♠ Degree of taxation ♣ ♥</b> "Basically, every institution had two types of agrarian domains. In the terms of Gardiner (1948), these were: “non-apportioning” (presumably worked or supervised by the institution’s own personnel); and “apportioning,” or p(s)S (cultivated by other institutions or private individuals). The major part of the crops of apportioning fields was kept by the parties taking care of their cultivation, while a small part (varying between 7.5% and 15%) went to what Gardiner considered to be the owning institution. This institution, however, should rather be considered not as the “owner” but as having been entitled to tax received from the land (the percentage specified): apportioning fields were often in the hands of private individuals, who were the actual owners, and who yearly paid tax to the temple or government institution (Haring 1998). ... The people cultivating their own land and paying their tax to the royal treasury are there called nmH(y) (plural: nmHyw), a word originally meaning “orphan,” but which in the New Kingdom had acquired the additional meaning “free” or “private,” and referred to people who owned property, but were not among the higher state and temple officials (sr; plural: srw; for this opposition see Romer 1994: 412 - 451)."<sup id="cite_ref-941" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-941">[941]</a></sup> General reference: "Ancient Egypt imposed taxation in grain, with an overall tax rate of some 10 percent of total production, but higher on some classes of land."<sup id="cite_ref-942" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-942">[942]</a></sup> General reference: "The harvest tax, probably one of the earliest, was enforced by an official annual survey."<sup id="cite_ref-943" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-943">[943]</a></sup> "The payment of the state land tax in gold ... suggests an attempt at monetization."<sup id="cite_ref-944" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-944">[944]</a></sup> General reference: 1/10 (1 h3r per 10 h3r) cite: Baer 1962. 10% yield cite: Bowman 1986.<sup id="cite_ref-945" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-945">[945]</a></sup> "Levies were not based on how much an acre had produced that year, which would have encouraged farmers to hide part of the crop to lower their tax.
