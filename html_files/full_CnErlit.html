The archaeological remains of this Erlitou culture are now found scattered throughout southern Shanxi and north- western Henan and are dated to 1900-1350 B.C., coinciding in time and in space with the Xia dynasty as described in ancient texts. Was there a Xia dynasty? Present evidence suggests that there indeed was a Xia dynasty. That Sima Qian selected Xia from among many contemporary polities was probably because during the earliest part of the Chinese Bronze Age or the Three Dynasties period, Xia was most powerful.

Recent radiocarbon work using “wiggle-matching” techniques have dated the site between 1750 and 1520 BCE, reducing Erlitou site occupation to a mere 200 years, the last 50 or so years claimed to be under Shang occupation (Qiu, Cai and Zhang 2006).

<p><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ quasi-polity ♥ </b> "Erlitou, rather than being a departure, continued the third-millennium pattern of megasites, centering an expansive sphere of material cultural influence (Figure 2.1). At the same time, a number of features that were to become central to Central Plains Bronze Age elite traditions, such as a rectangular, walled “palace-temple” district; rammed earth monumental courtyard structures; and bronze ritual vessels, apparently made their first appearance at Erlitou (Figures 2.2-2.6). The Erlitou tradition, however, was not alone on the Mainland East Asian stage. The land between the Yellow and Yangtze rivers was home to a variety of local and regional ceramic and other material cultural traditions beyond those of Erlitou." <sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>
</p><p>"The political organization of the polity centered at Erlitou is unclear. Erlitou sat atop a settlement hierarchy of unknown size,48 and for perhaps a century, maybe less (1700-1600 BCE), it was the largest urban center in East Asia for which we have evidence (Shimao may overlap with the early phases of Erlitou; Sanxingui, with at least the late phases; and Yanshi and Zhengzhou were probably both major centers by the Erlitou phase IV). While the Erlitou ceramic tradition was widespread, the mechanisms of this expansion are probably only indirectly related to political activity (if pots don’t equal people, they are even less representative of conquering armies or “state” administrators). The degree of centralization, mechanisms of political control, and social organization can only be guessed at or extrapolated through comparison with Zhengzhou and Anyang. This comparison can justifiably be made insofar (and only insofar) as many of Erlitou’s elite cultural forms appear to be ancestral to those found at Zhengzhou and Anyang, from architecture, to symbols of status and implements of ritual.49 Nevertheless, as will be discussed in more detail later on, there are considerable qualitative and quantitative differences between Erlitou, Zhengzhou, and Anyang, making their comparison—and especially the derivation of the lesser known from the better known—a more complex problem than most have credited. Seen in regional context, if Erlitou has its civilizational sphere (Baines and Yoffee 1998; Allan 2007), it was not alone." <sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>

Currently available C14 samples date phase III of the Erlitou site—the period associated with the most notable evidence of the site’s prosperity—to c. 1610-1550 (or even 1530) calibrated years BC, while Erligang sites such as Zhengzhou (郑州) and Yanshi (偃师) date from c. 1600 BC (Zhang et al. 2007; Zhongguo 2003, pp. 659-663).

For example, among pottery vessel types, the ding and the dou are found in every region, often in large numbers, suggesting the wide distribution of a style of cooking formerly prevailing only in the Dawenkou and Daxi cultures. The perforated slate rectangular and semilunar knives represent another horizon marker, as do some pottery and jade art motifs that, as pointed out earlier, may reflect deeper substratal commonalities than recent contact. With the definition of "interaction spheres," for the first time we can discuss the issue of the name "China." I suggest that from this point on, as the regions with which we are concerned came to be joined together in archaeological terms and exhibit increasing similarities, the interaction sphere may be referred to as "Chinese."

This expansion is often said to have involved the aggressive conquering of faraway lands, along with the establishment of colonies crucial for the extraction and acquisition of particular resources that were essential for Erlitou’s functioning as a governing state (Liu 2004, pp. 232-234; Liu and Chen 2003)."<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup></dd>

The motive behind the expansion, they argue, was to produce copper, tin, lead, and salt for the core area's people and workshops. On balance, however, the evidence seems to favor something more modest, a polity confined to the Yilou basin, comparable in size to a large city-state in Mesopotamia or Mesoamerica."<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<p><b> ♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣ 4 ♥ </b> levels.

<dl><dd>1. Capital - Erlitou - 300 ha at maximum expansion
<dl><dd>2. Regional center
<dl><dd>3. Secondary center - Eg. Shaochau (60ha), Dashigu (50 ha)
<dl><dd>4. Small villages</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>"Archaeological fieldwork demonstrates that with the emergence of the Erlitou capital, quite a few new settlements appeared in the Luoyang basin centered around the Erlitou site. Larger sites are distributed at intervals, revealing a large, structured network of settlements. The Shaochai 稍柴 site (60ha) seems to be located in the eastern section of a vital communication route in the Luoyang basin. In addition to being a secondary center, the important functions of this settlement included protecting the capital and transferring resources (Chen Xingcan et al. 2003; Liu et al. 2004: 75-100). More than 20 sites dating to the Erlitou period (10-30 ha in size) have been found in the surrounding area. Some sites have remains of white pottery or ritual drinking vessels of delicate pottery. These other Erlitou period sites (including burials) are concentrated around Songshan 嵩山 (Mt Song), including the area from Zhengzhou to Luoyang, and the area from the Yinghe and Ruhe rivers to Sanmenxia city. The sites are all large or medium-sized settlements located in valleys and basins. They must have been regional centers in the core area of the Erlitou state (Nishie 2005). The city discovered at Dashigu 大师姑 (51ha), 70km east of the Erlitou site, might be a military town at the eastern edge of the Erlitou state territory, or the center of another polity (Zhengzhou Kaogusuo 2004). We can conclude that there was a four- tiered settlement hierarchy in the Erlitou culture consisting of a large capital settlement, regional centers, secondary centers, and numerous small villages. This settlement pattern is in sharp contrast to the Longshan settlement pattern in which various regional centers coexisted and competed for power." <sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup>
</p><p>"A four-tier regional settlement hierarchy appeared during the Erlitou period, signifying the domination of the Erlitou site (as the paramount center) over a state-level system with at least three levels of political control above ordinary villages (Liu and Chen 2003, following the definition by Wright 1977). [...] Criticism has been leveled at different elements of this reconstruction. [...] Even more substantially, the proposed four-tier regional settlement hierarchy model has been criticized as being based on subjective criteria (Peterson and Drennan 2011; see further below)." <sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup>
</p><p>"Likewise, Erlitou may very well have been at once a political capital, a ceremonial center, and a nexus of elite production. Unfortunately, information concerning spatial practices at Erlitou and other Bronze Age Chinese sites is fragmentary at best, and characterizations are necessarily somewhat crude and speculative on current evidence." <sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup>

Although important individuals could simply have been deputed to undertake specific responsibilities as needed, administering the realm would no doubt have required minimally defined bureaucratic positions with at least rudimentary authority. The early rulers presumably established a limited but basically effective core of officials under their direct control, a sort of working staff, with responsibility for crucial activities being broadly construed.

</p><p><b> ♠ Specialized government buildings ♣ {absent; present} ♥ </b> Historians and archaeologists appear to disagree about the function of excavated non-domestic Erlitou stuctures, proposing a range of uses from administration to communal gatherings and rituals.
</p><p>"A cluster of rammed-earth foundations enclosed by rammed-earth walls about 2 m in width situated more or less at the center of the site and known in the literature as the “palace city” or “palatial area” (gongcheng 宫城) (Zhongguo 2003) are seen as evidence of intrasite stratification. The largest foundations inside this area, labeled Palace I and Palace II, stand on top of rammed earthen platforms 9600 m2 and 4200 m2 in size, respectively, and are said to have been the seat of the leader (or king) of the state. [...] Criticism has been leveled at different elements of this reconstruction. For example, the identification of the main public structures in Erlitou as palaces has been challenged: palaces are usually defined as multifunctional buildings, serving as the king’s residence and also as the central hub of state administration (Flannery 1998, pp. 22-36). The Erlitou complexes, despite being composed of large walled courtyards with roofed buildings, are actually quite small. As Thorp (1991) has suggested, these structures are better explained as locations of public gatherings or rituals, where large audiences convened in the courtyard, rather than as the residences of kings." <sup id="cite_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-64">[64]</a></sup>
</p><p>"It is important to note, however, that despite their characterization as gongdian “palaces” in Chinese or “palace-temples” in the English literature, there is very little evidence other than later traditions to suggest their function (Thorp 1988), and indeed, as Xu et al. (2004, 2005) suggests, that function may have changed over the life of the site, never mind the course of the second millennium BCE. Do their large courtyards suggest the open spaces of public architecture and collective ritual, or does their limited access through a single entrance suggest more restricted use (see Figures 2.3-2.5)?" <sup id="cite_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup>

<p>As mentioned above, no city walls were found at Erlitou, but the construction of the entire palace city, including the external walls and the foundation platforms of the buildings inside it, had an accumulated volume of some 40,000 m3, which would have required 5,298 person-months of work to construct. This is roughly seven times less work than the minimal estimates for the work invested in Taosi. Moreover, if the Erlitou population during phase III was 18,000- 30,000 (Liu 2004, pp. 229), then between a third and a fifth of the population could have constructed it within one month, and 10-16&nbsp;% of the population could have constructed it in two months. <sup id="cite_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-77">[77]</a></sup> 5298 people-months = 441.5 people-years.

In Palace I, this platform measures 36 m x 25 m, with a rectangular building 30 m x 11 m on top of it (Fig. 5).

</p><p>"The Erlitou site lies on the south bank of the Luo River, reaching 2 km south of the river and extending 1.5 km from east to west. In the center of this area, test probes have located a number of pounded-earth terraces and building foundations. The largest so far excavated is a square terrace more than 100 m on a side (Fig. 3.11). This was constructed by pounding thin layers of earth into an excavation up to 2 m deep and then continuing to add layers until a height of 80 cm above the surrounding ground was reached. Individual layers are about 4.5 cm thick; their upper surfaces carry the circular impressions of pounding tools 3—5 cm in diameter. The terrace was enclosed by an earthen wall with a gate in the south side; lines of post holes parallel to the wall show that a roofed structure was built against it. Inside the enclo- sure was a pounded-earth building foundation that had been constructed before the rest of the terrace. Judging from post holes, the building it carried was a large rectangular wood-framed hall measuring 30 m east—west and 11 m north—south. The post holes along the south side are set well back from the edge of the foundation, so the hall must have had an unroofed porch. Just outside the line of post holes is a line of smaller holes; if these were left by eave supports, they imply a hipped roof, for they encircle the building. A few traces of earth mixed with straw might be remains of the walls or the roof. No other evidence of walls was found, but the hall of a similar compound nearby was enclosed and divided into three rooms by walls of wattle and daub. Pits dug into the terrace contained human skeletons, apparently sacrificial burials not connected with the construction of the compound but perhaps with its later use. If the compound was a setting for ceremonies performed on the porch of the hall, an audience of several thousand could have watched from within the enclosure." <sup id="cite_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-79">[79]</a></sup>

<dd><b> ♠ Bronze ♣ present ♥ </b> "Many lines of evidence point to a dramatic increase in the sophistication of craft production and the level of specialization during the Erligang period. The technology used to cast bronze vessels —the piece-mold or section-mold technique— was already developed by the Erlitou period, but it reached a much higher level of sophistication during this period. Vessel shapes were now much more varied than before and much more lavishly decorated. The complexity and sheer size of some of these vessels show their casting to have been a real technological achievement. For example, one bronze square ding (fangding 方鼎) dated to the Erligang period is 100 cm tall and weighs 86.4 kg. More bronze was used to cast this single vessel than was used for all of the known Erlitou vessels combined. Another example is three hoards of bronze objects discovered in the outer city of Zhengzhou, containing 28 bronzes with a total weight of over 500 kg (Thorp 2006, pp. 89-91). Mold parts found at the different bronze workshops in Zhengzhou suggest that one, the Nanguanwai (南关外), specialized in the production of ritual vessels (although it also produced tools and weapons), while another, Zijingshan (紫荆山), produced few vessels, if any, and focused instead on weapons and small tools (Fig. 8) (Henan 2001, pp. 307-383). Such workshop specialization, which can be seen in other crafts as well, may have to do not only with the artisans working in each foundry but also with the level of political control over and sponsorship of these workshops." <sup id="cite_ref-110" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-110">[110]</a></sup></dd>

The interpretation of an arsenal was made because the structure of the building was similar to that of an arsenal at Luoyang dating to the Han period (206 BC to AD 220) and Wei period (AD 220-534). In addition, it appears that the city walls of Yanshi were deliberately shaped with a military function in mind. The city walls are not straight as seen in most other early cities. This is particularly clear for the inner city walls.

<p>Not much evidence for wars, but possibly military conquest:
</p><p>"Southern finds are not alone in suggesting that the Erligang culture was widespread. Although no city site comparable to Panlongcheng has been excavated elsewhere, typical Erligang bronzes have been found throughout a large part of North and Central China. Since the bronzes are indistinguishable from Zhengzhou counterparts no matter where they are found, they argue that the dispersion of the Erligang civilization was not a gradual process but a sharply defined event. It seems difficult to imagine any mechanism other than conquest that could spread a uniform inventory of bronze artifacts and a complex technology in a short space of time over so large an area, and the evidence of archaeology is thus that the Erligang period saw not only the formation of a civilization but also a sudden territorial expansion. The expansion seems, however, to have been short-lived. After the Erligang period bronzes no longer exhibit any widespread stylistic uniformity; nothing comparable is seen again in the archaeological record before the Zhou period. The next few centuries instead witnessed the rise of local bronze-using cultures, and presumably of local powers, in regions which before the arrival of the Erligang civilization probably had no knowledge of metallurgy (and metallurgy may be only the visible part of a larger debt). The most impressive and at the moment best-known regional bronze culture of the time immediately following the Erligang period was centered in northern Jiangxi, some 300km south of Panlongcheng, at modern Wucheng and Xin'gan on the Gan River. Here, just beyond the reach of the Erligang expansion, we find a local culture pushed over the threshold of civilization by contact with the culture of the north." <sup id="cite_ref-193" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-193">[193]</a></sup>
</p><p>War between Erlitou and Erligang?
</p>
<dl><dd>"There are other reasons why many scholars believe Yanshi was an important military town. First, Yanshi is located only 6km away from Erlitou, the capital of the Erlitou culture. Most scholars in China believe that Erlitou was the capital city of the Xia dynasty, whose residents were the enemy of Shang. Second, the large, inner walled area at the Shang city of Zhengzhou that was contemporaneous with, or a little earlier than, the city of Yanshi is 300ha in size, while Yanshi is only 81ha in size. The unusually small size suggests that Yanshi had a special function. Third, as mentioned above, the concave and convex sections of the city walls seem to represent a conscious design for defense. The remains of a large arsenal or storage area for weapons also indicate the military function of the site." <sup id="cite_ref-194" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-194">[194]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ elite mortuary feast ♥</b> Elite feasts probably involved more people than non-elite feasts, and elite feasts accompanying mortuary events would probably have involved even more people <sup id="cite_ref-195" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-195">[195]</a></sup>. This ritual would have involved emotionally arousing elements such as feasting, drinking, human and animal sacrifice, and they likely fostered cohesion at the elite level, and fear, awe and grief among non-elites (some of whom may have been relatives of sacrificial victims, and/or fearful that they would be sacrificed at the next ritual) <sup id="cite_ref-196" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-196">[196]</a></sup>.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ yearly ♥</b> once every few years. " While there may have been frequent ‘feasting’ by people to memorialize and metaphorically sustain their dead, this does not mean that the ritual or the scale would be the same in all cases. As mentioned above, there appears to have been a distinction between standard and major ceremonies.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ yearly ♥</b> once every few years. " While there may have been frequent ‘feasting’ by people to memorialize and metaphorically sustain their dead, this does not mean that the ritual or the scale would be the same in all cases. As mentioned above, there appears to have been a distinction between standard and major ceremonies.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ not applicable ♥</b> (<span style="color:blue">Thomas Cressy: Removed code, as it was based on the quote given for participant. Seems no evidence of passive spectators as required in the codebook</span>)</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Duration ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Typical size of participating group ♣ unknown ♥</b> "[I]n most if not all cases, we are limited in what we can say by the archaeological resolution, the coverage of the excavation. In many or most cases, only a limited number of units are excavated. While it may be possible to estimate the size of a community by the size of the community’s residential area (and therefore the numbers of people who may have attended a local feast); this would require full-coverage excavation, which is rare. It would also be difficult to account for people who might have traveled from outside communities to attend a lineage feast, a marriage, or a funeral ceremony." <sup id="cite_ref-197" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-197">[197]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Inclusiveness (ritual specialist) ♣ elites ♥</b> Though excavations at Yanshi (a later, Erligang site) suggest that important aspects of Bronze Age ritual such as feasting, divination and (human and animal) sacrifice were not strictly a prerogative of the elites <sup id="cite_ref-198" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-198">[198]</a></sup>, it seems likely that ritual specialists in charge of elite mortuary ceremonies would have belonged to the ruling elite. RA's guess.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Inclusiveness (participants) ♣ whole polity ♥</b> Due to the scale of this ritual, it is likely that both elites and non-elites would have participated, even if the latter were "only" involved with preparations, such as building, cooking, and crafting. RA's guess.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Inclusiveness (audience) ♣ not applicable  ♥</b> Regardless of who could physically attend the ritual, it is likely that the whole polity would have been aware of it happening, and that it would have been emotionally affected by it. This is suggested by Reinhart's observations regarding more exclusive Bronze Age elite rituals in a later period: "While the temple, palace, and inner city walls at Yanshi physically and metaphorically separated elite rituals into an inner sanctum, sensory effects such as sounds and smells the ritual activities—of feasting and ‘‘sacrifice”—inside the palace certainly would have carried beyond the walls. In private elite rituals, attended only by elite and their attendants and ritual specialists, the secluded nature of the event increases the sense of mystery and importance for people not in attendance (Trigger, 2003, p. 509)." <sup id="cite_ref-199" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-199">[199]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b>♠ fear ♣ inferred present ♥</b> The following may well apply to Bronze Age Chinese rituals involving human sacrifice: "The death of a young Inca woman left on a high mountain peak in the Andes may have been ‘quiet’ to many people in her community who could not hear her cries, but this fails to consider the bereavement of her survivors or the effect on other young women fearful of the same fate." <sup id="cite_ref-200" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-200">[200]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ humiliation ♣ inferred present ♥</b> Bodies of sacrificial victims at the site of Erlitou found "in various positions of disrespect (face down, limbs bent in various directions, overlapping body parts)." <sup id="cite_ref-201" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-201">[201]</a></sup> This suggests that, perhaps, relatives of the victims would have also felt humiliated.</dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ feasting ♣ present ♥</b> "Excavators mention a sacrificial zone or ‘cultic area’ located north of the palace [at Erlitou], containing architectural structures associated with burials (Xu et al. 2005).

<dd><b>♠ alcohol ♣ present ♥</b> "The first cast bronze vessels are thought to have been used for drinking alcohol and were of the jue, jia, and he types, modeled after pottery (Bagley 1990; Childs-Johnson 1987). ‘The forms of these drinking vessels inherited a ceramic tradition associated with ritual feasting as a part of the ancestral cult ceremony, and this tradition can be traced back to the Neolithic period ... The stylistic continuity of these vessels as ritual paraphernalia from the Neolithic to Bronze Ages suggests a continuous practice of similar forms of ritual observances’ (Liu and Chen 2012, p. 272)." <sup id="cite_ref-205" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-205">[205]</a></sup></dd>

Of course, shamanistic dancing is not the only kind of dancing.</dd>

"It also is clear that divination was widespread.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ big game hunting ♥</b> Nothing appears to have been written about hunting in the Erlitou. However, hunting appears to have been an important ritual in prehistoric China, at least starting in the late Longshan <sup id="cite_ref-286" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-286">[286]</a></sup>. Therefore, it may be reasonable to reconstruct ritual hunting for the Erlitou, based on what is known about this practice in earlier (Longshan) and later (Shang) periods. "Meat is always the principal food in feasts. Since meat is not a daily component of the diet in agricultural communities, the offering of an expensive animal for sacrifice is reason enough to gain prestige (cf. Clarke 2001: 160). Therefore, skilled hunters would have greater opportunities to promote their social status in a community. This may have been the situation applying to the household in T26 [at the late Longshan site of Kangjia], which yielded evidence for specialized hunting (H79). In addition, hunting animals may carry symbolic meanings other than merely obtaining protein. Hunting in many complex societies is a strongly ritualized activity and success in hunting frequently is taken as evidence of supernatural approval and support (Helms 1992a). Therefore, successful hunting would ideologically reinforce the prestige of individuals and social groups. "This symbolic aspect of hunting may be observed in the late Shang dynasty, in which hunting was one of the significant ritual activities of the royal court. The animals, used as ritual sacrifice, played a role to link the kings with supernatural power (Fiskesjö 2001; Keightley 2000: 107-113). It is notable that the Shang kings’ favorite game include buffalo and deer (Lefeuvre 1990-1991; Yang Zhongjian and Liu 1949). More interestingly, Shang kings even traveled to the lower Wei River valley to hunt. As recorded by Sima Qian in 'Yin benji' in Shiji, King Wuyi was killed by lightning during a hunt in an area between the Wei and Yellow rivers. Hunting associated with economic, political and symbolic power may have had a long tradition back to the Neolithic period in this region, and the consumption of wild animals in ritual feasting was a tangible medium materializing the intangible symbolic power." <sup id="cite_ref-287" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-287">[287]</a></sup> "Hunts that involved killing dangerous animals (as opposed to more docile animals such as domesticates, less aggressive herbivores, or smaller animals) and that also involved displays of people’s courage, prowess, and strength may have been both euphoric and dysphoric, involving such aspects as pride (in displaying prowess), exhilaration (surely a dramatic chase would be exhilarating), but also fear/terror depending on circumstances, such as the hunter being chased by the game or other scenes of danger." <sup id="cite_ref-288" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-288">[288]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ monthly ♥</b> “In contrast to the spatial specifications on the location of the hunt, the temporal preference does not seem to have been divined for.

Therefore, skilled hunters would have greater opportunities to promote their social status in a community. This may have been the situation applying to the household in T26 [at the late Longshan site of Kangjia], which yielded evidence for specialized hunting (H79). In addition, hunting animals may carry symbolic meanings other than merely obtaining protein.

<p><b>♠ Human sacrifice ♣ [4-5] ♥</b> "The complex of cultural traits encountered at Erlitou, partly Neolithic and partly new, was destined for long survival. It includes building types and techniques; a burial form; vessels and other objects of cast bronze, some inlaid with turquoise; vessels of pottery in shapes later to appear in bronze; jades; a standard Bronze Age weapon, the ge, in both bronze and jade versions; lacquered wood, encountered in the form of fragments of coffins and smaller articles; animal bones used for divination; and human sacrifice." <sup id="cite_ref-367" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-367">[367]</a></sup> At the Erligang site of Yanshi, "archaeologists excavated a dense network of pits containing remains of animals, humans, pottery, and other materials (Institute of Archaeology, 2002).

Excavators (site report 1999~2006) believe there is a sacrificial area at the Erlitou site (Yanshi Erlitou) that is located in the central and eastern part of the site, north and northeast of the palatial area. I couldn’t find any reporting of details of this area in the massive site report (5 large volumes) but managed to chase down two of the references provided in a brief description of the area. These references (Du 1989 and Zheng 1998, in Chinese) describe, without any diagrams, a special area with structures and pits, abnormally buried human burials, burnt surfaces. The excavator mentions that this is a special burial and sacrificial place that requires more attention. A second article, again with no diagrams, describes a burial area with unusual structures (different than houses) and child burials under wall foundations though the author does not mention whether the burials may be related to foundation sacrifice. It seems that the implication is that the structure(s) may be religious structures and that the area was a sacrificial area. This is indeed how it is described in the massive excavation report. <sup id="cite_ref-370" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-370">[370]</a></sup>

<dd><b>♠ Official cult forbids human sacrifice universally ♣ inferred absent ♥ </b> Human sacrifice was certainly performed: at the Erligang site of Yanshi, "archaeologists excavated a dense network of pits containing remains of animals, humans, pottery, and other materials (Institute of Archaeology, 2002).

Some pigs’ bodies were buried whole, dismembered, or decapitated, and sometimes even bound and buried alive (Yuan and Flad, 2005, p. 257).
