In1640, at his instigation, an assembly was convened of Oirat, Khalkha, Koko Nor and Kalmuk rulers and representatives of the high clergy, at which the Oirat Mongol Legal Code was drafted and enacted, under which all were urged to consolidate their own internal position and to pool their efforts in order to resist the Manchus. However, fragmented as they were, the Mongols found these measures extremely difficult to carry out in practice. <sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

<p>The Zungharian polity was, according to Atwood,<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> "the last great independent power of the steppe". The tribal name "Zunghar" first appeared in the seventeenth century, as part of the Oirat confederation of steppe tribes; their rise to dominance within the confederation began under the leadership of Khara-Khula (d. 1634), but it was only in the 1670s, under Galdan, that they officially became the confederacy's leading tribe, and recognised as such even by the Dail Lama, who gave Galdan the title of Boshogtu Khan.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> At its height, the Zungharian polity included portions of Central Asia, Kazakhstan, western Mongolia, neighbouring areas of southern Siberia, and Xinjiang.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> In 1755, the Qing empire was able to annex the Zungharians following a relatively quick and bloodless military campaign; because the Zungharians had successfully repelled the Chinese army several times before, the cause for this sudden collapse can most likely be found in the conflict between the successors of the last great Zugharian ruler, Galdan-Tseren (d. 1735).<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup>
</p><p><i>Population and political organization</i>
</p><p>The Zungharian ruler, known as Khung-Taiji, benefited from the support of an office (yamu) or court (zarghu) composed of four chief officials, known as ministers (tüshimed), judges (zarghuchis), or grand councillors (zaisangs). Galdan-Tseren, the only Zungharian ruler to also be known by the title of Khan, added six additional councillors. Each of the tribes that made up the Zungharian-led confederacy (previously known as the Oirat confederacy) and its own ruler who was himself supported by his own councillors, as well as minor functionaries such as standard-bearers and trumpeters. Finally, each tribe was itself subdivided into otogs, which were themselves subdivided into smaller units (of 40 and then 20 households) governed by local commoner officials.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>
</p><p>Sources say that the Zungharian polity included "200,000 households";<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> with a conservative estimate of 3-8 people per household, the population would therefore have been in the range of 600,000-1,600,000 people.

</p><p>Perdue's map <sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> indicates the presence of regional capitals and towns; however these probably corresponded to the Chinese administration.
Erdeni Batur had built a capital for the Zunghars at Kubak Zar near Tashkent but it fell into disuse after his death (before the start of our polity) <sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup>
Zunghar farms are also mentioned <sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>

</p><p>"Those Oirats who stayed in Jungaria, led by the Choros under their khan Baatur-Khongtaiji (1634-53), consolidated their hold on the area, symbolizing this by stabilizing their headquarters in the form of a city which became the modern Chuguchak (Tacheng)." <sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup>

<p>"While often called the “Zunghar Khanate,” the Zünghar ruler bore the title of khan only rarely. Instead, the Zünghar ruler bore the title of Khung-Taiji, a title derived from Chinese huang-taizi, “crown prince” and originally meaning viceroy or regent for the khan. The title of khan was taken later, if at all, and only by special grant from an outside power, such as the Dalai Lama. While Galdan held the title of khan, his nephew and successor Tse- wang-Rabtan was merely Khung-Taiji. GALDAN-TSEREN (r. 1727-45) is usually called khan, but it is unclear from whom he received the title." <sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup>
</p><p>"Galdan-Tseren reorganized the Zünghar principality, nominally numbering 200,000 households, into directly ruled otogs and appanages, or anggis. His directly subject households, nomadizing in the Ili valley, numbered 24 otogs administered by 54 albachi zaisang (tax officials), with a nominal strength of 87,300 households. These were his personal Choros subjects, captured Siberian and Mongolian peoples, and functional units such as the 4,000 Kötöchi-Nar (equerries), 1,000 Buuchin (musketeers), 5,000 Uruud (craftsmen), and 2,000 ZAKHACHINs (borderers). The appanages of the great nobles, which surrounded the Ili center, were arranged into 21 anggis, specified as six Choros, one Khoshud, two Torghud, eight Khoid, and (presumably) four Dörböd. The anggis did not pay regular taxes to the ruler." <sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup>
</p><p>"The Kalmyk and Zünghar confederations were similar in many ways. Both were divided into tribes (AIMAG), which themselves were conglomerations of exogamous yasun (bones, or patrilineages). The khan or khung-taiji was assisted by an office (yamu) or court (zarghu) composed of four chief officials, variously called ministers (tüshimed), judges (zarghuchis; see JARGHUCHI), or zaisangs (from Chinese zaixiang, grand councillor). These were commoner retainers of the ruler’s tribe. The Zünghar ruler GALDAN-TSEREN (r. 1727-45) expanded the council by adding six zarghuchis to assist the four tüshimed.
The people were assigned to appanages (ulus or anggi) controlled by a nobility (noyod or taiji; see NOYAN) of the tribes’ particular ruling “bones.” Below the noyods were the tabunangs, or sons-in-law or those who had married women of the noyod lineages. The positions of “four ministers,” or “judges,” were restricted to such tabunangs of the ruler. Below them were minor functionaries: standard bearers, trumpeters, aides-de-camp (kiya), and so on.
Each appanage was divided into otogs (a camp district composed of several clans and usually with 3,000 to 6,000 households; see OTOG). The otogs were divided into groups of 40 households, and they in turn into 20s. Each of these units had officials: zaisangs, demchis, and shülengges, respectively. These local officials were all accounted commoners. Commoners without office were divided into the “good” (said), the “middle,” and the “base.” "<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup>

The clergy and their “disciples” were protected from both violence and state duties. Novices who had married without taking the major vows were probably common although legally discouraged. The monasteries were mostly nomadic, although in 1638 a Zünghar ruler requested pigs from Russia to give to the monasteries. At its height the Kalmyk chief lama’s estate of shabinar (disciples, or serfs), for example, reached 3,000-4,000 households. Galdan-Tseren organized the entire clergy into nine jisai (Mongolian, jisiya), with 9,000 lamas and 10,600 households of shabinar. To improve the clergy, he requisitioned 500 pupils, each with two yurts, three servants, two horses, and 100 sheep to be trained by a respected Tibetan lama.

One special otog, or camp dis- trict, named Altachin, “goldsmiths,” was dedicated to making Buddhist images." <sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup>

<p>"The Zunghars participated in the defeat of the last Tibetan king (1642) and the installation of the Dalai Lama as the leader of both Tibetan Buddhism and the state. In 1671 Galdan became the supreme khan, and he successfully expanded the Zunghar polity against the Central Asian Muslim oasis cities. By 1688 conflict between the east and west led to the breakup of the confederation. The Zunghars in the east still remained powerful and successfully annexed Mongol territories farther east, thus bringing most of Mongolia under their control. After initial successes, the Zunghar forces returned home to deal with internal conflicts. It was not until 1694 that the Zunghar armies advanced again on Mongolia, this time apparently because of a devastating famine. The Zunghars were finally defeated by Qing forces, apparently as a result of internal conflicts and a smallpox epidemic (Barfield 1989, p. 294)." <sup id="cite_ref-115" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-115">[115]</a></sup>

Wars in central Asia:
"Upon the death of Tsewang Rabtan in 1727, his son Galdan Tseren (r. 1727-1745) succeeded as ruler of the Junghars. He reorganized the empire and attempted to push the Manchu-Chinese out of the Khalkha Mongol lands in 1730 and 1731, but he was defeated both times and finally made peace with the Ch’ing in 1739. He then attacked the Kazakhs, who separated the Junghars from their Torgut (Kalmyk) relatives far to the west on the lower Volga. The Junghars established their domination deep into Western Central Asia." <sup id="cite_ref-116" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-116">[116]</a></sup>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ summer festival ♥</b> "At least since the 17th century communal summer religious ceremonies have always concluded with competitions of the 'three manly games' (<i>eriin gurwan naadam</i>). Such summer ceremonies include aspersions of koumiss at the opening of the mare-milking season, OBOO (cairn) worship, and the DANSHUG ritual, in which lay patrons present a mandala to INCARNATE LAMAs. All these rituals were carried out by both large and small groups." <sup id="cite_ref-117" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-117">[117]</a></sup> "In the NAADAM 'games' that accompanied religious rituals, archery was practiced with large, blunt ivory heads. The most common target was a pyramid or line of sur, made of leather straps rolled into a cylinder and filled with oak bark or leather, which was to be knocked over. At the beginning of the competition, the umpires (uukhaichin, or "uukhai sayers") gave a cry of uukhai, accompanied by a circular motion of their arms with the hands pointed up to the sky to summon good fortune. The same cry accompanied each striking of the target and the final tallying of the score. The victorious archer received the title mergen (sharpshooter, but also wise man)." <sup id="cite_ref-118" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-118">[118]</a></sup> "Horse racing is one of Mongolia's 'three manly games,' although ironically it is today most often performed by young boys and girls." <sup id="cite_ref-119" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-119">[119]</a></sup> "Wrestling matches occur during NAADAM, or games held in conjunction with summertime religious ceremonies or national holidays. The wrestlers first perform a clockwise circumambulation of the field and traditionally make a libation of mare’s milk to the gods. Before each match the wrestler’s coach chants a magtaal, or praise for the wrestler (see YÖRÖÖL AND MAGTAAL). The wrestler then gives the coach his hat and performs a dance called 'the flapping of the Garuda' (the mythic Indian king of birds) around the banner standard or national flag before touching the ground with his hands. During the bout the competitors' coaches stand next to them shouting advice in a ritualized language and sometimes slapping the wrestlers' buttocks or thighs if the contest seems slow. After one wins the loser passes under the winner’s arm and is slapped on the buttocks, and the winner performs the Garuda dance again. The winner then takes from his coach a handful of crumbly Mongolian cheeses, which he tosses in offering to the local deities and/or the spectators. Young wrestlers eagerly vie to catch and eat these cheeses." <sup id="cite_ref-120" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-120">[120]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>"Regardless of the exact religious complexion of those performing the ritual, oboo sacrifices are everywhere strikingly similar. Formal worship is always performed in the summer, on a date determined by astrological calculation, and is intended to ensure seasonable rainfall and fertile livestock. Only adult men are allowed to participate in or even watch the ceremony (men are banned from the Daur women’s oboos). The deities worshiped include the various tenggeri (gods), the dragons (luu) who control the rains, the 'master of the land' (gazar-un ezen or sabdag, from Tibetan sa-bdag), or shaman spirits among still shamanic peoples such as the BURIATS and Daurs. Buddhist oboo worship also invokes the powerful fierce bodhisattva Vajrapani (of whom CHINGGIS KHAN was believed to be an emanation body). Either a lama or a respected lay elder presides over the ritual, never a shaman, even if the deity worshiped is a shaman spirit. A small table is set up by the oboo’s southern side for the offering of prayers. Offerings of sacrificial meat are placed on the oboo, and liquor and water are poured on the stones. Most of the meat is eaten by the members of the group sponsoring the sacrifice, but the bones are left at the oboo. Worship opens and closes with a triple clockwise circumambulation, and athletic competitions follow the ritual. Skulls of beloved HORSES are also placed on the oboo after their death. "The texts used by Mongolian lamas for setting up Buddhist oboos and performing the offerings were written by the THIRD MERGEN GEGEEN (1717-66). In them the Mergen Gegeen criticized the blood sacrifices and gluttonous feasting and merrymaking that accompanied the oboo sacrifice, but despite his admonition and that of later authors of Buddhist didactic poetry, meat was still widely used even in lamas’ offerings." <sup id="cite_ref-121" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-121">[121]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>"These offerings began with a poem in the Tibetan shabdan (from zhabs-brtan, firm feet) genre requesting the lama to remain in this world for the sake of sentient beings and the presentation of a silver mandala, then followed with a gilt statue of Ayushi (Amitayus), Buddha of eternal life, and the scripture Tsendoo, written in five jewels." <sup id="cite_ref-122" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-122">[122]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ divination ♥</b> "Divining by reading the cracks in burnt bones, an almost universal practice in ancient Eurasia, was the major method of divination in the MONGOL EMPIRE and was practiced until recent times. While in ancient Shang China tortoise shells were burned by a piece of hot iron, the Mongols always used sheep scapula, or shoulder blades, and simply placed them in a fire. The great khans of the Mongol Empire used scapulimancy to divine the will of heaven (TENGGERI) before virtually every decision. CHINGGIS KHAN carried a charred sheep pelvis as an amulet. This divination was performed by the khans themselves, by shamans (bö’e, modern böö), and sometimes by foreign divination experts, such as YELÜ CHUCAI (1190-1244). The inquirer first had to whisper to the shoulder blade, and then the blade was burned. A straight vertical crack meant yes, and a horizontal crack or splintering meant no. Today shamans follow up the reading of the blade’s cracks with a shamanic session to ask the ONGGHONs (spirit figurines) for further information about the inquirer’s troubles. "Scapulimancy continued in Buddhist Mongolia. The great Tu (Monguor) lama and scholar Sum-pa mKhan-po Ishi-Baljur (Ye-shes dPal-'byor, 1704-87) wrote a text on the topic based on what he knew of the practice among the OOLOD Mongols. In it he notes that a shoulder blade from a freshly slaughtered, healthy, white sheep had to be washed and censed with juniper and/or incense. In a room, the diviner prayed alone to the Buddhist deities and recited a dharani (sacred spell) several times before placing the bone in the fire. The resulting cracks were interpreted according to a complex division of the bone into areas along its edges and along the central spine. The cracks’ lengths, colors, and positions were all considered, allowing much room for the diviner’s interpretation of the event. Evil omens were to be dealt with by having the appropriate scriptures recited by a lama.</dd>
<dd>"Scapulimancy was still practiced widely in the late 1930s in Inner Mongolia and is practiced today by shamans among the DARKHAD, ZAKHACHIN, and other western Mongolian groups. It has given way to ASTROLOGY in modern urban milieus." <sup id="cite_ref-183" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-183">[183]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ yorool and magtaal ♥</b> "The yörööl (blessing or benediction) and magtaal (praise or panegyric) together form one of the major genres of Mongol folk poetry. The offering of a yörööl (Kalmyk-Oirat, yöräl, Buriat, yerüül) accompanies virtually all public ritual functions in traditional and in much modern Mongolian life. Occasions for a yörööl include dedication of newly made or acquired tools and implements (felt, YURT, saddles, rifles, etc.); the birth or acquisition of a valuable new animal; the making of a cradle for a newborn baby; the presentation of a whole sheep, liquor, or new KOUMISS; sacrifices to the household fire (see FIRE CULT), the OBOO, or war standard, aspersions (tsatsal) of mare’s milk to heaven (see TENGGERI); and WEDDINGS. Such yörööls often include descriptive magtaals, which are also spoken separately for mountains and other features of the natural environment and especially during sporting events to announce the great qualities of the victorious horse and jockey, wrestler, or archer. Sometimes political addresses and wedding speeches are separated as zorig. "A typical yörööl begins with a syllable or line of invocation, such as om sain amgalan boltugai 'Om (the sacred Tantric seed-syllable)! May there be a good peace!' or the exclamation 'Zee!' The speaker then describes the occasion and the offerings made (where appropriate), praises the features of the object being blessed one by one, gives a predictive picture of its successful use, and concludes with the blessing proper. The poetic forms of yörööls and magtaals are marked by groups of lines (couplets, tercets, or quatrains) alliterating on the first syllable. Parallelism between both lines and larger strophes is common, as are long catalogue-like lists. One of the most distinctive features of this genre and Mongolian ritual language generally is the combination of repeated restatement of obvious facts together with pervasive hyperbole. Thus, a YURT’s latticework is jade and its door is garnet, an arrow is fledged with the 'flight feathers of the King Garuda (the mythological Indian bird) who flies gracefully on high,' and so on. This ritual hyperbole, found also in Mongolian EPICS, resembles a lay adaption of the language of Tantric visualizations, which re-creates this world in the form of a perfected world. "In Mongolian society men with a talent for speaking such praises and blessings, called yöröölchi (blessers) or khonjin, are widely sought for all sorts of ritual occasions. While the addresses are delivered orally and creative variations on existing patterns are valued, written exemplars have long circulated in booklets to help speakers develop their repertoire." <sup id="cite_ref-251" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-251">[251]</a></sup></dd>

Such summer ceremonies include aspersions of koumiss at the opening of the mare-milking season, OBOO (cairn) worship, and the DANSHUG ritual, in which lay patrons present a mandala to INCARNATE LAMAs. All these rituals were carried out by both large and small groups." <sup id="cite_ref-290" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-290">[290]</a></sup> "In the NAADAM 'games' that accompanied religious rituals, archery was practiced with large, blunt ivory heads. The most common target was a pyramid or line of sur, made of leather straps rolled into a cylinder and filled with oak bark or leather, which was to be knocked over. At the beginning of the competition, the umpires (uukhaichin, or "uukhai sayers") gave a cry of uukhai, accompanied by a circular motion of their arms with the hands pointed up to the sky to summon good fortune. The same cry accompanied each striking of the target and the final tallying of the score. The victorious archer received the title mergen (sharpshooter, but also wise man)." <sup id="cite_ref-291" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-291">[291]</a></sup> "Horse racing is one of Mongolia's 'three manly games,' although ironically it is today most often performed by young boys and girls." <sup id="cite_ref-292" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-292">[292]</a></sup> "Wrestling matches occur during NAADAM, or games held in conjunction with summertime religious ceremonies or national holidays. The wrestlers first perform a clockwise circumambulation of the field and traditionally make a libation of mare’s milk to the gods. Before each match the wrestler’s coach chants a magtaal, or praise for the wrestler (see YÖRÖÖL AND MAGTAAL). The wrestler then gives the coach his hat and performs a dance called 'the flapping of the Garuda' (the mythic Indian king of birds) around the banner standard or national flag before touching the ground with his hands. During the bout the competitors' coaches stand next to them shouting advice in a ritualized language and sometimes slapping the wrestlers' buttocks or thighs if the contest seems slow. After one wins the loser passes under the winner’s arm and is slapped on the buttocks, and the winner performs the Garuda dance again. The winner then takes from his coach a handful of crumbly Mongolian cheeses, which he tosses in offering to the local deities and/or the spectators. Young wrestlers eagerly vie to catch and eat these cheeses." <sup id="cite_ref-293" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-293">[293]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>"Regardless of the exact religious complexion of those performing the ritual, oboo sacrifices are everywhere strikingly similar. Formal worship is always performed in the summer, on a date determined by astrological calculation, and is intended to ensure seasonable rainfall and fertile livestock. Only adult men are allowed to participate in or even watch the ceremony (men are banned from the Daur women’s oboos). The deities worshiped include the various tenggeri (gods), the dragons (luu) who control the rains, the 'master of the land' (gazar-un ezen or sabdag, from Tibetan sa-bdag), or shaman spirits among still shamanic peoples such as the BURIATS and Daurs. Buddhist oboo worship also invokes the powerful fierce bodhisattva Vajrapani (of whom CHINGGIS KHAN was believed to be an emanation body). Either a lama or a respected lay elder presides over the ritual, never a shaman, even if the deity worshiped is a shaman spirit. A small table is set up by the oboo’s southern side for the offering of prayers. Offerings of sacrificial meat are placed on the oboo, and liquor and water are poured on the stones. Most of the meat is eaten by the members of the group sponsoring the sacrifice, but the bones are left at the oboo. Worship opens and closes with a triple clockwise circumambulation, and athletic competitions follow the ritual. Skulls of beloved HORSES are also placed on the oboo after their death. "The texts used by Mongolian lamas for setting up Buddhist oboos and performing the offerings were written by the THIRD MERGEN GEGEEN (1717-66). In them the Mergen Gegeen criticized the blood sacrifices and gluttonous feasting and merrymaking that accompanied the oboo sacrifice, but despite his admonition and that of later authors of Buddhist didactic poetry, meat was still widely used even in lamas’ offerings." <sup id="cite_ref-294" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-294">[294]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>"These offerings began with a poem in the Tibetan shabdan (from zhabs-brtan, firm feet) genre requesting the lama to remain in this world for the sake of sentient beings and the presentation of a silver mandala, then followed with a gilt statue of Ayushi (Amitayus), Buddha of eternal life, and the scripture Tsendoo, written in five jewels." <sup id="cite_ref-295" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-295">[295]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ blood brotherhood ritual ♥</b> In the fifth century BCE, Herodotus says they were performed by the Scythians <sup id="cite_ref-356" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-356">[356]</a></sup> (typically the first people mentioned in histories of Central Eurasia, even though they never reached as far as our NGA), we know that the Khitan performed them in the tenth century at least <sup id="cite_ref-357" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-357">[357]</a></sup>, and we know that the Mongols performed them in subsequent centuries <sup id="cite_ref-358" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-358">[358]</a></sup>. This suggests continuity between the Scythians, Khitan and Mongols, which in turn suggests that the blood brotherhood ritual was probably performed by peoples that inhabited Central Eurasia after the Scythians and before the Khitan - and these people may well have included the Xiungnu. "Herodotus also tells us that the Scythians give each other sworn pledges by pouring their blood, mixed with wine, into a bowl in which they dip a sword, arrows, an axe and a javelin before drinking from it. We may note that the use of arrows in making a 'blood-brother' agreement is evidenced in the case of Genghis Khan and also in East (or Chinese) Turkistan (now Sinkiang or Xinjiang in north-west China): there, as generally among the Turks and Mongols, the weapons represent the souls of men themselves." <sup id="cite_ref-359" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-359">[359]</a></sup> "Arrows (along with bows, saddles, horses, and gowns) also figure in ritual exchanges made between two men who agree to be blood-brothers." <sup id="cite_ref-360" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-360">[360]</a></sup>. "Found in many Turco-Mongol nomadic societies, the ritual of blood brotherhood involved drinking from a cup into which blood from both parties had been poured. The 'brothers' would then exchange gifts and usually spend some time living in the same YURT, or <i>ger</i>.

This concept takes the agency away from gods and kings: karma could mature after thousands of years and come to fruition.

<p>We are interested here in any systems of thought and behavior that can influence people's actions, which we term a <i>Normative Ideology</i>.  Normative ideologies are thought-systems concerned with the correct behavior of people, governments/leaders, and other groups (and particularly the relationships between these groups).
</p><p>Mainly, this will be a religious or ritual system. As usual, when we mention Religious or Ritual System our focus  is on the 'official cult', defined the same way as in the Rituals section:
</p>
<dl><dd>With the official cult we refer to the set of collective religious practices that are most closely associated with legitimation of the power structure (including elites, if any).</dd></dl>
<p>However, Normative Ideologies are not restricted to religious/ritual systems. They include other thought systems, such as philosophy or anything that prescribes a particular pattern of behaviour. An example is  classical Greek philosophy, such as the works of Plato and Aristotle, who were concerned with correct or moral behaviour and whose thoughts influenced the actual practice of several societies (the empire of Alexander the Great, notably).

</p><p><b>♠ Description of the Normative Ideology ♣ ♥</b> "The Second Conversion refers to the Buddhist missionary movement from 1566 to around 1650, through which Buddhism became the sole authorized religion among the Mongols. [...] From 1585 to 1588 the Third Dalai Lama personally toured southwest Inner Mongolia. In 1585 a ruler of KHALKHA (Mongolia proper), ABATAI KHAN (1554-88), learned about Buddhism from a party of merchants from the Tümed region and began building a temple. The next year he personally visited the Dalai Lama at Altan Khan’s capital, Guihua (modern HOHHOT). [...] "Mantras and numbered categories, such as the Three Jewels, the 'six syllables' om mani padme hum, and the eightfold restraint (moral rules), transmitted basic instruction. Neichi Toin and his patrons rewarded anyone who memorized the mantra of the fierce protector deity Yamantaka. Neichi Toin was later accused of freely giving out Yamantaka initiations to commoners and was recalled from the mission field by the Manchu emperor on advice of the Fifth Dalai Lama in 1652. Key political leaders, both male and female, everywhere received the Tantric Hevajra initiation. "Conversion narratives suggest varied patterns for individual conversion. Neichi Toin rejected the world when he saw the death throes of a pregnant wild ass he and his friends had shot. Altan and Abatai converted after successful campaigns had confirmed their leadership; they saw reestablishing the 'TWO CUSTOMS' (khoyar yosu) of religion and state as a way of confirming their success. Miracles, healings, and supernatural contests played a role. Reading Mongolian translations of Buddhist hagiographies and viewing the splendor of mandalas and other Tantric rituals are also mentioned as strengthening weak faith. Although not treated in detail in the sources, it seems clear that women played the leading role in promoting conversion; virtually every strong male adherent can be linked to a devout woman, either his wife or a blood relative. "The Second Conversion was fiercely intolerant of the native Mongolian religion. The JEWEL TRANSLUCENT SUTRA (1607) boasts that under Altan Khan 'the mad and stupid shamans were annihilated and the shamanesses humiliated.' Khutugtai Sechen Khung-Taiji prescribed harsh penalties for funerary blood sacrifices, making or sacrificing to an ONGGHON (spirit figurines), or striking a monk. Instead, yurts were to have six-armed Mahakalas worshiped with fasting and bloodless offerings, and funerals were to be marked by almsgiving. In Khorchin government messengers accompanied by Neichi Toin’s disciples collected enough ongghons to fill a YURT, all of which were burned. Later codes, such as the 1640 MONGOL-OIRAT CODE, reduced unrealistically severe penalties to more practical livestock fines but kept the prohibitions on shamanist activity. "Apart from these laws, few other Mongolian practices were directly banned. Human sacrifice disappeared rapidly. Individual hunting and the eating of horse flesh were discouraged, but collective public hunts continued and were enshrined in the Mongol-Oirat Code. Strikingly, the EIGHT WHITE YURTS, or shrine of CHINGGIS KHAN, with its blood sacrifices, remained an integral part of government even in a Buddhist utopia such as the CHAGHAN TEUKE (White history). "This new exclusivist vision of dGe-lugs-pa Buddhism also targeted the older orders still found in eastern and northern Mongolia. The Fifth Dalai Lama (1617-82) told an eminent Mongolian lama returning from education in Tibet: 'If you propagate the Old Teaching in the Mongol lands it will only bring bad luck! If anybody else tries to spread them, you must stop him!'" <sup id="cite_ref-422" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-422">[422]</a></sup> "Two Customs (Khoyar Yosu) This concept, along with the allied concept of “offering site and almsgiver” (or priest and patron), linked the Buddhist religion to imperial rule in Inner Asia. The “Two Customs” of Buddhist religion (shashin) and monarchical rule (toro) established a mutually harmonious relation between the two fundamental orders of society, celibate monks and married householders. The monarch served as an “almsgiver” (oglige-yin ejen, from Tibetan yon-bdag) to the monks, who served as an “offering site” (takhil-un oron, from Tibetan mchod-gnas). The monarch also had the duty to ensure the discipline of the monastic community (sangha), expelling the unfit. From the Tangut XIA DYNASTY (1038-1227) on, the monarch would ideally receive an initiation into one of the great Tantric Buddhist deities following a preparatory course of study with fastings and meditations and would prostrate himself before his lama- teacher. While shocking to defenders of imperial prerogatives, this Tantric pupil-teacher relation was the acme of the “almsgiver-offering-site” relation. (Although the translation “two principles” has become common, the word yosu in Mongolian is always “custom,” with its implication of past tradition.)" <sup id="cite_ref-423" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-423">[423]</a></sup>

Thus, as a relatively late arriver, Buddhism accepted, tacitly, many of the given forms of social praxis in India. And, even when Buddhism sought to redefine religious goals and family values, these efforts were manifested vis-a-vis patterns that had already been in place for centuries.

This includes generalized impersonal punishment/reward (e.g., karma, mana) as well as punishment by specific supernatural beings. Include specific details of the nature and extent of punishment/reward in the description. Code “compound” moral actions (e.g., filial piety = kin + respect) in multiple categories as necessary.

<dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement against harm ♣ present ♥</b> “The heart of Buddhist spiritual life, whether lay or monastic, is puṇya (Pali puñña ). This term is usually translated as ‘merit’ and refers to certain significant kinds of action that are regarded as auspicious and potent deeds. Essentially, merit is good ‘karma’ ( karman/kamma)&nbsp;: wholesome ( kuśla/kusala ) deeds which plant seeds that bear fortunate and pleasant fruits, whether in this life or lives to come, and thereby create conditions for further meritorious action in the future. These are the kinds of action that conduce to the development of the qualities of the eightfold path. Moreover it is making merit that binds the lay and monastic communities together. The traditional ‘bases of merit’ are generosity (dāna), ethical conduct ( śīla/sīla ), and meditation ( bhāvanā ). [...]The practice of good conduct takes the form of commitment to the five precepts usually recited in conjunction with the three refuges: (1) to refrain from harming living creatures, (2) to refrain from taking what is not given, (3) to refrain from sexual misconduct, (4) to refrain from false speech, (5) to refrain from intoxicants that cause heedlessness (see pp. 170- 2). In addition the lay disciple may on special occasions (traditionally the full moon ‘observance’ days) or for longer periods take the eight precepts, replacing the third precept (refraining from sexual misconduct) with complete sexual abstinence and adding (6) refraining from eating after midday, (7) refraining from attending entertainments and using perfumes, etc., and (8) refraining from using luxurious beds.”<sup id="cite_ref-486" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-486">[486]</a></sup> “The nature of bad action is usually illustrated by reference to a list of the ten courses of unwholesome action ( karma/kamma-patha ) which consist of three bodily courses of action (taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct), four vocal courses of action (lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech, frivolous speech), and three mental courses of action (covetousness, ill-will, wrong view). [...] Essentially the psychological states that motivate the ten unwholesome courses of action— strong greed, hatred, and delusion —lead to rebirth in the unhappy destinies or ‘descents’: in a hell realm, as a hungry ghost, an animal, or a jealous god. In fact rather a precise correlation exists here: dominated by greed one becomes a hungry ghost, a class of beings ever discontent and anguished because of being unable to satisfy their greed; dominated by hatred one enters one of the hell realms where one suffers terrible pain; dominated by ignorance one becomes an animal ruled by the instincts of food and reproduction.” <sup id="cite_ref-487" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-487">[487]</a></sup></dd>

What ‘right action’ and ‘right livelihood’ positively involve becomes clearer in the numerous practical guidelines for dealing with one’s parents, teachers, spouse, children, friends, one’s master and servant, Brahmans and Sramanas. So, for example, in the very popular Sigālovāda Sutta (DN 31): Children should honour their parents, be grateful and support them when they are in need or grow old; parents should show their love to their children by teaching them virtue, training them for a profession and passing on their inheritance when it is due; [...] a husband should minister to his wife ‘by honouring her, by not disparaging her, by not being unfaithful to her, by giving authority to her, by providing her with adornments’. A wife will reciprocate ‘by properly organising her work, by being kind to the servants, by not being unfaithful, by protecting stores, and by being skilful and diligent in all she has to do’.” <sup id="cite_ref-496" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-496">[496]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of in-group loyalty ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> “As mentioned before, the development of a loving mind towards all beings, whether friend or foe, is the aim of one of the meditative practices of early Buddhism (see above p. 53f ). In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsāric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f ). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21).” <sup id="cite_ref-497" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-497">[497]</a></sup> “[...] Buddhism maintained a fairly flexible posture vis-a-vis competing religions and never sought to require laity to identify themselves exclusively as Buddhist or to rely singularly on the Buddhist clergy for all their spiritual needs.” <sup id="cite_ref-498" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-498">[498]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of bravery ♣ absent ♥</b> “In marked contrast to the view of Islam about the fate of warriors who die in a holy war, the Buddha expresses the view in the Sutta Nipāta (Sn.iv.308-11) that soldiers who die in battle go not to a special paradise but to a special hell, since at the moment of death their minds were bent on killing. Some texts affirm that even killing in self-defence, or in defence of family or friends, is wrongful, and in general an attitude of non-resistance in the face of violence is commended. The commentary to the Dhammapada relates how on one occasion when the Buddha's kinsmen, the Sakyas, were under attack, they allowed themselves to be slaughtered rather than break the First Precept. Other examples in the Jātakas and elsewhere speak of princes and kings who renounced their thrones rather than resorting to violence to defend their kingdoms.” <sup id="cite_ref-500" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-500">[500]</a></sup></dd>

</p><p><b>♠ Charity ♣ present ♥</b> "Cultural life among the great Oirat khanates was dominated by Buddhism. The Buddhist belief among the Oirats, surrounded by the Muslim Turks, was peculiarly militant and focused on the Dalai Lama in Tibet, whose name itself was a common religious prayer. The biography of the great monk-scholar Zaya Pandita Namkhai- amtsu vividly illustrates the aristocratic Buddhist milieu. A nobleman might donate up to 10,000 horses for a single religious service or requisition his subjects to become bandi (novices) or lay servants in the monasteries. The clergy and their “disciples” were protected from both violence and state duties. Novices who had married without taking the major vows were probably common although legally discouraged. The monasteries were mostly nomadic, although in 1638 a Zünghar ruler requested pigs from Russia to give to the monasteries." <sup id="cite_ref-554" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-554">[554]</a></sup>
