The origins of the Sabaean alphabet are now thought to be in the Fertile Crescent, though why or how it spread to South Arabia remains a mystery.

<p>In 115 BCE the Himyarites were a tribe from the southwestern highlands of Yemen. They formed, with Saba, the dual kingdom of Saba and Dhu-Raydan<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup> after the Roman attacks in 25 BCE emboldened the Himyarites who "siezed the Sabaean homelands and made the population subject to a new Saba-Himyar regime."<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> They used the royal title 'king of Saba and dhu-Raydan' with Raydan later becoming known as Qataban.<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup> Dhu-Raydan (Zafar), the Himyarite capital, was located in the highlands near modern Yarim.<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup>
</p><p>The Roman discovery of the Indian Ocean trade winds around 100 CE signaled the end of many great civilizations in South Arabia that used overland trade routes;<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup> but the Himyarite state was initially an exception, and prospered. For a time the Himyarites were a subject tribe of the Romans<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> and they possessed colonies which seeded the Abyssinian Kingdom in Ethiopia.<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup> The wealth of the Himyar state, similarly acquired as other local kingdoms from the trade of incense and spices, came from trading overseas routes. While during the second millennium CE Saba split from Himyar the Himyarites later benefited immensely at the expense of their rival kingdoms as the overland routes became increasingly less efficient and disrupted by warfare, especially in the third century CE, which involved Himyar, Saba, Hadramawt and Aksum.
</p><p>The Himyarites had a much more centralized polity than Saba throughout the early first millennium<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup> but could not hold back the Abyssinians who invaded and occupied the tihama (Red Sea littoral) from the 2nd century CE; the Ethiopians conquered the Himyarite capital in 240 CE, but agreeing an alliance with Himyar withdraw from the Arabian peninsular<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup> in about 270 CE.<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup> The Himyar-Abyssinain alliance or vassalage ended about 298 CE.<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup> Himyar "reached the peak of its power in the third century as a result of a successful series of wars against the local heathen tribes and the African realm of Ethiopia."<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup> Between 270-280 CE the Sabaean Kingdom was annexed by the Himyarites.<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup> Hadramawt was conquered by 300 CE.<sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup> Throughout this period the profits from the incense trade were in a progressive decline as the rise of Christianity in the west had reduced demand for a product that was most commonly used in pagan rituals. When in 395 CE the Roman emperor Theodosius declared Christianity to be the official state religion of the Roman Empire the trade ceased entirely.<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup>
</p><p>At this same time Himyarites also were undergoing their own seismic shift in religious belief system - rapidly converting from their pagan polytheistic belief system to monotheistic religious doctrines by the late 4th century CE.<sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup> "There is significant archaeological evidence of the abandonment of pagan temples toward the conclusion of the fourth century and of the almost complete disappearance of expressions of devotion to the old tribal gods shortly thereafter."<sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup> "From the 4th century on the Himyarite kings were either full members or sympathizers of Judaism" and the Jewish faith became "the dominant religion" in South Arabia.<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup> In the later fourth century there was a Jewish dynasty of kings known as the Tabbai'a.<sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup> A list of Himyarite's known Jewish kings include: Yassirum Yohre'am (from 270 CE); 'Amr-Shlomo ben David (325-330 CE); Malki Kariba Juha'min (378-385 CE); Abu Kariba As'as (385-420 or 445 CE); Shurihbi'il Yakkuf (468-480 CE); Martad Ilan ('Judaized' 495-515 CE); Yusuf Ash'ar Dhu Nuwas (515-525 CE).<sup id="cite_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup> The Himyarite army adopted Judaism as its official religion at the start of the fifth century CE.<sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup>
</p><p>Christianity also was present in Himyar at least from the first half of the 4th century<sup id="cite_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup> when the Christian missionary Theophilus arrived and "complained that he found a great number of Jews".<sup id="cite_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup> By 350 CE Christian communities were becoming established and over the next 100 years, "missionaries systematically converted many Arabian tribes from their traditional polytheistic practices to monotheistic Christianity".<sup id="cite_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup> It is also suggested that the rulers were not Jewish but Monophysite Christians. According to Friedman (2006) Himyarite colonists, the Axumites, in the land of Cush (Ethiopia) "which they renamed Axum ... converted to Monophysite Christianity at the beginning of the fourth century. Between 340 to 378, the Axumites returned to Yemen and imposed their rule and religion over the Himyarites. Although the interregnum was short-lived, the impact of the Axumites was very profound. Yemen was a Christian land, with churches and a cathedral in San'a, and all but one of the restored Himyarite monarchs (378-525) were Monophysite Christians. The lone heretic was Dhu-Nuwas who, for unknown reasons, hated Christians and converted to Judaism."<sup id="cite_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup> However, Christians appear to have been repressed due to a perceived association with influence of the Byzantine Empire: "in the 470s ... a priest named Azqir was executed for active proselytisation in Najran".<sup id="cite_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup> Hitti also mentions the 340-378 CE period of Abyssinian rule.<sup id="cite_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-57">[57]</a></sup>
</p><p>An inscription dated to 378 CE claimed "the completion of buildings by a Himyar monarch had been accomplished 'through the power of their lord of sky and heaven,' and phrases such as 'the owner of the sky and earth,' and the expression 'the Merciful' also were used.<sup id="cite_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup> It has been suggested that the Himyarite "profession of monotheism, and later full-fledged Judaism, distanced the Himyarites from the Christianity of the Byzantines and their Ethiopian allies and the Zoroastrianism of the Persians"<sup id="cite_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup> so that their strategically located state had an independent or neutral identity. Written sources mention the presence of synagogues in Zafar and Najran.<sup id="cite_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-60">[60]</a></sup>
</p><p>As trade revenues flatlined, the increasing persecution and then massacre of Christians by king Dhu Nuwas<sup id="cite_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-61">[61]</a></sup> lead to a foreign intervention. The Byzantine Empire in alliance with the Aksumite Kingdom invaded the Himyarite kingdom and Dhu Nuwas was removed. Himyar and the Red Sea Coast was thereafter ruled directly by the Christian Ethiopians until the Persian conquest in 570 CE, interrupted by the Christian Ethiopian governor-general Abraha's declaration of independence between 550-553 CE.<sup id="cite_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-62">[62]</a></sup>

"The patron deity (shym) of a people was of more immediate significance in south Arabia than the remoter figure of 'Athtar. The four principal peoples had as their patrons Almaqah (Sabaeans), Wadd (Minaeans), 'Amm (Qatabanians) and Sayin (Hadramites), and each people was collectively termed the 'chrildren of their respective patron deity."<sup id="cite_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-82">[82]</a></sup> The pagan religion of South Arabia "was in its essence a planetary astral system in which the cult of the moon-god prevailed.

He was conceived of as a masculine deity and took precedence over the sun, Shams, who was his consort.

</p><p>The pagan Himyarites likely worshipped Almaqah from the time the kingdom was combined with Saba.

</p><p><b>Description of the Ritual System</b>
</p><p><i>Communal feast</i> - Most euphoric
</p><p>"From all regions of Arabia we have evidence, sometimes archaeological and sometimes literary, for communal meals ... These might be joyous affairs, such as circumcision and marriage feasts, when whole communities came together to witness the rites and share in the repast. Others were more sombre, such as funerary banquets ... But all such occasions of communal consumption served many functions beyond the immediate one of satiation. They often had social aims, for eating and drinking together promotes companionship, so confirming and reinforcing group identity and solidarity. If that group was a cultic entity, then communal meals took on the significance of a declaration of confessional allegiance, and to eat the consecrated food of non-believers might be regarded as an abomination. As the eucharistic meal of Christians, the divinities themselves might be present, and by admitting man to their table they bound him to them in a special relationship. There could also be a political dimension, for it was by sponsoring public feasts that an aspiring leader became a man of influence and renown, his cavalier generosity to others creating obligations of reciprocity as well as earning him repute. A particularly long-lived form of feasting is the ritual banquet (mrzh'), a celebration attended by a select group of colleagues in honour of a particular deity or deities. It is attested as early as the thirteenth century BC in a text from Ugarit, which describes the preparations taken by the chief of the gods for his guests, the slaughtering of animals and the provision of wine."<sup id="cite_ref-223" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-223">[223]</a></sup> "Feasts might also be profane affairs, just plain revelry and camraderie. Allusions to gatherings for the purpose of enjoying wine, women and song are common in the poems of the pastoralists of north Arabia."<sup id="cite_ref-224" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-224">[224]</a></sup> "Also in the category of profane feasts are the meals provided for the poor and needy, for the stranger and wayfarer. Generosity and hospitality were considered the cardinal Arabian virtues, and to be thought niggardly would be the ruin of a man".<sup id="cite_ref-225" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-225">[225]</a></sup>
</p><p><br>
<i>Ritual of divination by consulting an oracle</i> - Most widespread
</p><p>Divination assisted political and personal decision making "by removing the decision from contesting parties and giving it an objective legitimacy, both through its spiritual sovium - may still  need interpretation. Otherwise one may resort to observation of the behaviour of birds, animals and heavenly bodies in the belief that their movements are governed by higher forces and convey a message (omen). Or else one may turn to stratagems of chance, casting lots and the like, in the hope of receiving inspiration in one's choice. Finally one may rely upon the services of a spiritual diviner, who is able to see the unknown and know the unseen. In southern Arabia an oracle was, locally enough, a 'place/instrument of asking' (ms'l). The deity would often reply directly to interrogators by 'making them see' (hr'yhw) a vision ... or a dream ... or even speaking personally to them. Otherwise deities might convey their message indirectly via a medium. At the santuary of Jar al-Labba, west of Bayda, two stones were found bearing inscriptions ... unfortunately fragmentary, that detail the procedure for soliciting 'a divine response'. The method seems to have been to bring, and perhaps immediately sacrifice, an oblation, then to 'ask at the oracle over the sacrificial alter'. Next one must wait until the attendant 'delivered the oracular reply by the inspiration of 'Athtar', and finally offer a thanksgiving sacrifice upon receipt of 'a favourable response'. The ritual for this included such acts as a proclamation of 'a blood-offering poured out', 'turning towards the boundary marked by this pillar once and towards its corresponding one three times' and 'bowing down while turning about thrice'. The oracle was apparently not to be consulted at random: certain days of certain months are carefully specified on which the ceremonies took place. The mention in two places of a repetition of the sacrifices and of 'unpropitious omens or the evil eye' suggests that in some cases no pronouncement was forthcoming. The only recourse was then to repeat the sacrifices until an answer was given."<sup id="cite_ref-226" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-226">[226]</a></sup>

<i>Pilgrimage to the temple of Almaqah at Marib</i> - Largest scale
</p><p>"The inhabitants of the [Sabaean Cultural-Political Area] appear to have been obliged to perform the pilgrimage to Marib, to the central temples of Almaqah, once a year, in the Sabaean month d-'BHY."<sup id="cite_ref-227" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-227">[227]</a></sup> However, a decree suggests that the obligation was on the "representatives of the respective groups and naturally not by all the inhabitants of the [Sabaean cultural-political area] without exception."<sup id="cite_ref-228" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-228">[228]</a></sup> When the pilgrims arrived they would perform rituals in the federal temple of Almaqah.<sup id="cite_ref-229" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-229">[229]</a></sup> A tithe would be paid to the central temple of Almaqah at Awwam by the Sabaeans, as their chief deity, but also by representatives of non-Sabaeans within the Sabaean Cultural-Political Area.<sup id="cite_ref-230" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-230">[230]</a></sup> Pilgrimage occurred at time of the summer rains<sup id="cite_ref-231" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-231">[231]</a></sup> - dysphoric aspect to it.

</p><p><br>
<i>Dedications to Almaqah</i> - Most frequent (most dysphoric?)
</p><p>"The dedications to Almaqah, the lord of Awwam, were made by the members of all the main strata, tribes and groups of the [Sabaean Cultural-Political Area, by the Sabaeans and non-Sabaeans, by kings, royal or qyalite maqtawis and clients of all the types, by the Sabaean aristocracy and ordinary Sabaeans (and Fayshanites), by qayls of all the main tribes and ordinary tribesmen from all the main parts of the SCPA.

Dedications could be more frequent than once per year.
</p><p>"In ancient times south Arabians would make over themselves and their immediate family to deities; since many such dedicants were of high status, this probably did not mean any sort of sacred slavery, but rather full allegiance to the cult community. ... At a later  date worshippers would dedicate statuettes of themselves rather than themselves directly, though the aim probably remained much the same, to receive the protection of a divinity. Human sacrifice was occasionally practised in Arabia, the victims generally being prisoners-of-war, who represented the victory-giving deity's share in the booty (Mi'sal 7, 9; Jidhma 2-3), though other forms may have existed."<sup id="cite_ref-235" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-235">[235]</a></sup> "Given the importance to Arabian religions of presenting gifts and sacrifices to the gods, some sort of alter was obviously essential. The god-stone could serve this purpose. The third-century AD philosopher Porphyry in his account of human sacrifice notes that 'the inhabitants of Duma in Arabia used each year to sacrifice a boy whom they buried beneath an alter that they treat as a cult-statue' (2.56)."<sup id="cite_ref-236" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-236">[236]</a></sup> "Beeston, A.F.L., 'Miscellaneous epigraphic notes II', Raydan 5, 1988, 5-32 (pp. 11-14 deal with the Mi'sal and Gidma texts relating to human sacrifice)."<sup id="cite_ref-237" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-237">[237]</a></sup>
</p><p>Offerings at temples and holy places made "on a regular basis, especially in more developed cultures where service was organised more along the lines of that at a royal court ... in south Arabia it is common to read on an alter the like of the following: 'On this the king will slaughter a bull on the ninth day of the month of Dhu Thawr' ... The agricultural/pastoral calendar would also provide its own set of dates for offerings; in particular there was the very widespread practice of making first-fruit/first-born offerings (fr'), presenting to the relevant deity a proportion of the crops harvested/young animals born in gratitude for that deity's bounty. And there were various occasions in the life of the individual that usually entailed offerings, such as birth, puberty, marriage and death, for these were the times of transition, and transition was always regarded as a phenomenon rife with potential danger that was best minimised by involving the gods on one's side. The commemoration of some great event, historical or otherwise, might also become a set part of the calendar and inevitably require its own offerings ... There would also be extraordinary occasions for offerings, which were provided by special or exceptional occurrences in the life of the community and the individual and have no fixed times. These might be joyous occasions ... though all too often it was crises that demanded such action  ... Given the importance of rain everywhere in Arabia, droughts would necessitate sacrifices, and in south Arabia there was a special ceremony involving sacrifice carried out by certain specialised religious personnel (rshw ...). If benefits were forthcoming or misfortunes were averted, then this would be a natural occasion for a thanksgiving offering. And after committing some offence or violating some taboo an expiatory offering would help to restore the normal good relationship between man and deity. This practice is attested in south Arabia ..."<sup id="cite_ref-238" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-238">[238]</a></sup>
</p><p>Animals chosen for sacrifice mainly camel, shaeep and oxen "game is rarely mentioned, and poultry never. The rite of sacrifice was not tied to a particular location, though we mostly hear of it being performed in some sort of sacred place. Nor was the execution of the rite restricted to a priestly group, but could be carried out by the dedicants themselves (though probably not women) or, in the case of a communal sacrifice, by the head of the relevant social grouping (household, lineage, clan etc.). Of the actual mechanics of the rite we know very little. There must have been special words pronounced and actions performed to convey the drama of the event ..."<sup id="cite_ref-239" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-239">[239]</a></sup> A sacrificial ceremony could involve a procession, a hymn, walking around animal in a circle, an animal such as a camel would be killed with a sword and the executioner would taste the blood.

</p><p>"The prevalence of infanticide at the prophet's time among the Tamim and their neihbours, or, according to other authorities, among the Tamim, Cais, Asad, Hodhail and Bakr-Wail, is connected by the Kamil with a terrible seven years' drought, and such an occurence might well give new life to an ancient usage which was already beginning to offend the more advanced minds. But infanticide was not a new thing, nor was it limited to one group of tribes; the mother of 'Amr b. Kolthum, daughter of Mohalhil the Taghlibite, was sentenced by her father to be destroyed but saved by her mother (Agh. ix. 192). This must have been about A.D. 500, or earlier; and more than a century later, Mohammed, when he took Mecca and received the homage of the  women in the most advanced centre of Arabian civilisation, still deemed it necessary formally to demand from them a promise not to commit child-murder (Ibn al-Athir, Bul. e., ii. 105). In Arabia, as among other barbarous peoples, child-murder was carried out in such a way that no blood was shed: the infant was buried alive, and often, if we may believe Zamakhshari on Sur. lxxxi. 8, the grave was ready by the side of the bed on which the daughter was born. The same authority says that girls were sometimes spared till the age of six, then adorned and led forth by their fater and cast into a pit in the wilderness. This, however, seems to be rather a kind of human sacrifice, such as we know the Arabs to have practised, for the father said to the mother, 'Dress her up that I may bring her to her mothers' ... i.e. to the goddesses or Banat allah. According to the proverb (Fr., Ar. Pr. i. 229), to bury a daughter was regarded not only as a virtuous but as a generous deed, which is intelligible if the reason was that there would be fewer mouths to fill in the tribe. And so in Hamasa, p. 4, we find that 'Osaim the Fazarite did not dare to save alive his daughter LAcita, without concealing her from his people, although she was his only child. This implies that the custom was very deeply rooted indeed. ... Te father, however, seems usually not to have killed the daughter himself, but to have bidden the mother do so. This appears in the story of 'Amr's mother, in Zamakhshari's account, and in the prophet's charge to the women of Mecca, and is perhaps an indication that the custom took shape before the rise of paternity. Indeed that the pressure of famine had far more to do with the origin of infanticide than family pride had, can be doubtful to no one who realises the fact ... that the nomads of Arabia suffer constantly from hunger during a great part of the year."<sup id="cite_ref-241" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-241">[241]</a></sup>

And there were various occasions in the life of the individual that usually entailed offerings, such as birth, puberty, marriage and death, for these were the times of transition, and transition was always regarded as a phenomenon rife with potential danger that was best minimised by involving the gods on one's side. The commemoration of some great event, historical or otherwise, might also become a set part of the calendar and inevitably require its own offerings ... There would also be extraordinary occasions for offerings, which were provided by special or exceptional occurrences in the life of the community and the individual and have no fixed times. These might be joyous occasions ... though all too often it was crises that demanded such action  ... Given the importance of rain everywhere in Arabia, droughts would necessitate sacrifices, and in south Arabia there was a special ceremony involving sacrifice carried out by certain specialised religious personnel (rshw ...). If benefits were forthcoming or misfortunes were averted, then this would be a natural occasion for a thanksgiving offering.

This must have been about A.D. 500, or earlier; and more than a century later, Mohammed, when he took Mecca and received the homage of the  women in the most advanced centre of Arabian civilisation, still deemed it necessary formally to demand from them a promise not to commit child-murder (Ibn al-Athir, Bul. e., ii. 105). In Arabia, as among other barbarous peoples, child-murder was carried out in such a way that no blood was shed: the infant was buried alive, and often, if we may believe Zamakhshari on Sur. lxxxi. 8, the grave was ready by the side of the bed on which the daughter was born. The same authority says that girls were sometimes spared till the age of six, then adorned and led forth by their fater and cast into a pit in the wilderness. This, however, seems to be rather a kind of human sacrifice, such as we know the Arabs to have practised, for the father said to the mother, 'Dress her up that I may bring her to her mothers' ... i.e. to the goddesses or Banat allah. According to the proverb (Fr., Ar. Pr. i. 229), to bury a daughter was regarded not only as a virtuous but as a generous deed, which is intelligible if the reason was that there would be fewer mouths to fill in the tribe. And so in Hamasa, p. 4, we find that 'Osaim the Fazarite did not dare to save alive his daughter LAcita, without concealing her from his people, although she was his only child. This implies that the custom was very deeply rooted indeed. ... Te father, however, seems usually not to have killed the daughter himself, but to have bidden the mother do so. This appears in the story of 'Amr's mother, in Zamakhshari's account, and in the prophet's charge to the women of Mecca, and is perhaps an indication that the custom took shape before the rise of paternity. Indeed that the pressure of famine had far more to do with the origin of infanticide than family pride had, can be doubtful to no one who realises the fact ... that the nomads of Arabia suffer constantly from hunger during a great part of the year."<sup id="cite_ref-352" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-352">[352]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Communal feast ♥</b> "From all regions of Arabia we have evidence, sometimes archaeological and sometimes literary, for communal meals ... These might be joyous affairs, such as circumcision and marriage feasts, when whole communities came together to witness the rites and share in the repast. Others were more sombre, such as funerary banquets ... But all such occasions of communal consumption served many functions beyond the immediate one of satiation. They often had social aims, for eating and drinking together promotes companionship, so confirming and reinforcing group identity and solidarity. If that group was a cultic entity, then communal meals took on the significance of a declaration of confessional allegiance, and to eat the consecrated food of non-believers might be regarded as an abomination. As the eucharistic meal of Christians, the divinities themselves might be present, and by admitting man to their table they bound him to them in a special relationship. There could also be a political dimension, for it was by sponsoring public feasts that an aspiring leader became a man of influence and renown, his cavalier generosity to others creating obligations of reciprocity as well as earning him repute. A particularly long-lived form of feasting is the ritual banquet (mrzh'), a celebration attended by a select group of colleagues in honour of a particular deity or deities. It is attested as early as the thirteenth century BC in a text from Ugarit, which describes the preparations taken by the chief of the gods for his guests, the slaughtering of animals and the provision of wine."<sup id="cite_ref-353" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-353">[353]</a></sup> "Feasts might also be profane affairs, just plain revelry and camraderie.

Kolthum, daughter of Mohalhil the Taghlibite, was sentenced by her father to be destroyed but saved by her mother (Agh. ix. 192). This must have been about A.D. 500, or earlier; and more than a century later, Mohammed, when he took Mecca and received the homage of the  women in the most advanced centre of Arabian civilisation, still deemed it necessary formally to demand from them a promise not to commit child-murder (Ibn al-Athir, Bul. e., ii. 105). In Arabia, as among other barbarous peoples, child-murder was carried out in such a way that no blood was shed: the infant was buried alive, and often, if we may believe Zamakhshari on Sur. lxxxi. 8, the grave was ready by the side of the bed on which the daughter was born. The same authority says that girls were sometimes spared till the age of six, then adorned and led forth by their father and cast into a pit in the wilderness. This, however, seems to be rather a kind of human sacrifice, such as we know the Arabs to have practised, for the father said to the mother, 'Dress her up that I may bring her to her mothers' ... i.e. to the goddesses or Banat allah. According to the proverb (Fr., Ar. Pr. i. 229), to bury a daughter was regarded not only as a virtuous but as a generous deed, which is intelligible if the reason was that there would be fewer mouths to fill in the tribe. And so in Hamasa, p. 4, we find that 'Osaim the Fazarite did not dare to save alive his daughter Lacita, without concealing her from his people, although she was his only child. This implies that the custom was very deeply rooted indeed. ... The father, however, seems usually not to have killed the daughter himself, but to have bidden the mother do so. This appears in the story of 'Amr's mother, in Zamakhshari's account, and in the prophet's charge to the women of Mecca, and is perhaps an indication that the custom took shape before the rise of paternity. Indeed that the pressure of famine had far more to do with the origin of infanticide than family pride had, can be doubtful to no one who realises the fact ... that the nomads of Arabia suffer constantly from hunger during a great part of the year."<sup id="cite_ref-401" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-401">[401]</a></sup></dd>

Muslims refer to the pre- Islamic period as the jahiliyya, the “time of ignorance” before the coming of the Koranic revelation. From a historical rather than a theological viewpoint, the term is an apt one, although for entirely different reasons. Almost all of the Muslim sources on the pre-Islamic period and the years spanning Muhammad’s career are relatively late, having been written a century and a half or more after the events they purport to describe. (They were of course based at least in part on material which circulated orally much earlier.) In recent years, several scholars have cast serious doubt upon the accuracy of the traditional picture of pre- and early-Islamic Arabian society, much of it relying on those late Muslim sources. The problem with those sources, in a nutshell, is that they were put together and used by Muslims to settle later controversies and to justify retrospectively an Islamic Heilsgeschichte, and so reflect more what later Muslims wanted to remember than what was necessarily historically accurate. [...] At least one corner of Arabia supported an agricultural and citied civilization on a par with those of the Fertile Crescent. The southwestern corner of the peninsula, focused on the modern country of Yemen, was Arabia Felix, “fruitful” or “happy Arabia,” a land (unlike the rest of the peninsula) of significant rainfall and lush vegetation. In the centuries before the rise of Islam, its environmental conditions and agricultural and trading economy (situated as it was at a strategic point on the sea route from the Mediterranean to both India and East Africa) supported a material culture and political traditions much more like those of the rest of the Near East than those of central Arabia, and the religious situation there was markedly different than that elsewhere in the peninsula."<sup id="cite_ref-402" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-402">[402]</a></sup>

<p><b>Supernatural beings (e.g., gods, spirits, ancestors)</b>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>♠ Number of officially sanctioned supernatural beings ♣ polytheism ♥</b> "Up until about the fourth century AD almost all the inhabitants of Arabia were polytheists. [...] The patron deity ( shym ) of a people was of more immediate significance in south Arabia than the remoter figure of ‘Athtar. The four principal peoples had as their patrons Almaqah (Sabaeans), Wadd (Minaeans), ‘Amm (Qatabanians) and Sayin (Hadramites), and each people was collectively termed the ‘children’ of their respective patron deity. The last would be characterised as the ‘lord’ of the shrine that served as the cultic centre for his people (e.g. ‘Almaqah lord of Awwam’, the principal temple in Marib)."<sup id="cite_ref-415" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-415">[415]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Omnipresent supernatural beings ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Omniscient supernatural beings ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Omnipotent supernatural beings ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></dd>
<dd><b>♠ High Gods (creator gods) ♣ active ♥</b> The following suggests that the gods were believed to intervene in human affairs, and that they were also somehow linked to group values, but there appears to be no explicit evidence that the gods specifically rewarded ethical behaviour and/or punished transgressions--indeed, it seems that punishments were taken care of by human authorities (and even here the areas in which the names of the gods were invoked seem to do mostly with administrative matters). "Up until about the fourth century AD almost all the inhabitants of Arabia were polytheists. We know many of the names of their deities, since the most common aim of Arabian inscriptions was to invoke the gods in some way, usually petitioning them or thanking them. But names alone do not tell us much, and the brevity of most of these texts makes it difficult for us to understand the nature and function of the gods or to comprehend what they meant to their worshippers. They are also frequently assigned epithets (compare Christian designation of Mary as ‘mother of God’, ‘the virgin’, etc.), but without the myths and narratives to decode them these are not usually very informative. Loosely, of course, the gods represented those forces that were important to the lives of their devotees but beyond their control: rain, fertility, health, love, death and so on. By seeking the favour of the gods, typically making some votive gift, one might thereby influence these forces. Thus one member of the northwest Yemeni tribe of Amir ‘dedicated to his lord Dhu Samawi in his temple . . . a bronze statuette of a she-camel that Dhu Samawi may grant him the wellbeing of himself and his children as well as the wellbeing and safety of his camel’ (Ja 2956). But how exactly this tribesman conceived of his divine patron and to what degree the latter affected his life we do not know. [...] The patron deity ( shym ) of a people was of more immediate significance in south Arabia than the remoter figure of ‘Athtar. The four principal peoples had as their patrons Almaqah (Sabaeans), Wadd (Minaeans), ‘Amm (Qatabanians) and Sayin (Hadramites), and each people was collectively termed the ‘children’ of their respective patron deity. The last would be characterised as the ‘lord’ of the shrine that served as the cultic centre for his people (e.g. ‘Almaqah lord of Awwam’, the principal temple in Marib). These patron deities played a vital socio-political role in that their cults served as the focus of a people’s cohesion and loyalty and functioned as an expression of communal will and activity. For example the tithes owing on land and its produce were paid to the gods (via their human servants), who also saw to its redistribution: Frankincense after being collected is conveyed to Shabwa on camels, one of the gates of the city being opened for its admission. The kings have made it a capital offence for camels so laden to turn aside from the high road. At Shabwa a tithe estimated by measure and not by weight is taken by the priests for the god they call Sayin, and the incense is not allowed to be put on the market until this has been done. This tithe is drawn on to defray what is a public expenditure, for actually on a fixed number of days the god graciously entertains guests at a banquet. (Pliny 12.63) Tithes exacted on the same traffic by the Minaean deities could be discharged by public works, such as construction of town walls, undertaken by the tithe-payers (e.g. M 29). In Qataban, when the king ‘requested’ a regulation dealing with water supplies, the promulgation of it was made in the name of the god Anbay (Ry 478). The shared cult of ‘Amm of Labakh enabled cooperation between a group of Qatabanian landlords and their tenants in far-off Dathinah (RES 3688- 89, 3691- 93). In Saba military campaigns were carried out ‘for Almaqah and the Sabaeans’ (e.g. RES 3945), and fines for all manner of offences were paid ‘to Almaqah and the kings of Saba’ (e.g. Ja 576). In other words it was the cult of the patron deity that allowed the community to function as a coherent entity (as opposed to a mass of discrete localised kinship groups), acting as a sort of social glue."<sup id="cite_ref-416" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-416">[416]</a></sup></dd></dl>
