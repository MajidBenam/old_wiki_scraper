</p><p>The timeline here largely follows Kelle (2007:21-23).

Circa 841 BCE, Jehu seizes the throne and pays tribute to Assyria. For the next century, Israel is in a constant state of vassalage to either Assyria or Aram, as their respective political fortunes wax and wane. Finally, in 727 BCE, Israel joins in a regional rebellion against Assyria that ends with its dissolution as a polity.

Assuming that Jeroboam ruled at least part of his reign from Tirzah, as did his son Nadab, as well as Tibni, Tirzah was the seat of the  first six or seven northern kings, for a period of forty to fifty years. I see no reason to doubt the authenticity of the consistent and deeply rooted information on Tirzah as the capital of Israel.

</p><p>"Tirzah lost its importance in the early ninth century, when Omri (884-873 b.c.e.) moved the capital of the northern kingdom to Samaria, possibly in his desire to establish a link with the coastal plain and the port of Dor (de Vaux 1967, 382). Indeed, the beginning of the transformation of Israel into a more complex kingdom came with the construction of the first palace at Samaria, probably by Omri. A full-scale urban transformation of the capital and the kingdom characterizes the more advanced phase of the Omride dynasty, probably in the days of Ahab (873-852 b.c.e.)."<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>

<p>_Short description_
</p><p>The ancient kingdom of Israel 1030-722 CE was a monarchy established by Israelite people that was eventually conquered by the Assyrian Empire. Initially a monarchic union with Judah, around 930 BCE the Northern Kingdom (Israel) gained autonomy. In the 9th century Israel entered an anti-Assyria coalition but from Jehu (841 BCE) paid them tribute and thereafter were frequently a vassal of the Mesopotamian empire. After a revolt against Assyria in 727 CE the Assyrians ended the polity sending many of its inhabitants into exile.
</p><p>The century authorities ruled through administrative centers and fortresses sites that had "public buildings and ... large open spaces."<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> Local administration may have been through tribal elders who may have been responsible for tax collection. Our image of a centralized monarchy (for some of or the whole of the period) might be tempered by the ideas of Pfoh (2008) who has argued Israel was actually a "patronage kingdom" in which a monarchy did not control a truly unitary state. Nevertheless, Israel possessed a standing army with a strong chariot corps, and used weapons of iron and bronze. Fortifications were many and imposing, and the Palace of Omri was one of the grandest in the Ancient Near East.
</p><p>At its height, Israel imposed tribute on many of the surrounding kingdoms, not only Judah but Moab, Edom, and perhaps others as well. The Israelite population primarily lived in cities and towns in the hills, with fortified cities protecting the frontiers on the plains and dominating major trade routes through the region. Trade linked Israel with its northern neighbor Phoenicia, particularly through the port of Dor. At the height of its power, Israel was also a significant military force, contributing the largest contingent to the regional coalition that turned back Assyria's first attempt to conquer the Levant.
</p><p>At least some of the population was literate even before the 10th Century BCE, though the prevalence of literacy is disputed. While the majority of the populace lived in small towns and villages, a significant fraction lived in walled cities such as the capital, Samaria. Most of the economy was in agriculture and pastoral production; staples for export included grain, wine, and oil. In the eighth century BCE the population likely exceeded well over a quarter of a million people, a vast increase on the less than 100,000 people estimated for the earliest times.
</p><p><br>
</p><p>_Oren's long description_
</p><p>How the Kingdom of Israel began is a matter of dispute. The Bible depicts it as originally being the greater part of the old Israelite tribal confederation, and then a part of the United Monarchy under Saul, David, and Solomon (c. 1030 BCE)—before seceding during the rule of Rehaboam, and forming its own state. This narrative is more or less accepted by some archaeologists such as Mazar, while others such as Finkelstein assert that Israel actually emerged first from a process of gradual state formation, with the southern kingdom of Judah emerging later.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>
</p><p>Regardless, the two kingdoms always had close interactions, and the northern kingdom of Israel was almost always the dominant one. At its height, Israel imposed tribute on many of the surrounding kingdoms, not only Judah but Moab, Edom, and perhaps others as well. The Israelite population primarily lived in cities and towns in the hills, with fortified cities protecting the frontiers on the plains and dominating major trade routes through the region. Trade linked Israel with its northern neighbor Phoenicia, particularly through the port of Dor. At the height of its power, Israel was also a significant military force, contributing the largest contingent to the regional coalition that turned back Assyria's first attempt to conquer the Levant. Israel featured a standing army with a strong chariot corps, with weapons of iron and bronze. Fortifications were many and imposing, and the Palace of Omri was one of the grandest in the Ancient Near East.
</p><p>However, starting with the assassination of the Omrid king Jehoram by Jehu (c. 841 BCE), Israel's fortunes waned; and it spent the rest of its existence as the tributary of either Aram or Assyria, depending on which of the two empires were ascendent. Even when the economy of Israel flourished during particular periods of the next century (as attested to by the greater incidence of luxury goods in archaeological finds), Israel was still subject to the depredations of foreign powers, being invaded several times. Ultimately, following an ill-fated rebellion against Assyria, the polity of Israel was dissolved (c. 722 BCE), its people exiled, and the land turned into an Assyrian province.
</p><p>Israelite politics were marked with instability. In contrast to the kingdom of Judah, which featured a single ruling dynasty that traced its beginnings to David, Israelite kings frequently met violent ends. These would typically be at the hands of rebellious military commanders who would seize the throne, though such rebels ran the risk of being deposed themselves in short order. Zimri, one rebel captain, would rule for only a single week before losing the support of the army to rival captain Omri, founder of the Omrid Dynasty.
</p><p>At least some of the population was literate even before the 10th Century BCE, though the prevalence of literacy is disputed. While the majority of the populace lived in small towns and villages, a significant fraction lived in walled cities such as the capital, Samaria. Most of the economy was in agriculture and pastoral production; staples for export included grain, wine, and oil.
</p><p>A word of caution is in order about coding methodology. Much of the evidence we have about this polity comes from archaeological finds. However, the brute fact of an archaeological artifact is often used as the basis for considerable interpretation and conjecture. Methods have been improving over time, but still some archaeologists tend to leap far ahead of what the evidence will support. Additionally, the meaning of many finds is hotly disputed by archaeologists, each faction insisting for its point of view.
</p><p>Worse, scholars of this particular polity often operate with ideological motives - either to prove the essential historicity of the Bible, or to disprove it—which can distort their claims. Israel Finkelstein, for example, once claimed that King David never existed, before having to revise his view after the discovery of the Tel Dan Stela.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> (He now <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/print/2010/12/david-and-solomon/draper-text">believes</a>, as <i>National Geographic</i> puts it, that David was "a raggedy upstart akin to Pancho Villa.") His "Low Chronology" seems to have been motivated by the attempt to disprove the early existence of the United Monarchy, and the weight of the evidence now contradicts the chronology (while still inconclusive on the matter of the United Monarchy).<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> In general, it seems that many archaeologists treat the absence of evidence as evidence of absence—risky to do, considering that new finds are unearthed practically every month.
</p><p>In short, every data point that is backed up with archaeology must be considered provisional, and new discoveries can totally upend our picture of what happened. As can new interpretations that correct erroneous early interpretations, a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~fisher/hst140/MotelOfMysteries.html">constant danger</a> with motivated archaeologists.

</p><p>"The central hill country—between the Jezreel and the Beer-sheba Valleys—is well known archaeologically from both excavations and intensive survey projects.  The surveys, mainly those conducted in the 1980s, revealed a massive wave of settlement that swept throughout this region in the Iron I (Finkelstein 1988; 1995; Zertal 1994; Ofer 1994).  The main concentration of sites can be found in the northern part of this region, between Jerusalem and the Jezreel Valley.  The settlement process may have started in the  final phase of the Late Bronze Age (the late thirteenth or early twelfth centuries b.c.e.), accelerated in the early Iron I (the late twelfth to mid-eleventh century), and reached its peak in the late Iron I (the late eleventh and  first half of the tenth centuries b.c.e.). In the late Iron I there were approximately 250 sites in this area (compared to ca. 30 sites in the Late Bronze Age), with a total built-up area that can be estimated at roughly 220 hectares (ca. 50 hectares in the Late Bronze Age). Using the broadly accepted, average density coefficient of two hundred people living on one built-up hectare in premodern societies, the late Iron I population can be estimated at circa 45,000 people."<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>
</p><p>"Estimation of population is based on the results of surface surveys; if done properly, the collection of pottery sherds at a given site can shed light on the size of the site in every period of habitation. Accordingly, one can draw a settlement map for a given period with all sites, classified according to size, and compute the total built-up area. Deploying a density coefficient (number of people living on one built-up hectare in premodern, traditional towns and villages), it is possible to reach the total number of inhabitants.  The population of [the Northern Kingdom of] Israel on both sides of the Jordan River in its peak prosperity in the middle of the eighth century can accordingly be estimated at 350,000—three times larger than the population of Judah of that time (Broshi and Finkelstein 1992)."<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>
</p><p>It should be noted that these estimates are highly speculative, and there is reason to believe that they underestimate the true population by a considerable amount. "Some of the densities recently put forward for area coefficients have been based on unwalled, premodern villages…. How similar is such a village to a walled Bronze or Iron Age town or city? Although this is not a case of comparing apples and oranges (more like oranges and grapefruit), it seems probable that the economic constraints of building a defensive system put a permanent physical limit on the settlement area," leading to higher population densities.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>

<p>"Volkmar Fritz identifies three general settlement types: (1) ring-shaped villages, (2) agglomerated villages, and (3) farmsteads. Characteristic of the first type—ring-shaped villages—is the arrangement of houses in a closed circle or oval, with an open area in the center, an arrangement that possibly functioned as a means of defense, as well as providing an open area for keeping animals. The agglomerated village type consists of individual buildings, or complexes of several buildings, with streets of varying width and irregular open areas left between the individual units. The edges of this village type are open, and living space is relatively close and restricted. The third type of settlement—farmsteads—consists simply of single buildings or groups of buildings surrounded by a widely extending wall, which may have functioned as an enclosure for animals."<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup>

Indeed, the beginning of the transformation of Israel into a more complex kingdom came with the construction of the first palace at Samaria, probably by Omri.

<p>There are two potential candidates for the title of "most impressive building". The first, and more likely, is the so-called Palace of Omri, in Samaria. "The palace was built of massive, roughly dressed blocks on a solid core of rock with perpendicular scarp made by quarrying away the rock around it…. The part of the palace that was exposed (foundations of walls only) is circa 55 x 40 m in size. The Samaria palace is one of the largest Iron Age buildings known in the Levant; in scale and grandeur it matches the Iron II palaces of northern Syria ( g. 23). The palace was surrounded by several auxiliary buildings of an administrative nature on the west and northeast."<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup>
</p><p>The second, and far more speculative, is Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem. However, due to the political sensitivities of that site, there has been almost no archaeological work done, and there is no firm evidence of the date of its construction. It would only be considered part of the present polity if it were indeed built during the presumed United Monarchy period, for if it were built later it would have been after the kingdoms divided and thus would be part of a separate polity. Furthermore, its dimensions as described in the Bible would make it smaller than the Palace of Omri, and it would only qualify as "most impressive" if its building materials were more costly than those of Omri (e.g. overlays of gold etc.), which cannot be verified. For all these reasons, this entry describes what is known about the Palace of Omri.

As a rough example, a family of four who received 70% of its sustenance from such grain would need to refill such a jar every two or three days (calculations based on Clark and Haswell 1967 with modifications by Jongman 2008: 598-99)."<sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup> Wet volume was in <i>log</i> and <i>hin</i>.</dd>

As such it transmits Judahite ideas regarding territory, kingship, temple, and cult. Moreover, even what some scholars consider as the early layers of the history of ancient Israel, such as the books of Samuel (e.g., McCarter 1994; Halpern 2001; Römer and de Pury 2000, 123-28; Hutton 2009), were written after the northern kingdom was vanquished by Assyria and its elite was deported.…  The original northern texts—or at least some of them—could have been written as early as the  first half of the eighth century b.c.e. in the capital Samaria or in the temple of YHWH at Bethel, located on the northern border of Judah (also Fleming 2012, 314-21; for a later date of compilation at Bethel, see Knauf 2006; Davies 2007a, 2007b; for the archaeology of Bethel, see Finkelstein and Singer-Avitz 2009).

Infantry formed the primary fighting force and included spearmen, equipped with spears, lances, javelins, and shields; archers, utilizing bows of various sizes, carrying quivers on their backs, and often accompanied by separate shield-bearers; and slingers, organized in combat pairs."<sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup>

Except for the capital Samaria, only Jezreel seems to have been located in the heartland of Israel.

<dd><b> ♠ Complex fortifications ♣ present ♥ </b> “During the United Monarchy much use was made of the so-called casemate wall, which consisted of two parallel walls joined at determined intervals by perpendicular walls. Casemate walls could be freestanding, as at Megiddo VA, or could be integrated into city buildings, as at Beer-sheba II. Casemate walls could be used as soldiers’ dwellings, or to store food or weapons that could be used in case of siege. Sometimes the stone casemates served as a framework, which was filled with earth. From the Divided Monarchy onwards massive walls are more frequent. The earliest type is the inset and offset type, built with sections of around 6m long that alternately project and recede. The degree of projection was 0.5-0.6m. Megiddo IVA is the best example of this type.”<sup id="cite_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-79">[79]</a></sup></dd>

<p><b> ♠ Standing armies ♣ present ♥ </b> “By the reigns of David and Solomon (c.1050-920), the HB/OT claims the presence of a standing army that included chariots and cavalry…. Both biblical and non-biblical sources confirm that standing armies were in place in Israel and Judah by the Assyrian period in the 9th century.”<sup id="cite_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-80">[80]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Uniformity of equipment ♣ [absent; present] ♥ </b> It is generally believed that the bulk of the military force was light infantry mobilized from popular militias; these would most likely provide their own equipment. The standing army, however, would be equipped by the crown. <sup id="cite_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-81">[81]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Total army ♣ [1,000-20,000] ♥ </b> Calculating this is speculative. While some sources for army sizes exist, modern scholars consider them to be likely exaggerated. For example, the Assyrian Kurkh Monolith of Shalmaneser III describes the events of the Battle of Qarqar, and puts Ahab's contingent at 10,000 infantry and 2,000 chariots. However, the Assyrians were known to exaggerate the numbers of their foes, so as to heighten the achievement of victory or explain away losses.<sup id="cite_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-82">[82]</a></sup> Other explanations for the apparently overlarge army exist. “A better explanation can be derived from the fact that Assyrian records of this battle make no mention of Israel’s immediate neighbors of Judah, Moab, and Edom, kingdoms described elsewhere as being under the influence, and perhaps even under the control, of Israel during this period…. Thus, another possible explanation for the size of Israel’s forces at Qarqar is that kingdoms like Judah, Moab, Edom, and perhaps Phoenicia contributed contingents that were counted under the banner of Israel.”<sup id="cite_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-83">[83]</a></sup> Army sizes given in the Bible are considered by scholars to be equally exaggerated. Partly this is because they do not match well with scholarly population estimates of the time (though see above about the reliability of such estimates), and partly this is by analogy to the observed boasting of other ANE monarchies such as Egypt and Assyria.

</p><p><b> ♠ Largest fielded army ♣ [5,000-15,000] ♥ </b> Assuming this to be the Battle of Qarqar, see above note.

Assuming about 150 km travel distance from Samaria to Dan, that would be about 6 days of travel.
</p><p><b> ♠ Sources of recruits ♣ domestic; mercenary ♥ </b> Aside from the popular militias and occasional episodes of mass conscription, there were also native standing forces that gradually displaced the kings' reliance on mercenaries over time.<sup id="cite_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-85">[85]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Procurement of equipment and animals ♣ by the state; by soldiers ♥ </b> The popular militias almost certainly provided their own equipment.

<p>A collective ritual is a ritual in which two or more people participate. With the official cult we refer to the set of collective ritual practices that are most closely associated with legitimation of the power structure (including elites, if any).
</p><p>In the case of ancient Israel, coding is made difficult because of considerable uncertainty over exactly which cult was the "official" one at which time, and in any event what their practices were. <span style="color:red"> is there any info on any ritual system that would allow for these variables to be coded? 'Official' here can be somewhat flexible -- it can mean supported by the state, or simply the ritual system most widely practiced, or (for practical reasons) jus thte system we happen to know the most about </span> Notably, the Bible states (I Kings 12:24-29) that the monarch of the seceding Northern Kingdom severed its links with the Jerusalem cult, setting up new cults instead to bolster his power. Later, King Ahab is portrayed in the Bible as having sponsored the worship of Phoenician deities, but the extent to which this sponsorship lasted, and the practices involved, are unknown. "Regardless of the identity of the deities that were worshiped in northern shrines (see, e.g., Köckert 2010), in the ninth century cult had not yet been centralized, seemingly not even at a given site. Archaeological evidence of cult at Samaria is lacking, and the same holds true for Jezreel."<sup id="cite_ref-98" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-98">[98]</a></sup> Archaeologists such as William Dever also believe that the "folk" religion was quite different from the "official" religion, with most of the archaeological finds relating to the former.<sup id="cite_ref-99" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-99">[99]</a></sup>
</p><p>In general, however, we can say that inhabitants of the Northern Kingdom most frequently worshipped local deities, either Canaanite or Phoenician (for example, in II Kings 1, King Ahaziah is depicted seeking an oracle from Baal-Zevul of Ekron), with many cultic figurines having been found throughout the region; as well as YHWH, localized to various places such as "YHWH of Samaria" and "YHWH of Teman".<sup id="cite_ref-100" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-100">[100]</a></sup> Whether this use of YHWH implies continuity with the older Canaanite deity El, or is a syncretism of a distinct Biblical religion, is disputed by scholars. Animal sacrifice was clearly a part of religious ritual; some scholars argue that all meat needed to be consecrated to a deity before eating. It is likely that human sacrifice was practiced at times,<sup id="cite_ref-101" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-101">[101]</a></sup> but the archaeological evidence for same is inconclusive. Details of specific rituals are completely absent.

<p><b>♠ RA ♣ ♥</b> <i>This polity was coded through pers. comm. with Oren Litwin</i>
</p><p><b>♠ Expert ♣ Oren Litwin ♥</b>
</p><p><b>♠ Editor ♣ ♥</b>
</p><p>Coding the regime and political-culture variables of Phase II for this polity has significant difficulties. While many scholars have undertaken subtle analyses of the Israelite political culture,<sup id="cite_ref-102" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-102">[102]</a></sup> these analyses are usually based on the Bible—both because of its later historical significance, and because it is simply the only comprehensive source we have for the time period. But the Bible is an imperfect source for the Phase II variables. Its concerns are not anthropological and it often silently assumes that the reader is familiar with existing cultural practice; as a result, it rarely describes the cultural features we are interested in explicitly. Furthermore, many scholars believe that the Bible was written centuries after the fact, as we noted above, rendering its use as a source problematic.
</p><p>On the other hand, even with the least sympathetic understanding of the Bible's historicity, we can at least say that it records a representation of the political memory of the times being written of. This is particularly the case since the Bible records political institutions that are startlingly different from those of the consolidated monarchies and empires surrounding Israel: chiefly, the pre-monarchical tribal confederation, and the conceptually limited monarchy, who does not make the law but is (in theory) bound by it in the same way that the common folk are. This latter concept was so unique that the Biblical tradition would provide the direct impetus for the growth of constitutional government in early modern Europe.<sup id="cite_ref-103" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-103">[103]</a></sup> It is unrealistic to suppose that such novel institutions would be invented out of whole cloth by a later writer, at a time and place (e.g. Babylonia) when the legitimacy of absolute kings was unquestioned; that gives us some confidence that the depictions are, at least in outline, reflective of some reality.
</p><p>Meanwhile, the Bible itself records that Israelite culture retained several features of the older Canaanite one, and that several kings tried to import political institutions and ideologies from surrounding polities such as Assyria in order to buttress their own authority. Thus, the lived experience of political institutions was likely different from the "ideal" system laid out in the Mosaic law, even in the best case.
</p><p>Therefore, in coding the following variables, the Bible will have significant weight, but need not be the final word. Where possible, the Bible and Biblical scholarship will be supplemented with the archaeological record, comparison with surrounding cultures, and (where necessary) inference from what is known about similar regimes in different settings.

<p>If we know little about the royal bureaucracy, we know practically nothing about local city officials.

The Bible refers variously to local notables as זקנים, "elders," שרים, "officers" or "commanders," and גדולים, "great ones," but their roles and how they were chosen are opaque.

<p>The details of the Israelite legal system are obscure. To date, no surviving legal documents or references to legal proceedings have been found from this period by archaeologists. Even the Bible does not fully describe the legal system; however, it seems that each significant town had some sort of justice system "at the gate of the city," administered by local זקנים (elders);<sup id="cite_ref-108" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-108">[108]</a></sup> I Kings 21 also includes an obscure category of notables called חורים (sometimes translated "nobles" or "prominent ones," literally "the pure, distinct, or shining ones," with the post-biblical meaning of "freemen") who took part in judicial proceedings. Priestly figures may have played some unspecified role as well, perhaps by administering supernatural ordeals in unusual circumstances. Guilt, according to biblical accounts, was primarily determined through testimony of at least two witnesses. The final verdict lay with the presiding judges. There is no reference to prosecuting or defending advocates.
</p><p>Additionally, several Biblical texts suggest that patriarchal heads would render judgments on matters internal to the family, up to and including capital punishment (e.g. Genesis 38). This would be consistent with other Middle-Eastern tribal societies down to the modern era. It is unclear where the authority to do so came from—whether it was recognized by the "official" law of the land, or whether it was a set of customary practices in opposition to the "official" law. (I would suspect the latter, as no explicit text in the Bible endorses such authority.)

<p>Whether a hereditary nobility existed during this time is unclear. If it did, it has no ideological justification at all in the Bible, whose ideology is broadly egalitarian. Surrounding cultures were, however, strongly stratified; so it is conceivable that Israelite kings may have tried to set up a nobility to reward their supporters. Ahab had his גדולים, "great ones" (II Kings 10:11), and other texts reference חורים, often translated as "nobles," but whether these actually reflected a hereditary nobility or simply prominent men is totally unknown. During the United Kingdom succession struggle of Solomon and Adoniyahu (depicted in I Kings 1), the key supporters of each side are priests, prophets, or military men; but that does not exclude a nobility arising later. (Relatedly, whether royal bureaucrats were selected or hereditary is also unknown, though families of powerful royal bureaucrats are attested to in the Southern Kingdom;<sup id="cite_ref-116" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-116">[116]</a></sup> and the line between "noble" and "bureaucrat" is fine indeed.)
</p><p>Kessler<sup id="cite_ref-117" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-117">[117]</a></sup> identifies the עמי הארץ ("people of the land") of the Southern Kingdom as a "landed aristocracy." Prominent and powerful people they certainly were, but to be a true aristocracy one must not simply have power, but some sort of formal caste privilege, for which evidence is unclear. But here we get to a question of definition: if one's father is wealthy and that wealth passes on to you, does that count as a "hereditary elite status" in our present sense? In any event, while one might infer the existence of a similar group in the Northern Kingdom, there is no explicit reference to them.

</p><p><b>♠ Expert ♣ Oren Litwin ♥</b>
</p><p><b>Description of the Normative Ideology</b>
</p><p>As noted above, Israelite norms were most likely an uneasy mix of Biblical, vestigial Canaanite, and Assyrian or other ANE polity.
</p><p>Under the Biblical ideology, the Israelite people (understood in the broad cultural sense here) were vassals of YHWH, who was their true king. However, that shared vassalage also meant that no individual had standing to oppress another, and underwrote a religious claim to something akin to egalitarianism (patriarchal, to be sure).<sup id="cite_ref-124" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-124">[124]</a></sup>
</p><p>"The picture of Canaanite religion is often drawn from the texts found at ancient Ugarit (in spheres outside religion, however, most scholars do not include Ugarit within the scope of Canaan). While the Ugaritians distinguished themselves from Canaanites, Ugaritic religious literature has enough links with later biblical literature to place Ugarit on a cultural continuum with Canaan.… A large number of male and female deities was worshiped throughout the area, known from Ugarit, the Bible, various Canaanite personal names, and inscriptions. The high god 'El, the father-god, head of the council of gods, lived on top of a mountain at the foot of which was the source of fresh water. Of the same 'generation' was Asherah, a marine goddess ('atiratu yammi at Ugarit); the gods at Ugarit are called her children and she is called creator of creatures.… These deities demonstrate continuity with those of the national religions of the Iron Age: Yahweh in Israel, for instance, is a storm god as well as an 'El figure (patriarch, head of the council). There is no evidence that Chemosh in Moab, Milkom in Ammon, and Qaws in Edom were any different. In fact, there is some slight evidence that they were similar; they were also national gods from the same time period, and the onomastica are similar; and the Mesha stela shows Chemosh leading Mesha in war and requiring a kind of 'holy war' destruction."<sup id="cite_ref-125" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-125">[125]</a></sup>
</p><p>"The four ranks in [Canaanite] society - royal, noble, peasant, and slave - were mirrored by four tiers of gods (Handy 1994; M. S. Smith 2004, pp. 101-5). At the top stood the divine patron and sometimes his spouse. In the second rank were the cosmic gods, who ruled aspects of the natural realm such as the storms that fertilized the land, the lights in the sky, the endlessly chaotic sea, the vast earth, and the eternal underworld. On the third level were the gods who assisted with practical aspects of daily life, such as gods of craftsmanship, gods of childbearing, and the family ancestors who had become gods after death. The lowest rank of the gods, corresponding to slaves in human society, were the messengers." <sup id="cite_ref-126" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-126">[126]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Rulers are legitimated by gods ♣ present ♥</b> "The religious politics of antiquity can be called “divine patronage” (Noll 2001a, pp. 207-15, 265-8). In most cases, it worked this way: a human king owed his authority to one god, his divine patron." <sup id="cite_ref-127" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-127">[127]</a></sup> "The rise of David as king over all Israel and his selection of Jerusalem as his political and religious capital plays a foundational role in the conceptualization and development of ancient Israelite religion because it establishes a close interrelationship between the Davidic kings and YHWH. This interrelationship is evident in YHWH's promise of an eternal dynasty to David immediately after David brings the ark of the covenant to Jerusalem in 2 Sam. 6. According to 2 Sam. 7, David had thought to build a “house” or Temple for YHWH once he had become king, but the prophet Nathan came to David and declared that YHWH did not desire a “house.” Instead, YHWH would build a “house,” i.e., a dynasty, for David so that his descendants would rule forever in Jerusalem. David never built the “house,” or Temple, for YHWH in Jerusalem, but his son Solomon did and thereby established the Davidic monarchy and the Jerusalem Temple as the two primary institutions of ancient Israel or Judah. In short, the House of David established and supported the Jerusalem Temple of YHWH, and YHWH established and supported the House of David." <sup id="cite_ref-128" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-128">[128]</a></sup>
</p><p>While this refers to the Southern Kingdom, it is clear from the Bible that rulers in the Northern Kingdom used a similar strategy. Jeroboam I sets up a competing cult to that in Jerusalem to legitimate his own kingship; Ahab establishes the worship of the Phoenician Baal; Jehu claims to have usurped the kingship from Ahab's sons acting as YHWH's agent.

When King Mesha of Moab fought in the name of his god Kemosh, he subjected his enemies to herem, a ritual slaughter of every man, woman, and child required by the god himself (Pritchard 1969a, pp. 320-1).

<dd> <b>♠ Ideological thought equates men and women ♣ absent ♥</b> "For example, since ancient Near Eastern society was patriarchal, treating women as subordinate to men, it follows logically that the divine patron also treated women this way. A biblical example illustrates the point (Noll 2001a, pp. 213-4). In 2 Samuel 11-12, King David covets another man’s wife, takes her, and later kills the husband when the woman becomes pregnant. According to the story, the patron god, Yahweh, is angry, but not because David has raped and murdered (Noll 1999, pp. 35 -6). Yahweh expresses disgust that David has taken the wrong man’s wife, for he, Yahweh, is eager to give David the wives of other men if David desires them (12:7b-8). As punishment for David’s sin, the woman’s child shall die and another man shall rape several of David’s other wives (12:9-14). The moral values of Canaanite culture are clearly on display in this tale: the divine patron punishes a man by killing a child and orchestrating the rape of other women. The divine patron protects the property of males by violating or destroying the property of other males." <sup id="cite_ref-132" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-132">[132]</a></sup> "The priestly legislation rules that women are ‘unclean’ for much more of the time than men—primarily through menstruation and childbirth—and this naturally causes restrictions on their activities.

Polygyny, as the marriage of the same man to two or more wives with the same legal status, is distinct in scripture from concubinage, in which a man took secondary wives (usually foreigners or women of lower social standing). It is distinct, too, from a sexual relationship between a free man and a slave woman of his household, which seems to have been unrestricted…. Although the scriptures presuppose that polygyny is valid, they invite the reader to regard it with suspicion.… Deuteronomy 17:17 counsels that a king should not have many wives lest his heart be distracted. Solomon’s downfall is attributed to his having many wives and concubines, although his attachment to foreign women may have been the chief source of his troubles (1 Kgs 11:1-6). The polygamous marriages of Esau, Elkanah, and Jacob were marred by favoritism and by discord among wives. The story of Abraham, his wife Sarah, and her foreign handmaid Hagar (Gen 16) drives that message home, although Hagar was presumably only a sexual partner, and not Abraham’s wife in the proper sense (notwithstanding Gen 16:3). But these negative associations fall short of opprobrium. Every family has it dysfunctional aspects, and the Jewish scriptures do not idealize the human condition." <sup id="cite_ref-134" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-134">[134]</a></sup>

<dl><dd><b>♠ care/harm ♣ inferred present ♥</b> In the narrow sense that injury to another was punished with a fine (e.g. Exodus 21:24), in line with other traditional cultures.<sup id="cite_ref-147" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-147">[147]</a></sup> "In Judaism, the Golden Rule does not occur before the Hellenistic period, and it is most probable that the reception of the Golden Rule in early Judaism is to be attributed to Hellenistic influence. The oldest extant evidence is Tobit 4:15 (ca. 200 B.C.E.), where the Golden Rule in its negative form (“What you hate, do not do to anyone”) appears without special emphasis in a series of admonitions as part of Tobit’s farewell speech to his son." <sup id="cite_ref-148" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-148">[148]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ fairness/cheating ♣ inferred present ♥</b>The biblical laws include prohibitions against false weights and measures (Leviticus 19:35-36, Deuteronomy 25:13-16), and repeatedly warn against lying (e.g. Leviticus 19:11).</dd>
<dd><b>♠ in-group loyalty ♣ present ♥</b> "Families were units of a clan, clans units of a tribe, and the tribes units of the people (Block, 2003). Endogamy enabled the Israelites to use marriage to conserve kin groups. Marriage within the clan was preferable, and marriage outside the people was highly suspect, in part because it risked contamination from alien laws and cults." <sup id="cite_ref-149" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-149">[149]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ respect for authority ♣ present ♥</b> "In addition to the sacred laws, the Temple served as the source for laws governing the social life of the people. Extensive laws concerning issues of murder, personal injury, property transfer, property damage, marriage, rape, debt, inheritance, etc., appear in Exod. 21-24, 34; Lev. 18-20; Num. 27, 30-36; and Deut. 16-26. Thus, Exod. 22:28 forbids cursing God or a prince, i.e., the monarch, among the people." <sup id="cite_ref-150" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-150">[150]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ purity ♣ present ♥</b> Several kinds of purity are required in the Biblical system, some of which are unique and others that paralleled practices of the surrounding societies. Menstruating women were considered unclean and were to be avoided; dead bodies also brought about impurity. Misusing holy things could also bring about impurity. "Humans were supposed to obey the moral precepts of the gods, but were not expected to be able to do that perfectly. Therefore, in divine mercy, ritual sacrifice provided communion between the divine and human. Careful study of the Bible demonstrates that theYom Kippur sacrifice was not what achieved divine forgiveness for sin. Rather, human repentance and righteous lifestyles were the requirements for forgiveness (e.g., Micah 6:6 - 8). The ritual sacrifice was a purification rite, a kind of cleansing ceremony needed because sinfulness had defiled the holy temple and its furnishings. The blood is spilled not for the sinners, but for the temple and its altar (see, for example, Leviticus 16)." <sup id="cite_ref-151" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-151">[151]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ kinship ♣ inferred present♥</b> The biblical laws repeatedly enjoin honor and fear for parents; the laws of debt slavery include an obligation on the part of clansmen to redeem kin who were sold as slaves, or to redeem alienated land, and this obligation features heavily in the Ruth narrative. King Solomon is depicted as honoring his mother greatly (e.g. I Kings 2:19). Furthermore, the biblical laws include levirate marriage and blood feud, both of which presuppose the high value of kinship and blood ties: “In contrast to Mesopotamia, biblical Israel is characterized by the persistence of social organization based on kinship ties. It is no wonder, then, that the initiative for remedying a homicide lay with the victim’s family. The family in biblical Israel acted as a mutual aid society and, therefore, in a case of homicide, blood feud ensued.”<sup id="cite_ref-152" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-152">[152]</a></sup> “Adoption, which abrogates blood ties, became a prominent institution in Mesopotamian society; levirate marriage, which protects blood ties, never did.”<sup id="cite_ref-153" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-153">[153]</a></sup></dd>

Extensive laws concerning issues of murder, personal injury, property transfer, property damage, marriage, rape, debt, inheritance, etc., appear in Exod. 21-24, 34; Lev. 18-20; Num. 27, 30-36; and Deut. 16-26. [...] Exod. 21:28-36 employs the example of an ox that gores, to establish principles for deciding cases of property damage, and Exod. 21:37-22:14 defines other areas of restitution for damaged or stolen property." <sup id="cite_ref-154" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-154">[154]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p><b>♠ Moralistic punishment by supernatural beings ♣ inferred present ♥</b> Best example is Elisha's disciple anointing Jehu as king and encouraging him to depose the Omrid dynasty (II Kings 9).

<p><b>State Intervention in Economy</b>
</p>
<dl><dd> <b>♠ The state regulates banking ♣ unknown ♥</b> The possibility exists, as central temples in the Ancient Near East often functioned as a sort of proto-central bank or communal treasury, under the control of the king.<sup id="cite_ref-156" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-156">[156]</a></sup> The Babylonian Talmud (Ketuvot 106b) describes the much-later Second Temple as engaging in market-smoothing operations for produce.

<dd> <b>♠ Debt-relief measures ♣ unknown ♥</b> The Bible mandates the remission of debts every seven years (Deut. 15:1-2), but later prophets complain that these measures were ignored (e.g. Ezekiel 22:12).
