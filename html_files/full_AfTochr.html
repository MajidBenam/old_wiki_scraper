<p>The period of Sogdian and Bactrian history between the disintegration of the Greco-Bactrian kingdom in the late 2nd century BCE and the rise of the Kushan Empire in the 1st century CE is poorly understood. The region was politically fragmented and the local settled populations were subjected to nomadic invasions, notably by a group of pastoralists and traders known to us by their Chinese name, Yuezhi.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> The Yuezhi are also sometimes referred to as 'Tochari' by scholars who believe they spoke a Tocharian language, part of an extinct Indo-European language group.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> (Others argue that their original language was eastern Iranic or proto-Turkic.)<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup>
</p><p>In the mid-1st millennium BCE and perhaps even earlier, the Yuezhi were living on the steppes to the north of China.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> However, after coming into conflict with other nomadic groups, the Xiongnu and Wusun, they migrated towards Sogdiana.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> By 129 BCE, when the Han Chinese diplomat Zhang Qian visited the Yuezhi court on the Oxus river, they were ruling over a region that included parts of the old Hellenistic Greco-Bactrian kingdom.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup>
</p><p>In the early 1st century CE, the first Kushan king, Kujula Kadphises, seized power and began ruling over south-eastern Sogdiana, marking the end of our Yuezhi period.<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> Kujula Kadphises was probably a member of one of five Yuezhi factions or subtribes, which he succeeded in unifying through military conquest,<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup> but even this is disputed.
</p><p><i>Population and political organization</i>
</p><p>The Yuezhi in Bactria and Sogdiana seem to have been organized into a federation of five tribes that competed for political supremacy in the new territory.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup> There is no written or numismatic evidence of a centralized Yuezhi state with a single paramount ruler before the rise of Kujula Kadphises.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup> Historian Craig Benjamin has characterized Yuezhi control over the sedentary population of northern Bactria and Sogdia as that of a militarily superior ruling dynasty of nomads, 'pastoralist conquerors' whose 'nominal sovereignty' was acknowledged by the locals because they feared violence if they refused to submit.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup>
</p><p>Secure estimates for the combined population of the ruling Yuezhi and the settled population under their control in this period are lacking.

Beginning in the first century BCE, most of Sogdiana was included in a larger nomadic state, centered on the middle Syr Darya, namely Kangju. On the other hand, the Yuezhi principalities and then the Kushan empire incorporated the southeast part of Sogdiana (south of the Hissar mountains), which thereafter left the Sogdian sphere and was attached to Bactria.'<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup>

</p><p>Liu paints a picture of religious pluralism in this period: 'The Kushan, like other nomads in Central Asia, tended to change objects of worship, or even embrace other religions through interactions with other peoples, especially sedentary peoples. Religious tolerance and the diversity of Bactrian religion itself also encouraged the Kushan to adopt the various religious cults they encountered'.<sup id="cite_ref-117" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-117">[117]</a></sup> (Liu uses 'Yuezhi' and 'Kushan' interchangeably in this article.) These cults included those of the Hellenistic pantheon, Zoroastrianism, the Sumerian gods, and 'the Indian cults of Buddha and Shiva'.<sup id="cite_ref-118" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-118">[118]</a></sup> Unfortunately for our codes, she concludes that 'To pin down the state religion or the true faith of the Kushan is difficult and unnecessary'.<sup id="cite_ref-119" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-119">[119]</a></sup> Similarly, it does not seem possible to reconstruct Kushan rituals--whether they combined elements of each of the religions present in their polity (and which elements these would be), or whether they adopted rituals from some religions and rejected rituals from others, or whether they had entirely new rituals altogether. The literature does not appear to contain this information, and, given the nature of the evidence on which our understanding of Kushan society is based, it seems likely that experts, too, would find it difficult to reconstruct Kushan rituals.

<p>Code the variables below for the most widespread collective ritual of the official cult. Widespread refers to the degree of coverage a ritual has in a polity and therefore to the proportion of the overall population that participates in or observes a ritual. Keep in mind that it is possible that the ritual with the highest coverage is not necessarily a mass ritual performed at one location, but can be a ritual that is performed all over the polity and of which the aggregate of the audiences represent the largest degree of coverage.

</p><p><span style="color:purple">For the Yuezhi, this period seems to have been one of transition from a nomadic to a settled lifestyle: 'At first contemptuous of city life and Greek culture, the nomads gradually became enamored of the seductive Hellenic tradition. They rebuilt the cities they had sacked and created the great Kushan Empire on their own debris'.<sup id="cite_ref-120" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-120">[120]</a></sup> Unfortunately the details of this transformation remain murky: 'In the time between the Greco-Bactrian period and the flowering of the Kushans, ancient records fail us'.<sup id="cite_ref-121" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-121">[121]</a></sup></span>

The <i>Xihou</i> were probably tribal chiefs in Bactria before the Yuezhi and were assigned by the Yuezhi ruler to maintain order there.

If we take care of our own spiritual development, we render a service to others; and if we develop love towards others, we thereby also help ourselves. Accordingly, it is explicitly stated, someone who pursues the path of salvation only for his or her own benefit is to be censured, while the one who follows the path for one’s own benefit and for the benefit of others is to be commended (see AN 7:64).” <sup id="cite_ref-253" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-253">[253]</a></sup> Hinduism: “According to Hindu Dharmashastras, of the four stages of life, the person who is at the householder stage is the anchor of society.

Householders are the ones with material wealth, and their responsibility, their dharma, is to share it with others. [...] The link between the world of the householder and the world of the renunciant is gift giving—dana. The classic image is of the renouncer with the begging bowl, making the rounds for alms.

These virtues that are said to be common to all humans are known as sadhārana (common) or sanatana (eternal) dharma. For example, the Law of Manu (X:63) argues that non-injury, truth, not stealing, purity and control of the senses summarise dharma for the four castes. Elsewhere Manu (VI:91- 2) asserts that avoiding backbiting, hypocrisy, greed, infatuation, anger and discontent is approved dharma for all the stages of life. The problem is that there are different views as to what the actuality of universal dharma is. Radhakrishnan, for example, argues for a sanatana dharma, based upon Advaita Vedanta thought, that is said to be present in all religious traditions. It is a kind of perennial philosophy that is at the heart of every religious tradition not just at the heart of the Hindu tradition. Others concentrate upon a universal dharma within the Hindu tradition itself but there is no absolute consensus as to what it is.

Not much is known about the latter. In Greek religion: "Greeks did not necessarily assume that the gods could read their minds and knew the inner secrets of their heart and so forth. However, they definitely assumed that gods could see and hear everything they did. I don’t think the gods were concerned with people’s thoughts unless these thoughts manifested themselves in words or actions. This is not to say that they could never read minds, just that it wasn’t part and parcel of how they were represented, the way it is, for example, with the Christian god.” <sup id="cite_ref-347" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-347">[347]</a></sup> In Hinduism: "Each Purana tends to focus on a specific deity as the Supreme Being responsible for creating and ordering the world. [...] Thus, [for example,] Krishna [...] is a form of the supreme God who creates, maintains, and destroys the universe. In the Bhagavad Gita , Arjuna is permitted to glimpse Krishna’s cosmic form. He sees the entire universe, the sun, stars, and planets, and all the people gathered on the battlefield within the body of Krishna. Krishna tells him that everything that exists is part of himself, but that he is not limited to everything that exists. In other words, just as the Vedic Purusha extended ten finger-lengths beyond the created universe, so too Krishna is the entire cosmos and more." <sup id="cite_ref-348" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-348">[348]</a></sup> In Zoroastrianism: "The name of the supreme God of the Zoroastrian faith is Ahura Mazda (or Ohrmazd). He is self-created, omniscient, omnipresent, holy, invisible, and beyond human conceptualization (Yasna 4.7, 29.4, 31.13, 45.5; Yasht 1.7, 1.8, 1.12, 1.13-14; Videvdat 2.1, 19.20)."<sup id="cite_ref-349" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-349">[349]</a></sup> In Buddhism: "There are numerous Higher Gods, but these are remote and sublime beings who have little involvement in human affairs.

Not enough appears to be known about the latter to be able to say whether the gods they focussed on were thought to be omniscient. And, similarly, it is not very clear whether omniscience would have been seen as a characteristic of Siva. However, even by looking only at the remaining three religions, it is clear that this variable cannot be coded as either "absent" or "present". Regarding Buddhism, the idea of an all-knowing God runs contrary to the emphasis that this religion places on an individual's responsibility for their own spiritual development <sup id="cite_ref-352" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-352">[352]</a></sup>. Regarding Zoroastrianism, the god Ahura-Mazda is a fairly straightforward omniscient deity <sup id="cite_ref-353" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-353">[353]</a></sup>. And as for Greek deities, “Everything depends on what you mean by “omniscience.” First, there is the distinction between “knowing everything important,” like who committed a crime or who will win the war, and true omniscience, which includes everything which can be known (things like “the fall of a sparrow” and how many grains of sand are on a beach). Very few Greek gods claimed true omniscience. The only example I know is that it was claimed for Apollo at Delphi, who was specifically an oracular god. So it was his business to know everything. The claim seems to have been put forward by the sanctuary in order to enhance his prestige. Greek philosophers presumably believed in divine omniscience because they represented the gods or the divine as perfect, which would require absolute knowledge, but these issues do not seem to have really come to the fore in the literature until the Roman period and Christianity, so far as I can tell. Even if omniscience only means “knowing everything that it is important to know,” I have my doubts about whether the Greek gods possessed it. I would say that it was always contextual. They knew whatever it was important to know in a given context. Greeks did not necessarily assume that the gods could read their minds and knew the inner secrets of their heart and so forth. However, they definitely assumed that gods could see and hear everything they did. I don’t think the gods were concerned with people’s thoughts unless these thoughts manifested themselves in words or actions. This is not to say that they could never read minds, just that it wasn’t part and parcel of how they were represented, the way it is, for example, with the Christian god.” <sup id="cite_ref-354" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-354">[354]</a></sup></dd>

Not much is known about the latter. In Greek religion: In Hinduism: "Among the cosmic laws that constitute dharma, the law of karma, or action, is especially relevant to rebirth. By the law of karma, every thought, word, and deed carries with it a like reaction. Beings are born, live, die, and are reborn based on their actions. Every good deed brings a reward, and every bad deed a punishment. The terms ‘reward’ and ‘punishment’ are deceptive, however; for karma is not seen as a set of rewards and punishments doled out by a just God, but in impersonal terms, as the working of natural law. Karma attracts reactions to moral agents like an ethical law of gravity. Benevolent actions produce good results for the person who engages in them. Similarly, actions intended to cause suffering will lead to suffering for those who commit them." <sup id="cite_ref-359" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-359">[359]</a></sup> In Zoroastrianism, the following quote makes it clear the supreme god, Ahura Mazda, was both responsible for the creation of the world and for punishing transgressors. "[T]he prophet feels also the awe due to the God who is “Creator of all” (Y. 44.7), and who, as Lord of aša, presides over a strict justice for mankind by which the wicked, who have chosen to act “at Lie’s commands” (Y. 31.1) will be in due course condemned. Their destination is the Worst Existence, i.e., Hell, which has been brought into being by Angra Mainyu (Y. 30.4). Mazdā has “appointed recompenses” (Y. 43.5), decreeing that “the end shall be different for each” (Y. 48.4); but he “has left to men’s wills (the choice between) holy and unholy” (Y. 45.9), and it is their own inner selves (daēnā-) which lead sinners to destruction (Y. 51.13)."<sup id="cite_ref-360" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-360">[360]</a></sup> In Buddhism: "There are numerous Higher Gods, but these are remote and sublime beings who have little involvement in human affairs.

It is a comprehensive term, incorporating benevolence to humanity, moral restraint (<i>yama</i>), and observance of duty or obligation (<i>niyama</i>). <i>Yama</i> required the active avoidance of violence (<i>ahimsa</i>), dishonesty, falsehood, jealousy, avarice, and other vices." <sup id="cite_ref-364" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-364">[364]</a></sup>  In Zoroastrianism: According to the Arda Viraz Namag, sins punished in hell include homicide, "neglecting crying and hungry children" and "denying hospitality to travellers"<sup id="cite_ref-365" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-365">[365]</a></sup>.

In fact rather a precise correlation exists here: dominated by greed one becomes a hungry ghost, a class of beings ever discontent and anguished because of being unable to satisfy their greed; dominated by hatred one enters one of the hell realms where one suffers terrible pain; dominated by ignorance one becomes an animal ruled by the instincts of food and reproduction." <sup id="cite_ref-367" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-367">[367]</a></sup></dd>

In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsaric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f ). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21)." <sup id="cite_ref-398" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-398">[398]</a></sup> "[...] Buddhism maintained a fairly flexible posture vis-a-vis competing religions and never sought to require laity to identify themselves exclusively as Buddhist or to rely singularly on the Buddhist clergy for all their spiritual needs." <sup id="cite_ref-399" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-399">[399]</a></sup></dd>

[...]Brahmins have traditionally been seen as ritually more pure than Kshatriyas and more versed in religious knowledge. They are, in theory if not always in fact, the key scholars in the Hindu tradition. The Kshatriyas have traditionally been seen, again in theory if not always in practice, as the rulers who maintain society, uphold dharma and protect the householder system. They built and sponsored temples, protected their subjects and their deities and, to that extent, the Brahmins recognised a ruler’s overlordship. However, the kingly role in ruling and guardianship duties involved more ‘polluting tendencies’ than were usual in a Brahmin’s life. The Brahmins have had a dual role in society. Those who are active priests in temples have engaged in functions that involve being given gifts by worshippers and such temple priests are more involved with lower castes.

The failure to achieve the required state of purity results in the failure of the ritual. A graver and more serious offence is committed when someone crosses the river without prayer and the ritual washing—then the gods are not only irate, but also keen to punish. This makes sense: the rivers are divinities, and by entering them humans establish a particularly close contact with the divine. It is one of the basic premises of Greek religion that gods abhor pollution, which is why ritual cleansing is a necessary prerequisite for every ritual action. This would imply that entering a river requires a particularly stringent adherence to ritual purity, while avoiding this purification inspires a particularly harsh punishment—a punishment for jeopardizing the god’s own purity.

According to Dumont, in addition to the distinctions already outlined that fit varnas and jatis into hierarchies, another must be added. This distinction takes caste hierarchical divides beyond the kind of class distinctions found in eighteenth-century Britain or in the Ancien Regime in Europe, by stressing the opposition between purity and pollution. Caste difference, according to this classification, goes beyond class differences into this other realm of ritual purity and pollution. The Brahmins are the highest and purest varna, and the Dalits are the lowest, in that they are outside varna and are impure altogether. The other varnas rank in between. Pollution occurs in different ways. It occurs through bodily contact of one sort or another, with menstrual cycles, through birth and death, through emissions such as faeces, urine and saliva, and through contact with night-soil, dirty clothes, unswept rooms and so on. Thus marriage and sex have to function within the correct set of jatis in the correct varna. Polluting jobs such as laundering and sweeping are done by people of lower castes so that the blood of people of higher castes can remain ‘pure’. Equally menstrual activity among older women makes them more ‘impure’ than men or pre-menstrual virgins, and therefore women are more polluting than men. They will thus often live semi-separately while menstruating, during which time they will also avoid going to the temple and therefore ‘polluting’ the gods. Furthermore, untouchable Dalits were prohibited from entering many temples before the post-Independence freedom-of-temple-entry legislation and even now they are kept out of some temples in many villages. [...] It is also true to say that Dumont’s thesis suffers from exaggeration and other matters are important in discussing caste. Nevertheless, there is at least an element of truth in the notion that purity and pollution has relevance in any discussion of caste." <sup id="cite_ref-414" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-414">[414]</a></sup> In Zoroastrianism: "Be that as it may, another division of hell appears in the Arda Viraz Namag (The Book of the Righteous Viraz).

In Buddhism: "In marked contrast to the view of Islam about the fate of warriors who die in a holy war, the Buddha expresses the view in the Sutta Nipata (Sn.iv.308-11) that soldiers who die in battle go not to a special paradise but to a special hell, since at the moment of death their minds were bent on killing. Some texts affirm that even killing in self-defence, or in defence of family or friends, is wrongful, and in general an attitude of non-resistance in the face of violence is commended. The commentary to the Dhammapada relates how on one occasion when the Buddha's kinsmen, the Sakyas, were under attack, they allowed themselves to be slaughtered rather than break the First Precept. Other examples in the Jatakas and elsewhere speak of princes and kings who renounced their thrones rather than resorting to violence to defend their kingdoms." <sup id="cite_ref-417" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-417">[417]</a></sup></dd>

According to this system, at death one would pass on to a life in heaven or hell, depending on the merits of one’s activities in life. Then, after a certain amount of time, the individual would be reborn on earth once again. The mechanism that regulated this system was karman, a word that literally means "action." Every action must have an effect. So, the effects of one’s actions in life determine what one will experience after death, and what kind of life one will have in the next birth. In this way, even if a person does not seem to receive all the rewards or punishments deserved in a particular life, the scales will be balanced in the future." <sup id="cite_ref-420" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-420">[420]</a></sup> "Coming from the Sanskrit root word <i>Dhar</i> (sustain), <i>Dharma</i> has been interpreted variously as a religious code of behavior, a divine system of morality and righteousness, and conformation to one’s cosmically allotted duty and nature (Radhakrishnan, 1968).

<p><b>♠ Irrigation works ♣ present ♥</b> Irrigation works predate the arrival of Yuezhi and Scythian nomads in Bactria: 'A very important point, deduced mainly from nomadic graves in Bactria, is that the graves are situated on the edge of the valleys and do not encroach on the irrigated and tilled areas.

<dl><dd><b>♠ provision of irrigation works ♣ non-state ♥</b> Writing about the Khwarazm region, which fell outside of Yuezhi domination during this period, Mukhamedjanov says: 'Tolstov, in his study of the remains of the ancient irrigation works in Chorasmia, noted that it was precisely during the period of antiquity [4th century BC to 4th century AD according to the periodization used by the Karakalpak-Australian Archaeological Expedition]<sup id="cite_ref-525" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-525">[525]</a></sup> that a school of irrigation engineers and high priests of science emerged at Chorasmia [...] The school included experts in mathematics, water engineering, cartography, astronomy and calendrical observations, which were of great importance for an extensive irrigation economy. The brunt of the task of building irrigation works was, however, borne by the peasants, and many irrigation systems were dug by labourers from the rural communities, without any particular expenditure of effort or contribution by the authorities'.<sup id="cite_ref-526" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-526">[526]</a></sup> It seems likely that this was also the case in Yuezhi-controlled Bactria and southern Sogdiana, from which we have no evidence of a comparable school of engineering and science, or of any form of irrigation management by the state.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Staple ♣ inferred present ♥</b> Chinese historian Sima Qian records that before the Yuezhi were forced westwards by attacks from the Xiongnu, 'the authority of the Yüeh-chih ruler was accepted by the countries in Central Asia. They provided free food to envoys moving through their territories, but messengers from China had to pay for their food as well as their horses'.<sup id="cite_ref-545" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-545">[545]</a></sup> This provisioning of Yuezhi envoys with food could count as a form of tribute. Perhaps once they settled close to the Oxus in the later 2nd century BCE, the Yuezhi would have continued to compel inhabitants of regions that accepted their authority to feed their officials. Enoki, Koshelenko and Haidary also speculate that the ceramic vessels found in nomad graves in Bactria were exacted as tribute from the farmers, but there is no concrete evidence for this - surely they could have been acquired through trade.<sup id="cite_ref-546" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-546">[546]</a></sup></dd>

<p><b>♠ Wages ♣ ♥</b>
</p><p><b>♠ staple cost of principal source of carbohydrates ♣ unknown ♥</b> I have not found any figures for the staple cost of grain in this period. Discussing the nomadic states on the western fringes of China, Barfield says that 'Grain was one of the products most in demand by nomads, but because this trade was so ordinary it is scantily documented and scholars continue to argue over whether the steppe nomads included grain as a regular part of their diet'.<sup id="cite_ref-553" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-553">[553]</a></sup> His comments seem likely to apply to the Yuezhi occupation of Transoxania and Bactria too.
</p><p><b>♠ Top fortune ♣ unknown ♥</b> I have not found a numerical figure for the top fortune in this period. However, the six burials excavated at the site of Tillya Tepe in northern Afghanistan, dating to the mid-1st century CE, were 'extremely rich', containing 'goods from the length of Eurasia, including glass from the Roman west and mirrors from the Han Chinese east'.<sup id="cite_ref-554" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-554">[554]</a></sup> There is some disagreement about the ethnic identity of these people, but they 'have generally been considered to be settled descendants of the nomadic Yuezhi and most scholars have described them as "proto-Kushans"'.<sup id="cite_ref-555" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-555">[555]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Other wealth distribution ♣ ♥</b> Barfield's model of nomadic states in Central Asia compares them to 'redistributive chiefdoms': they extract (or extort) tribute from sedentary populations and distribute the ensuing wealth among the 'tribes' that make up the nomadic confederation. 'Nomad states were more like redistributive chiefdoms. They lacked a strong class structure and the leaders' main responsibilities internally were organizational rather than extractive. They were expected to provide real benefits and prestige goods to component tribes and their leaders'.<sup id="cite_ref-556" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-556">[556]</a></sup> He focuses on those nomadic 'empires' on the borders of the Chinese state, but perhaps this economic model could also apply to the Yuezhi in Transoxiana, who, if we believe the Chinese sources, migrated westward from their homeland in modern Gansu province.
