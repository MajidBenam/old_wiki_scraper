<b> ♠ UTM zone ♣ 38 P ♥ </b> 'Yemen is in the Middle East lying between about 13’000 and 19’000 north latitude, bordering the Arabian Sea, Gulf of Aden, Red Sea, Oman and Saudi Arabia (Greenwich Mean Time 2004). The total land area of Yemen is 527,970 km2 including the islands of Perim and Socotra. The population was estimated at 19.2 M in 2003 (World Bank 2004). The highest elevation is 3760 m above sea level at Jabal-an-Nabi Shu’ayb. Most of the land is desert, with a hot and humid climate along the west coast, extraordinarily hot, dry and harsh desert in the eastern part, and a temperate climate with seasonal monsoons in the western hilly area.' <sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> 'Yemen occupies the southern shore and the southwestern corner of the Arabian peninsula. Its western boundary is the Red Sea. The country has a mountainous interior with a temperate or subtropical climate. The central highlands divide Yemen into a coastal plain called the Tihama, which has a tropical climate with sparse rainfall, and a desert region that stretches into the Empty Quarter. A midlands area consists of valleys (wadis) and foothills that slope down to the lowlands. Southwest monsoons influence Yemen's climate. THe southern highlands receive the most rainfall, particularly where mountains provide less of a barrier to precipitation.' <sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> This refers to Yemen proper rather than Turkey, the core area of the Ottoman empire.

Al-Khamri, of course, is Bayt al-Ahmar’s home area. The al-Ahmars and Hashid acquired a very prominent place in relations between the Turks and the Imam, which they retained under al-Mutawakkil’s successors (ibid. 336, 354, and passim). By comparison, the Barat Bakil tribes, who had been so conspicuous in the mid-nineteenth century, played a somewhat subdued role. A little later, in 1882, Muhammad al-Huthi declared himself Imam at Barat and took the name al-Mahdi. He persisted in the claim until his death in 1901, but he was quite overshadowed by the Imams al-Hadi Sharaf al-Din (1879-90) and al-Mansur Muhammad (1890-1904), both of whom were concerned with great events on the plateau north of San’a’. His own career at Barat was a vita umbratilis, and even to Glaser in the Jawf (1903: 82) he was little more than a rumour. Dhu Muhammad and Dhu Husayn are mentioned both in the north and in Lower Yemen […] -a little later, in 1908, we find a mention of Naji Abu Ra’s of Dhu Muhammad as a Turkish ‘amil in Raydah […] -but the great axis of dispute between the south and the far north-east collapsed: it was the leaders of the more central northern tribes who now came to the fore. The great tribal families of today had appeared at the start of the eighteenth century; but what one sees as the start of the present century is the establishment of their present differences in wealth and power.’ <sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> 'With the Turkish occupation (1872-1918), the dramatic events that historians record shift in part from the west and south into the tribes‘  own territory. The political reality was complex, and at most points up to 1918 the Turks found support from Yemenis, not least from certain northern shaykhs whose fortunes were bound up with the Turkish presence. The clerk of the San’a’ court learned Turkish. Many if the ‘ulama’ supported the Turks even when the Imam’s fight against them was at its height, and he ambiguities of resisting the Turkish Sultan, who himself was seen to be beset by Christendom, were usually marked. None the less there was sustained resistance in the north. Tribes and Imams fought the Turks repeatedly, and the dynasty of Imams emerged that was to rule Yemen until the 1960s.’ <sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> Tribes retained political and military significance in the 20th century: 'It is a continuing challenge of governmental strategies to achieve a stable balance between relatively autonomous tribes and the state. Alliance with dominant tribal confederation therefore may still be influential in the distribution of development projects by central authorities.' <sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> Local hierarchies and government structures intersect on the administrative level: 'Yemeni society is hierarchically organized on the basis of birth status and occupation. Until relative political stability was achieved in the late 1970s, birth and occupational statuses were legitimized as ascribed social categories. The elimination of practical barriers that restrict power and privilege?especially through marriage and education?to certain members of the society has only just begun. Under the system of ranked social categories, members of respectable groupings recognized their own noble descent and considered themselves the protectors of servants, former slaves, artisans, and certain farmers, all of whom were thought of as&nbsp;?deficient,? either because they provided a service or craft?such as bloodletting, butchery, or barbering?that involved contact with polluting substances, or because their origins were discredited as ignoble. The tribal code of protection was also extended to elites at the top of the social scale, especially to sayyids, the reputed descendants of the Prophet, who originally came to Yemen to serve as mediators between tribes and who are respected for their religious expertise. Another social category, that of legal scholars, also inherits high status in the ranking order. Scholars, along with shuyukh   (sing. shaykh  ), who are tribal leaders, typically serve as village administrators. The majority of Yemenis use various equivalent or substitute terms to identify themselves within the social hierarchy, including qaba\??\il   in the northern highlands to connote tribal membership, ra\??\iyah   in the south to mean&nbsp;?cultivators,? and \??\arab   along the coast to signify respectable ancestry. Former slaves continue to act as agents and domestics in the households of former masters, but the most menial jobs (e.g., removing human waste from the street) are reserved for Yemenis who are alleged descendants of Ethiopians of the pre-Islamic era. In addition, Yemen relies on a range of foreigners from the East and West for professional, technical, and custodial services.' <sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup>

The tribes were directed against the Shafi’i areas of Lower Yemen, much as they had been by the Qasimis, in a jihad. ‘The tribesman who enrolled under the Imam’s standard and came from north of San’a’ to the lowlands of the Tihamah, to Ibb, to Ta’izz, and al-Bayda’ was not referred to as a soldier but as a warrior in the cause of the God’ (Nu’man 1965: 27).

But this time, mindful of the empire’s commitments elsewhere (the Italians had just invaded Tripoli), they did not pursue the Imam northwards. Instead negotiations were begun at once. In October 1911 the Turks and the Imam met at Da’’an, on Jabal ‘Iyal Yazd, and signed a truce that, although not ratified by imperial firman until two years later, was upheld by both sides thereafter.

The contemporary borders are largely a product of the foreign policy goals and actions of Britain, the Ottoman Empire, and Saudi Arabia.

</p><p>(3) Port Cities and Administrative Centres; (2) Rural Towns and Markets; (1) Villages and Hamlets
</p><p>Most Yemenis lived in rural villages and towns: 'Yemen is an overwhelmingly rural country, with about three-fourths of the people living in the countryside. With only a few exceptions, the rural population is distributed fairly evenly. The monsoon rainfall that causes the western slopes of the massif to be so well-dissected makes the area the most densely populated part of the country. Fertile soils are another regional asset. In varying concentrations, Yemenis inhabit nearly all the country’s geographic zones-from sea level to 10,000 feet (3,000 metres) and higher. (In fact, the intricate variety of subregions and microclimates produces an agricultural base of astonishing diversity.) The scarcity of farmland has greatly influenced rural settlement and construction patterns, as has the need for security. Villages tend to be small, and buildings are erected on ground that cannot be cultivated-frequently along cliffs and rock outcroppings. Homes often consist of several stories (as many as five or more), with the lower floors being made of hand-hewn stone. Upper stories, where the family resides, are usually made of mud brick, a superior insulator. These quarters also have many windows, providing ventilation in the heat of the summer. The location of the living quarters in these upper stories offers the capacity for storage in the lower stories, as well as an element of security. Cities in Yemen follow patterns seen in other parts of the Arab world. Original construction consisted of a walled and fortified old city, in which the ornate multistory home was standard. The old city also contained shops, souks, schools, and mosques. In the modern period, urban areas began to sprawl outside the old city, and the wealthy began to build larger and more-ornate mansions and villas in nearby suburbs.' <sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup> Specialists were concentrated in larger towns: 'But the ideological power of the Imamic state did not erase rural political idioms and leadership. During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the economic power of urban forces remained circumscribed. Craft production and trade remained small-scale, and specialists were divided in status between those who ruled (families with literate and religious specialties or engaged in long-distance trading) and those who served (the craftsmen and market-service families). In the countryside arms-bearing farmers regarded the groups who worked in craft production, petty trading and market services as a dependent service class attached to their local political communities. Even in large towns the men who performed such occupations were distinguished as Jews or as Muslim strata (mazayinah, bani 'l-khums, nuqqas) marked by sumptuary customs or regulations. Literate specialists,  who sought to govern, to regulate the market, and to control long-distance trade, distinguished themselves from the labouring specialists of the market.' <sup id="cite_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup> Cities served as economic and political centres and grew significantly during the 20th century: 'Most Yemenis live in small, widely dispersed farming villages and towns. Three-quarters of the population lives in roughly 50,000 settlements with less than 500 inhabitants. The cities of Aden, Abyan, Al-Houta, Al-Hudaydah (a port), Sana, and Taizz have more than 100,000 residents each. Many foreign countries have assisted in the building of roads, hospitals, and schools, but improvements such as sanitary water facilities and power supply typically remain local development projects.' <sup id="cite_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-68">[68]</a></sup>

</p><p>On the local level, tribal authority remained relevant, often intersecting with lower-level administration. Aspiring Imams had to rely on tribal support in their anti-Ottoman campaigns: 'It is a continuing challenge of governmental strategies to achieve a stable balance between relatively autonomous tribes and the state. Alliance with dominant tribal confederation therefore may still be influential in the distribution of development projects by central authorities.' <sup id="cite_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-69">[69]</a></sup> 'The Zaidi Imamate could not build its power solely upon a union of non-agricultural specialists: it required the support of the militarily powerful northern landowning shaikhs and the groups of fighting men that they could muster, usually from the poorer village families. The development of shaikhly constellations of power, in the manner described by Montagne for the Moroccan Berbers, was curtailed by exporting shaikhly leaders to tax prebends in richer areas. In this way the tribe was sanctioned as a status group within the state. The Imamic state rested on an alliance of the farmer (the fighter) with the preacher (the judge) and on the symbolic and political suppression of mercantile and craft interests more generally. The union of religious leaders and martial farmers from agriculturally marginal areas formed a loose prebendal dominion over the more productive, largely Shafi'i, peasant areas of the west and south. Whether collected by regular employees of the government or by irregulars from the north, taxes were paid by those who produced most, by the peasants of the richer areas. For example, Goitein reports that the Jewish villagers of al-Gades in lower Yemen called the local landlord 'askari, "soldier", noting, however, that he and his like came from the eastern pastoral region and should be distinguished from the regular 'askari who accompanied the local government officer on his tax levies.' <sup id="cite_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-70">[70]</a></sup> 'Yemeni society is hierarchically organized on the basis of birth status and occupation. Until relative political stability was achieved in the late 1970s, birth and occupational statuses were legitimized as ascribed social categories. The elimination of practical barriers that restrict power and privilege?especially through marriage and education?to certain members of the society has only just begun. Under the system of ranked social categories, members of respectable groupings recognized their own noble descent and considered themselves the protectors of servants, former slaves, artisans, and certain farmers, all of whom were thought of as&nbsp;?deficient,? either because they provided a service or craft?such as bloodletting, butchery, or barbering?that involved contact with polluting substances, or because their origins were discredited as ignoble. The tribal code of protection was also extended to elites at the top of the social scale, especially to sayyids, the reputed descendants of the Prophet, who originally came to Yemen to serve as mediators between tribes and who are respected for their religious expertise. Another social category, that of legal scholars, also inherits high status in the ranking order. Scholars, along with shuyukh   (sing. shaykh  ), who are tribal leaders, typically serve as village administrators. The majority of Yemenis use various equivalent or substitute terms to identify themselves within the social hierarchy, including qaba\??\il   in the northern highlands to connote tribal membership, ra\??\iyah   in the south to mean&nbsp;?cultivators,? and \??\arab   along the coast to signify respectable ancestry. Former slaves continue to act as agents and domestics in the households of former masters, but the most menial jobs (e.g., removing human waste from the street) are reserved for Yemenis who are alleged descendants of Ethiopians of the pre-Islamic era. In addition, Yemen relies on a range of foreigners from the East and West for professional, technical, and custodial services.' <sup id="cite_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup> The Imamate and the Ottomans superimposed their own administrative structure onto the tribal system without supplanting it: 'Developments in the 19th century were fateful for Yemen. The determination of various European powers to establish a presence in the Middle East elicited an equally firm determination in other powers to thwart such efforts. For Yemen, the most important participants in the drama were the British, who took over Aden in 1839, and the Ottoman Empire, which at mid-century moved back into North Yemen, from which it had been driven by the Yemenis two centuries earlier. The interests and activities of these two powers in the Red Sea basin and Yemen were substantially intensified by the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 and the reemergence of the Red Sea route as the preferred passage between Europe and East Asia. As the Ottomans expanded inland and established themselves in Sanaa and Taʿizz, the British expanded north and east from Aden, eventually establishing protectorates over more than a dozen of the many local statelets; this was done more in the interest of protecting Aden’s hinterland from the Ottomans and their Yemeni adversaries than out of any desire to add the territory and people there to the British Empire. By the early 20th century the growing clashes between the British and the Ottomans along the undemarcated border posed a serious problem; in 1904 a joint commission surveyed the border, and a treaty was concluded, establishing the frontier between Ottoman North Yemen and the British possessions in South Yemen. Later, of course, both Yemens considered the treaty an egregious instance of non-Yemeni interference in domestic affairs. The north became independent at the end of World War I in 1918, with the departure of the Ottoman forces; the imam of the Zaydīs, Yaḥyā Maḥmūd al-Mutawwakil, became the de facto ruler in the north by virtue of his lengthy campaign against the Ottoman presence in Yemen. In the 1920s Imam Yaḥyā sought to consolidate his hold on the country by working to bring the Shāfiʿī areas under his administrative jurisdiction and by suppressing much of the intertribal feuding and tribal opposition to the imamate. In an effort to enhance the effectiveness of his campaigns against the tribes and other fractious elements, the imam sent a group of Yemeni youth to Iraq in the mid-1930s to learn modern military techniques and weaponry. These students would eventually become the kernel of domestic opposition to Yaḥyā and his policies.' <sup id="cite_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-72">[72]</a></sup> 'The  first thing to be said  is that no attempt was  made  to abolish tribalism as such. Where tribal practice was equated so readily with ignorance, and thus with irreligion, this  might  seem surprising, but it  is  as  if  the phenomenon were God-given; as  much part of  the intractable world and God's will as the mountains or the weather. Indeed,there were   only 'tribes', not tribalism, and th eradical ambition of rebuilding humanity to   some human design   (a 'sociological' ambition, of its nature) is more  a feature of our own time. Nor did   theImamate command the   means   to root out institutions on any  large  scale.  The Hamidal-Din  Imams,  Yahya (1904-48)and Ahmad(1948-62), did not reproduce the elaborate courts and armies of the  early  Qasimis but were rather frugal  men who personally supervised even  small,  local matters and ran  their administrations with the  forms  of power available to them (see e.g.Rihani 1930:220ff.; Scott 1942:174-5).Over the following decades they gradually built an army, whose  officers  in  the  end were  to  be part of the Imamate's undoing,but the  tribes remained the stronger force,   always carefully fragmented by their rulers' policy. The  aim  was that 'the pure shari'a be established', which  (as in most pre-bureaucratic Islamic  states) meant first  of  all that the zakat, or canonical tax, be collected and   a  modicum  of order retained. 'Broadly speaking, the tribal Zaydi north was governed by indirect rule with subsidies providedf or  the  chiefs.  The  Shafi'I south was  less fortunate in being under direct rule  by government officials working in concert with local headmen'(Serjeant 1979:92). In both areas the 'headmen' received  a cut  of the tax which it was their responsibility to  collect. One is sometimes told now that this  was  a quarter of  the total for northerners and a tenth for  the Shafi'I south (Messick 1978:170), but the details in the north were in  fact irregular.' <sup id="cite_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-73">[73]</a></sup> ‘By the terms of the European armistice at the end of the First World War, the Turks were obliged to abandon Yemen. The Imam filled their place. Even before he entered San’a’ in 1918, Imam Yahya sent a force of tribesmen under Sayyid ‘Ali al-Wazir to take Haraz from the Isma’ilis (al-Jirafi 1951: 225), some of whom turned for help to the Idrisi; and as the Turks withdrew, the Imam also turned his attention southward. The tribes were directed against the Shafi’i areas of Lower Yemen, much as they had been by the Qasimis, in a jihad. ‘The tribesman who enrolled under the Imam’s standard and came from north of San’a’ to the lowlands of the Tihamah, to Ibb, to Ta’izz, and al-Bayda’ was not referred to as a soldier but as a warrior in the cause of the God’ (Nu’man 1965: 27). Not all of Nu’man’s writing is intended as sober history, but the nature of these campaigns is not in doubt and they occurred of course well within living memory.’ <sup id="cite_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-74">[74]</a></sup> 'Imamic government was of a religious character, sharing power with and at times dominating, but never entirely restructuring or supplanting, rural political, military and legal structures.

The allegiance of the prominent shaikhs was rewarded by alliance and simultaneously controlled by a system of holding (and educating) young hostages from their families. During the reign of Imam Yahya, the developing administration of the Imamic state moved to institutionalize status differences. The cadre of the Imamic administration proclaimed themselves the bearers of the civilizing tradition of Islamic learning and law.

Al-Khamri, of course, is Bayt al-Ahmar’s home area. The al-Ahmars and Hashid acquired a very prominent place in relations between the Turks and the Imam, which they retained under al-Mutawakkil’s successors (ibid. 336, 354, and passim). By comparison, the Barat Bakil tribes, who had been so conspicuous in the mid-nineteenth century, played a somewhat subdued role. A little later, in 1882, Muhammad al-Huthi declared himself Imam at Barat and took the name al-Mahdi. He persisted in the claim until his death in 1901, but he was quite overshadowed by the Imams al-Hadi Sharaf al-Din (1879-90) and al-Mansur Muhammad (1890-1904), both of whom were concerned with great events on the plateau north of San’a’. His own career at Barat was a vita umbratilis, and even to Glaser in the Jawf (1903: 82) he was little more than a rumour. Dhu Muhammad and Dhu Husayn are mentioned both in the north and in Lower Yemen […] -a little later, in 1908, we find a mention of Naji Abu Ra’s of Dhu Muhammad as a Turkish ‘amil in Raydah […] -but the great axis of dispute between the south and the far north-east collapsed: it was the leaders of the more central northern tribes who now came to the fore. The great tribal families of today had appeared at the start of the eighteenth century; but what one sees as the start of the present century is the establishment of their present differences in wealth and power.’ <sup id="cite_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-76">[76]</a></sup> 'With the Turkish occupation (1872-1918), the dramatic events that historians record shift in part from the west and south into the tribes‘  own territory.

The clerk of the San’a’ court learned Turkish. Many if the ‘ulama’ supported the Turks even when the Imam’s fight against them was at its height, and he ambiguities of resisting the Turkish Sultan, who himself was seen to be beset by Christendom, were usually marked.

Yet most adherents of the different schools of Islam reside in distinct sections of the country, and this fact has certain political implications.

Location in the highlands apparently enables Zaydis more successfully to repel invasions than Shafis in the lower lying areas. A smaller Shia subsect, the Ismaili, and also the remnants of an ancient Jewish community, may still be found in certain parts of Yemen.

The interiors of Tihama houses may be highly ornamented. Buildings constructed of cinder blocks are routinely replacing the huts.

(A good many Turks individually had elected to stay on.) A Yemeni historian does justice to the novelty: "The army was divided inti numbered taburs, or "detachments", so the first was called the first tabur, the second called the second tabur, and so one. Three taburs togethere were called a liwa', and three liwa's were called a firqah, and the whole together was called the Victorious Regular Army.

"The Imam expended the utmost effort on this and showed enormous interest", and in the next year four taburs more were raised around Ta'izz. The number of regulars rose to 15-20,000.

There has also been extensive cultivation of fruits-both tropical (mangoes, plantains, bananas, melons, papayas, and citrus) and temperate (pears, peaches, apples, and grapes). The two main cash crops in the northern highlands are coffee (Coffea arabica) and khat (qāt; Catha edulis). The coffee trade, which began in the 16th century, was originally based on Yemeni coffee, and, for centuries, coffee was the most important and renowned export of Yemen. The port city of Mocha-from which a distinctive style of coffee takes its name-was the point from which most of Yemen’s coffee was exported between the 16th and 18th centuries, before more-economical plantation cultivation was introduced in other parts of the world.

While old accounting registers were predominantly horizontal (written) in orientation, the new exhibited a more vertical (numerical) alignment. Thus while the pages of a tax collector's manual from early in the century contained entries strung across the page like laundry on a line, a comparable manual from circa 1955 had two prominent axes, one of grain types, the other of terrace names, creating a grid for entering the relevant figures.

For the “Protecting Power,” he continues, “there is … a natural tendency to champion the shariʽa, for it is ‘tidier’ than the vagaries of local custom from the administrative point of view and provides better political propaganda.” Promotion of the shariʽa enabled (p.66) the British to “pose as in some degree the champion of Islam, in partial imitation of the Governments of the Yemen and of Saudi Arabia” (1970: 12n).' <sup id="cite_ref-135" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-135">[135]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Professional Lawyers ♣ absent ♥</b> The Ottoman administrators introduced reforms of the judicial system, but no professional advocates are mentioned: 'The twentieth century opened in Yemen with a judgeship recently modified in accord with Ottoman reforms. Behind the simple character of the 1916 Ottoman personnel list lies a template for a new way of thinking about the nature of the shariʽa court. Although the more sweeping changes represented by the new Nizamiyya courts established in the central provinces of the empire were not instituted in the highlands, there were some significant innovations. A modicum of “order” (nizam), on a scale reduced and adapted for the special circumstances of Ottoman rule in Yemen, was introduced into local judicial affairs, as it had been in the closely associated sphere ofinstruction. Like Ottoman schools, much of this new system would apparently be undone by Imam Yahya, only to reappear in the institutional reforms of the republic. Undramatic though they may now appear, the innovations signaled in the personnel list were elements of a comprehensive reformulation of the judicial process, and beyond, as in the case of instruction, of the state itself. The list embodies selected bits and pieces of a much larger Ottoman bureacratic scheme for a justice system, one roughly analogous (p.188) In scope and detail to the legislation for judicial organization enacted in Yemen in 1979. The 1916 Ibb court staff were implementing a style of bureaucratic behavior radically different from that of the patrimonial imamic state, one that would only begin to be fully elaborated conceptually and enacted in practice with the wave of legislation and accompanying generation of complex new state organs in the 1970s.'  <sup id="cite_ref-136" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-136">[136]</a></sup> In the Imamic system, Islamic legal scholars adjudicated disputes not resolved through tribal mechanisms: 'Central to the muwajaha format was the notion of responsiveness. An “official,” al-masʾul, was literally “the one asked.” What was sought from an imam or a governor, a mufti or a judge, was an “answer” (a jawab). In the case of the mufti, a query was posed and the answer was the fatwa. For the other three dispute-handling public officials, the imam in the capital and the governor and the judge on the provincial level, the approach was made in the form of a complaint or petition, known as a shakwa. Historically, shakwas were the general means by which individuals initiated actions in which they wanted to involve the state.9 Whether these were individual-state matters (employment, state credit, charity disbursement, tax matters) or individual-individual ones (p.171) (disputes of all sorts) pursued through the state, the shakwa always represented the opening move.' <sup id="cite_ref-137" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-137">[137]</a></sup> The Shafi'i and Zaydi legal systems did not admit professional lawyers or advocates.

The most common crops are cereals such as millet, corn (maize), wheat, barley, and sorghum; myriad vegetables from a burgeoning truck farm industry have appeared on the market in recent years.

During much of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, government authority -and, for that matter, urban traders- found it difficult to centralize agricultural surplus. In 1884 the Ottomans, short of grain, looted the homes of rural people in the vicinity of San'a' and in 1904 Imam Yahya and his supporters raided the homes of San'anis for grain. And much later, in the early years of the Republican regime, the first priority of the central government  was the building of adequate grain storage facilities. During the late 1960s, as often in the past, the threat of famine was a real one and government storehouses were drastically inadequate. This did not mean that cultivators were everywhere left with their surplus, but rather that relations of domination and tax collection were not centralized throughout much of the last two centuries. The farming out of taxes was as common as regular assessment by the central government. Effective coercive power often lay in the hands of rural landlords and leaders, especially the northern shaikhs.' <sup id="cite_ref-147" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-147">[147]</a></sup> So far, the sources have been silent on potential storage facilities constructed by the Ottomans.

</p><p><b> ♠ Knowledge/information buildings ♣ absent ♥ </b> [There were schools only in the large settlements but Qoranic literacy by the local imam was important.] The Imamate supported schools, publishing, and libraries: 'Although principally concerned with the administration of schools, Imam Yahya's Maʿarif administration also provided the umbrella for small-scale but significant early departures in state-initiated publishing, library reform, and officially sponsored history writing. The printing equipment in question had been left behind by the departing Turks, and the early imamic usage of it was partly inspired by that of the previous Ottoman administration. Like his school program, the imam's new library was an imaginative hybrid, a recasting of old institutional ideas in newly elaborated forms. The history-writing project, although new to Yemen, bore some resemblance to a far better known scholarly enterprise of the new Turkish Republic.1 These collateral maʿarif efforts were further assertions of a tentative yet determined attitude toward developing the state's identity and extending its authority by means of new textual technologies.' <sup id="cite_ref-150" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-150">[150]</a></sup> 'The first organizational step was the creation of a specially designated space: a new storey was constructed over arcades along the southern side of the Great Mosque (Sanʿaʾ) courtyard. Access to the library (located “south of the east minaret”) was by means of a long flight of steps. There the imam gathered what remained of the old collections together with his own large and newly created endowment. The properly qualified librarian, described in the decree, was to have “comprehensive knowledge of religion and jurisprudence so as to know the relative importance of the books and the disciplines.” This librarian-the scholarly brother of the historian al-Wasiʿi is named as the first holder of the position29-is required to “take a security deposit from each borrower in an amount greater than the value of the book borrowed.” “Tens of thousands of endowed books have been lost,” the imam wrote, “because of the nontaking of security deposits.” With a proper deposit a book could be borrowed for a period of six months. The contractual language of “loan” and “deposit,” and the notion that a book may be constituted as an “endowment,” come directly from the manuals of jurisprudence. In his initial organizing decree for his new library the imam also appointed a second library official, charged with documenting and indexing the collections.30 In the same year, the imam dispatched Muhammad Zabara to Ibb and nearby Jibla, where he was ordered to “find out about the endowment books for teachers and students and compile a listing of them in a register.”' <sup id="cite_ref-151" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-151">[151]</a></sup> It is assumed here that schooling was not widely available in the Ottoman period and absent from most settlements.

The determination of various European powers to establish a presence in the Middle East elicited an equally firm determination in other powers to thwart such efforts. For Yemen, the most important participants in the drama were the British, who took over Aden in 1839, and the Ottoman Empire, which at mid-century moved back into North Yemen, from which it had been driven by the Yemenis two centuries earlier. The interests and activities of these two powers in the Red Sea basin and Yemen were substantially intensified by the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 and the reemergence of the Red Sea route as the preferred passage between Europe and East Asia. As the Ottomans expanded inland and established themselves in Sanaa and Taʿizz, the British expanded north and east from Aden, eventually establishing protectorates over more than a dozen of the many local statelets; this was done more in the interest of protecting Aden’s hinterland from the Ottomans and their Yemeni adversaries than out of any desire to add the territory and people there to the British Empire. By the early 20th century the growing clashes between the British and the Ottomans along the undemarcated border posed a serious problem; in 1904 a joint commission surveyed the border, and a treaty was concluded, establishing the frontier between Ottoman North Yemen and the British possessions in South Yemen.

Zaydis, who belong to the Shia subsect of Islam, are located in the northern and eastern parts of Yemen, whereas Shafis, orthodox Sunnis, live in the southern and coastal regions. Location in the highlands apparently enables Zaydis more successfully to repel invasions than Shafis in the lower lying areas.

<p><b>Kinds of Written Documents</b>
</p>
<dl><dd><b> ♠ Lists, tables, and classifications ♣ present ♥ </b> The successive Yemeni administrations made use of sales instruments and other formal documentation, initially in traditional manuscript form, then in print: 'While the Syrian traveler (an exemplar of the print world, a graduate, with a literature major, from the American University in Beirut, and a writer of newspaper travel pieces on Yemen) did not report what sort of documents he had come in contact with, these could have been (p.232) (p.233) as diverse as memoranda, official correspondence, legal opinions, testaments, or sale instruments. All such handwritten texts were apt to exhibit the characteristic spiral form he describes. Given a blank page, a Yemeni writer of the period commenced far down on the page and indented radically toward the center. Since Arabic is written right to left, this meant roughly within the lower left quadrant. When the bottom was reached before the writing was finished, the spiral effect came into play. In short texts, completed at or before the bottom edge, there was no spiral, but a very wide margin remained to the right and across the top of the page.' <sup id="cite_ref-171" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-171">[171]</a></sup> Forms and clerical documents were introduced by the Ottomans: 'Forms, that is, documentary blanks to be filled in, appeared in Ibb with the Ottomans. At the local telegraph office, for example, one of the earliest of these forms had a crescent seal at the top, headings in Ottoman Turkish and French, boxes for office use, and lines to contain the message.11 Such blank forms proliferated in the Ottoman bureaucracies as they would later under the republicans. The commercial receipt, another type of printed form to be filled in, was introduced via Aden. Prior to the “order form” itself, the written purchase-requests Ibb merchants sent to Aden were connected narrations by a scribe (concluding with qala, “said,” and then the writer's name).12 Their internal arrangements were similar to the scalloped entries of the old foundation register. Existing apart from and prior to any particular written content, forms are the mechanical templates of the new age of writing. As with the Ottomans earlier in the century, the principal goal of the Egyptian advisors attached to Ibb offices in the late 1970s was to facilitate a bureacratic movement in a new direction, to assist functionaries in separating what had formerly been lumped together, to itemize what had been recorded whole. While old accounting registers were predominantly horizontal (written) in orientation, the new exhibited a more vertical (numerical) alignment. Thus while the pages of a tax collector's manual from early in the century contained entries strung across the page like laundry on a line, a comparable manual from circa 1955 had two prominent axes, one of grain types, the other of terrace names, creating a grid for entering the relevant figures. Vertical orientations facilitate whole-page summations and are associated with a new emphasis on the efficient extraction and display of numerical data, which used to be embedded in written text.' <sup id="cite_ref-172" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-172">[172]</a></sup> 'With the Turkish occupation (1872-1918), the dramatic events that historians record shift in part from the west and south into the tribes‘  own territory. The political reality was complex, and at most points up to 1918 the Turks found support from Yemenis, not least from certain northern shaykhs whose fortunes were bound up with the Turkish presence. The clerk of the San’a’ court learned Turkish. Many if the ‘ulama’ supported the Turks even when the Imam’s fight against them was at its height, and he ambiguities of resisting the Turkish Sultan, who himself was seen to be beset by Christendom, were usually marked. None the less there was sustained resistance in the north. Tribes and Imams fought the Turks repeatedly, and the dynasty of Imams emerged that was to rule Yemen until the 1960s.’ <sup id="cite_ref-173" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-173">[173]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b> ♠ Calendar ♣ present ♥ </b> See above.</dd>
<dd><b> ♠ Sacred Texts ♣ present ♥ </b> The primary works of reference were Qur'an and Sunna: 'A primary sort of textual authority was derived:4 it followed from the existence and importance of an original, genuine, and ultimately reliable text, which refers back to the position and identity of the Quran. “In the genealogy of texts,” Edward Said writes (1983: 46), “there is a first text, a sacred prototype, a scripture, which readers always approach through the text before them.” A genealogy of authoritative texts in Islam must begin with a consideration of the Quran as the authoritative original. The paradigmatic, Ur text qualities of the Quran concern both content and textual form. Substantively, the Quran and the Sunna, the practice of the Prophet, constituted the two fundamental “sources” (usul, sing. asl) for the elaboration of shariʽa jurisprudence. Discursively, the Quran represents both the end and the beginning of the kitab (text, scripture, writing, book). Just as Muhammad was the last, the “seal,” of the Prophets, and also the first Muslim, the Quran was the definitive and final kitab, whose particular authority would initiate and delimit a discursive tradition.' <sup id="cite_ref-174" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-174">[174]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b> ♠ Religious literature ♣ present ♥ </b> Scholars of Islamic law referred to biographical literature and legal manuals: 'For many centuries now, Ibb has supported an active community of Shafiʿi scholars. Despite their seemingly remote mountain valley location, town jurists were far from parochial. In terms of texts studied, theirs was not an unconventional local version of the shariʽa, Beginning with Ibn Samura and continuing to the present century, biographical histories provide views of the changing scholarly community in Ibb. A recently published work (Zabara 1979) devoted to noted individuals of the just-completed (fourteenth) Hegira century contains an entry on a distinguished Ibb scholar and prominent political figure who lived from 1876 to 1922, some seven and a half centuries after Faqih al-Nahi. Like al-Nahi, ʿAbd al-Rahman al-Haddad was an adherent of the Shafiʿi school of shariʽa jurisprudence. Both men were connected to the school through their relations with particular teachers and specific texts. In al-Haddad's case the teacher was his father, and the key text was a celebrated old manual known as Al-Minhaj. [...] Ibb scholars such as ʿAbd al-Rahman al-Haddad and, in the next generation, men such as his nephew and son-in-law, Ahmad b. Muhammad al-Haddad, whom I knew in the 1970s as an old man and a practicing court judge, commenced their higher studies with two standard Shafiʿi texts, the just-mentioned Al-Minhaj by Muhyi al-Din al-Nawawi, a Syrian who died in A.D. 1277,10 and a still more radically concise manual, known as Al-Mukhtasar (“the abridgment”) or simply as the matn, the “text,” of Abu Shuja, a resident of Basra active in the twelfth century.' <sup id="cite_ref-175" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-175">[175]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b> ♠ Practical literature ♣ inferred present ♥ </b> The Imamic government also published military manuals and pedagogical literature: 'In addition to his official newspaper and a monthly magazine that appeared briefly,25 Imam Yahya also authorized the printing of a number of books, both at the government press and overseas, especially in Cairo and the Levant. Rossi categorizes the government press output as of 1938 in three groups: editions of venerable old works by Yemeni scholars (a total of six books published and one in press); nine varied contemporary works; and two brief military manuals. Four books appear on the madrasa al-ʿilmiyya curriculum list given by al-Akwaʿ (1980). There is also a recognizable emphasis on pedagogical materials of various types. Works of a theoretical nature include a classic treatise on adab in darasa instruction; a little book entitled Risalafi al-tarbiya, which Rossi describes as a “collection of pedagogical recommendations inspired by modern concepts,” authored by the former inspector of elementary schools in Sanʿaʾ; and, finally, the two military manuals, one containing rules of army discipline inherited from the Turks with “few modifications,” the other a military pedagogy work by a Syrian officer in the employ of the imam.26 Many of the remaining publications are short works, including what Rossi describes as a sort of “catechism,” and brief treatises on Quran recitation, grammar, and history that appear suitable for use in the lower schools. Rossi states, however, that at the time of his visit in 1937 “neither a textbook nor a syllabary for elementary students has yet been printed in Yemen.”' <sup id="cite_ref-176" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-176">[176]</a></sup> During the Imamate, codified rules for the use of educational institutions, such as libraries, were introduced: 'It is not only such things as the holdings of printed books and the use of metric system measures that are indicative of an emergent new order in Imam Yahya's library. Complementing the specially developed classificatory system are an elaboration of detailed rules of “library” conduct, which are set forth in a supplementary imamic order of 1938. In a manner familiar to Western library users, these rules define a library negatively, in terms of inappropriate behaviors' <sup id="cite_ref-177" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-177">[177]</a></sup> It is assumed here that similar manuals existed during the Ottoman period as well.</dd>
<dd><b> ♠ History ♣ inferred present ♥ </b> The Imamate supported historiography: 'Although principally concerned with the administration of schools, Imam Yahya's Maʿarif administration also provided the umbrella for small-scale but significant early departures in state-initiated publishing, library reform, and officially sponsored history writing. The printing equipment in question had been left behind by the departing Turks, and the early imamic usage of it was partly inspired by that of the previous Ottoman administration. Like his school program, the imam's new library was an imaginative hybrid, a recasting of old institutional ideas in newly elaborated forms. The history-writing project, although new to Yemen, bore some resemblance to a far better known scholarly enterprise of the new Turkish Republic.1 These collateral maʿarif efforts were further assertions of a tentative yet determined attitude toward developing the state's identity and extending its authority by means of new textual technologies.' <sup id="cite_ref-178" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-178">[178]</a></sup> It is assumed here that historiography was produced during the Ottoman period as well.</dd>

Houses and mosques found in different regions of the country reflect unique stylistic and functional variations. Highlanders construct multistoried buildings from smooth, layered mud, mud brick, or cut stone. Dwellings in San\??\a are particularly impressive with their decorative colored-glass windows. In the rural highlands, houses constructed atop terraced embankments were fortresses against enemy tribes. In cities along the coastal plain, the former elegance of houses and mosques can be seen in their elaborate doors and facades. Rural towns in the Tihama usually include a walled compound that contains mud and thatched-roof huts identical to those found in Africa, on the other side of the Red Sea. The interiors of Tihama houses may be highly ornamented. Buildings constructed of cinder blocks are routinely replacing the huts. Competitive poetry duels performed at weddings by men of tribal status are highly valued. In the past, celebrations for circumcision (required of all Muslim males) were particularly elaborate, but now government officials discourage postinfancy circumcisions, thereby undermining the importance of ceremonial specialists.' <sup id="cite_ref-200" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-200">[200]</a></sup> Dresch refers to mountain strongholds when relating the uprisings against the Ottomans: 'Several claimants to the Imamate were active. In Zaydism it is possible in theory as well as practice to have more than one Imam at one, but in 1904 the Imamate passed to Yahya Muhammad Hamid al-Din, whose father before him had claimed the title since 1890, and Yahya took the regnal name al-Mutawakkil 'ala Allah, "He who relies on God". Though none in his particular line before his father had been Imam, the family were descendants of al-Qasim, and, as it happened, Yahya's theology was of Qasimi form. His claim in correspondence, like that of all Imams, was to descent from his ultimate ancestor, the Prophet of God; his duty was to wage the jihad against oppressors. Like his father, he launched a rising in northern Yemen, and all the old calumnies against the Turks from the last time that "Turks" ruled Yemen, in the sixteenth century, were redeployed: that they were corrupt, allowed the drinking of wine, had a taste for small boys, exploited the poor, failed to uphold God's law, and, in short, were scarcely Muslims. The details of the fight were complex. So were the issues fuelling it. The Turks at most points had Yemeni supporters: indeed by then there was something of a local bureaucracy staffed by Yemenis, many judges and clerks spoke Turkish as well, several Yemeni delegations had travelled to Istanbul, and not everyone near Sanaa or even the Prophet's kin supported the Imam.  [...] The revolt was in the northern countryside. Many tribes there, like many learned persons, had taken stipends since the Turks arrived, but offences against their leaders' status, interference with their land, attempts to tax them, and famine induced by recurrent drought all provoked opposition. [...] In the midst of a general famine Sanaa surrendered in 1905: "it's markets were destroyed, its houses empty, and only a few of its inhabitants were left". Fighting went on as far as Qa'tabah, but little towns in lower Yemen, such as Ibb, mainly stood with the Ottomans even when Sanaa fell. The Turks landed thousands of fresh troops, retook their capital, and pushed north to the mountain stronghold of Shaharah where they were beaten with heavy losses. In the course of that year they lost 30,000 men.' <sup id="cite_ref-201" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-201">[201]</a></sup> ‘The Porte again pursued negotiations and again sent reinforcements, this time landing some 42,000 fresh troops at al-Hudaydah by June 1905 (Baldry 1977: 50).

<p><b> ♠ Standing armies ♣ present ♥ </b> Turkish and European forces were present throughout the colonial period: 'Yemen resisted foreign rule, but two occupations by the Ottoman Turks occurred?between the mid-sixteenth to early seventeenth centuries and from the 1870s to 1918. The imams then sought to reassert their political authority over the tribes of Yemen and against Saudi Arabia. The assassination of Iman Yahya in 1948 was eventually followed by a successful revolt of dissident army officers, intellectuals, and businessmen in 1962. Civil warfare lasted into the 1970s and reerupted in the 1990s.' <sup id="cite_ref-206" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-206">[206]</a></sup> 'Developments in the 19th century were fateful for Yemen. The determination of various European powers to establish a presence in the Middle East elicited an equally firm determination in other powers to thwart such efforts. For Yemen, the most important participants in the drama were the British, who took over Aden in 1839, and the Ottoman Empire, which at mid-century moved back into North Yemen, from which it had been driven by the Yemenis two centuries earlier. The interests and activities of these two powers in the Red Sea basin and Yemen were substantially intensified by the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 and the reemergence of the Red Sea route as the preferred passage between Europe and East Asia. As the Ottomans expanded inland and established themselves in Sanaa and Taʿizz, the British expanded north and east from Aden, eventually establishing protectorates over more than a dozen of the many local statelets; this was done more in the interest of protecting Aden’s hinterland from the Ottomans and their Yemeni adversaries than out of any desire to add the territory and people there to the British Empire. By the early 20th century the growing clashes between the British and the Ottomans along the undemarcated border posed a serious problem; in 1904 a joint commission surveyed the border, and a treaty was concluded, establishing the frontier between Ottoman North Yemen and the British possessions in South Yemen. Later, of course, both Yemens considered the treaty an egregious instance of non-Yemeni interference in domestic affairs. The north became independent at the end of World War I in 1918, with the departure of the Ottoman forces; the imam of the Zaydīs, Yaḥyā Maḥmūd al-Mutawwakil, became the de facto ruler in the north by virtue of his lengthy campaign against the Ottoman presence in Yemen. In the 1920s Imam Yaḥyā sought to consolidate his hold on the country by working to bring the Shāfiʿī areas under his administrative jurisdiction and by suppressing much of the intertribal feuding and tribal opposition to the imamate. In an effort to enhance the effectiveness of his campaigns against the tribes and other fractious elements, the imam sent a group of Yemeni youth to Iraq in the mid-1930s to learn modern military techniques and weaponry. These students would eventually become the kernel of domestic opposition to Yaḥyā and his policies.' <sup id="cite_ref-207" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-207">[207]</a></sup> Ottoman troops were involved in multiple clashes with tribal and Imamic forces: ‘Al-Mansur suffered a stroke, and in September 1904 he died (ibid. 393-403). His son Yahya took the Imamate, which he was to hold until his death in 1948. As a number of authors have noted […], the success of his claim was very probably due to the support of Nasir Mabkhut al-Ahmar, who had (at least most of the time) supported al-Mansur.

Perhaps as many as thirty thousand troops were transferred to Yemen […]. And the Mufti of Hamah arrived in San’a’ on the Sultan’s orders to attempt negotiations with Iman al-Mansur, but the talks foundered. In May 189 Faydi Pasha began moving north. Bani ‘Abd, on the mountains north of Raydah, put up stiff resistance, but parts of Bani Suraym submitted in return for stipends. The Imam almost despaired. But, as one of his advisors pointed out, he could not afford to dispense with Hashid, and without Hashid he had no security at all (ibid, 2/79-80). In June Faydi reached al-Waflah, destroyed the houses of the Imam’s supporters there and promptly withdrew. Four months later, when Hashid reaffirmed their support for the Imam at Huth, they could only express their regret at having let Faydi in (al-Hibshi 1980: 500).’ <sup id="cite_ref-209" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-209">[209]</a></sup> The Imamate continued to rely on Turkish forms of military organization and expertise in the first half of the 20th century: 'In 1919, two thousand men were levied from tribes near Sanaa and trained "according to the rules of the Turkish army". (A good many Turks individually had elected to stay on.) A Yemeni historian does justice to the novelty: "The army was divided into numbered taburs, or "detachments", so the first was called the first tabur, the second called the second tabur, and so one. Three taburs togethere were called a liwa', and three liwa's were called a firqah, and the whole together was called the Victorious Regular Army. Every tabur was made up of four blocs...and each of them had its number, the first and the second and so forth." Unlike tribal levies, this army had a fixed pay scale. The officers were mainly Turkish -indeed, instruction remained in Turkish until the 1930s; some, though, were Yemenis who had been to Turkish schools and command was given to 'Abdullah Dumayn, a sayyid from the Jawf who had served with the Turks in the rank of bekbashi. "The Imam expended the utmost effort on this and showed enormous interest", and in the next year four taburs more were raised around Ta'izz. The number of regulars rose to 15-20,000. A school for telegraphists was opened, allowing the Imam's care for detail to reach everywhere.' <sup id="cite_ref-210" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-210">[210]</a></sup> Tribal forces should not be considered in these terms.

<p><b>♠ Inter-polity wars ♣ present ♥</b>  absent/present/inferred present/inferred absent/uncoded/unknown Many of the clashes during the Ottoman period involved tribal, Imamic, and Ottoman as well as British forces, blurring the boundaries between inter-polity and intra-polity wars. The Imams fought Ottoman forces: 'Several claimants to the Imamate were active. In Zaydism it is possible in theory as well as practice to have more than one Imam at one, but in 1904 the Imamate passed to Yahya Muhammad Hamid al-Din, whose father before him had claimed the title since 1890, and Yahya took the regnal name al-Mutawakkil 'ala Allah, "He who relies on God". Though none in his particular line before his father had been Imam, the family were descendants of al-Qasim, and, as it happened, Yahya's theology was of Qasimi form. His claim in correspondence, like that of all Imams, was to descent from his ultimate ancestor, the Prophet of God; his duty was to wage the jihad against oppressors. Like his father, he launched a rising in northern Yemen, and all the old calumnies against the Turks from the last time that "Turks" ruled Yemen, in the sixteenth century, were redeployed: that they were corrupt, allowed the drinking of wine, had a taste for small boys, exploited the poor, failed to uphold God's law, and, in short, were scarcely Muslims. The details of the fight were complex. So were the issues fuelling it. The Turks at most points had Yemeni supporters: indeed by then there was something of a local bureaucracy staffed by Yemenis, many judges and clerks spoke Turkish as well, several Yemeni delegations had travelled to Istanbul, and not everyone near Sanaa or even the Prophet's kin supported the Imam.  [...] The revolt was in the northern countryside. Many tribes there, like many learned persons, had taken stipends since the Turks arrived, but offences against their leaders' status, interference with their land, attempts to tax them, and famine induced by recurrent drought all provoked opposition. [...] In the midst of a general famine Sanaa surrendered in 1905: "it's markets were destroyed, its houses empty, and only a few of its inhabitants were left". Fighting went on as far as Qa'tabah, but little towns in lower Yemen, such as Ibb, mainly stood with the Ottomans even when Sanaa fell. The Turks landed thousands of fresh troops, retook their capital, and pushed north to the mountain stronghold of Shaharah where they were beaten with heavy losses. In the course of that year they lost 30,000 men.' <sup id="cite_ref-215" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-215">[215]</a></sup> ‘In 1910 Yahya sent emissaries to Jabal Barat to organize a renewal of the fighting against the Turks (Zabarah 1956: ii. 174-80) and San’a’ was again besieged: with huge numbers of fresh troops the Turks again reconquered the areas south of San’a’ and reached the city itself in April 1911. But this time, mindful of the empire’s commitments elsewhere (the Italians had just invaded Tripoli), they did not pursue the Imam northwards. Instead negotiations were begun at once. In October 1911 the Turks and the Imam met at Da’’an, on Jabal ‘Iyal Yazd, and signed a truce that, although not ratified by imperial firman until two years later, was upheld by both sides thereafter. Upper Yemen was ceded to the Imam’s control.’ <sup id="cite_ref-216" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-216">[216]</a></sup> ‘The Porte again pursued negotiations and again sent reinforcements, this time landing some 42,000 fresh troops at al-Hudaydah by June 1905 (Baldry 1977: 50).

Now, hesitantly, they armed the treaty chiefs, and in 1922, using aircraft. to which Yahya had no effective counter, they bombed the Imam's men out of Hawshabi south of Dali'. Negotiations in 1926 came to little, and in 1927 Qa'tabah (just north of the old Anglo-Turkish line) was bombed and machine-gunned for five days, at which stage the Imam's men were 50 kilometres from Aden. Even Ibb, 100 kilometres north again from Qa'tabah, was strafed and Ta'izz itself was bombed.' <sup id="cite_ref-218" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-218">[218]</a></sup> The Imams also fought tribal forces once an agreement with the Ottomans had been established: ‘With the treaty of Da’’an the Imam became a Turkish ally. The Idrisi of ‘Asir, who had risen to prominence in the Tihamah some years before and fought the Turks much as Yahya did, became the enemy of both. The tribal shaykhs had alternately supported the Imam and exploited the possibility of playing off the Turks against him, and certain of them had been present at Da’’an when the truce was signed: Nasur al-Ahmar, for instance, Hamid Shariyan of Dhu Husayn, and Jibran al-Ghashmi of Hamdan (Zabarah 956: ii. 208-9). As the polarity between the Imam and the Idrisi intensified, however, so shaykhs and tribes again found themselves between two competing powers. In 1912 fighting broke out between the Imam’s men and the Idrisi’s in Hajur, Khawlan, and Jabal Razih, west of Sa’dah […]. Some of the Hashid shaykhs, not least of them Bayt al-Ahmar, went so far as to swear the Idrisi allegiance and send him hostages […], which might remind us how careful we should be about thinking of them always as ‘Zaydis’.’ <sup id="cite_ref-219" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-219">[219]</a></sup> British and Ottoman forces clashed as well: 'Developments in the 19th century were fateful for Yemen. The determination of various European powers to establish a presence in the Middle East elicited an equally firm determination in other powers to thwart such efforts. For Yemen, the most important participants in the drama were the British, who took over Aden in 1839, and the Ottoman Empire, which at mid-century moved back into North Yemen, from which it had been driven by the Yemenis two centuries earlier. The interests and activities of these two powers in the Red Sea basin and Yemen were substantially intensified by the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 and the reemergence of the Red Sea route as the preferred passage between Europe and East Asia. As the Ottomans expanded inland and established themselves in Sanaa and Taʿizz, the British expanded north and east from Aden, eventually establishing protectorates over more than a dozen of the many local statelets; this was done more in the interest of protecting Aden’s hinterland from the Ottomans and their Yemeni adversaries than out of any desire to add the territory and people there to the British Empire. By the early 20th century the growing clashes between the British and the Ottomans along the undemarcated border posed a serious problem; in 1904 a joint commission surveyed the border, and a treaty was concluded, establishing the frontier between Ottoman North Yemen and the British possessions in South Yemen. Later, of course, both Yemens considered the treaty an egregious instance of non-Yemeni interference in domestic affairs. The north became independent at the end of World War I in 1918, with the departure of the Ottoman forces; the imam of the Zaydīs, Yaḥyā Maḥmūd al-Mutawwakil, became the de facto ruler in the north by virtue of his lengthy campaign against the Ottoman presence in Yemen. In the 1920s Imam Yaḥyā sought to consolidate his hold on the country by working to bring the Shāfiʿī areas under his administrative jurisdiction and by suppressing much of the intertribal feuding and tribal opposition to the imamate. In an effort to enhance the effectiveness of his campaigns against the tribes and other fractious elements, the imam sent a group of Yemeni youth to Iraq in the mid-1930s to learn modern military techniques and weaponry. These students would eventually become the kernel of domestic opposition to Yaḥyā and his policies.' <sup id="cite_ref-220" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-220">[220]</a></sup>

From the start of the rising certain northern shaykhs were conspicuous in the area, probably fighting around their own landholdings: Nasir Mabkhut al-Ahmar of al-‘Usaymat and Muhsin al-Qayifi of Kharif around Mahwit […]. Zafir Hajjah was finally surrendered after having been held by the Imam’s supporters for a full year. Nasir al-Ahmar admitted that although the water tanks were running dry and his men were exhausted, the surrender itself involved ‘a sum of money’ (shay’ min al-mal).  ‘Ali al-Iryani reckoned it at 11,000 riyals (Zabarah 1956:i. 2/81-2), an enormous sum by the standards of the time.’ <sup id="cite_ref-227" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-227">[227]</a></sup> ‘Al-Hadi Sharaf al-Din died in 1890.

The sayyids of the Sa’dah area took time to organize themselves around him (al-Mahdi Muhammad was still active at Barat), and meanwhile some hundreds of Hashid chiefs came into San’a’, returning still in receipt of large Turkish stipends (al-Hibshi 1980: 393-9). But the rains then failed, and fighting broke out between the tribes just north-east of San’a’. The sorghum crop was ruined in the summer by locusts and the Turks applied severe pressure to the shaykhs of Hajjah, among other areas, presumably to extract taxes […].’ <sup id="cite_ref-228" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-228">[228]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Intra-elite conflicts ♣ present ♥</b> Many conflicts saw leaders of different tribal, political, and military factions competing for power. In the case of conflicts involving tribes, it is hard to draw a clear distinction between intra-elite conflicts and popular uprisings, as both shaykhs and their followers were involved: 'Zaydi tribes disputed Yahya's control as they had always doneand through the 1920s as many skirmishes were fought against "rebels" (bughah) north of Sanaa as south. Hashid, for example, had supported the Imam against the Turks in the fighting of 1910-11 and Yahya had lived among them through much of World War I; in December 1924, however, Imamic forces fought their way, into Hashid's main town, Khamir, and "set their affairs in order", taking hostages from Bani Suraym and Kharif and billetting troops on them "as is done to subjects other than them in all the Imamic lands" (the urban chronicler's satisfaction is plain here, though committed to print three decades later; the term "subject" denies any difference between tribes and peasants). Arhab, a Bakil tribe nearby, also had to surrender hostages. Al-'Usaymat and 'Idhar, two Hashid tribes in the region near Shaharah where Yahya first claimed the Imamate in 1904, were left alone after swearing their nominal allegiance.' <sup id="cite_ref-229" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-229">[229]</a></sup> 'Not until 1928 was all Hashid under the Imam's control, and not until the 1930s did he control the east around Ma'rib - such tribes as 'Abidah and Murad, importantly - or the northeast near Jabal Barat, the homeland of Dhu Muhammad and Dhu Husyan. His progress around Ta'izz was more rapid. When a number of Lower Yemeni leaders conspired in the 1920s (perhaps specifically against Zaydi rule; the sources obscure the issue) Yahya had large numbers of shaykhs sent in chains to Sanaa where few survived. But the most important did so. Indeed 'Abd al-Wahhab Nu'man, the great baron of Hugariyyah, re-emerged for a time as governor of Bilad al-Bustan nera Sanaa. The pattern throughout was of negotiation, blandishments and severity of a kind hard to summarise, for one shaykh was used against another, one tribe against another, amid shifting complexities which the language of jihad obscures. In the midst of this the rudiments of state power emerged. A shaykh of Hamdan, just north of Sanaa, felt he desrved more consideration and Yahya asked him angrily, "Who made you a shaykh?" "The same as made you Imam", came the answer; but Yahya gained means before long to have 'Ali Mutlaq chained in a dungeon for twenty years.' <sup id="cite_ref-230" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-230">[230]</a></sup> al-Idrisi was a notable example of a tribal leaders at odds with the Imams: 'Muhammad 'Ali al-Idrisi, based in 'Asir, had been at odds with Yahya since the 1911 truce. In 1915 the British signed a treaty with him against the Turks (from 1917 they paid a stipend), and after the war he gained from them Hudaydah; but he also signed an agreement with 'Abd al-'Aziz Ibn Sa'ud, then Sultan of Najd, late in 1920. Ibn Sa'ud at this date seemed a long way from Yemeni concerns. The Idrisi himself, however, attracted wide support, not least from Bayt al-Ahmar the paramount shaykhs of Hashid ('Ali Dahhan al-Ahmar and Nasir Nasir al-Ahmar in turn both went to him), and just after World War I, Yahya al-Shayif of Dhu Husayn at Barat, among the greatest of Bakil tribes, had appeared in Aden as his spokesman, promoting a "confederation" to include, as the British were told, "Zaydis and Shafi'is and Isma'ilis". After 1918 many of Yahyas battles in the fertile mountains overlooking the Tihamah - from Razih in the north, through al-Haymah and Rayma, to Wusab in the south - were contests with the Idrisi state.' <sup id="cite_ref-231" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-231">[231]</a></sup> ‘With the treaty of Da’’an the Imam became a Turkish ally.

Hashid, for example, had supported the Imam against the Turks in the fighting of 1910-11 and Yahya had lived among them through much of World War I; in December 1924, however, Imamic forces fought their way, into Hashid's main town, Khamir, and "set their affairs in order", taking hostages from Bani Suraym and Kharif and billetting troops on them "as is done to subjects other than them in all the Imamic lands" (the urban chronicler's satisfaction is plain here, though committed to print three decades later; the term "subject" denies any difference between tribes and peasants). Arhab, a Bakil tribe nearby, also had to surrender hostages. Al-'Usaymat and 'Idhar, two Hashid tribes in the region near Shaharah where Yahya first claimed the Imamate in 1904, were left alone after swearing their nominal allegiance.' <sup id="cite_ref-233" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-233">[233]</a></sup> 'Not until 1928 was all Hashid under the Imam's control, and not until the 1930s did he control the east around Ma'rib - such tribes as 'Abidah and Murad, importantly - or the northeast near Jabal Barat, the homeland of Dhu Muhammad and Dhu Husyan. His progress around Ta'izz was more rapid. When a number of Lower Yemeni leaders conspired in the 1920s (perhaps specifically against Zaydi rule; the sources obscure the issue) Yahya had large numbers of shaykhs sent in chains to Sanaa where few survived. But the most important did so. Indeed 'Abd al-Wahhab Nu'man, the great baron of Hugariyyah, re-emerged for a time as governor of Bilad al-Bustan nera Sanaa. The pattern throughout was of negotiation, blandishments and severity of a kind hard to summarise, for one shaykh was used against another, one tribe against another, amid shifting complexities which the language of jihad obscures. In the midst of this the rudiments of state power emerged. A shaykh of Hamdan, just north of Sanaa, felt he desrved more consideration and Yahya asked him angrily, "Who made you a shaykh?" "The same as made you Imam", came the answer; but Yahya gained means before long to have 'Ali Mutlaq chained in a dungeon for twenty years.' <sup id="cite_ref-234" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-234">[234]</a></sup> Shaykhs relied on popular tribal support when fighting among themselves or against Imamic and Ottoman opponents: 'Muhammad 'Ali al-Idrisi, based in 'Asir, had been at odds with Yahya since the 1911 truce. In 1915 the British signed a treaty with him against the Turks (from 1917 they paid a stipend), and after the war he gained from them Hudaydah; but he also signed an agreement with 'Abd al-'Aziz Ibn Sa'ud, then Sultan of Najd, late in 1920. Ibn Sa'ud at this date seemed a long way from Yemeni concerns. The Idrisi himself, however, attracted wide support, not least from Bayt al-Ahmar the paramount shaykhs of Hashid ('Ali Dahhan al-Ahmar and Nasir Nasir al-Ahmar in turn both went to him), and just after World War I, Yahya al-Shayif of Dhu Husayn at Barat, among the greatest of Bakil tribes, had appeared in Aden as his spokesman, promoting a "confederation" to include, as the British were told, "Zaydis and Shafi'is and Isma'ilis". After 1918 many of Yahyas battles in the fertile mountains overlooking the Tihamah - from Razih in the north, through al-Haymah and Rayma, to Wusab in the south - were contests with the Idrisi state.' <sup id="cite_ref-235" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-235">[235]</a></sup> The period also saw tribal insurrections: 'The Imam then arrested his own appointee in Hajjah, Yahya Shayban, probably over a discrepancy in the accounts, and Muhsin Shayban announced an insurrection. A recent (republican) author asserts that ‘Shaykh Nasir al-Ahmar had no choice but to send a force from Hashin under the command of his son, Shaykh Husyan’ (al-Shamahi 1972: 172), which is probably to collapse into one episode a struggle that went on for years. Certainly, however, Muhammad Ghalib al-Qudaymi of Kharif was present in support of Shayban […], and when the insurrection failed Shayban fled to Hashid (almost certainly to Kharif), which was beyond the Imam’s control. Just after this, Hashid tribesmen again appeared with the Idrisi, further west.' <sup id="cite_ref-236" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-236">[236]</a></sup> ‘The Porte again pursued negotiations and again sent reinforcements, this time landing some 42,000 fresh troops at al-Hudaydah by June 1905 (Baldry 1977: 50). At the beginning of September, Faydi reoccupied San’a’ and then moved north, again being let pass by Bani Suryam. Ten battalions were committed to besiege the Imam at Shaharah. The sheer cliffs there are imposing at any time, with birds of prey always circling above them; even rifle fire at weddings echoes off the mountains like thunder. A veritable war, with small arms and artillery, was fought there for more than a month (Zabarah 1956: ii. 28-31) until the Turks gave op and withdrew with heavy losses.  A battalion detached to ‘Iyal Yazid was annihilated, and a thousand troops surprised by the tribesmen near Khamir were wiped out to the last man (Baldry 1977: 58). There was nothing to show for it. At Shaharah now there is still a pair of field-guns, engraved in ornate Ottoman script at the breech with ‘Frederick Krupp, Essen’: an oddly specific remnant from the period of dreadnoughts and diplomacy elsewhere.

<p><b>♠ Wars within same ethnic group ♣ present ♥</b> Imamic and tribal forces fought among themselves in addition to clashes with the Ottomans: 'Developments in the 19th century were fateful for Yemen. The determination of various European powers to establish a presence in the Middle East elicited an equally firm determination in other powers to thwart such efforts. For Yemen, the most important participants in the drama were the British, who took over Aden in 1839, and the Ottoman Empire, which at mid-century moved back into North Yemen, from which it had been driven by the Yemenis two centuries earlier. The interests and activities of these two powers in the Red Sea basin and Yemen were substantially intensified by the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 and the reemergence of the Red Sea route as the preferred passage between Europe and East Asia. As the Ottomans expanded inland and established themselves in Sanaa and Taʿizz, the British expanded north and east from Aden, eventually establishing protectorates over more than a dozen of the many local statelets; this was done more in the interest of protecting Aden’s hinterland from the Ottomans and their Yemeni adversaries than out of any desire to add the territory and people there to the British Empire. By the early 20th century the growing clashes between the British and the Ottomans along the undemarcated border posed a serious problem; in 1904 a joint commission surveyed the border, and a treaty was concluded, establishing the frontier between Ottoman North Yemen and the British possessions in South Yemen. Later, of course, both Yemens considered the treaty an egregious instance of non-Yemeni interference in domestic affairs. The north became independent at the end of World War I in 1918, with the departure of the Ottoman forces; the imam of the Zaydīs, Yaḥyā Maḥmūd al-Mutawwakil, became the de facto ruler in the north by virtue of his lengthy campaign against the Ottoman presence in Yemen. In the 1920s Imam Yaḥyā sought to consolidate his hold on the country by working to bring the Shāfiʿī areas under his administrative jurisdiction and by suppressing much of the intertribal feuding and tribal opposition to the imamate. In an effort to enhance the effectiveness of his campaigns against the tribes and other fractious elements, the imam sent a group of Yemeni youth to Iraq in the mid-1930s to learn modern military techniques and weaponry. These students would eventually become the kernel of domestic opposition to Yaḥyā and his policies.' <sup id="cite_ref-242" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-242">[242]</a></sup> ‘In the west the Imam suffered further setbacks. From the start of the rising certain northern shaykhs were conspicuous in the area, probably fighting around their own landholdings: Nasir Mabkhut al-Ahmar of al-‘Usaymat and Muhsin al-Qayifi of Kharif around Mahwit […]. Zafir Hajjah was finally surrendered after having been held by the Imam’s supporters for a full year. Nasir al-Ahmar admitted that although the water tanks were running dry and his men were exhausted, the surrender itself involved ‘a sum of money’ (shay’ min al-mal).  ‘Ali al-Iryani reckoned it at 11,000 riyals (Zabarah 1956:i. 2/81-2), an enormous sum by the standards of the time.’ <sup id="cite_ref-243" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-243">[243]</a></sup> ‘Al-Hadi Sharaf al-Din died in 1890. Al-Mansur Muhammad Hamid al-Din, who was in San’a’ at the time, was called on to take the Imamate and had little option but to leave he city. The sayyids of the Sa’dah area took time to organize themselves around him (al-Mahdi Muhammad was still active at Barat), and meanwhile some hundreds of Hashid chiefs came into San’a’, returning still in receipt of large Turkish stipends (al-Hibshi 1980: 393-9). But the rains then failed, and fighting broke out between the tribes just north-east of San’a’. The sorghum crop was ruined in the summer by locusts and the Turks applied severe pressure to the shaykhs of Hajjah, among other areas, presumably to extract taxes […].’ <sup id="cite_ref-244" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-244">[244]</a></sup> Tribes also fought each other when supporting the rival Imamic and Ottoman factions: ‘It was around Hajjah that the most serious results ensued. The Turkish governor attacked Mabkhut al-Ahmar’s property and provoked a counter-attack. The Imam had already promoted an attack on the Turks in January 1891, but serious fighting only now broke out in May, and in June Zafir Hajjah was taken by a force which Mabkhut al-Ahmar led […]. Arhab, ‘Iyal Surayh, and Hamdan all rose and attacked the areas around San’a’, although the Turks sought advice from Bin Sinan ‘the ‘amil of Arhab’ (al-Hibshi 1980: 424). Parts of Khawlan sent hostages to the Imam, the Turks sealed the city off, and fires began to appear at night on the surrounding mountains.

</p><p><b>♠ Wars involving groups with different language families  ♣ present ♥</b> The Imams and tribal coalitions fought Ottoman forces: 'Several claimants to the Imamate were active. In Zaydism it is possible in theory as well as practice to have more than one Imam at one, but in 1904 the Imamate passed to Yahya Muhammad Hamid al-Din, whose father before him had claimed the title since 1890, and Yahya took the regnal name al-Mutawakkil 'ala Allah, "He who relies on God". Though none in his particular line before his father had been Imam, the family were descendants of al-Qasim, and, as it happened, Yahya's theology was of Qasimi form. His claim in correspondence, like that of all Imams, was to descent from his ultimate ancestor, the Prophet of God; his duty was to wage the jihad against oppressors. Like his father, he launched a rising in northern Yemen, and all the old calumnies against the Turks from the last time that "Turks" ruled Yemen, in the sixteenth century, were redeployed: that they were corrupt, allowed the drinking of wine, had a taste for small boys, exploited the poor, failed to uphold God's law, and, in short, were scarcely Muslims. The details of the fight were complex. So were the issues fuelling it. The Turks at most points had Yemeni supporters: indeed by then there was something of a local bureaucracy staffed by Yemenis, many judges and clerks spoke Turkish as well, several Yemeni delegations had travelled to Istanbul, and not everyone near Sanaa or even the Prophet's kin supported the Imam.  [...] The revolt was in the northern countryside. Many tribes there, like many learned persons, had taken stipends since the Turks arrived, but offences against their leaders' status, interference with their land, attempts to tax them, and famine induced by recurrent drought all provoked opposition. [...] In the midst of a general famine Sanaa surrendered in 1905: "it's markets were destroyed, its houses empty, and only a few of its inhabitants were left". Fighting went on as far as Qa'tabah, but little towns in lower Yemen, such as Ibb, mainly stood with the Ottomans even when Sanaa fell. The Turks landed thousands of fresh troops, retook their capital, and pushed north to the mountain stronghold of Shaharah where they were beaten with heavy losses.

But this time, mindful of the empire’s commitments elsewhere (the Italians had just invaded Tripoli), they did not pursue the Imam northwards. Instead negotiations were begun at once. In October 1911 the Turks and the Imam met at Da’’an, on Jabal ‘Iyal Yazd, and signed a truce that, although not ratified by imperial firman until two years later, was upheld by both sides thereafter.

A veritable war, with small arms and artillery, was fought there for more than a month (Zabarah 1956: ii. 28-31) until the Turks gave op and withdrew with heavy losses.  A battalion detached to ‘Iyal Yazid was annihilated, and a thousand troops surprised by the tribesmen near Khamir were wiped out to the last man (Baldry 1977: 58). There was nothing to show for it. At Shaharah now there is still a pair of field-guns, engraved in ornate Ottoman script at the breech with
‘Frederick Krupp, Essen’: an oddly specific remnant from the period of dreadnoughts and diplomacy elsewhere. The pattern of events, though, was much as it had been in the first Turkish wars there hundred years earlier in the time of the Mamelukes.’ <sup id="cite_ref-255" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-255">[255]</a></sup> Yemen's Muslim population consists mostly of Zaydi and Shafi'i communities; some conflicts involved members of different Muslim groups on opposing sides.  Sectarian divisions were occasionally deployed as rallying cries in various clashes: 'The armies that conquered these southern areas were made up of northern tribesmen. But those who in Lower Yemen were ansar al-haqq or mujahidin (‘supporters of the truth’, ‘warriors in the cause of God’), were in their own territory still most often cast as ‘evil ones’ (ashrar), ‘tyrants’ (bughah), and unbelievers. They were most conspicuous in the west, where the Tihamah was in the hands of the Idrisi and the coastal towns were occupied for some years by the British who supported him. At the same time as their followers were supporting the Imam’s southern c onquests, greedily ambitious people from Hashid and Bakil appeared with the Idrisi in the Tihamah (Zabarah 1956: iii. 28).

The tribes were directed against the Shafi’i areas of Lower Yemen, much as they had been by the Qasimis, in a jihad. ‘The tribesman who enrolled under the Imam’s standard and came from north of San’a’ to the lowlands of the Tihamah, to Ibb, to Ta’izz, and al-Bayda’ was not referred to as a soldier but as a warrior in the cause of the God’ (Nu’man 1965: 27).

</p><p><b>♠ Wars between different world religions ♣ present ♥</b> The British occasionally clashed with the Ottomans: 'Developments in the 19th century were fateful for Yemen. The determination of various European powers to establish a presence in the Middle East elicited an equally firm determination in other powers to thwart such efforts. For Yemen, the most important participants in the drama were the British, who took over Aden in 1839, and the Ottoman Empire, which at mid-century moved back into North Yemen, from which it had been driven by the Yemenis two centuries earlier. The interests and activities of these two powers in the Red Sea basin and Yemen were substantially intensified by the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 and the reemergence of the Red Sea route as the preferred passage between Europe and East Asia. As the Ottomans expanded inland and established themselves in Sanaa and Taʿizz, the British expanded north and east from Aden, eventually establishing protectorates over more than a dozen of the many local statelets; this was done more in the interest of protecting Aden’s hinterland from the Ottomans and their Yemeni adversaries than out of any desire to add the territory and people there to the British Empire. By the early 20th century the growing clashes between the British and the Ottomans along the undemarcated border posed a serious problem; in 1904 a joint commission surveyed the border, and a treaty was concluded, establishing the frontier between Ottoman North Yemen and the British possessions in South Yemen. Later, of course, both Yemens considered the treaty an egregious instance of non-Yemeni interference in domestic affairs. The north became independent at the end of World War I in 1918, with the departure of the Ottoman forces; the imam of the Zaydīs, Yaḥyā Maḥmūd al-Mutawwakil, became the de facto ruler in the north by virtue of his lengthy campaign against the Ottoman presence in Yemen. In the 1920s Imam Yaḥyā sought to consolidate his hold on the country by working to bring the Shāfiʿī areas under his administrative jurisdiction and by suppressing much of the intertribal feuding and tribal opposition to the imamate. In an effort to enhance the effectiveness of his campaigns against the tribes and other fractious elements, the imam sent a group of Yemeni youth to Iraq in the mid-1930s to learn modern military techniques and weaponry. These students would eventually become the kernel of domestic opposition to Yaḥyā and his policies.' <sup id="cite_ref-258" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-258">[258]</a></sup> The British also backed tribal factions opposed to the Ottomans: 'The armies that conquered these southern areas were made up of northern tribesmen.

Now, hesitantly, they armed the treaty chiefs, and in 1922, using aircraft, to which Yahya had no effective counter, they bombed the Imam's men out of Hawshabi south of Dali'. Negotiations in 1926 came to little, and in 1927 Qa'tabah (just north of the old Anglo-Turkish line) was bombed and machine-gunned for five days, at which stage the Imam's men were 50 kilometres from Aden. Even Ibb, 100 kilometres north again from Qa'tabah, was strafed and Ta'izz itself was bombed.' <sup id="cite_ref-260" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-260">[260]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Annexation ♣ present ♥</b> The Imams and the Ottomans fought to bring rebellious tribal territories under their control: ‘In 1910 Yahya sent emissaries to Jabal Barat to organize a renewal of the fighting against the Turks (Zabarah 1956: ii. 174-80) and San’a’ was again besieged: with huge numbers of fresh troops the Turks again reconquered the areas south of San’a’ and reached the city itself in April 1911. But this time, mindful of the empire’s commitments elsewhere (the Italians had just invaded Tripoli), they did not pursue the Imam northwards. Instead negotiations were begun at once. In October 1911 the Turks and the Imam met at Da’’an, on Jabal ‘Iyal Yazd, and signed a truce that, although not ratified by imperial firman until two years later, was upheld by both sides thereafter. Upper Yemen was ceded to the Imam’s control.’ <sup id="cite_ref-261" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-261">[261]</a></sup> 'The armies that conquered these southern areas were made up of northern tribesmen.

</p><p><b>♠ Looting ♣ present ♥</b> Dresch describes some looting: 'At  the outset each side attempted to forestall the other, and the results of these attempts in many cases drew lines across which the war then went on for years. In the first few weeks, for example, the republicans sent three columns to  the east('Abdal-Ilah 1964: 75)· One of these, under Amin Nu'man, was intended to  move past Dhib into  the Jawf and was hurried on  its way by  news that the princes were already gathering support aroun dal-Hazm. The republicans reached the fort at Sinwan, in the northernmost part of Arhab and very  close  to Sufyan, where, as 'Abd al-Ilah tells  the story, they  failed  to picket the surrounding hills and were  set upon by night. Most fled, while a few firmer spirits stayed to destroy the stores and were themselves killed or captured (ibid.80). But  the events which the author presents as happening in  an instant are remembered by those involved as having spread over several weeks. The first mixed force of republicans, mainly from Hashid, 'Iyal Surayh, and 'Iyal Yazid, arrived some  ten  days after the coup, at about the same time  as letters from Prince 'Abdulah Husayn reached Murhibah, Arhab, and Sufyan. These latter tribes were not at  first committed as wholes to either side, but men  from each of them joined the royalist force moving in from  the Jawf. The republicans pushed the royalists back to Haran before retiring themselves to Sinwan. Some weeks later a larger royahst force,j oined by men from Murhibah, Sufyan, and other tribes of the area,came in from the Jawf and laid  siege to Sinwan. The siege was raised by republican reinforcements from San'a' (probably under Sinan Abu Lahum  of Nihm), some  of whom went on  to loot livestock from Sufyani territory. Resistance stiffened.' <sup id="cite_ref-266" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-266">[266]</a></sup> His material seems to suggest that looting was tolerated in a 'contained' form: ‘Al-Mansur suffered a stroke, and in September 1904 he died (ibid. 393-403). His son Yahya took the Imamate, which he was to hold until his death in 1948. As a number of authors have noted […], the success of his claim was very probably due to the support of Nasir Mabkhut al-Ahmar, who had (at least most of the time) supported al-Mansur. With al-Ahmar’s backing, Yahya took binding agreements (qawa’id wa-dawabit) from the shaykhs about the conduct of the jihad, stipulating that the weak be protected, looting be controlled, and any artillery captured be surrendered to the public treasury (Zabahrah 1956: ii. 8). Almost immediately after his accession he dispatched forces to the west and south, the outlying Turkish garrisons fell, and San’a’ was again besieged […]. In the midst of an atrocious famine the Turkish garrison withdrew under safe conduct in April 1905. ‘San’a’ after the surrender was a ruin.

The Imam had already promoted an attack on the Turks in January 1891, but serious fighting only now broke out in May, and in June Zafir Hajjah was taken by a force which Mabkhut al-Ahmar led […]. Arhab, ‘Iyal Surayh, and Hamdan all rose and attacked the areas around San’a’, although the Turks sought advice from Bin Sinan ‘the ‘amil of Arhab’ (al-Hibshi 1980: 424). Parts of Khawlan sent hostages to the Imam, the Turks sealed the city off, and fires began to appear at night on the surrounding mountains.

Epithets such as "evil ones" and "servants of idols" were used against people who themselves served as allies in God's cause against their neighbours, and from those whose obedience mattered the Imam took hostages (by the 1930s there were probably about 4,000).' <sup id="cite_ref-273" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-273">[273]</a></sup> 'Zaydi tribes disputed Yahya's control as they had always done and through the 1920s as many skirmishes were fought against "rebels" (bughah) north of Sanaa as south. Hashid, for example, had supported the Imam against the Turks in the fighting of 1910-11 and Yahya had lived among them through much of World War I; in December 1924, however, Imamic forces fought their way, into Hashid's main town, Khamir, and "set their affairs in order", taking hostages from Bani Suraym and Kharif and billetting troops on them "as is done to subjects other than them in all the Imamic lands" (the urban chronicler's satisfaction is plain here, though committed to print three decades later; the term "subject" denies any difference between tribes and peasants). Arhab, a Bakil tribe nearby, also had to surrender hostages. Al-'Usaymat and 'Idhar, two Hashid tribes in the region near Shaharah where Yahya first claimed the Imamate in 1904, were left alone after swearing their nominal allegiance.' <sup id="cite_ref-274" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-274">[274]</a></sup> Rebellious shaykhs were imprisoned as well: 'Not until 1928 was all Hashid under the Imam's control, and not until the 1930s did he control the east around Ma'rib - such tribes as 'Abidah and Murad, importantly - or the northeast near Jabal Barat, the homeland of Dhu Muhammad and Dhu Husyan. His progress around Ta'izz was more rapid. When a number of Lower Yemeni leaders conspired in the 1920s (perhaps specifically against Zaydi rule; the sources obscure the issue) Yahya had large numbers of shaykhs sent in chains to Sanaa where few survived. But the most important did so. Indeed 'Abd al-Wahhab Nu'man, the great baron of Hugariyyah, re-emerged for a time as governor of Bilad al-Bustan nera Sanaa. The pattern throughout was of negotiation, blandishments and severity of a kind hard to summarise, for one shaykh was used against another, one tribe against another, amid shifting complexities which the language of jihad obscures. In the midst of this the rudiments of state power emerged. A shaykh of Hamdan, just north of Sanaa, felt he desrved more consideration and Yahya asked him angrily, "Who made you a shaykh?" "The same as made you Imam", came the answer; but Yahya gained means before long to have 'Ali Mutlaq chained in a dungeon for twenty years.' <sup id="cite_ref-275" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-275">[275]</a></sup> Ottoman forces also captured prominent enemies:  ‘Faydi Pasha, at Khamir, had meanwhile been trying to regain his prisoners, whom the Imam had sent to Barat.

As a number of authors have noted […], the success of his claim was very probably due to the support of Nasir Mabkhut al-Ahmar, who had (at least most of the time) supported al-Mansur. With al-Ahmar’s backing, Yahya took binding agreements (qawa’id wa-dawabit) from the shaykhs about the conduct of the jihad, stipulating that the weak be protected, looting be controlled, and any artillery captured be surrendered to the public treasury (Zabahrah 1956: ii. 8). Almost immediately after his accession he dispatched forces to the west and south, the outlying Turkish garrisons fell, and San’a’ was again besieged […]. In the midst of an atrocious famine the Turkish garrison withdrew under safe conduct in April 1905. ‘San’a’ after the surrender was a ruin. Its markets were destroyed, its houses empty, and only a few of its inhabitants were left’, but when the tribes saw the victory that had been won ‘every tribe wanted to control some province or another of Yemen as a fief…’ (al-Wasi’I 928: 203).’ <sup id="cite_ref-280" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-280">[280]</a></sup>

</p><p>The following was extracted from the relevant eHRAF Culture Summary: 'Islam is the major force that unifies Yemenis across social, sexual, and regional boundaries. Yet most adherents of the different schools of Islam reside in distinct sections of the country, and this fact has certain political implications. Zaydis, who belong to the Shia subsect of Islam, are located in the northern and eastern parts of Yemen, whereas Shafis, orthodox Sunnis, live in the southern and coastal regions. Location in the highlands apparently enables Zaydis more successfully to repel invasions than Shafis in the lower lying areas. A smaller Shia subsect, the Ismaili, and also the remnants of an ancient Jewish community, may still be found in certain parts of Yemen.' <sup id="cite_ref-281" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-281">[281]</a></sup> 'As Muslims, Yemenis aspire to fulfill the five tenets of Islam: affirmation of the Islamic creed, prayer, fasting, charity, and pilgrimage.' <sup id="cite_ref-282" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-282">[282]</a></sup> 'In the Shafi areas of Yemen, the tombs of certain holy men are visited by believers for their special healing and other powers.' <sup id="cite_ref-283" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-283">[283]</a></sup> 'Being of sayyid status, even in contemporary Yemeni society, still validates (but does not necessarily guarantee) one's access to religious learning.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Id al Kabir ♥</b> 'Now let us turn our attention to the two major religious festivals in he Muslim calendar: the 'id al-kabir after the holy month of fast, Ramadan, and the 'id as-saghir that marks the end of the annaual pilgrimage to Mecca. Unfortunately, I had the opportunity to observe only one of these festivals (at the end of Ramadan) while I was in Khawland, though I was assured by tribesmen that the same rituals were enacted in both. On the first morning after the fast had been officially declared at an end, the old and young adult males of the village in which I was staying convened in the selah (flood plain) to greet each other with salutations peculiar to the 'id. The flood plain has special significance. In the Yemeni highlands most villages are built on rock outcrops that jut upwards from the wadi floor, the fertile fields surrounding them irrigated by canals that drain the wadi's plain when it is in flood, during the rainy season twice a year. The rest of the time the wadi floor is dry and used for a variety of purposes, including the transport of animals, the passage of people between villages located along the plain, as the meeting ground for tribal delegations who have been sent to a village to mediate one of its disputes, and for open-air markets that convene once a week. A mosque is usually situated at the rim of the flood plain and the village, casting its sacred canopy over these people and their activities. In short, the flood plain is a general thoroughfare bringing fertility, religious blessing, and hopefully also security. It is not surprising that the religious festival marking the transition of the fast and the beginning of a new year is held in a place saturated with the symbolism of passage, for, as Van Gennep ([1908] 1960) understood, ritual time is often symbolized by movement in space. In the cool hours of early morning on the first day after the fast, the hamlet of Bet al-Bahluli sends a delegation of adult males to march in the wadi toward the hamlet of Dhu l-Mukh, which in turn dispatches a group of adult males toward the former, the two groups meeting halfway. At the head of the delegations are the servants of their respective hamlets, drumming the rhythms of the bara' dance. The men behind them chant a zamil poem appropriate to the religious occasion: "The month of Shawal for Arabs is proclaimed // As the time to break the fast for those who have fasted. Happy is the faster who has been loyal to [God's] demand, // And to those who have not -may they be damned!" "We have put our trust in God. // Our lot can only increase through His generosity. O Lord, let rainds give us (water) to drink // And irrigate the crops and fields." Again, the unmarried boys watch from the sidelines, the women from their houses. As soon as the two delegations stand facing each other a few yards apart, the elder of the first arrivals begins the greeting. "Peace, O tribesmen (lit, faces," he shouts in a high, creaky voice that rises above the din of the drumming and chanting as a signal for the crowd to be silent. The elder continues as before: "May God restore us and you to the saved and the healthy". The presupposition of this formula, of course, is that those addressed are true believers who have remained steadfast in Ramadan. As soon as the elder has finished, the men of the opposing delegation intone in unison the response. "May God restore us and you to the saved and the healthy. May He protect them [the rest of the tribe] from harm." A reception line is formed by the initial group, which now welcomes the new arrivals individually. Each man shakes the other's hand and quickly kisses the back of it, muttering min as-salimin (among the saved), a shibboleth among the community of the faithful. Smiling and laughing, the group now either prays in the mosque at the rim of the flood plain or else retires to an open-air site to hear a sermon about the significance of the 'id and then join in communal prayer. This activity may last a half hour, after which time they retire to their villages behind the drummers, once again chanting zamil poems. The next morning the villagers visit each other and perhaps exchange gifts, the children often skipping from door to door to receive candy; at noon relatives assemble for large communal feasts. Everyone is very much relieved that the hardship of the fast is finally over, though perhaps their joyous mood is also tinged with a slight anticlimactic feeling because the drama of self-discipline that marks the fast has ended.' <sup id="cite_ref-286" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-286">[286]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ salat ♥</b> <i>Salat</i> is "the ritualized, obligatory prayer performed five times a day: sunrise, noon, afternoon, sunset, and evening. <i>Salat</i>, which means 'to bow, bend, or stretch,' is composed of a series of yogic movements that include standing, bowing, rising, sitting, turning east and west, and falling prostrate, all repeated in cycles, and accompanied by specific verses from the Quran. "As with all Muslim rituals, <i>salat</i> can begin only after the intention to pray is voiced, and only while the Muslim faces toward Mecca, the direction of prayer, or <i>qiblah</i>. Although salat can be performed individually as a means to purify and cleanse the soul, it is meant to be a communal act that binds the Ummah as a single body. For this reason, it is always preferable to perform salat in a place of assembly. Indeed, one particular salat--the noon prayer on Fridays (<i>salat al-jum'a</i>)--must be performed in the mosque, in the presence of the community. And while five daily prayers may seem like a heavy burden, the obligation is suspended for the sick, those who are traveling, or anyone else who is unable to perform them for any justifiable reason; if one wishes, missed salats can always be made up at a later time" <sup id="cite_ref-327" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-327">[327]</a></sup>.</dd>

Additionally, prior to prayer the individual might need to perform an ablution, or cleansing, depending on the activities undertaken before hand. This might be a minor ablution which requires washing "certain parts of the body with water in the following order: hands, mouth, nose, right forearm, left forearm, face, head, ears, right foot, left foot".

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ salat ♥</b> <i>Salat</i> is "the ritualized, obligatory prayer performed five times a day: sunrise, noon, afternoon, sunset, and evening. <i>Salat</i>, which means 'to bow, bend, or stretch,' is composed of a series of yogic movements that include standing, bowing, rising, sitting, turning east and west, and falling prostrate, all repeated in cycles, and accompanied by specific verses from the Quran. "As with all Muslim rituals, <i>salat</i> can begin only after the intention to pray is voiced, and only while the Muslim faces toward Mecca, the direction of prayer, or <i>qiblah</i>. Although salat can be performed individually as a means to purify and cleanse the soul, it is meant to be a communal act that binds the Ummah as a single body. For this reason, it is always preferable to perform salat in a place of assembly. Indeed, one particular salat--the noon prayer on Fridays (<i>salat al-jum'a</i>)--must be performed in the mosque, in the presence of the community. And while five daily prayers may seem like a heavy burden, the obligation is suspended for the sick, those who are traveling, or anyone else who is unable to perform them for any justifiable reason; if one wishes, missed salats can always be made up at a later time" <sup id="cite_ref-365" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-365">[365]</a></sup>.</dd>

<dd><b>♠ Duration ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> The length of the prayer depended upon the time of day which it was undertaken. Each time of day required a specific number of rak'as or repetitions of the ceremony. "The evening prayer consists of three rak'as, the night four, the morning two, the noon four and the afternoon four." Additionally, prior to prayer the individual might need to perform an ablution, or cleansing, depending on the activities undertaken before hand. This might be a minor ablution which requires washing "certain parts of the body with water in the following order: hands, mouth, nose, right forearm, left forearm, face, head, ears, right foot, left foot". A major ablution required full emersion in water so that all parts of the body were cleansed and would therefore take longer. <sup id="cite_ref-369" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-369">[369]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Zawaj ♥</b> Wedding celebrations. 'In the course of a wedding ceremony there are two crucial events in which zamil performances are the norm: the samrah and the groom's zaffah. The noun samrah is derived from the Arabic Form I verb samar, meaning to spend the evening with friends in restful, idle conversation. Tribesmen gather after dinner to sit and pass the time in someone's mafraj (sitting room), sometimes nearly until dawn, chatting, playing games, and perhaps even dancing. The groom's samrah is supposed to have the same elements of relaxed amusement, but it naturally differs in that the caliber of entertainment is much higher. Professional musicians, a drummer-singer and a flute player, are usually hired to perform the music to which the assembly can dance the mizmar (named after the flute), and all the adult guests are obligated to contribute some lines of verse in the competitive balah poetry or razfah. The excitement builds as the guests arrive in groups of about five to ten during the early evening hours. They are the ones referred to in the poetry as 'ajanib (foreigners). Their zamil poem echoes in the wadi basin in which they are walking and carries through the stillness of the night on high-pitched voices. Upon hearing their chant, the post of the samrah dispatches some young men to greet them at the village entrance with gun salutes and rounds of exploding firecrackers. The thoroughfare to the groom's house beckons in soft white light emanating from the garlands of bulbs strung across the house walls and is astir with children scurrying about and adults doing their rounds of visiting. There is no mistaking the groom's house, which is ablaze with lanterns, strings of bulbs, and torches. Its colored, stained-glass windows glow invitingly like embers in a hearth. The arrivals are conducted to the diwan (hall) in which the celebrants, including the groom, are waiting to receive them. [...] When the delegation has stepped into the room, the assembly rises to its feet to perform the moving ritual greeting known as hal. Room is then made in the already packed hall for the new arrivals. The most prestigious personages, such as sheikhs, are seated nearest the groom; the rest may sit anywhere on the circle according to their preference. Usually a soft, thick oriental carpet is spread under the celebrants for their comfort during the long hours of the groom's samrah; the water pipe is also available, the tobacco laced with the finest incense and the water delicately scented. Each male wears the Yemeni dagger (jambiyyah) -a curved silver blade with a gazelle-horn handle inlaid with old coins- and brings a rifle, which he hangs by its leather strap on the wall pegs. These weapons are symbolic of male fighting prowess and hence honor and the poetry is full of allusions to them.' <sup id="cite_ref-403" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-403">[403]</a></sup>//'The groom has already changed into his brand-new set of clothes during the afternoon zaffah (procession). [...] Throughout the wedding ceremony the groom has to maintain a riding pose and does not participate in the event, such as the afternoon gat chews, the dancing, the poetry, or the shooting matches. He is a passive onlooker. Approximately one hour after the evening prayer, when the guests have been fed dinner, the professional musicians play a stirring drum salute called the tamsih, which incorporates in its music the rhythms of the famous bara' dance (see Adra 1982). This salute is a signal that the poetic events and dances of the evening are to begin. [...] Wedding celebrations may last several days, if not weeks, depending on the social prominence of the groom's family, and it is expected that the samrah be held on each evening of the celebration. On the lelat ad-dakhlak (night of consummation) the festivities reach their greatest intensity. Guests who cannot attend every night of the celebration try to attend at least that evening. Two genres of poetry are commonly performed at the samrah, the most important being a competitive verse composition known as the balah (the other being the dance-verse genre called the razfah). A wedding celebration is thought to be lacking if one or both of these genres is not performed; therefore, a special onus is placed on the guest to contribute in this way to the evening's entertainment. As for the zamil performance, I have already remarked that it occurs en route to the groom's village, but that is not the most crucial ceremony in which it is heard. Far more important is the groom's zaffah, the procession which begins at his house, slowly and majestically winds its way to the mosque, and then retraces its course. At the head of this procession are the village servants, who drum loudly the beat of the bara' dance. Immediately behind them are the guests of the wedding, all of them adult males, marching in columns with their rifles slung over their shoulders. They are wearing multicolored turbans, jackets, and skirts. They form what might be called the chorus of the zamil performance, one half chanting the first line of the poem and the other half chanting the second and final line; the poet usually comes from their ranks. If they feel so inclined, they might begin a dance to accompany the poetic chant and drum or shoot their files at an improvised target. All around them are the adolescent boys, too young to shoot off rifles or compose verse publicly, who gleefully light firecrackers and hurl them in the air to land usually underfoot or on the shoulders of the unsuspecting marchers, who cannot sidestep fast enough the flashing, hopping strings of fire. In the rear of the procession is the groom along with some friends or relatives bearing on their shoulders his mazharah or bouquet, which is composed of branches or acacia and sprigs of basil decjed with strings of different-colored berries, hollow eggs, and various other charms believed to ward off evil and bring good health, fertility, and prosperity. Sometimes a picture of the Haram Mosque in Mecca is stuck inside the bunch of plants, a reminder of the fundamentally sacred significance of the entire ceremony. As in the diwan, the groom is expected to maintain a solemn, dignified, and basically passive mien throughout the procession.//'Although  the women are not publicly present, they can be heard performing the peculiarly shrill ululation of joy (taghrid) from the house rooftops. Their black, veiled figures lean over the parapets four or more stories above the street, from where they throw candy to the children, who chase after these prizes through a haze of blue smoke rising from the exploding firecrackers. The whole affair is a cacophony of noise, a swirling mass of movement and color. The ideal of the poetic performance is that the guests compose a zamil to which the hosts respond; this exchange may be one of friendly teasing, or mutual recognition of honor expressed through praise and lofty compliments, of greeting, or of pious sentiments. The following is an example of such an exchange. First the host's poem: "From us good evening, [as many times as] the star revolves in the sky, // [As many times as] the rifle hits with its accurate bullets. O greeting to the guests, greetings from us all, // Which London announces and is broadcast in Iraq." The illocutionary force of the greeting is intensified by the metaphors of revolving heavenly bodies and the deadly accuracy of tribal marksmanship. Now the guest's poem: "Greetings from us. May thousands fill your mountains. // O defenders of the tribal border with the barrel of the rifle, We came from the same origins. // No one abandons his kinsmen until he dies." The guest poet returns the greeting with equal force and addresses the hosts as "defenders of the tribal border", meaning that they are therefore honorable men. Because the guest is a relative by marriage, he feels obligated to attend the wedding and affirms this obligation by declaring, "no one abandons his kinsmen until he dies.' The ideal of sociality understood as balanced exchange is upheld.' <sup id="cite_ref-404" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-404">[404]</a></sup>//Caton's material focuses on the performance of poetry: 'A small group of men -approximately six to ten in the average performance- form a circle (halgah) in the middle of the room. They face inward, their arms clasped around each other's shoulders or waists and their feet slowly moving in a simple side step (clockwise or counterclockwise; the direction of movement does not seem to matter). This circle of men is what I call a chorus, though in Arabuc they are referred to as saffen, literally two ranks (lines or groups). One rank or saff chants a refrain, and the other chants a certain part of the verse, the two groups thus alternating their canting throughout the performance of a single poem. The choristers are often the younger men of the wedding party, sometimes even adolescents, who may not yet possess the requisite skill to compose verse but are learning it by performing in the chorus. The poets, whoever they turn out to bem shut their eyes as they listen to the chanting, their faces tense with the effort of composition, their lips silently forming the lines that spring from their imagination. Confident that they have composed a well-formed verse, their faces brighten, and one among their number (which varies from two to five or even more) moves decisively toward the circle and breaks through the linked arms of the choristers, who close ranks behind him. The poet is now in the center of the performance, in the middle of the samrah, and at the heart of the wedding festivities. The collective attends the individual's chant to see how well he plays the game. Cupping one or both hands to the sides of his head, sometimes even plugging his ears with his thumbs [...] -a gesture that simultaneously projects the verse off a natural sounding board so that the whole noisy assembly can hear it and blocks out any palaver that might disturb his concentration (conindicentally this attitude is reminiscent of the mu'adhdhin, who calls the people to prayer)- he walks half of the circle's circumference and at the same time chants the first hermistich (harf) of his turn. Depending on the particular chant, the chorus might introduce at this juncture with a choral refrain, but in any case the power finishes his turn by chanting the second menistich and continuing around to close the circle. (In the case of a third hemistich, which rarely occurs, he describes another half-circle). He then immediately exits from the middle of the circle, and the chorus meanwhile picks up the chanting of the last hemistich of the poet's turn, alternating it with the refrain line. Now it is up to his rivals to continue building it with the refrain line. Now it is up to his rivals to continue building the poem. The performance ought not to depend heavily on the contributions of one person, for the nit is no longer felt to be an evenly matched competition. Throughout the performance the audience is hardly ever still, except when a poet enters the circle, at which time most people want to hear what he has to say and evaluate it. They are quick to laugh at a witty line or exclaim allahu akbar (God is great) in reaction to a particularly good metaphor or adroit turn of phrase. If the poet'S gift to the groom is unsound because it breaks the rules of composition, they will start shouting boisterously harf magsus (a broken hemistich). Occasionally such rowdy criticism incites a quarrel between the poet and his audience, but he his more likely to amend the fault by quickly fashioning another hemistich. If he cannot make a speedy recovery, he will inevitably give to another poet and thereby lose face. As soon as the poet has exited the circle and the chorus has begun chanting again, the audience usually attends to its own matters -resuming a conversation, smoking the water pipe, joking, or just dozing to the hypnotic drone of the chant.' <sup id="cite_ref-405" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-405">[405]</a></sup>//'To summarize, the performance is made up of three concentric circles: the inner one is described by the poet's turn, the middle one comprises the chorus, and the outer one is formed by the seated audience. The penetration of the inner circle by the poet emerging from the outer two and then the exiting back into them is perfectly iconic of the ideal that everyone -whether a member of the audience or the chorus- may be a poet; no one is privileged. In addition, and much more significant, is the fact that the closer someone is to the center, the more intimately he becomes involved in the compositional process: the audience react to the poem, the chorus "carries" it (the Arabic word is shall, which means lift or carry), and the poet composes it. And whereas the audience and chorus look inward, the poet faces them in the middle by looking outward: the individual is alone and being judged by the collectivity. It is certainly the ultimate moment of truth, when honor is being tested and is either recognized or repudiated.' <sup id="cite_ref-406" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-406">[406]</a></sup> 'Each genre of performance-composed poetry (balah, zamil, razfah, and roshan) has its own set of melodies on which the poetry is chanted.' <sup id="cite_ref-407" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-407">[407]</a></sup> It is worth noting that this description dates to the twentieth century.</dd>

</p><p>Note: The Ottomans had become involved in Yemen in the 16th century already, but had lost control shortly thereafter: 'Throughout its history, foreign powers had become involved in Yemenfor reasons of  strategy, riches, trade, religion and even lebensraum. In thecase of  the Ottoman Turks, such involvement had been inherited from theMamluk state after Cairo fell to them in 1517. For they had two fundamentalinterests to safeguard: the Holy Cities of  Mecca and Medina and the traderoute with India in spices and textiles, both of  which had been threatenedand the latter virtually eclipsed by the arrival of  the Portuguese in the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea in the early part of  the century. Such pre-occupations were reinforced by reports from reliable sources of  the potentialriches of  a country that had sustained such powerful earlier dynasties as theRasulids and Tahirids.' <sup id="cite_ref-484" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-484">[484]</a></sup> 'For a brief  period, the long effort and expense which even a degree ofcontrol over the country had cost the Turks may have seemed worthwhile;for, in the early 1560s, the country did pay its way and spices were being soldin Egypt at a profit to the Ottoman state. Indeed, one successful candidate forthe governor-generalship of  the country is said to have paid a vast sum inbribes for the post. But this happy period for the Turks had only followed asatisfactory truce with the Imam Sharaf  al-Din’s eldest son, Mutahhar, whohad by then been accepted as the Zaydi leader in Yemen. Otherwise, theprovince ran at a loss, and, as the author points out earlier in the work, nofoundry like Yemen had been seen for Turkish troops who had melted awaylike salt in water, with casualties already exceeding 70,000!' <sup id="cite_ref-485" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-485">[485]</a></sup> 'After the long struggle between the sūfiyya and the fuqahā’, the focus of Sufi thought in Yemen began to drift away from the debates over Ibn ‘Arabī’s ideas. Like all debates, it abated as ideas found their way to the hearts of people and events no longer exacerbated the same tensions. Notably, Yemen faced new threats from the incursion of European and Ottoman colonial powers. I have already discussed the fierce tensions in the previous chapter between the Zaydī imams and the Sufis and how the Sufis first supported the Ottomans, believing that they would liberate them from the tyranny of the Zaydīs, but later turned against them due to the un-Islamic practices of the new colonial power. New priorities and ideas emerged with Sufi masters who sought to render more accessible, often through popular verse, the theology and imagery of Sufi thought. To understand the transformation of ideas in Yemen, the literary achievements of the celebrated Sufi, Muhammad b. ‘Alī, known as ‘Abd al-Hādī as-Sūdī (d. 932/1525) and the famous Sufi of Hadramawt ‘Umar Muhammad Bā Makhrama (d. 952/1545) should be highlighted.' <sup id="cite_ref-486" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-486">[486]</a></sup> Even once the Ottomans had regained power in Yemen in the 19th century, tribal authority remained relevant on the local level, often intersecting with lower-level administration. Aspiring Imams had to rely on tribal support in their anti-Ottoman campaigns: 'It is a continuing challenge of governmental strategies to achieve a stable balance between relatively autonomous tribes and the state. Alliance with dominant tribal confederation therefore may still be influential in the distribution of development projects by central authorities.' <sup id="cite_ref-487" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-487">[487]</a></sup> 'The Zaidi Imamate could not build its power solely upon a union of non-agricultural specialists: it required the support of the militarily powerful northern landowning shaikhs and the groups of fighting men that they could muster, usually from the poorer village families. The development of shaikhly constellations of power, in the manner described by Montagne for the Moroccan Berbers, was curtailed by exporting shaikhly leaders to tax prebends in richer areas. In this way the tribe was sanctioned as a status group within the state. The Imamic state rested on an alliance of the farmer (the fighter) with the preacher (the judge) and on the symbolic and political suppression of mercantile and craft interests more generally. The union of religious leaders and martial farmers from agriculturally marginal areas formed a loose prebendal dominion over the more productive, largely Shafi'i, peasant areas of the west and south. Whether collected by regular employees of the government or by irregulars from the north, taxes were paid by those who produced most, by the peasants of the richer areas. For example, Goitein reports that the Jewish villagers of al-Gades in lower Yemen called the local landlord 'askari, "soldier", noting, however, that he and his like came from the eastern pastoral region and should be distinguished from the regular 'askari who accompanied the local government officer on his tax levies.' <sup id="cite_ref-488" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-488">[488]</a></sup> Ascribed social status was important: 'Yemeni society is hierarchically organized on the basis of birth status and occupation. Until relative political stability was achieved in the late 1970s, birth and occupational statuses were legitimized as ascribed social categories. The elimination of practical barriers that restrict power and privilege?especially through marriage and education?to certain members of the society has only just begun. Under the system of ranked social categories, members of respectable groupings recognized their own noble descent and considered themselves the protectors of servants, former slaves, artisans, and certain farmers, all of whom were thought of as&nbsp;?deficient,? either because they provided a service or craft?such as bloodletting, butchery, or barbering?that involved contact with polluting substances, or because their origins were discredited as ignoble. The tribal code of protection was also extended to elites at the top of the social scale, especially to sayyids, the reputed descendants of the Prophet, who originally came to Yemen to serve as mediators between tribes and who are respected for their religious expertise. Another social category, that of legal scholars, also inherits high status in the ranking order. Scholars, along with shuyukh   (sing. shaykh  ), who are tribal leaders, typically serve as village administrators. The majority of Yemenis use various equivalent or substitute terms to identify themselves within the social hierarchy, including qaba\??\il   in the northern highlands to connote tribal membership, ra\??\iyah   in the south to mean&nbsp;?cultivators,? and \??\arab   along the coast to signify respectable ancestry. Former slaves continue to act as agents and domestics in the households of former masters, but the most menial jobs (e.g., removing human waste from the street) are reserved for Yemenis who are alleged descendants of Ethiopians of the pre-Islamic era. In addition, Yemen relies on a range of foreigners from the East and West for professional, technical, and custodial services.' <sup id="cite_ref-489" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-489">[489]</a></sup> The Imamate and the Ottomans superimposed their own administrative structure onto the tribal system without supplanting it: 'Developments in the 19th century were fateful for Yemen. The determination of various European powers to establish a presence in the Middle East elicited an equally firm determination in other powers to thwart such efforts. For Yemen, the most important participants in the drama were the British, who took over Aden in 1839, and the Ottoman Empire, which at mid-century moved back into North Yemen, from which it had been driven by the Yemenis two centuries earlier. The interests and activities of these two powers in the Red Sea basin and Yemen were substantially intensified by the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 and the reemergence of the Red Sea route as the preferred passage between Europe and East Asia. As the Ottomans expanded inland and established themselves in Sanaa and Taʿizz, the British expanded north and east from Aden, eventually establishing protectorates over more than a dozen of the many local statelets; this was done more in the interest of protecting Aden’s hinterland from the Ottomans and their Yemeni adversaries than out of any desire to add the territory and people there to the British Empire. By the early 20th century the growing clashes between the British and the Ottomans along the undemarcated border posed a serious problem; in 1904 a joint commission surveyed the border, and a treaty was concluded, establishing the frontier between Ottoman North Yemen and the British possessions in South Yemen. Later, of course, both Yemens considered the treaty an egregious instance of non-Yemeni interference in domestic affairs. The north became independent at the end of World War I in 1918, with the departure of the Ottoman forces; the imam of the Zaydīs, Yaḥyā Maḥmūd al-Mutawwakil, became the de facto ruler in the north by virtue of his lengthy campaign against the Ottoman presence in Yemen. In the 1920s Imam Yaḥyā sought to consolidate his hold on the country by working to bring the Shāfiʿī areas under his administrative jurisdiction and by suppressing much of the intertribal feuding and tribal opposition to the imamate. In an effort to enhance the effectiveness of his campaigns against the tribes and other fractious elements, the imam sent a group of Yemeni youth to Iraq in the mid-1930s to learn modern military techniques and weaponry. These students would eventually become the kernel of domestic opposition to Yaḥyā and his policies.' <sup id="cite_ref-490" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-490">[490]</a></sup> 'The  first thing to be said  is that no attempt was  made  to abolish tribalism as such. Where tribal practice was equated so readily with ignorance, and thus with irreligion, this  might  seem surprising, but it  is  as  if  the phenomenon were God-given; as  much part of  the intractable world and God's will as the mountains or the weather. Indeed,there were   only 'tribes', not tribalism, and th eradical ambition of rebuilding humanity to   some human design   (a 'sociological' ambition, of its nature) is more  a feature of our own time. Nor did   theImamate command the   means   to root out institutions on any  large  scale.  The Hamidal-Din  Imams,  Yahya (1904-48)and Ahmad(1948-62), did not reproduce the elaborate courts and armies of the  early  Qasimis but were rather frugal  men who personally supervised even  small,  local matters and ran  their administrations with the  forms  of power available to them (see e.g.Rihani 1930:220ff.; Scott 1942:174-5).Over the following decades they gradually built an army, whose  officers  in  the  end were  to  be part of the Imamate's undoing,but the  tribes remained the stronger force,   always carefully fragmented by their rulers' policy. The  aim  was that 'the pure shari'a be established', which  (as in most pre-bureaucratic Islamic  states) meant first  of  all that the zakat, or canonical tax, be collected and   a  modicum  of order retained. 'Broadly speaking, the tribal Zaydi north was governed by indirect rule with subsidies providedf or  the  chiefs.  The  Shafi'I south was  less fortunate in being under direct rule  by government officials working in concert with local headmen'(Serjeant 1979:92). In both areas the 'headmen' received  a cut  of the tax which it was their responsibility to  collect. One is sometimes told now that this  was  a quarter of  the total for northerners and a tenth for  the Shafi'I south (Messick 1978:170), but the details in the north were in  fact irregular.' <sup id="cite_ref-491" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-491">[491]</a></sup> ‘By the terms of the European armistice at the end of the First World War, the Turks were obliged to abandon Yemen. The Imam filled their place. Even before he entered San’a’ in 1918, Imam Yahya sent a force of tribesmen under Sayyid ‘Ali al-Wazir to take Haraz from the Isma’ilis (al-Jirafi 1951: 225), some of whom turned for help to the Idrisi; and as the Turks withdrew, the Imam also turned his attention southward. The tribes were directed against the Shafi’i areas of Lower Yemen, much as they had been by the Qasimis, in a jihad. ‘The tribesman who enrolled under the Imam’s standard and came from north of San’a’ to the lowlands of the Tihamah, to Ibb, to Ta’izz, and al-Bayda’ was not referred to as a soldier but as a warrior in the cause of the God’ (Nu’man 1965: 27). Not all of Nu’man’s writing is intended as sober history, but the nature of these campaigns is not in doubt and they occurred of course well within living memory.’ <sup id="cite_ref-492" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-492">[492]</a></sup> 'Imamic government was of a religious character, sharing power with and at times dominating, but never entirely restructuring or supplanting, rural political, military and legal structures. Its rule rested on an uneasy pact with northern leaders and groups. The allegiance of the prominent shaikhs was rewarded by alliance and simultaneously controlled by a system of holding (and educating) young hostages from their families. During the reign of Imam Yahya, the developing administration of the Imamic state moved to institutionalize status differences. The cadre of the Imamic administration proclaimed themselves the bearers of the civilizing tradition of Islamic learning and law. Under the Imamate Islamic shari'ah was to conquer divisive tribal custom and the ulema (the scholars) would rule and not merely serve the shaikhs.' <sup id="cite_ref-493" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-493">[493]</a></sup> Tribal parties, Imams, and Ottoman authorities often clashed, but also entered shifting alliances: ‘When the Turks arrived at San’a’ in 1872, the Imam al-Mutawakkil Muhsin slipped away, first to Bani ‘Ali in northern Arhab and then to Hashid, moving between Huth, al-Khamri, and al-Qaflah (al-Hibshi 1980: 335). Al-Khamri, of course, is Bayt al-Ahmar’s home area. The al-Ahmars and Hashid acquired a very prominent place in relations between the Turks and the Imam, which they retained under al-Mutawakkil’s successors (ibid. 336, 354, and passim). By comparison, the Barat Bakil tribes, who had been so conspicuous in the mid-nineteenth century, played a somewhat subdued role. A little later, in 1882, Muhammad al-Huthi declared himself Imam at Barat and took the name al-Mahdi. He persisted in the claim until his death in 1901, but he was quite overshadowed by the Imams al-Hadi Sharaf al-Din (1879-90) and al-Mansur Muhammad (1890-1904), both of whom were concerned with great events on the plateau north of San’a’. His own career at Barat was a vita umbratilis, and even to Glaser in the Jawf (1903: 82) he was little more than a rumour. Dhu Muhammad and Dhu Husayn are mentioned both in the north and in Lower Yemen […] -a little later, in 1908, we find a mention of Naji Abu Ra’s of Dhu Muhammad as a Turkish ‘amil in Raydah […] -but the great axis of dispute between the south and the far north-east collapsed: it was the leaders of the more central northern tribes who now came to the fore. The great tribal families of today had appeared at the start of the eighteenth century; but what one sees as the start of the present century is the establishment of their present differences in wealth and power.’ <sup id="cite_ref-494" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-494">[494]</a></sup> 'With the Turkish occupation (1872-1918), the dramatic events that historians record shift in part from the west and south into the tribes‘  own territory. The political reality was complex, and at most points up to 1918 the Turks found support from Yemenis, not least from certain northern shaykhs whose fortunes were bound up with the Turkish presence. The clerk of the San’a’ court learned Turkish. Many if the ‘ulama’ supported the Turks even when the Imam’s fight against them was at its height, and he ambiguities of resisting the Turkish Sultan, who himself was seen to be beset by Christendom, were usually marked. None the less there was sustained resistance in the north. Tribes and Imams fought the Turks repeatedly, and the dynasty of Imams emerged that was to rule Yemen until the 1960s.’ <sup id="cite_ref-495" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-495">[495]</a></sup> The Britannica provides the following general summary of historical developments in Ottoman- and Imamic-period Yemen: 'Developments in the 19th century were fateful for Yemen. The determination of various European powers to establish a presence in the Middle East elicited an equally firm determination in other powers to thwart such efforts. For Yemen, the most important participants in the drama were the British, who took over Aden in 1839, and the Ottoman Empire, which at mid-century moved back into North Yemen, from which it had been driven by the Yemenis two centuries earlier.

These students would eventually become the kernel of domestic opposition to Yaḥyā and his policies.' <sup id="cite_ref-497" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-497">[497]</a></sup> 'Yemeni independence allowed the imam to resuscitate Zaydī claims to “historic Yemen,” which included Aden and the protectorate states, as well as an area farther north that had been occupied only recently by an expanding Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, including the province of Asir and some important areas around the Najrān oasis and Jīzān. These areas became a point of conflict with the house of Saʿūd. Yaḥyā, of course, did not recognize the standing Anglo-Ottoman border agreement.' <sup id="cite_ref-498" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-498">[498]</a></sup> 'The British, on the other hand, retained control over the south, which they considered strategically and economically important to their empire. Friction between the imamate and Britain characterized the entire interwar period, as Imam Yaḥyā sought to include the south in the united Yemen that he perceived to be his patrimony. The British in the meantime were consolidating their position in the south. The most important change was the incorporation of the Ḥaḍramawt and its great valley into the protectorate system-the result of the labours of British diplomat Harold Ingrams, who negotiated the famous “Ingrams’s Peace” among the more than 1,400 tribes and clans that had been feuding in that district for decades.' <sup id="cite_ref-499" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-499">[499]</a></sup> 'By the end of World War II in 1945, dissatisfaction with Yaḥyā and his imamate had spread to a rather wide segment of Yemeni society, including both secular and Muslim reformers and modernists, other elements of the traditional elite, and even the ʿulamāʾ (religious scholars). This tide of dissent culminated in early 1948 in the assassination of Yaḥyā and a coup by a varied coalition of dissidents. Much to the consternation of the plotters, however, Yaḥyā’s son Aḥmad succeeded in bringing together many of the tribal elements of the north, overthrew the new government, and installed himself as imam. Although Imam Aḥmad ibn Yaḥyā had indicated that he supported many of the popular political, economic, and social demands (e.g., creation of a cabinet with real responsibilities, abandonment of the principle of economic autarky, and the establishment of free public education), his own government soon resembled his father’s in nearly all respects. An attempt on Aḥmad’s life in 1955 only increased repression; indeed, his paranoia concerning the loyalty of major tribal elements prompted actions that eventually cost his son tribal support during the civil war after the 1962 revolution.' <sup id="cite_ref-500" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-500">[500]</a></sup> Given the complex political landscape of Ottoman-period Yemen, it is hard to identify a chief executive, although Imams might qualify to a degree.

(A good many Turks individually had elected to stay on.) A Yemeni historian does justice to the novelty: "The army was divided inti numbered taburs, or "detachments", so the first was called the first tabur, the second called the second tabur, and so one. Three taburs togethere were called a liwa', and three liwa's were called a firqah, and the whole together was called the Victorious Regular Army. Every tabur was made up of four blocs...and each of them had its number, the first and the second and so forth." Unlike tribal levies, this army had a fixed pay scale. The officers were mainly Turkish -indeed, instruction remained in Turkish until the 1930s; some, though, were Yemenis who had been to Turkish schools and command was given to 'Abdullah Dumayn, a sayyid from the Jawf who had served with the Turks in the rank of bekbashi. "The Imam expended the utmost effort on this and showed enormous interest", and in the next year four taburs more were raised around Ta'izz. The number of regulars rose to 15-20,000. A school for telegraphists was opened, allowing the Imam's care for detail to reach everywhere.' <sup id="cite_ref-502" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-502">[502]</a></sup> The Ottomans and the British stationed troops in Yemen during the colonial period: 'Developments in the 19th century were fateful for Yemen.

As a number of authors have noted […], the success of his claim was very probably due to the support of Nasir Mabkhut al-Ahmar, who had (at least most of the time) supported al-Mansur. With al-Ahmar’s backing, Yahya took binding agreements (qawa’id wa-dawabit) from the shaykhs about the conduct of the jihad, stipulating that the weak be protected, looting be controlled, and any artillery captured be surrendered to the public treasury (Zabahrah 1956: ii. 8). Almost immediately after his accession he dispatched forces to the west and south, the outlying Turkish garrisons fell, and San’a’ was again besieged […]. In the midst of an atrocious famine the Turkish garrison withdrew under safe conduct in April 1905. ‘San’a’ after the surrender was a ruin. Its markets were destroyed, its houses empty, and only a few of its inhabitants were left’, but when the tribes saw the victory that had been won ‘every tribe wanted to control some province or another of Yemen as a fief…’ (al-Wasi’I 928: 203).’ <sup id="cite_ref-505" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-505">[505]</a></sup></dd>

<dd> <b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from judiciary ♣ absent ♥</b> Informal justice coexisted with Imamic legal scholarship and Ottoman courts. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, informal tribal law remained relevant to the rural population: 'A strict and complex code of honor based on tribal values governs behavior among groups and proper decorum between the sexes, including veiling of women in urban or northern areas.' <sup id="cite_ref-506" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-506">[506]</a></sup> 'The cultural concept of honor also regulates the handling of disputes, which depends on confirming significant kinship ties.' <sup id="cite_ref-507" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-507">[507]</a></sup> 'It is a continuing challenge of governmental strategies to achieve a stable balance between relatively autonomous tribes and the state. Alliance with dominant tribal confederation therefore may still be influential in the distribution of development projects by central authorities.' <sup id="cite_ref-508" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-508">[508]</a></sup> But Islamic legal scholarship has a long history in Yemen as a guarantor of status and in the settling of disputes: 'Yemeni society is hierarchically organized on the basis of birth status and occupation. Until relative political stability was achieved in the late 1970s, birth and occupational statuses were legitimized as ascribed social categories. The elimination of practical barriers that restrict power and privilege?especially through marriage and education?to certain members of the society has only just begun. Under the system of ranked social categories, members of respectable groupings recognized their own noble descent and considered themselves the protectors of servants, former slaves, artisans, and certain farmers, all of whom were thought of as&nbsp;?deficient,? either because they provided a service or craft?such as bloodletting, butchery, or barbering?that involved contact with polluting substances, or because their origins were discredited as ignoble. The tribal code of protection was also extended to elites at the top of the social scale, especially to sayyids, the reputed descendants of the Prophet, who originally came to Yemen to serve as mediators between tribes and who are respected for their religious expertise. Another social category, that of legal scholars, also inherits high status in the ranking order. Scholars, along with shuyukh   (sing. shaykh  ), who are tribal leaders, typically serve as village administrators. The majority of Yemenis use various equivalent or substitute terms to identify themselves within the social hierarchy, including qaba\??\il   in the northern highlands to connote tribal membership, ra\??\iyah   in the south to mean&nbsp;?cultivators,? and \??\arab   along the coast to signify respectable ancestry. Former slaves continue to act as agents and domestics in the households of former masters, but the most menial jobs (e.g., removing human waste from the street) are reserved for Yemenis who are alleged descendants of Ethiopians of the pre-Islamic era. In addition, Yemen relies on a range of foreigners from the East and West for professional, technical, and custodial services.' <sup id="cite_ref-509" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-509">[509]</a></sup> The Ottoman administrators introduced legal reforms, many of which were undone by the Imamate in the North: 'The twentieth century opened in Yemen with a judgeship recently modified in accord with Ottoman reforms. Behind the simple character of the 1916 Ottoman personnel list lies a template for a new way of thinking about the nature of the shariʽa court. Although the more sweeping changes represented by the new Nizamiyya courts established in the central provinces of the empire were not instituted in the highlands, there were some significant innovations. A modicum of “order” (nizam), on a scale reduced and adapted for the special circumstances of Ottoman rule in Yemen, was introduced into local judicial affairs, as it had been in the closely associated sphere ofinstruction. Like Ottoman schools, much of this new system would apparently be undone by Imam Yahya, only to reappear in the institutional reforms of the republic. Undramatic though they may now appear, the innovations signaled in the personnel list were elements of a comprehensive reformulation of the judicial process, and beyond, as in the case of instruction, of the state itself. The list embodies selected bits and pieces of a much larger Ottoman bureacratic scheme for a justice system, one roughly analogous (p.188) In scope and detail to the legislation for judicial organization enacted in Yemen in 1979. The 1916 Ibb court staff were implementing a style of bureaucratic behavior radically different from that of the patrimonial imamic state, one that would only begin to be fully elaborated conceptually and enacted in practice with the wave of legislation and accompanying generation of complex new state organs in the 1970s.'  <sup id="cite_ref-510" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-510">[510]</a></sup> The British authorities in the South promoted the institutionalization of formal Islamic law: 'In the Yemeni sultanates known collectively as the Aden Protectorate, the British were instrumental in the institutionalization of formal shariʽa courts and in the consequent decline of customary law. “shariʽa law appears in South Arabia largely as the tool of the centralized government, whether indigenous or foreign,” Anderson writes (1970 [1955]: 11). For the “Protecting Power,” he continues, “there is … a natural tendency to champion the shariʽa, for it is ‘tidier’ than the vagaries of local custom from the administrative point of view and provides better political propaganda.” Promotion of the shariʽa enabled (p.66) the British to “pose as in some degree the champion of Islam, in partial imitation of the Governments of the Yemen and of Saudi Arabia” (1970: 12n).' <sup id="cite_ref-511" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-511">[511]</a></sup> In the Imamic system, Islamic legal scholars adjudicated disputes not resolved through tribal mechanisms: 'Central to the muwajaha format was the notion of responsiveness. An “official,” al-masʾul, was literally “the one asked.” What was sought from an imam or a governor, a mufti or a judge, was an “answer” (a jawab). In the case of the mufti, a query was posed and the answer was the fatwa. For the other three dispute-handling public officials, the imam in the capital and the governor and the judge on the provincial level, the approach was made in the form of a complaint or petition, known as a shakwa. Historically, shakwas were the general means by which individuals initiated actions in which they wanted to involve the state.9 Whether these were individual-state matters (employment, state credit, charity disbursement, tax matters) or individual-individual ones (p.171) (disputes of all sorts) pursued through the state, the shakwa always represented the opening move.' <sup id="cite_ref-512" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-512">[512]</a></sup></dd></dl>

The development of shaikhly constellations of power, in the manner described by Montagne for the Moroccan Berbers, was curtailed by exporting shaikhly leaders to tax prebends in richer areas. In this way the tribe was sanctioned as a status group within the state. The Imamic state rested on an alliance of the farmer (the fighter) with the preacher (the judge) and on the symbolic and political suppression of mercantile and craft interests more generally. The union of religious leaders and martial farmers from agriculturally marginal areas formed a loose prebendal dominion over the more productive, largely Shafi'i, peasant areas of the west and south. Whether collected by regular employees of the government or by irregulars from the north, taxes were paid by those who produced most, by the peasants of the richer areas. For example, Goitein reports that the Jewish villagers of al-Gades in lower Yemen called the local landlord 'askari, "soldier", noting, however, that he and his like came from the eastern pastoral region and should be distinguished from the regular 'askari who accompanied the local government officer on his tax levies.' <sup id="cite_ref-515" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-515">[515]</a></sup> ‘By the terms of the European armistice at the end of the First World War, the Turks were obliged to abandon Yemen. The Imam filled their place. Even before he entered San’a’ in 1918, Imam Yahya sent a force of tribesmen under Sayyid ‘Ali al-Wazir to take Haraz from the Isma’ilis (al-Jirafi 1951: 225), some of whom turned for help to the Idrisi; and as the Turks withdrew, the Imam also turned his attention southward. The tribes were directed against the Shafi’i areas of Lower Yemen, much as they had been by the Qasimis, in a jihad. ‘The tribesman who enrolled under the Imam’s standard and came from north of San’a’ to the lowlands of the Tihamah, to Ibb, to Ta’izz, and al-Bayda’ was not referred to as a soldier but as a warrior in the cause of the God’ (Nu’man 1965: 27). Not all of Nu’man’s writing is intended as sober history, but the nature of these campaigns is not in doubt and they occurred of course well within living memory.’ <sup id="cite_ref-516" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-516">[516]</a></sup> The Ottomans and the Imamate did not supplant autonomous tribal institutions. Tribesmen rather than trained officials acted as tax collectors, keeping part of the revenue for themselves: 'The  first thing to be said  is that no attempt was  made  to abolish tribalism as such. Where tribal practice was equated so readily with ignorance, and thus with irreligion, this  might  seem surprising, but it  is  as  if  the phenomenon were God-given; as  much part of  the intractable world and God's will as the mountains or the weather. Indeed,there were   only 'tribes', not tribalism, and th eradical ambition of rebuilding humanity to   some human design   (a 'sociological' ambition, of its nature) is more  a feature of our own time. Nor did   theImamate command the   means   to root out institutions on any  large  scale.  The Hamidal-Din  Imams,  Yahya (1904-48)and Ahmad(1948-62), did not reproduce the elaborate courts and armies of the  early  Qasimis but were rather frugal  men who personally supervised even  small,  local matters and ran  their administrations with the  forms  of power available to them (see e.g.Rihani 1930:220ff.; Scott 1942:174-5).Over the following decades they gradually built an army, whose  officers  in  the  end were  to  be part of the Imamate's undoing,but the  tribes remained the stronger force,   always carefully fragmented by their rulers' policy. The  aim  was that 'the pure shari'a be established', which  (as in most pre-bureaucratic Islamic  states) meant first  of  all that the zakat, or canonical tax, be collected and   a  modicum  of order retained. 'Broadly speaking, the tribal Zaydi north was governed by indirect rule with subsidies providedf or  the  chiefs.  The  Shafi'I south was  less fortunate in being under direct rule  by government officials working in concert with local headmen'(Serjeant 1979:92). In both areas the 'headmen' received  a cut  of the tax which it was their responsibility to  collect. One is sometimes told now that this  was  a quarter of  the total for northerners and a tenth for  the Shafi'I south (Messick1978:170), but the details in the north were in  fact irregular.' <sup id="cite_ref-517" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-517">[517]</a></sup> Nevertheless, government organization and documentation became increasingly bureaucratized: 'Developments in the 19th century were fateful for Yemen. The determination of various European powers to establish a presence in the Middle East elicited an equally firm determination in other powers to thwart such efforts. For Yemen, the most important participants in the drama were the British, who took over Aden in 1839, and the Ottoman Empire, which at mid-century moved back into North Yemen, from which it had been driven by the Yemenis two centuries earlier. The interests and activities of these two powers in the Red Sea basin and Yemen were substantially intensified by the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 and the reemergence of the Red Sea route as the preferred passage between Europe and East Asia. As the Ottomans expanded inland and established themselves in Sanaa and Taʿizz, the British expanded north and east from Aden, eventually establishing protectorates over more than a dozen of the many local statelets; this was done more in the interest of protecting Aden’s hinterland from the Ottomans and their Yemeni adversaries than out of any desire to add the territory and people there to the British Empire. By the early 20th century the growing clashes between the British and the Ottomans along the undemarcated border posed a serious problem; in 1904 a joint commission surveyed the border, and a treaty was concluded, establishing the frontier between Ottoman North Yemen and the British possessions in South Yemen. Later, of course, both Yemens considered the treaty an egregious instance of non-Yemeni interference in domestic affairs. The north became independent at the end of World War I in 1918, with the departure of the Ottoman forces; the imam of the Zaydīs, Yaḥyā Maḥmūd al-Mutawwakil, became the de facto ruler in the north by virtue of his lengthy campaign against the Ottoman presence in Yemen. In the 1920s Imam Yaḥyā sought to consolidate his hold on the country by working to bring the Shāfiʿī areas under his administrative jurisdiction and by suppressing much of the intertribal feuding and tribal opposition to the imamate. In an effort to enhance the effectiveness of his campaigns against the tribes and other fractious elements, the imam sent a group of Yemeni youth to Iraq in the mid-1930s to learn modern military techniques and weaponry. These students would eventually become the kernel of domestic opposition to Yaḥyā and his policies.' <sup id="cite_ref-518" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-518">[518]</a></sup> 'Forms, that is, documentary blanks to be filled in, appeared in Ibb with the Ottomans. At the local telegraph office, for example, one of the earliest of these forms had a crescent seal at the top, headings in Ottoman Turkish and French, boxes for office use, and lines to contain the message.11 Such blank forms proliferated in the Ottoman bureaucracies as they would later under the republicans. The commercial receipt, another type of printed form to be filled in, was introduced via Aden. Prior to the “order form” itself, the written purchase-requests Ibb merchants sent to Aden were connected narrations by a scribe (concluding with qala, “said,” and then the writer's name).12 Their internal arrangements were similar to the scalloped entries of the old foundation register. Existing apart from and prior to any particular written content, forms are the mechanical templates of the new age of writing. As with the Ottomans earlier in the century, the principal goal of the Egyptian advisors attached to Ibb offices in the late 1970s was to facilitate a bureacratic movement in a new direction, to assist functionaries in separating what had formerly been lumped together, to itemize what had been recorded whole. While old accounting registers were predominantly horizontal (written) in orientation, the new exhibited a more vertical (numerical) alignment. Thus while the pages of a tax collector's manual from early in the century contained entries strung across the page like laundry on a line, a comparable manual from circa 1955 had two prominent axes, one of grain types, the other of terrace names, creating a grid for entering the relevant figures. Vertical orientations facilitate whole-page summations and are associated with a new emphasis on the efficient extraction and display of numerical data, which used to be embedded in written text.' <sup id="cite_ref-519" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-519">[519]</a></sup>  'With the Turkish occupation (1872-1918), the dramatic events that historians record shift in part from the west and south into the tribes‘  own territory.

Al-Khamri, of course, is Bayt al-Ahmar’s home area. The al-Ahmars and Hashid acquired a very prominent place in relations between the Turks and the Imam, which they retained under al-Mutawakkil’s successors (ibid. 336, 354, and passim). By comparison, the Barat Bakil tribes, who had been so conspicuous in the mid-nineteenth century, played a somewhat subdued role. A little later, in 1882, Muhammad al-Huthi declared himself Imam at Barat and took the name al-Mahdi. He persisted in the claim until his death in 1901, but he was quite overshadowed by the Imams al-Hadi Sharaf al-Din (1879-90) and al-Mansur Muhammad (1890-1904), both of whom were concerned with great events on the plateau north of San’a’. His own career at Barat was a vita umbratilis, and even to Glaser in the Jawf (1903: 82) he was little more than a rumour. Dhu Muhammad and Dhu Husayn are mentioned both in the north and in Lower Yemen […] -a little later, in 1908, we find a mention of Naji Abu Ra’s of Dhu Muhammad as a Turkish ‘amil in Raydah […] -but the great axis of dispute between the south and the far north-east collapsed: it was the leaders of the more central northern tribes who now came to the fore. The great tribal families of today had appeared at the start of the eighteenth century; but what one sees as the start of the present century is the establishment of their present differences in wealth and power.’ <sup id="cite_ref-521" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-521">[521]</a></sup> 'With the Turkish occupation (1872-1918), the dramatic events that historians record shift in part from the west and south into the tribes‘  own territory.

Its rule rested on an uneasy pact with northern leaders and groups. The allegiance of the prominent shaikhs was rewarded by alliance and simultaneously controlled by a system of holding (and educating) young hostages from their families. During the reign of Imam Yahya, the developing administration of the Imamic state moved to institutionalize status differences. The cadre of the Imamic administration proclaimed themselves the bearers of the civilizing tradition of Islamic learning and law. Under the Imamate Islamic shari'ah was to conquer divisive tribal custom and the ulema (the scholars) would rule and not merely serve the shaikhs.' <sup id="cite_ref-523" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-523">[523]</a></sup> 'The 1970s marked a time of rapid "institution building", as political scientists put it. And, contrary to what the political rhetoric of the time would have us believe, such institutions were in fact erected on the earlier introduction of printing and the modern arts of government. But these institutions of the Republic did not as yet obscure just how limited bureaucratic development had been prior to 1962, the date of the overthrow of the Imamate, when even at the pinnacle of government the model of rule had been that of a dynastic house (daulah in Yemeni dialectal usage). Brothers, sons and cousins of the Imam served as ministers and commanders; foreign trade was essentially a family monopoly; the court, not the administrative department, was the site of Imamic legal judgment. True, the Imam's domestic space was grand: unlike the households of most other men it contained both slaves and servants. So too, the houses of powerful political figures might include an independent reception room, with an entrance separate from the house, known as mahkamah or hukuma, a place of judgment. In the later years of the Imamate, modernist jurists deplored the way justice was administered: judges, who were paid at best a scant salary, accepted monies directly from the litigants; court was held early in the day by the door of the judge's home and later in the afternoon in his reception rooms. If this was true of state office-holders, it was all the more so in the case of shaikhly government. A shaikh governed from his house.' <sup id="cite_ref-524" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-524">[524]</a></sup> It is assumed here that Turkish clerks would have received some compensation from the Ottoman authorities, but governors may have expropriated resources in the form of taxation as well.

<p><b>♠ Number of regional administrative units ♣ ♥</b> This is not clear from the material reviewed so far. Note: Informal tribal authority and ascribed social status remained relevant throughout the 19th and 20th centuries: 'It is a continuing challenge of governmental strategies to achieve a stable balance between relatively autonomous tribes and the state. Alliance with dominant tribal confederation therefore may still be influential in the distribution of development projects by central authorities.' <sup id="cite_ref-525" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-525">[525]</a></sup> 'Yemeni society is hierarchically organized on the basis of birth status and occupation. Until relative political stability was achieved in the late 1970s, birth and occupational statuses were legitimized as ascribed social categories. The elimination of practical barriers that restrict power and privilege?especially through marriage and education?to certain members of the society has only just begun. Under the system of ranked social categories, members of respectable groupings recognized their own noble descent and considered themselves the protectors of servants, former slaves, artisans, and certain farmers, all of whom were thought of as&nbsp;?deficient,? either because they provided a service or craft?such as bloodletting, butchery, or barbering?that involved contact with polluting substances, or because their origins were discredited as ignoble. The tribal code of protection was also extended to elites at the top of the social scale, especially to sayyids, the reputed descendants of the Prophet, who originally came to Yemen to serve as mediators between tribes and who are respected for their religious expertise. Another social category, that of legal scholars, also inherits high status in the ranking order. Scholars, along with shuyukh   (sing. shaykh  ), who are tribal leaders, typically serve as village administrators. The majority of Yemenis use various equivalent or substitute terms to identify themselves within the social hierarchy, including qaba\??\il   in the northern highlands to connote tribal membership, ra\??\iyah   in the south to mean&nbsp;?cultivators,? and \??\arab   along the coast to signify respectable ancestry. Former slaves continue to act as agents and domestics in the households of former masters, but the most menial jobs (e.g., removing human waste from the street) are reserved for Yemenis who are alleged descendants of Ethiopians of the pre-Islamic era. In addition, Yemen relies on a range of foreigners from the East and West for professional, technical, and custodial services.' <sup id="cite_ref-526" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-526">[526]</a></sup> Aspiring Imams had to rely on tribal support in their anti-Ottoman campaigns: 'The Zaidi Imamate could not build its power solely upon a union of non-agricultural specialists: it required the support of the militarily powerful northern landowning shaikhs and the groups of fighting men that they could muster, usually from the poorer village families. The development of shaikhly constellations of power, in the manner described by Montagne for the Moroccan Berbers, was curtailed by exporting shaikhly leaders to tax prebends in richer areas. In this way the tribe was sanctioned as a status group within the state. The Imamic state rested on an alliance of the farmer (the fighter) with the preacher (the judge) and on the symbolic and political suppression of mercantile and craft interests more generally. The union of religious leaders and martial farmers from agriculturally marginal areas formed a loose prebendal dominion over the more productive, largely Shafi'i, peasant areas of the west and south. Whether collected by regular employees of the government or by irregulars from the north, taxes were paid by those who produced most, by the peasants of the richer areas. For example, Goitein reports that the Jewish villagers of al-Gades in lower Yemen called the local landlord 'askari, "soldier", noting, however, that he and his like came from the eastern pastoral region and should be distinguished from the regular 'askari who accompanied the local government officer on his tax levies.' <sup id="cite_ref-527" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-527">[527]</a></sup> ‘By the terms of the European armistice at the end of the First World War, the Turks were obliged to abandon Yemen. The Imam filled their place. Even before he entered San’a’ in 1918, Imam Yahya sent a force of tribesmen under Sayyid ‘Ali al-Wazir to take Haraz from the Isma’ilis (al-Jirafi 1951: 225), some of whom turned for help to the Idrisi; and as the Turks withdrew, the Imam also turned his attention southward. The tribes were directed against the Shafi’i areas of Lower Yemen, much as they had been by the Qasimis, in a jihad. ‘The tribesman who enrolled under the Imam’s standard and came from north of San’a’ to the lowlands of the Tihamah, to Ibb, to Ta’izz, and al-Bayda’ was not referred to as a soldier but as a warrior in the cause of the God’ (Nu’man 1965: 27). Not all of Nu’man’s writing is intended as sober history, but the nature of these campaigns is not in doubt and they occurred of course well within living memory.’ <sup id="cite_ref-528" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-528">[528]</a></sup> The Ottomans and the Imamate did not supplant autonomous tribal institutions. Tribesmen rather than trained officials acted as tax collectors, keeping part of the revenue for themselves: 'The  first thing to be said  is that no attempt was  made  to abolish tribalism as such. Where tribal practice was equated so readily with ignorance, and thus with irreligion, this  might  seem surprising, but it  is  as  if  the phenomenon were God-given; as  much part of  the intractable world and God's will as the mountains or the weather. Indeed,there were   only 'tribes', not tribalism, and th eradical ambition of rebuilding humanity to   some human design   (a 'sociological' ambition, of its nature) is more  a feature of our own time. Nor did   theImamate command the   means   to root out institutions on any  large  scale.  The Hamidal-Din  Imams,  Yahya (1904-48)and Ahmad(1948-62), did not reproduce the elaborate courts and armies of the  early  Qasimis but were rather frugal  men who personally supervised even  small,  local matters and ran  their administrations with the  forms  of power available to them (see e.g.Rihani 1930:220ff.; Scott 1942:174-5).Over the following decades they gradually built an army, whose  officers  in  the  end were  to  be part of the Imamate's undoing,but the  tribes remained the stronger force,   always carefully fragmented by their rulers' policy. The  aim  was that 'the pure shari'a be established', which  (as in most pre-bureaucratic Islamic  states) meant first  of  all that the zakat, or canonical tax, be collected and   a  modicum  of order retained. 'Broadly speaking, the tribal Zaydi north was governed by indirect rule with subsidies providedf or  the  chiefs.  The  Shafi'I south was  less fortunate in being under direct rule  by government officials working in concert with local headmen'(Serjeant 1979:92). In both areas the 'headmen' received  a cut  of the tax which it was their responsibility to  collect. One is sometimes told now that this  was  a quarter of  the total for northerners and a tenth for  the Shafi'I south (Messick1978:170), but the details in the north were in  fact irregular.' <sup id="cite_ref-529" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-529">[529]</a></sup> Nevertheless, government organization and documentation became increasingly bureaucratized: 'Developments in the 19th century were fateful for Yemen. The determination of various European powers to establish a presence in the Middle East elicited an equally firm determination in other powers to thwart such efforts. For Yemen, the most important participants in the drama were the British, who took over Aden in 1839, and the Ottoman Empire, which at mid-century moved back into North Yemen, from which it had been driven by the Yemenis two centuries earlier. The interests and activities of these two powers in the Red Sea basin and Yemen were substantially intensified by the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 and the reemergence of the Red Sea route as the preferred passage between Europe and East Asia. As the Ottomans expanded inland and established themselves in Sanaa and Taʿizz, the British expanded north and east from Aden, eventually establishing protectorates over more than a dozen of the many local statelets; this was done more in the interest of protecting Aden’s hinterland from the Ottomans and their Yemeni adversaries than out of any desire to add the territory and people there to the British Empire. By the early 20th century the growing clashes between the British and the Ottomans along the undemarcated border posed a serious problem; in 1904 a joint commission surveyed the border, and a treaty was concluded, establishing the frontier between Ottoman North Yemen and the British possessions in South Yemen. Later, of course, both Yemens considered the treaty an egregious instance of non-Yemeni interference in domestic affairs. The north became independent at the end of World War I in 1918, with the departure of the Ottoman forces; the imam of the Zaydīs, Yaḥyā Maḥmūd al-Mutawwakil, became the de facto ruler in the north by virtue of his lengthy campaign against the Ottoman presence in Yemen. In the 1920s Imam Yaḥyā sought to consolidate his hold on the country by working to bring the Shāfiʿī areas under his administrative jurisdiction and by suppressing much of the intertribal feuding and tribal opposition to the imamate. In an effort to enhance the effectiveness of his campaigns against the tribes and other fractious elements, the imam sent a group of Yemeni youth to Iraq in the mid-1930s to learn modern military techniques and weaponry. These students would eventually become the kernel of domestic opposition to Yaḥyā and his policies.' <sup id="cite_ref-530" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-530">[530]</a></sup> 'Forms, that is, documentary blanks to be filled in, appeared in Ibb with the Ottomans. At the local telegraph office, for example, one of the earliest of these forms had a crescent seal at the top, headings in Ottoman Turkish and French, boxes for office use, and lines to contain the message.11 Such blank forms proliferated in the Ottoman bureaucracies as they would later under the republicans. The commercial receipt, another type of printed form to be filled in, was introduced via Aden. Prior to the “order form” itself, the written purchase-requests Ibb merchants sent to Aden were connected narrations by a scribe (concluding with qala, “said,” and then the writer's name).12 Their internal arrangements were similar to the scalloped entries of the old foundation register. Existing apart from and prior to any particular written content, forms are the mechanical templates of the new age of writing. As with the Ottomans earlier in the century, the principal goal of the Egyptian advisors attached to Ibb offices in the late 1970s was to facilitate a bureacratic movement in a new direction, to assist functionaries in separating what had formerly been lumped together, to itemize what had been recorded whole. While old accounting registers were predominantly horizontal (written) in orientation, the new exhibited a more vertical (numerical) alignment. Thus while the pages of a tax collector's manual from early in the century contained entries strung across the page like laundry on a line, a comparable manual from circa 1955 had two prominent axes, one of grain types, the other of terrace names, creating a grid for entering the relevant figures. Vertical orientations facilitate whole-page summations and are associated with a new emphasis on the efficient extraction and display of numerical data, which used to be embedded in written text.' <sup id="cite_ref-531" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-531">[531]</a></sup>  'With the Turkish occupation (1872-1918), the dramatic events that historians record shift in part from the west and south into the tribes‘  own territory. The political reality was complex, and at most points up to 1918 the Turks found support from Yemenis, not least from certain northern shaykhs whose fortunes were bound up with the Turkish presence. The clerk of the San’a’ court learned Turkish. Many if the ‘ulama’ supported the Turks even when the Imam’s fight against them was at its height, and he ambiguities of resisting the Turkish Sultan, who himself was seen to be beset by Christendom, were usually marked. None the less there was sustained resistance in the north. Tribes and Imams fought the Turks repeatedly, and the dynasty of Imams emerged that was to rule Yemen until the 1960s.’ <sup id="cite_ref-532" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-532">[532]</a></sup> Tribal parties, Imams, and Ottoman authorities often clashed, but also entered shifting alliances: ‘When the Turks arrived at San’a’ in 1872, the Imam al-Mutawakkil Muhsin slipped away, first to Bani ‘Ali in northern Arhab and then to Hashid, moving between Huth, al-Khamri, and al-Qaflah (al-Hibshi 1980: 335). Al-Khamri, of course, is Bayt al-Ahmar’s home area. The al-Ahmars and Hashid acquired a very prominent place in relations between the Turks and the Imam, which they retained under al-Mutawakkil’s successors (ibid. 336, 354, and passim). By comparison, the Barat Bakil tribes, who had been so conspicuous in the mid-nineteenth century, played a somewhat subdued role. A little later, in 1882, Muhammad al-Huthi declared himself Imam at Barat and took the name al-Mahdi. He persisted in the claim until his death in 1901, but he was quite overshadowed by the Imams al-Hadi Sharaf al-Din (1879-90) and al-Mansur Muhammad (1890-1904), both of whom were concerned with great events on the plateau north of San’a’. His own career at Barat was a vita umbratilis, and even to Glaser in the Jawf (1903: 82) he was little more than a rumour. Dhu Muhammad and Dhu Husayn are mentioned both in the north and in Lower Yemen […] -a little later, in 1908, we find a mention of Naji Abu Ra’s of Dhu Muhammad as a Turkish ‘amil in Raydah […] -but the great axis of dispute between the south and the far north-east collapsed: it was the leaders of the more central northern tribes who now came to the fore. The great tribal families of today had appeared at the start of the eighteenth century; but what one sees as the start of the present century is the establishment of their present differences in wealth and power.’ <sup id="cite_ref-533" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-533">[533]</a></sup> 'With the Turkish occupation (1872-1918), the dramatic events that historians record shift in part from the west and south into the tribes‘  own territory.

Its rule rested on an uneasy pact with northern leaders and groups. The allegiance of the prominent shaikhs was rewarded by alliance and simultaneously controlled by a system of holding (and educating) young hostages from their families. During the reign of Imam Yahya, the developing administration of the Imamic state moved to institutionalize status differences. The cadre of the Imamic administration proclaimed themselves the bearers of the civilizing tradition of Islamic learning and law. Under the Imamate Islamic shari'ah was to conquer divisive tribal custom and the ulema (the scholars) would rule and not merely serve the shaikhs.' <sup id="cite_ref-535" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-535">[535]</a></sup> 'The 1970s marked a time of rapid "institution building", as political scientists put it. And, contrary to what the political rhetoric of the time would have us believe, such institutions were in fact erected on the earlier introduction of printing and the modern arts of government. But these institutions of the Republic did not as yet obscure just how limited bureaucratic development had been prior to 1962, the date of the overthrow of the Imamate, when even at the pinnacle of government the model of rule had been that of a dynastic house (daulah in Yemeni dialectal usage). Brothers, sons and cousins of the Imam served as ministers and commanders; foreign trade was essentially a family monopoly; the court, not the administrative department, was the site of Imamic legal judgment. True, the Imam's domestic space was grand: unlike the households of most other men it contained both slaves and servants. So too, the houses of powerful political figures might include an independent reception room, with an entrance separate from the house, known as mahkamah or hukuma, a place of judgment. In the later years of the Imamate, modernist jurists deplored the way justice was administered: judges, who were paid at best a scant salary, accepted monies directly from the litigants; court was held early in the day by the door of the judge's home and later in the afternoon in his reception rooms. If this was true of state office-holders, it was all the more so in the case of shaikhly government. A shaikh governed from his house.' <sup id="cite_ref-536" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-536">[536]</a></sup> We have provisionally considered allied tribesmen who performed some administrative tasks as 'local-level administrators'.

<p><b>♠ Multiple legal systems ♣ present ♥</b> Informal justice coexisted with Imamic legal scholarship and Ottoman courts. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, informal tribal law remained relevant to the rural population: 'A strict and complex code of honor based on tribal values governs behavior among groups and proper decorum between the sexes, including veiling of women in urban or northern areas.' <sup id="cite_ref-537" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-537">[537]</a></sup> 'The cultural concept of honor also regulates the handling of disputes, which depends on confirming significant kinship ties.' <sup id="cite_ref-538" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-538">[538]</a></sup> 'It is a continuing challenge of governmental strategies to achieve a stable balance between relatively autonomous tribes and the state. Alliance with dominant tribal confederation therefore may still be influential in the distribution of development projects by central authorities.' <sup id="cite_ref-539" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-539">[539]</a></sup> But Islamic legal scholarship has a long history in Yemen as a guarantor of status and in the settling of disputes: 'Yemeni society is hierarchically organized on the basis of birth status and occupation. Until relative political stability was achieved in the late 1970s, birth and occupational statuses were legitimized as ascribed social categories. The elimination of practical barriers that restrict power and privilege?especially through marriage and education?to certain members of the society has only just begun. Under the system of ranked social categories, members of respectable groupings recognized their own noble descent and considered themselves the protectors of servants, former slaves, artisans, and certain farmers, all of whom were thought of as&nbsp;?deficient,? either because they provided a service or craft?such as bloodletting, butchery, or barbering?that involved contact with polluting substances, or because their origins were discredited as ignoble.

Behind the simple character of the 1916 Ottoman personnel list lies a template for a new way of thinking about the nature of the shariʽa court. Although the more sweeping changes represented by the new Nizamiyya courts established in the central provinces of the empire were not instituted in the highlands, there were some significant innovations. A modicum of “order” (nizam), on a scale reduced and adapted for the special circumstances of Ottoman rule in Yemen, was introduced into local judicial affairs, as it had been in the closely associated sphere ofinstruction. Like Ottoman schools, much of this new system would apparently be undone by Imam Yahya, only to reappear in the institutional reforms of the republic. Undramatic though they may now appear, the innovations signaled in the personnel list were elements of a comprehensive reformulation of the judicial process, and beyond, as in the case of instruction, of the state itself. The list embodies selected bits and pieces of a much larger Ottoman bureacratic scheme for a justice system, one roughly analogous (p.188) In scope and detail to the legislation for judicial organization enacted in Yemen in 1979. The 1916 Ibb court staff were implementing a style of bureaucratic behavior radically different from that of the patrimonial imamic state, one that would only begin to be fully elaborated conceptually and enacted in practice with the wave of legislation and accompanying generation of complex new state organs in the 1970s.'  <sup id="cite_ref-541" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-541">[541]</a></sup> The British authorities in the South promoted the institutionalization of formal Islamic law: 'In the Yemeni sultanates known collectively as the Aden Protectorate, the British were instrumental in the institutionalization of formal shariʽa courts and in the consequent decline of customary law. “shariʽa law appears in South Arabia largely as the tool of the centralized government, whether indigenous or foreign,” Anderson writes (1970 [1955]: 11). For the “Protecting Power,” he continues, “there is … a natural tendency to champion the shariʽa, for it is ‘tidier’ than the vagaries of local custom from the administrative point of view and provides better political propaganda.” Promotion of the shariʽa enabled (p.66) the British to “pose as in some degree the champion of Islam, in partial imitation of the Governments of the Yemen and of Saudi Arabia” (1970: 12n).' <sup id="cite_ref-542" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-542">[542]</a></sup> In the Imamic system, Islamic legal scholars adjudicated disputes not resolved through tribal mechanisms: 'Central to the muwajaha format was the notion of responsiveness. An “official,” al-masʾul, was literally “the one asked.” What was sought from an imam or a governor, a mufti or a judge, was an “answer” (a jawab). In the case of the mufti, a query was posed and the answer was the fatwa. For the other three dispute-handling public officials, the imam in the capital and the governor and the judge on the provincial level, the approach was made in the form of a complaint or petition, known as a shakwa. Historically, shakwas were the general means by which individuals initiated actions in which they wanted to involve the state.9 Whether these were individual-state matters (employment, state credit, charity disbursement, tax matters) or individual-individual ones (p.171) (disputes of all sorts) pursued through the state, the shakwa always represented the opening move.' <sup id="cite_ref-543" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-543">[543]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Non-state judiciary ♣ present ♥</b> Disputes between tribes were often resolved through feuds and other forms of self-help justice: 'Yemeni society is tribally based, and trust and assurance most often are measured by degree of consanguinity. Families are very close and are the focus of the individual’s primary devotion; one’s second allegiance is to the tribe, an extended family unit that ordinarily traces its ties to a common eponymous ancestor. In rural Yemen, state authority is weak, and disputes between tribes are frequently solved through violence. The art of the feud is still quite real, and, as a consequence, Yemen is a gun culture. Virtually every household has at least one weapon, and men and boys often carry firearms in public. Even when not carrying a pistol or a rifle, most Yemeni males-particularly those belonging to a rural tribe-will carry a dagger, the traditional janbiyyah (or jambiyyah), a short, broad, curved blade sheathed on a belt worn across the abdomen and serving as a signal of one’s status within social and tribal hierarchies.' <sup id="cite_ref-544" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-544">[544]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Religious judiciary ♣ present ♥</b> The primary judicial specialists were Islamic legal scholars: 'Islam is the major force that unifies Yemenis across social, sexual, and regional boundaries. Yet most adherents of the different schools of Islam reside in distinct sections of the country, and this fact has certain political implications. Zaydis, who belong to the Shia subsect of Islam, are located in the northern and eastern parts of Yemen, whereas Shafis, orthodox Sunnis, live in the southern and coastal regions. Location in the highlands apparently enables Zaydis more successfully to repel invasions than Shafis in the lower lying areas. A smaller Shia subsect, the Ismaili, and also the remnants of an ancient Jewish community, may still be found in certain parts of Yemen. As Muslims, Yemenis aspire to fulfill the five tenets of Islam: affirmation of the Islamic creed, prayer, fasting, charity, and pilgrimage. In the Shafi areas of Yemen, the tombs of certain holy men are visited by believers for their special healing and other powers.' <sup id="cite_ref-545" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-545">[545]</a></sup> 'Yemeni society is hierarchically organized on the basis of birth status and occupation.

Scholars, along with shuyukh   (sing. shaykh  ), who are tribal leaders, typically serve as village administrators. The majority of Yemenis use various equivalent or substitute terms to identify themselves within the social hierarchy, including qaba\??\il   in the northern highlands to connote tribal membership, ra\??\iyah   in the south to mean&nbsp;?cultivators,? and \??\arab   along the coast to signify respectable ancestry. Former slaves continue to act as agents and domestics in the households of former masters, but the most menial jobs (e.g., removing human waste from the street) are reserved for Yemenis who are alleged descendants of Ethiopians of the pre-Islamic era. In addition, Yemen relies on a range of foreigners from the East and West for professional, technical, and custodial services.' <sup id="cite_ref-546" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-546">[546]</a></sup> Sayyids remained dominant in Yemeni Islamic scholarship: 'Being of sayyid status, even in contemporary Yemeni society, still validates (but does not necessarily guarantee) one's access to religious learning. Men gather at the mosque for prayers and sermons on the Sabbath, which in Yemen occurs on Friday. Strict segregation of the sexes usually does not permit women to worship in public.' <sup id="cite_ref-547" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-547">[547]</a></sup> Other ceremonial specialists included local preachers and men responsible for circumcising children: 'Despite the imposition of modernity, Yemenis remain proud of their architectural and oral-poetry traditions. Houses and mosques found in different regions of the country reflect unique stylistic and functional variations. Highlanders construct multistoried buildings from smooth, layered mud, mud brick, or cut stone. Dwellings in San\??\a are particularly impressive with their decorative colored-glass windows. In the rural highlands, houses constructed atop terraced embankments were fortresses against enemy tribes. In cities along the coastal plain, the former elegance of houses and mosques can be seen in their elaborate doors and facades. Rural towns in the Tihama usually include a walled compound that contains mud and thatched-roof huts identical to those found in Africa, on the other side of the Red Sea. The interiors of Tihama houses may be highly ornamented. Buildings constructed of cinder blocks are routinely replacing the huts. Competitive poetry duels performed at weddings by men of tribal status are highly valued. In the past, celebrations for circumcision (required of all Muslim males) were particularly elaborate, but now government officials discourage postinfancy circumcisions, thereby undermining the importance of ceremonial specialists.' <sup id="cite_ref-548" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-548">[548]</a></sup> The Imamate sought to strengthen the position of scholars vis-à-vis tribal shaykhs: 'Imamic government was of a religious character, sharing power with and at times dominating, but never entirely restructuring or supplanting, rural political, military and legal structures. Its rule rested on an uneasy pact with northern leaders and groups. The allegiance of the prominent shaikhs was rewarded by alliance and simultaneously controlled by a system of holding (and educating) young hostages from their families. During the reign of Imam Yahya, the developing administration of the Imamic state moved to institutionalize status differences. The cadre of the Imamic administration proclaimed themselves the bearers of the civilizing tradition of Islamic learning and law. Under the Imamate Islamic shari'ah was to conquer divisive tribal custom and the ulema (the scholars) would rule and not merely serve the shaikhs.' <sup id="cite_ref-549" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-549">[549]</a></sup> It is unclear from this how legal scholars fared under the Ottomans, but we have assumed they were active then as well.

Although the opinion of a potential bride or groom might be solicited on the issue, the final decision on marriage belongs with the head of the household. As in many parts of the Islamic world, endogamy (the practice of marrying someone from within one’s own kin group) is common, the preferred marriage being with a paternal first cousin of the opposite gender. The practice of mahr (bride-price, given by the father of the groom) is a usual part of the marriage ceremony. Divorce is not common, but neither is there a stigma attached to it. Men may have as many as four wives at the same time, though in practice it is rare for a man to take more than one wife.' <sup id="cite_ref-560" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-560">[560]</a></sup> While polygyny was legal in principle, monogamy was the norm for most: 'Islamic law and custom guide contemporary Yemeni marriages, although government regulations establishing ceilings on bride-price are often ignored. The legal marriage age of 16 for girls is also difficult to regulate because births are not routinely recorded. Arranged marriages prevail, but women do have veto power over a prospective groom. Fewer than 5 percent of Yemeni males exercise their option as Muslims to have up to four wives. The difficulty of supporting multiple wives equitably, as Islamic law requires, as well as the high cost of getting married, probably discourages polygyny. Divorce can be accomplished by men with far fewer restrictions than are imposed on women.

The head of the family is the eldest male, who makes all significant decisions for the family and its members. Women play a secondary role in running the household and raising the children and, in rural areas, helping to work the family farm. Though nearly one-fourth of Yemeni women obtain work outside the home, a woman traditionally earns most of her social status through bearing children, particularly males. The birth of a male child is considered one of the most important social events in Yemeni society and is followed almost immediately by a circumcision ceremony.

Men sometimes wear the full-length, loose-fitting thawb-frequently with a jacket over it-but more often the traditional fūṭah, a saronglike wraparound kilt, is worn with a shirt. The turban is a common type of head covering, and a finely woven bamboo hat (shaped somewhat like a fez) called a kofiya (or kofia) is a more formal choice of headgear. There are various forms of dress for women, depending on the social role a woman plays and where she lives. In North Yemen, women in cities and towns wore the sharsaf, a black skirt, scarf, and veil ensemble that covers the entire body. In South Yemen, the regime that succeeded the British after 1967 vigorously opposed this women’s dress code, and this opposition prevailed especially in the towns and cities. In the countryside, clothing for women tends to be somewhat more utilitarian and may consist of a dress or robe that provides for a greater range of movement and under which, in some parts of Yemen, it is not uncommon for a woman to wear a pair of loose slacks known as a sirwāl. Also in the countryside, a woman’s face may or may not be covered, and dresses are sometimes sewn from brightly coloured fabric. Working women frequently wear a broad-brimmed straw hat (dhola) to ward off the sun.' <sup id="cite_ref-570" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-570">[570]</a></sup> Labour was divided along gender lines: 'Women preside over the work of the household, which may be comprised of blood relatives, neighbors, and members of client or servant groups in families of high social status.

More characteristic of social organization in the southern and coastal regions are smaller alliances and/or greater association with others residing in the same vicinity.' <sup id="cite_ref-586" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-586">[586]</a></sup> 'Yemenis recognize the concept of “closeness” to describe desired relationships through marriage.' <sup id="cite_ref-587" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-587">[587]</a></sup> 'Landownership is concentrated within the dominant patrilineages, the result both of inheritance practices and marital strategies. Under Islamic rules, a woman's inheritance is only half that of her brother. In Yemen, women often do not renounce their claims of ownership. Thus the ideal marriage between patrilateral cousins would ensure that land remains within the patrilineage. Similarly, marriage to an outsider encourages the renunciation of claims to land that is too far away to farm.' <sup id="cite_ref-588" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-588">[588]</a></sup> Patriarchal values were important: 'Yemen shares in many of the customs and lifeways that are found in other parts of the Arab world. Culture is intensely patriarchal, and households usually consist of an extended family living in a single domicile or family compound. The head of the family is the eldest male, who makes all significant decisions for the family and its members. Women play a secondary role in running the household and raising the children and, in rural areas, helping to work the family farm. Though nearly one-fourth of Yemeni women obtain work outside the home, a woman traditionally earns most of her social status through bearing children, particularly males. The birth of a male child is considered one of the most important social events in Yemeni society and is followed almost immediately by a circumcision ceremony. Though prohibited by law in 2001, female genital cutting still occurs, taking place primarily in private and varying significantly by region.' <sup id="cite_ref-589" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-589">[589]</a></sup> Arranged endogamous marriages were the norm: 'Islamic law and custom guide contemporary Yemeni marriages, although government regulations establishing ceilings on bride-price are often ignored. The legal marriage age of 16 for girls is also difficult to regulate because births are not routinely recorded. Arranged marriages prevail, but women do have veto power over a prospective groom. Fewer than 5 percent of Yemeni males exercise their option as Muslims to have up to four wives. The difficulty of supporting multiple wives equitably, as Islamic law requires, as well as the high cost of getting married, probably discourages polygyny. Divorce can be accomplished by men with far fewer restrictions than are imposed on women. Customarily, wives (through fathers or brothers) must remunerate their husbands if they wish to terminate the marriage. Legally, fathers' rights to the children after divorce supersede those of mothers.' <sup id="cite_ref-590" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-590">[590]</a></sup> 'Marriages are almost always arranged and frequently are undertaken at a young age. Although the opinion of a potential bride or groom might be solicited on the issue, the final decision on marriage belongs with the head of the household. As in many parts of the Islamic world, endogamy (the practice of marrying someone from within one’s own kin group) is common, the preferred marriage being with a paternal first cousin of the opposite gender. The practice of mahr (bride-price, given by the father of the groom) is a usual part of the marriage ceremony. Divorce is not common, but neither is there a stigma attached to it. Men may have as many as four wives at the same time, though in practice it is rare for a man to take more than one wife.' <sup id="cite_ref-591" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-591">[591]</a></sup> Labour was divided along gender lines: 'Women preside over the work of the household, which may be comprised of blood relatives, neighbors, and members of client or servant groups in families of high social status. Women are valued members of the household unit as agricultural producers and are also crucial to the maintenance of the Yemeni ideal of domestic hospitality.' <sup id="cite_ref-592" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-592">[592]</a></sup></dd></dl>

The tribal code of protection was also extended to elites at the top of the social scale, especially to sayyids, the reputed descendants of the Prophet, who originally came to Yemen to serve as mediators between tribes and who are respected for their religious expertise. Another social category, that of legal scholars, also inherits high status in the ranking order. Scholars, along with shuyukh   (sing. shaykh  ), who are tribal leaders, typically serve as village administrators.

Former slaves continue to act as agents and domestics in the households of former masters, but the most menial jobs (e.g., removing human waste from the street) are reserved for Yemenis who are alleged descendants of Ethiopians of the pre-Islamic era.

Although efforts toward detribalization were at least in part effective, subsequent events indicated that such identifications were still socially, economically, and politically relevant.' <sup id="cite_ref-624" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-624">[624]</a></sup> 'Yemeni society is tribally based, and trust and assurance most often are measured by degree of consanguinity. Families are very close and are the focus of the individual’s primary devotion; one’s second allegiance is to the tribe, an extended family unit that ordinarily traces its ties to a common eponymous ancestor. In rural Yemen, state authority is weak, and disputes between tribes are frequently solved through violence. The art of the feud is still quite real, and, as a consequence, Yemen is a gun culture. Virtually every household has at least one weapon, and men and boys often carry firearms in public. Even when not carrying a pistol or a rifle, most Yemeni males-particularly those belonging to a rural tribe-will carry a dagger, the traditional janbiyyah (or jambiyyah), a short, broad, curved blade sheathed on a belt worn across the abdomen and serving as a signal of one’s status within social and tribal hierarchies.' <sup id="cite_ref-625" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-625">[625]</a></sup> 'It is a continuing challenge of governmental strategies to achieve a stable balance between relatively autonomous tribes and the state. Alliance with dominant tribal confederation therefore may still be influential in the distribution of development projects by central authorities.' <sup id="cite_ref-626" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-626">[626]</a></sup> Religion was another important social divider: 'Throughout society, the broadest distinctions between population groups are based not on ethnicity but on religious affiliation. Islam is the state religion, and the Sunni branch of Islam, represented by the Shāfiʿī school, predominates. The Shīʿite minority consists of the Zaydī school, which has long been politically dominant in the mountainous highlands of the north, and the Ismāʿīlīs, now a relatively small group found in the Haraz region of northern Yemen and in Jabal Manakhah, the mountainous area west of Sanaa. The non-Muslim community is very small, consisting mostly of foreign visitors and workers. All are free to worship as they wish-including the Jewish community-but, as in most conservative Muslim countries, proselytizing of Muslims by non-Muslims is illegal.' <sup id="cite_ref-627" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-627">[627]</a></sup> Low social status often intersected with ethnicity: 'Ethnic minorities include the Mahra, a people whose roots are unclear and who occupy a part of eastern Yemen, as well as the island of Socotra, and who speak a variant of the ancient Himyaritic language. (See Mahra Sultanate.) On the Tihāmah coastal plain, in-migrations from Ethiopia and Somalia have occurred over many centuries. There is a clear African admixture in the coastal population as well as a distinct social group known as the Akhdām, who perform menial tasks and are the closest thing to a caste in Yemen. In the far north there are still small remnants of the once-large Jewish communities (most migrated to Israel after 1948), while in the area of Aden and the eastern regions there are distinct Somali, Indonesian, and Indian elements in the population, legacies of the British colonial era as well of economic and political ties extending back over two millennia.'<sup id="cite_ref-628" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-628">[628]</a></sup> The importance of ascribed statues, the intersection of low social status with the performance of 'impure' and subservient economic roles and the determination of rights to social support by tribal affiliation seem to indicate little to no social mobility.

<dl><dd> <b>♠ recruitment of chief executive ♣ higher ♥</b> Even once the Ottomans had regained power in Yemen in the 19th century, tribal authority remained relevant on the local level, often intersecting with lower-level administration. Aspiring Imams had to rely on tribal support in their anti-Ottoman campaigns: 'It is a continuing challenge of governmental strategies to achieve a stable balance between relatively autonomous tribes and the state. Alliance with dominant tribal confederation therefore may still be influential in the distribution of development projects by central authorities.' <sup id="cite_ref-629" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-629">[629]</a></sup> 'The Zaidi Imamate could not build its power solely upon a union of non-agricultural specialists: it required the support of the militarily powerful northern landowning shaikhs and the groups of fighting men that they could muster, usually from the poorer village families. The development of shaikhly constellations of power, in the manner described by Montagne for the Moroccan Berbers, was curtailed by exporting shaikhly leaders to tax prebends in richer areas. In this way the tribe was sanctioned as a status group within the state. The Imamic state rested on an alliance of the farmer (the fighter) with the preacher (the judge) and on the symbolic and political suppression of mercantile and craft interests more generally. The union of religious leaders and martial farmers from agriculturally marginal areas formed a loose prebendal dominion over the more productive, largely Shafi'i, peasant areas of the west and south. Whether collected by regular employees of the government or by irregulars from the north, taxes were paid by those who produced most, by the peasants of the richer areas. For example, Goitein reports that the Jewish villagers of al-Gades in lower Yemen called the local landlord 'askari, "soldier", noting, however, that he and his like came from the eastern pastoral region and should be distinguished from the regular 'askari who accompanied the local government officer on his tax levies.' <sup id="cite_ref-630" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-630">[630]</a></sup> Ascribed social status was important: 'Yemeni society is hierarchically organized on the basis of birth status and occupation. Until relative political stability was achieved in the late 1970s, birth and occupational statuses were legitimized as ascribed social categories. The elimination of practical barriers that restrict power and privilege?especially through marriage and education?to certain members of the society has only just begun. Under the system of ranked social categories, members of respectable groupings recognized their own noble descent and considered themselves the protectors of servants, former slaves, artisans, and certain farmers, all of whom were thought of as&nbsp;?deficient,? either because they provided a service or craft?such as bloodletting, butchery, or barbering?that involved contact with polluting substances, or because their origins were discredited as ignoble. The tribal code of protection was also extended to elites at the top of the social scale, especially to sayyids, the reputed descendants of the Prophet, who originally came to Yemen to serve as mediators between tribes and who are respected for their religious expertise. Another social category, that of legal scholars, also inherits high status in the ranking order. Scholars, along with shuyukh   (sing. shaykh  ), who are tribal leaders, typically serve as village administrators. The majority of Yemenis use various equivalent or substitute terms to identify themselves within the social hierarchy, including qaba\??\il   in the northern highlands to connote tribal membership, ra\??\iyah   in the south to mean&nbsp;?cultivators,? and \??\arab   along the coast to signify respectable ancestry. Former slaves continue to act as agents and domestics in the households of former masters, but the most menial jobs (e.g., removing human waste from the street) are reserved for Yemenis who are alleged descendants of Ethiopians of the pre-Islamic era. In addition, Yemen relies on a range of foreigners from the East and West for professional, technical, and custodial services.' <sup id="cite_ref-631" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-631">[631]</a></sup> The Imamate and the Ottomans superimposed their own administrative structure onto the tribal system without supplanting it: 'Developments in the 19th century were fateful for Yemen. The determination of various European powers to establish a presence in the Middle East elicited an equally firm determination in other powers to thwart such efforts. For Yemen, the most important participants in the drama were the British, who took over Aden in 1839, and the Ottoman Empire, which at mid-century moved back into North Yemen, from which it had been driven by the Yemenis two centuries earlier. The interests and activities of these two powers in the Red Sea basin and Yemen were substantially intensified by the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 and the reemergence of the Red Sea route as the preferred passage between Europe and East Asia. As the Ottomans expanded inland and established themselves in Sanaa and Taʿizz, the British expanded north and east from Aden, eventually establishing protectorates over more than a dozen of the many local statelets; this was done more in the interest of protecting Aden’s hinterland from the Ottomans and their Yemeni adversaries than out of any desire to add the territory and people there to the British Empire. By the early 20th century the growing clashes between the British and the Ottomans along the undemarcated border posed a serious problem; in 1904 a joint commission surveyed the border, and a treaty was concluded, establishing the frontier between Ottoman North Yemen and the British possessions in South Yemen. Later, of course, both Yemens considered the treaty an egregious instance of non-Yemeni interference in domestic affairs. The north became independent at the end of World War I in 1918, with the departure of the Ottoman forces; the imam of the Zaydīs, Yaḥyā Maḥmūd al-Mutawwakil, became the de facto ruler in the north by virtue of his lengthy campaign against the Ottoman presence in Yemen. In the 1920s Imam Yaḥyā sought to consolidate his hold on the country by working to bring the Shāfiʿī areas under his administrative jurisdiction and by suppressing much of the intertribal feuding and tribal opposition to the imamate. In an effort to enhance the effectiveness of his campaigns against the tribes and other fractious elements, the imam sent a group of Yemeni youth to Iraq in the mid-1930s to learn modern military techniques and weaponry. These students would eventually become the kernel of domestic opposition to Yaḥyā and his policies.'<sup id="cite_ref-632" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-632">[632]</a></sup> 'The  first thing to be said  is that no attempt was  made  to abolish tribalism as such. Where tribal practice was equated so readily with ignorance, and thus with irreligion, this  might  seem surprising, but it  is  as  if  the phenomenon were God-given; as  much part of  the intractable world and God's will as the mountains or the weather. Indeed,there were   only 'tribes', not tribalism, and th eradical ambition of rebuilding humanity to   some human design   (a 'sociological' ambition, of its nature) is more  a feature of our own time. Nor did   theImamate command the   means   to root out institutions on any  large  scale.  The Hamidal-Din  Imams,  Yahya (1904-48)and Ahmad(1948-62), did not reproduce the elaborate courts and armies of the  early  Qasimis but were rather frugal  men who personally supervised even  small,  local matters and ran  their administrations with the  forms  of power available to them (see e.g.Rihani 1930:220ff.; Scott 1942:174-5).Over the following decades they gradually built an army, whose  officers  in  the  end were  to  be part of the Imamate's undoing,but the  tribes remained the stronger force,   always carefully fragmented by their rulers' policy. The  aim  was that 'the pure shari'a be established', which  (as in most pre-bureaucratic Islamic  states) meant first  of  all that the zakat, or canonical tax, be collected and   a  modicum  of order retained. 'Broadly speaking, the tribal Zaydi north was governed by indirect rule with subsidies providedf or  the  chiefs.  The  Shafi'I south was  less fortunate in being under direct rule  by government officials working in concert with local headmen'(Serjeant 1979:92). In both areas the 'headmen' received  a cut  of the tax which it was their responsibility to  collect. One is sometimes told now that this  was  a quarter of  the total for northerners and a tenth for  the Shafi'I south (Messick 1978:170), but the details in the north were in  fact irregular.' <sup id="cite_ref-633" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-633">[633]</a></sup> ‘By the terms of the European armistice at the end of the First World War, the Turks were obliged to abandon Yemen. The Imam filled their place. Even before he entered San’a’ in 1918, Imam Yahya sent a force of tribesmen under Sayyid ‘Ali al-Wazir to take Haraz from the Isma’ilis (al-Jirafi 1951: 225), some of whom turned for help to the Idrisi; and as the Turks withdrew, the Imam also turned his attention southward. The tribes were directed against the Shafi’i areas of Lower Yemen, much as they had been by the Qasimis, in a jihad. ‘The tribesman who enrolled under the Imam’s standard and came from north of San’a’ to the lowlands of the Tihamah, to Ibb, to Ta’izz, and al-Bayda’ was not referred to as a soldier but as a warrior in the cause of the God’ (Nu’man 1965: 27). Not all of Nu’man’s writing is intended as sober history, but the nature of these campaigns is not in doubt and they occurred of course well within living memory.’ <sup id="cite_ref-634" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-634">[634]</a></sup> 'Imamic government was of a religious character, sharing power with and at times dominating, but never entirely restructuring or supplanting, rural political, military and legal structures. Its rule rested on an uneasy pact with northern leaders and groups. The allegiance of the prominent shaikhs was rewarded by alliance and simultaneously controlled by a system of holding (and educating) young hostages from their families. During the reign of Imam Yahya, the developing administration of the Imamic state moved to institutionalize status differences. The cadre of the Imamic administration proclaimed themselves the bearers of the civilizing tradition of Islamic learning and law. Under the Imamate Islamic shari'ah was to conquer divisive tribal custom and the ulema (the scholars) would rule and not merely serve the shaikhs.' <sup id="cite_ref-635" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-635">[635]</a></sup> Tribal parties, Imams, and Ottoman authorities often clashed, but also entered shifting alliances: ‘When the Turks arrived at San’a’ in 1872, the Imam al-Mutawakkil Muhsin slipped away, first to Bani ‘Ali in northern Arhab and then to Hashid, moving between Huth, al-Khamri, and al-Qaflah (al-Hibshi 1980: 335). Al-Khamri, of course, is Bayt al-Ahmar’s home area. The al-Ahmars and Hashid acquired a very prominent place in relations between the Turks and the Imam, which they retained under al-Mutawakkil’s successors (ibid. 336, 354, and passim). By comparison, the Barat Bakil tribes, who had been so conspicuous in the mid-nineteenth century, played a somewhat subdued role. A little later, in 1882, Muhammad al-Huthi declared himself Imam at Barat and took the name al-Mahdi. He persisted in the claim until his death in 1901, but he was quite overshadowed by the Imams al-Hadi Sharaf al-Din (1879-90) and al-Mansur Muhammad (1890-1904), both of whom were concerned with great events on the plateau north of San’a’. His own career at Barat was a vita umbratilis, and even to Glaser in the Jawf (1903: 82) he was little more than a rumour. Dhu Muhammad and Dhu Husayn are mentioned both in the north and in Lower Yemen […] -a little later, in 1908, we find a mention of Naji Abu Ra’s of Dhu Muhammad as a Turkish ‘amil in Raydah […] -but the great axis of dispute between the south and the far north-east collapsed: it was the leaders of the more central northern tribes who now came to the fore. The great tribal families of today had appeared at the start of the eighteenth century; but what one sees as the start of the present century is the establishment of their present differences in wealth and power.’ <sup id="cite_ref-636" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-636">[636]</a></sup> 'With the Turkish occupation (1872-1918), the dramatic events that historians record shift in part from the west and south into the tribes‘  own territory. The political reality was complex, and at most points up to 1918 the Turks found support from Yemenis, not least from certain northern shaykhs whose fortunes were bound up with the Turkish presence. The clerk of the San’a’ court learned Turkish. Many if the ‘ulama’ supported the Turks even when the Imam’s fight against them was at its height, and he ambiguities of resisting the Turkish Sultan, who himself was seen to be beset by Christendom, were usually marked. None the less there was sustained resistance in the north. Tribes and Imams fought the Turks repeatedly, and the dynasty of Imams emerged that was to rule Yemen until the 1960s.’ <sup id="cite_ref-637" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-637">[637]</a></sup> The Britannica provides the following general summary of historical developments in Ottoman- and Imamic-period Yemen: 'Developments in the 19th century were fateful for Yemen. The determination of various European powers to establish a presence in the Middle East elicited an equally firm determination in other powers to thwart such efforts. For Yemen, the most important participants in the drama were the British, who took over Aden in 1839, and the Ottoman Empire, which at mid-century moved back into North Yemen, from which it had been driven by the Yemenis two centuries earlier.

These areas became a point of conflict with the house of Saʿūd. Yaḥyā, of course, did not recognize the standing Anglo-Ottoman border agreement.'<sup id="cite_ref-640" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-640">[640]</a></sup> 'The British, on the other hand, retained control over the south, which they considered strategically and economically important to their empire. Friction between the imamate and Britain characterized the entire interwar period, as Imam Yaḥyā sought to include the south in the united Yemen that he perceived to be his patrimony. The British in the meantime were consolidating their position in the south. The most important change was the incorporation of the Ḥaḍramawt and its great valley into the protectorate system-the result of the labours of British diplomat Harold Ingrams, who negotiated the famous “Ingrams’s Peace” among the more than 1,400 tribes and clans that had been feuding in that district for decades.' <sup id="cite_ref-641" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-641">[641]</a></sup> 'By the end of World War II in 1945, dissatisfaction with Yaḥyā and his imamate had spread to a rather wide segment of Yemeni society, including both secular and Muslim reformers and modernists, other elements of the traditional elite, and even the ʿulamāʾ (religious scholars). This tide of dissent culminated in early 1948 in the assassination of Yaḥyā and a coup by a varied coalition of dissidents. Much to the consternation of the plotters, however, Yaḥyā’s son Aḥmad succeeded in bringing together many of the tribal elements of the north, overthrew the new government, and installed himself as imam. Although Imam Aḥmad ibn Yaḥyā had indicated that he supported many of the popular political, economic, and social demands (e.g., creation of a cabinet with real responsibilities, abandonment of the principle of economic autarky, and the establishment of free public education), his own government soon resembled his father’s in nearly all respects. An attempt on Aḥmad’s life in 1955 only increased repression; indeed, his paranoia concerning the loyalty of major tribal elements prompted actions that eventually cost his son tribal support during the civil war after the 1962 revolution.' <sup id="cite_ref-642" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-642">[642]</a></sup> Given the complex political landscape of Ottoman-period Yemen, it is hard to identify a chief executive, but Imams might qualify.

<p><b>♠ occupational mobility ♣ absent ♥</b> At the time, most Yemenis were subsistence agriculturalists: 'Various tasks in the cultivation of crops are divided according to sex. Men, women, and children share responsibility for the care of livestock. Women gather firewood and water; in some regions, they now receive assistance from the men, who have acquired Japanese trucks. The family's livelihood may also depend on women selling homemade goods and produce in the marketplace.' <sup id="cite_ref-643" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-643">[643]</a></sup> 'Yemen’s difficult terrain, limited soil, inconsistent water supply, and large number of microclimates have fostered some of the most highly sophisticated methods of water conservation and seed adaptation found anywhere in the world, making possible the cultivation of surprisingly diverse crops. The most common crops are cereals such as millet, corn (maize), wheat, barley, and sorghum; myriad vegetables from a burgeoning truck farm industry have appeared on the market in recent years. There has also been extensive cultivation of fruits-both tropical (mangoes, plantains, bananas, melons, papayas, and citrus) and temperate (pears, peaches, apples, and grapes). The two main cash crops in the northern highlands are coffee (Coffea arabica) and khat (qāt; Catha edulis). The coffee trade, which began in the 16th century, was originally based on Yemeni coffee, and, for centuries, coffee was the most important and renowned export of Yemen. The port city of Mocha-from which a distinctive style of coffee takes its name-was the point from which most of Yemen’s coffee was exported between the 16th and 18th centuries, before more-economical plantation cultivation was introduced in other parts of the world. In Yemen the coffee tree grows best in the middle highlands, at elevations of 4,500 to 6,500 feet (1,400 to 2,000 metres), where khat also flourishes.' <sup id="cite_ref-644" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-644">[644]</a></sup> 'The typical Yemeni farmer raises at least some poultry and livestock, typically regional varieties of chickens, goats, sheep, or cattle. Agricultural aid programs sponsored by Western countries in the 1970s and ’80s introduced new varieties of dairy and beef cattle in the more temperate regions of the north, but Yemen still imports much of the livestock and dairy and poultry products it consumes.' <sup id="cite_ref-645" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-645">[645]</a></sup> Coffee and khat were important cash crops: 'The two main cash crops in the northern highlands are coffee (Coffea arabica) and khat (qāt; Catha edulis).

The latter is an evergreen shrub whose young leaves, which contain an alkaloid, are chewed as a mild stimulant. The production and consumption of khat occupy a prominent position in the culture and economy of Yemen. Increased affluence has allowed a growing section of the population to indulge in its use, which the government has attempted-with little success-to discourage. Greater demand has fueled a substantial increase in khat acreage. Although older coffee terraces are often converted to khat as their productivity declines, much of the land being devoted to khat was formerly considered marginal for commercial agricultural purposes and now benefits from regular soil-enhancement programs and terrace-maintenance efforts.' <sup id="cite_ref-646" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-646">[646]</a></sup> Cotton became more common in the 20th century: 'Beginning in the 1970s, the cultivation of cotton-both in the Tihāmah coastal plain in the north and in the coastal plain east of Aden-was strongly supported by the respective national governments, and for a while it contributed significantly to national income. At the end of the 20th century, a significant decline in world cotton prices, as well as the high costs of initiation and development, meant that the Yemeni cotton industry was not competitive.' <sup id="cite_ref-647" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-647">[647]</a></sup> Accordingly, we have assumed that occupational mobility was low for more Yemenis at the time.

Zaydis, who belong to the Shia subsect of Islam, are located in the northern and eastern parts of Yemen, whereas Shafis, orthodox Sunnis, live in the southern and coastal regions. Location in the highlands apparently enables Zaydis more successfully to repel invasions than Shafis in the lower lying areas. A smaller Shia subsect, the Ismaili, and also the remnants of an ancient Jewish community, may still be found in certain parts of Yemen.' <sup id="cite_ref-649" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-649">[649]</a></sup> 'As Muslims, Yemenis aspire to fulfill the five tenets of Islam: affirmation of the Islamic creed, prayer, fasting, charity, and pilgrimage.' <sup id="cite_ref-650" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-650">[650]</a></sup> 'In the Shafi areas of Yemen, the tombs of certain holy men are visited by believers for their special healing and other powers.' <sup id="cite_ref-651" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-651">[651]</a></sup> 'Being of sayyid status, even in contemporary Yemeni society, still validates (but does not necessarily guarantee) one's access to religious learning.

Islam is the state religion, and the Sunni branch of Islam, represented by the Shāfiʿī school, predominates. The Shīʿite minority consists of the Zaydī school, which has long been politically dominant in the mountainous highlands of the north, and the Ismāʿīlīs, now a relatively small group found in the Haraz region of northern Yemen and in Jabal Manakhah, the mountainous area west of Sanaa. The non-Muslim community is very small, consisting mostly of foreign visitors and workers. All are free to worship as they wish-including the Jewish community-but, as in most conservative Muslim countries, proselytizing of Muslims by non-Muslims is illegal.' <sup id="cite_ref-654" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-654">[654]</a></sup> Yemen has a history of religious militancy and Zaydism: 'Yemen's distance from any Islamic central authority has made it historically an attractive haven for militant offshoots of normative Sunni Islam, particularly the two smaller branches of Shiism: Ismaili, or "Sevener," Shiism, and Zaydi, or "Fiver," Shiism. Zaydism was established in Yemen by the imam Yahya al-Hadi (d. 911), a descendant of Ali's son Hasan who migrated from Medina to Yemen late in the ninth century and established his capital at the northern highland city of Sada. Unlike Ismaili or Twelver Shiite doctrine, Zaydi theology posits an active, visible imam, or leader of the Muslim community, descended from either Hasan or his brother Husayn, who is learned in the religious sciences and who publicly proves himself worthy of leading the Muslim community, in battle if necessary. What this has meant in Yemeni history is that scions of numerous lines of Hasanid and, less frequently, Husaynid descendants have proclaimed their dawas, or "calls"-occasionally simultaneously, so that the supporters of one line were obliged to fight it out with supporters of another.' <sup id="cite_ref-655" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-655">[655]</a></sup>

(See Mahra Sultanate.) On the Tihāmah coastal plain, in-migrations from Ethiopia and Somalia have occurred over many centuries. There is a clear African admixture in the coastal population as well as a distinct social group known as the Akhdām, who perform menial tasks and are the closest thing to a caste in Yemen. In the far north there are still small remnants of the once-large Jewish communities (most migrated to Israel after 1948), while in the area of Aden and the eastern regions there are distinct Somali, Indonesian, and Indian elements in the population, legacies of the British colonial era as well of economic and political ties extending back over two millennia.'<sup id="cite_ref-667" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-667">[667]</a></sup> The intersection of low social status with the performance of 'impure' and subservient economic roles and the role of ethnicity in this process seem to justify coding this variable for the more hierarchical option. Furthermore, Jews were violently persecuted after the emergence of a Messianic movement. The codebook does not currently provide a category for status discrimination based on religion, but religion and ethnicity could be considered to intersect in the case of the Yemeni Jewish community. Tobi provides a historical description of repressive measures directed at Jews: 'In 1629 power in San'a was retaken by the native populalion after the Turks were driven out by the sons of the Zaydi Imam al-Qasim, who had firsl risen in revolt against them at the end of the previous century. While the Jews did not live at ease under Turkish rule, especially in its last years, as attested by Shalom Shabazi in his commentary to the Pentateuch liemdat Yamim,7 their lot deteriorated under the Zaydi yoke. The latter were religious fanatics and far stricter than the Sunni Ottomans (of the Hanafi school) in their treatment of Jews as ahl aidhimmah. 8 But to the religious facet was added the national facet, for the new Zaydi rulers accused the Jews of siding with the infidel Turks.' <sup id="cite_ref-668" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-668">[668]</a></sup> 'Religious ardour apparently intensified in particular under al-Qasim's son, the Imam Ism3'il al-Mutawakkil, who took power in 1644 and who was zealously religious. 'o Despite all the foregoing, there is no evidence whatever in the Jewish sources that at a certain date prior to the events associated with Shabbetay Zevi in 1667 acts of repression were carried out against the Jews of Yemen. On the other hand, according to various sources the latter expected the coming of the Messiah in the course of the seventeenth century, from the year 1619 on. This was connected with the appearance of two comets that year, according to Yisrael HaKohen of Qubayrah, the city of the priests in the Shar'ab province in southern Yemen.' <sup id="cite_ref-669" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-669">[669]</a></sup> 'In the years immediately following 1619 the Jews of Yemen encountered great distress in the form of apostasy and incarceration and tonure at the hands of the Turkish rulers, worsened by the starvation resuhing from this and from a plague of locusts. Among the casualties were Yosef ben Avigad, Shabazi's father, and members of his family, as he relates in the sequel to the account of the comets in 1619. These harsh events were perceived as the birth-pangs preceding the advent of the Messiah, as indicated by the writing of zakharyah Ha-Zidoni, who in 1626 (1937 of the SE) expected the arrival of the Messiah in 1940 of the SE ("'In the year 1940 You shall accomplish vengeance") (a pun in Hebrew on the number of the year and the word for vengeance). That year was 1629, the year in which the Turks were driven out of San'a by the sons of al-Qasim, the Imam who rebelled against the foreign yoke.' <sup id="cite_ref-670" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-670">[670]</a></sup> 'The first information on Shabbetay Zevi reached Yemen very late, in 1666,30 when the Sabbatean movement was at its height and close to the time of the apocalypse expected that year.31 But it is noteworthy that at that time the advent of the Messiah was expected not only on the basis of this information and the omen of the two comets of 1619, since which time eighty years had not yet passed (see above), but also on the basis of another comet that had appeared in 1665. The only intimation of this is in one of the manuscripts of Shabazi's ll.emdat Yamim, in which the following appendage is found after the above account of the 1619 comelS: "In the year 1976 of Lht: SE a star arose before it like a flame and described a circle until it returned behind it; perhaps this is the star of the Messiah."' <sup id="cite_ref-671" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-671">[671]</a></sup> 'Following the impression made by these events, but without any connection to&nbsp;!.hem, one year later-I 666--letters reached Yemen from Safed and Egypt. apparently Alexandria, telling of the approach of the end of days and of the Messiah Shabbetay Zevi.J ) Some of the letters from Egypt reached the heads of the San'a community-Yihye Ha-Levi, who was head of the court of justice at San'a, and Siayman alNaqqash, the leader of the community. h is not stated explicitly that they were sent to them, and it seems that they were handed over to them by Yemeni Jews. Many of the Jews of Yemen had been led to believe in the messianism of Shabbetay Zevi and the prophecy of Nathan Ha' Azzati, who are the only two figures of the Sabbatean movement to whom reference is made in the letters of the Yemeni sages, even though the heads of the community, in San'a at least, rejected the rumours of redemption:'4 Like Jewish communities outside Yemen, the excitement caused by the tales of Shabbetay Zevi resulted in the occurrence of soothsaying among the Jews in San'a and the neighbouring communities, and also in the communities of the south_ The soothsayers (even including some women), called "heralds" in the sources,35 conducted propaganda on behalf of Shabbetay Zevi and encouraged the Jews to perfonn purification rites and mortification for the coming of the Messiah: it was forbidden to eat meat other than roasted, to drink wine even on Passover eve, to shave the hair of the women's heads, and to engage in sexual intercourse; food was to be dipped in dust and ashes and not in salt, etc. These customs were elaborated by the Sahbateans in Yemen of their own accord. although they had read about the act of purification and mortification in the letters promoting the movement that had reached Vemen from abroad.' <sup id="cite_ref-672" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-672">[672]</a></sup> 'The Muslims in Yemen oppressed and humiliated the Jews, for which the author appeals to God thus: "Restore us against the tribula· tion and the torture and the humiliations that we have encountered in this exile" (p. 135). It seems that the oppression intensified after the Turks withdrew from Yemen in the 1630s. in particular under the rule of the zealous Imam al·Mut3wakkil Isma'il who ascended the throne in 1644: "Israel has borne several decrees and oppression and a large lax every month and all the days since the year DROR" (-541011650) (p.16). The straitened circumstances of the Yemeni ex.ile also become clear from the interpretation of the verse in Psalms 70:20: "In our exile we suffer from three calamities, the first is persecutions, wandering and slavery; the second is agony, poverty and humiliation; the third is war, abuse and famine" (p, 136), Moreover, from the author's vision of the future status of the Jews of Yemen following redemption something may be learned of their humiliation and resentment stemming from the special ta:&lt; they had to pay for protection by the Muslim ruler: "When the Messiah from the tribe of Ephrayim will appear [.,,] [in the year 5426 [1666J the [Arab] king [...] who was wandering in the desert [...] will distribule letters all over his kingdom 10 enhance the Jews [",] hoping to find reSI and peace and ease to his nation of the known nalion" (the Jews, p, 110), "The Lord will send a spirit in the tongue of every king and governor to announce in the markets and in the streets, saying: Peace. peace for Israel, they shall not pay any more mindah, bela and halakh06 (p. 138).' <sup id="cite_ref-673" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-673">[673]</a></sup> 'Elsewhere in the work it transpires that in fact during the rule of al-Mutawakkil Isma'il, cases of apostasy mulliplied under threat of persecution and by decree: these are the birth pangs of the Messiah and a hidden means of discovering if indeed there is complete repentance that will justify redemption (pp. 114-115).' <sup id="cite_ref-674" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-674">[674]</a></sup> 'We have observed above that the belief in Shabbetay Zevi in Yemen propagated mainly among the ordinary folk, while the leaders of the San'a community at least, the President Naqqash and the head of the rabbinical court Yihye Ha-Levi, were skeptical about i1.68 As we shall see below, these reservations on the part of these two, and apparently of other leaders in the San'a and other communities, are what saved them from the unnatural death that was the lot of Siayman Jamal.' <sup id="cite_ref-675" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-675">[675]</a></sup> 'A contemporary Yemeni Muslim writer, 'Abd Allah ibn'Ali ibn al· Wazir, was the author of Iibtiq al-liulwti wa-Jihtif ai-Man wa·l-Salwa. Relating to the year 1077 of the Hijrah (beginning 4 July 1666), he sets out extremely important details on the messianic activity in Yemen that year.69 He states that it began in the month Rajab 1077 of the Hijrah, that is, January 1667. Presumably some time passed, at least several months, between the actual start of messianic activity in Yemen and the moment when the Muslims began to take note of it. The Muslim chronicle states, and this is borne out by what we know from the Hebrew sources, that the Jews sold their possessions cheaply and made preparations for their ascent to the Land of Israel, as the Messiah had been revealed.' <sup id="cite_ref-676" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-676">[676]</a></sup> 'This activity brought about an immediate response by the Qa.gi of San'a, Shiha.b aI-Din al-Maswari, who was responsible for public order in the city. He approached the Imam Isma'il, who resided in Sudah,73 for guidance on how to deal with the matter, for the very existence of a messianic movement was perceived by the rulers as a revolt, not only among the Jews but also, and perhaps especially, among the Muslims, principally the Shafi'is in the south and west of Yemen who were ruled by the zaydis. This was because the nature of a messianic movement was to alter the order of government. Nor was this entirely impossible, for we know of the Jewish false Messiah of 1495 in Hadramawt who got up a sizable anny and fought against the Tahiri ru,;,ii The Imam's reply is not known exactly, but its gist was that the actions of the Jews constituted a violation of the laws of protection granted them by the Islamic Slate, an act that released the state from maintaining the protection. The significance of this ruling was that Jewish blood and property were now free for all. because the state was not obliged to protect them. And in fact, as the chronicler relates, after word of the Imam's decision spread, among other places in Kawkaban and Shibam to the northwest of San'a, where there were Jewish communities, the Jewish wives were raped and their goods and property plundered. The rumours continued to spread to the northeast, to the tribal population. A group of men from the Hamdan tribes hastened to San'a to attack the Jews of the city. But its governor, Jamal ai-Din 'Ali ibn al-Mu'ayyad, prevented this act and also punished those who had robbed the Jews, on the grounds that the Imam had not ordered the pillaging even though the Jews' lives and property were unguarded as they had broken the conditions of the protection. The government certainly wished to prevent the actions of the tribes in San'a itself out of fear that hann would befall the entire population, including the Muslims. In general, the governor did not wish to have his authority weakened by actions over which he had no control.' <sup id="cite_ref-677" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-677">[677]</a></sup> 'According to ibn al-Wazir, the stonn abated and the Imam took no funher steps against the Jews. But the Jews themselves, that is, those who held the messianic belief. exploited this time of calm and continued their messianic activity not only in secret but openly, There is no doubt that the official leaders of the San'a community did not participate, except for a certain group headed by one of its sages. The Muslim chronicler relates that in the course of a wine-drinking feast a member of this group became intoxicated and his companions dressed him in the finest garments. This may have been an indication of the messianic aspirations of that individual, as we shall see below. In any event, this man climbed up to the largest fortress of San'a, situated in the eastern outskirts of the city, and attempted to ascend to the throne and the canopy in the fortress, that is, to become ruler of the Muslims. He even made the outspoken demand that the Muslim commanders and soldiers in the fortress place themselves under his command. But instead the latter arrested the man and threw him into the Bustan prison in the city. The Imam was infonned of what had transpired. and he ordered the prisoner to be taken out and executed.' <sup id="cite_ref-678" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-678">[678]</a></sup> 'Be that as it may, the response of the Imam Isma'il al this slage was far harsher than at the previous stage, for now it was a matter of actual insurrection, even though il was instigated by a man whose political strength was apparently very slight. It seems that the messianic activity was not limited 10 the San'a Jewish community alone. The Imam in Sudah heard of the events not only from the governors of San'a and other cities but also from the tribal chiefs.79 Isma'il summoned the Jewish leaders from the major centres at that time, San'a and tlamdah,so and interrogated them. As they could not deny the event, even though they were not devotees of the messiah, he decided to take drastic action against the Jewish communities, no doubt on the assumption that the Jews had violated the conditions of the protection agreement between the Islamic government and themselves by rebelling against the former. Instructions went out from Sudah to all the cities of Yemen and its provinces to strike at the Jews. And sure enough, the orders were fulfilled by the Imam's own troops dispatched from SGdah and presumably by local populations everywhere. But Ism3'il did not stop at this. It seems that he decided to enforce against the Jews the laws of discrimination that were practiced in other Islamic countries but had never been applied under Zaydi rule in Yemen since its beginning at the end of the ninth century.SI The main Hebrew source, Hamami. mentions only two matters: one is the confiscation by the slate of all Jewish property in Yemen, movable goods and real estate, and the regulation that hence· forward the Jews were forbidden to own land; the second is the decree banning the wearing by Jews of turban, or headdresses.82 Of all the decrees and persecution connected with the Sabbatean events in Yemen. some of which are still to be described below, the ban on headdresses became the symbol of the precariousness of the position and rights of the Jews of Yemen, and the entire episode is called by them and in their writings "the headdress decree" (gezerat ha- 'atarot).' <sup id="cite_ref-679" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-679">[679]</a></sup> 'The leaders of the Jewish communities were arrested and tortured in several prisons, and the sentence of death hovered over lhem. As usual in cases of this kind in Yemen, Jews so sentenced were offered their lives in return for conversion to Islam;84 but the offer was rejected.l.S Naqqash, the nagid of the San'a community, was exiled to Qamaran86 in the Red Sea, a mostly deserted island populated by a few fishermen and a handful of villagers who made their living by pearl diving87 and which was used as a prison island for political offenders.88 He remained imprisoned and shackled for two years and only lhen was he released and returned to San'a.89 During the Mawza' exile, in 1679, he was still officiating as the nagid of the San'a community.90 It appears that his release was due to the fact that like other leaders of the San'a and other communities he had not supported the messianic move-ment in Yemen at that time.' <sup id="cite_ref-680" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-680">[680]</a></sup> 'In contrast to this the fate of Jamal was far more bitter. When called before the governor of San'a, not the Imam Isma'il in Sfidah, during the Passover festival in 1667, he apparently did not deny his messianic belief. After arrest and torture "in a place beneath the ground,,91 he was handed over to "a second king in whose hand he used to place the tax", probably the'Amil of San' a, who was in charge of collecting the jizyah tax from the Jews and who therefore bore responsibility for them, and he too "locked him in a place of snakes and scorpions". They sent from San'a to the Imam asking him what to do with Jamal, since in the Zaydi ruling hierarchy the Imam was considered the supreme judge. The latter ordered that he be executed as a rebel against the kingdom who had grievously violated the protection agreement between the Zaydi state and the Jews, although in the history of Yemen Jewry only few cases are known of execution of Jews by the ruler.' <sup id="cite_ref-681" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-681">[681]</a></sup> 'Only then, apparently before the release of Naqqash from Qamaran island, were the leaders of the Jewish communities held in SCidah freed, "after suffering and large ransom", as Hamami writes on the New Moon of Second Adar in 1980 SE (1669), but without mention of the release of Naqqash. According to Hibshush,'OO the Jewish leaders remained in prison "a whole year, until the ministers of the land saved them, speaking reassuring and favourable words to the king".' <sup id="cite_ref-682" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-682">[682]</a></sup> 'Various natural disasters, especially a severe drought. that struck Yemen in the years following the execution of Jamal reinforced the opinion among Ihe Muslims in Yemen that the country was being punished for the act. For their part the Jews worked 10 spread and estab· Iish this view. II was also reported that a certain Jewish leader lOl vowed to take Muslim property to compensate for what the Imam Isma'il had confiscated from the Jews. It is related that he actually did so by means of witchcraft that destroyed Muslim propeny and harmed their villages and fields. 102 From a Hebrew source at our disposal, a lament by Shelo~ mo ben Ho!er al_'Uzayri,IOJ we learn that the reference is to the serious drought that occurred in 1669 throughout Yemen. This calamity struck the Jews in panicular, not only on account of the economic structure of the country, in which they were chiefly anisans remote from farming, but also owing to their poverty resulting from the heavy fines imposed on them and the expropriation of their property two years previously. The government, as was its wont, exploited these terrible circumstances, and did not supply the Jews with grain from its stores unless they convened. And indeed, as Hamami,l04 "about five hundred or more of Israel altered their faith, and it was as the generation of apostasy owing to the poverty that was from the start and owing to the famine that visited the earth", 'Uzayri points out not only the great famine but also the wandering of the Jews from place (0 place in search of food, and the decrees imposed on them by the "kingdom of evil" precisely at the time of their woe.' <sup id="cite_ref-683" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-683">[683]</a></sup> 'Some attenuation in the acts of repression against the Jews seems to have taken place towards the end of the life of the Imam Isma'il. In 1084 of the Hijrah (beginning 18 April 1673), he decided to release the propeny of the Jews that had been taken from them six years before. However. he imposed other taxes on the Jews in addition to the jizyah. 'OS The death of 15m3'11 and the ascent to power of his nephew alMahdi Ahmad ibn Hasan sparked the hope among the Jews of Yemen that an end to their suffering had come at last. An expression of this is three poems written by Shabazi in honour of this imam. '06 For our purpose of importance is the third poem, in which Shabazi says (translation from Arabic): "[...J In the rule of Ahmad I travelled peacefully and securely. My song is ended and my words are sealed with greetings of peace, may it embrace the seed of the Imam; there is nothing beyond them except the Messiah".' <sup id="cite_ref-684" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-684">[684]</a></sup> 'But the Jews of Yemen learned immediately that the cup of their suffering had not been filled by the execution, the imprisonment, the extra taxation, the fines, the confiscation of property and the discriminatory laws against them. The principal sources for this period are the Arabic chronicles and the legal opinions of the Muslim sages in Yemen regarding the settlement of the Jews in that country, as well as Shabazi's poems and Yihye Salin's Megillar Ternan. It emerges from Shabazi's poems107 that there was unremining pressure by the Zaydi government on the Jews to convert, and the Decree of the Orphans was renewed. lOB More important for the sUbject under review are the Arabic sources, because they reveal that the Imam Isma'il had already resolved to expel the Jews from Yemen, having concluded from the consequences of the messianic activity that their presence there was not beneficial for Islam and the Yemeni people. 109 The Qagi Shams ai-Islam Ahmad ibn ,Salin ibn abi al-Rijal writes in his opinion on the subject of the expulsion of the Jews thaI Isma'i1 commanded Ihis, and thaI in his own "holy scripl" he wrOle a will on his sickbed close 10 his death 1676, whose essence was Ihat the Jews of Yemen no longer enjoyed any protection by Ihe state and that it was obligatory to expel them from Yemen, Isma'il also willed thai no accounl be taken of any legal authorily, whoever he may be, who argued against the plain interpretation of Ihe hadirh allributed to Muhammad regarding the expulsion of the Jews from the Arabian Peninsula.' <sup id="cite_ref-685" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-685">[685]</a></sup> 'The Imam Isma'il therefore cited previous discussions on the settlement of the Jews in Yemen, and he wished to dismiss any interpretation that would permit their continued settlement. However, for various reasons, apparently economic in the main-the poverty of the country following the droughts-the heads of the Muslims from the family of the prophet Muhammad. the Sadah. succeeded in persuading Isma'il to act moderately, and at least (0 postpone the expulsion order for a certain period of time. Isma'il did not yield completely: although he gave up the idea of expulsion he requested the Muslim leaders who came to visit him during his illness to destroy the synagogues that had been built in Yemen; the intention was apparently those built after the rise of Islam; whose construction was forbidden in the terms of the protection.' <sup id="cite_ref-686" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-686">[686]</a></sup> 'Isma'il did not live to carry out what he desired, but his political testament was binding on his successor, Imam Ahmad. The latter, who like his predecessor was a great zaydi conqueror and expansionist, began to execute the will. On 28 September 1677 an order was sent by the Imam to the man who was eventually to inherit the crown of the imamate, Isma'il's son "Izz aI-Islam Muhammad,ll" on the expulsion of the Jews and the destruction of their synagogues. After giving the order he undertook discussions with the sages of Islam in San'a so as to win their support for the expulsion, which he then ascertained was a matter for controversy among the sages. On the other hand, all were agreed regarding the demolition of the synagogues. So that same year, 1677, the synagogue in San'a was locked up and those in the ai-Sawn area, northwest of San'a, were destroyed.' <sup id="cite_ref-687" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-687">[687]</a></sup> 'Recently additional evidence has been published on the destruction of the synagogues in Yemen in those years, and this seems to indicate that these acts were restricted to the winter of 1678: "The razing of the synagogue of SUsan on the fourth day of the week which is third day of the year 1989 [SE-1678], and the enemie,s forbade us to gather as a quorum of ten for prayer and three scrolls of law were slashed to pieces. May He in His mercy save us and all Israel from all the decrees".' <sup id="cite_ref-688" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-688">[688]</a></sup> 'The consultations on the expulsion of the Jews were prolonged, the basic question being, as stated, if the prophet Muhammad had commanded the expulsion of the Jews from the entire Arabian Peninsula or from the Hijaz alone. liB Finally the Imam Ahmad resolved to implement the expulsion as a matter subject to the discretion of the ruler. as was the opinion of the Qadi ibn abi al_Rijal. l19 The 1ewish sources relate that the Jews were given the chance of converting to Islam in order to forestall the expulsion decree, an offer that they spumed, and that at first the intention was to deport them to the coast of Africa, beyond the Yemen borders. but through the intervention of Muslims close to the government the Imam Ahmad agreed to their expulsion to the Mawza' region in western Yemen near the pon of Mocha. And indeed, in 1679, about three years after Ahmad's succession, the Jews were expelled from all pans of Yemen to Mawza' _ Again, through the agency of the factors mentioned above, on account of the need for Jews in the country's economy as artisans and small traders, they were allowed to return from exile, albeit not to the same quarters and houses, but to new abodes near the cities yet outside the walls; the situation was similar regarding villages. l20 The construction of synagogues was no longer penniued and worship was conducted in private homes converted into prayer houses. In October 1679, after the Jews began their journey into exile, the Imam Ahmad ordered the doors of the San'a synagogue. which had been locked in 1676, to be opened; he took away the books and poured oul the wine kept in its storerooms. On the advice of ',Izz alIslam Muhammad ben Isma'i1 the synagogue was tom down, and in its stead a mosque was built, and given the name masjid al-jala' ("the mosque of the exile").' <sup id="cite_ref-689" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-689">[689]</a></sup></dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Ideological thought equates men and women ♣ [present; absent] ♥</b> “Both supporters and critics of Islam turn to the Qur'an, sunna, and Islamic law to justify their claims about Islam's stance towards women. For more than a millennium, differing interpretive traditions have employed these sources to address and settle disagreements over issues.//As with Judaism and Christianity, gender is an inherent aspect of God's plan for humanity from the first humans. However, unlike her Judeo-Christian counterpart, the Qur'anic Eve (unnamed in the Qur'an, but identified as hawwa' in later sources) is not responsible for tempting Adam into eating the forbidden fruit, which results in their expulsion; they are equally responsible. Furthermore, Islam does not have a doctrine of original sin; Adam and Eve's punishment does not extend to future generations, nor is Eve's role explicitly linked to future women—though medieval scholars, such as al-Tabari, have argued that Eve was solely culpable and that her role reveals women's deficiencies (Stowasser, 1994).//The Qur'an explicitly states that men and women have equal religious responsibility before God and that male and female believers will be rewarded equally (33:35, 40:8). However, in other realms they have differentiated roles and rights. In some cases women have lesser positions than men. For example, two women's testimonies are equivalent to that of a single man (2:282), men have authority over their wives and may discipline them in the case of disobedience (nushuz, 4:34), women typically inherit less than male relatives (4:7–20), and polygamy is permitted under certain circumstances (4:3). However, the Qur'an provides some protections explicitly for women. For example, a bride directly receives the dower (mahr, 4:4), husbands are required to provide maintenance (nafaqa) for their wives (2:233), and husbands should treat their wives kindly (4:19).//Contemporary feminist scholars, particularly Fatima Mernissi (1991), have been critical of the treatment of women in the hadith literature, especially when stripped of its historical context. Mernissi argues that much of the hadith literature stands in contrast to the equality of the Qur'an and the experience of Muhammad's wives, and therefore the authenticity and chains of transmission of certain ahadith, such as the hijab and injunctions against women's political leadership, must be re-examined. Leila Ahmed (1992) undertakes such an explanation, contextualizing the relation between religion and gender in space and across time.//The interpretation and application of the Qur'an and sunna in legal matters is dependent upon a variety of factors, including the legal school, particulars of a given case, and the socio-historical context. While there is a measure of consensus between the four major Sunni schools of jurisprudence, they vary on particulars ranging from a wife's potential recourses if her husband is unable to provide her maintenance to what constitutes equitable treatment in a polygamous marriage. An important distinction between the Sunni schools of jurisprudence and Ithna 'Ashari (Twelver) Shiism is the former's explicit rejection of temporary marriage (mut'ah). In analyzing whether women are disadvantaged in comparison to men in Islamic law, Judith Tucker (2008) concludes that women's status varies substantially between issues. While women have less freedom than men to independently initiate marriage or divorce, Islamic law largely guarantees the property rights of both married and unmarried women and imposes safeguards in the case of divorce.//A key issue in Islamic exegesis is how much of Qur'anic and hadith material relates specifically to Muhammad's wives (Mothers of the Believers, Ummahat al-Mu'minūn) and how much can be generalized as normative practice for all Muslim women. For example, the Qur'an indicates the special status of Muhammad's wives (33:32), and they were under certain restrictions such as not remarrying after Muhammad's death (33:52), stipulations that were not obviously applicable to other Muslim women. Another issue revolves around veiling, concerning the exact manner in which women should dress and whether veiling was a requirement of all Muslim women or merely Muhammad's wives. [...]Ahmed (1991) argues that the rise of the Abbasid dynasty, influenced by Persian and Byzantine practices, represented a decisive turning point for gender equality in public life. Among elite families, the seclusion of women and concubinage became increasingly common.” <sup id="cite_ref-690" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-690">[690]</a></sup> In Yemen, wives were in a weaker legal position than husbands in the case of divorce: 'Islamic law and custom guide contemporary Yemeni marriages, although government regulations establishing ceilings on bride-price are often ignored. The legal marriage age of 16 for girls is also difficult to regulate because births are not routinely recorded. Arranged marriages prevail, but women do have veto power over a prospective groom. Fewer than 5 percent of Yemeni males exercise their option as Muslims to have up to four wives. The difficulty of supporting multiple wives equitably, as Islamic law requires, as well as the high cost of getting married, probably discourages polygyny. Divorce can be accomplished by men with far fewer restrictions than are imposed on women. Customarily, wives (through fathers or brothers) must remunerate their husbands if they wish to terminate the marriage. Legally, fathers' rights to the children after divorce supersede those of mothers.' <sup id="cite_ref-691" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-691">[691]</a></sup> Veiling was common in the North: 'The traditional nature of Yemeni society is reflected in choices of attire, though the native dress of Yemen differs somewhat from that found in other conservative parts of the Arabian Peninsula. Men sometimes wear the full-length, loose-fitting thawb-frequently with a jacket over it-but more often the traditional fūṭah, a saronglike wraparound kilt, is worn with a shirt. The turban is a common type of head covering, and a finely woven bamboo hat (shaped somewhat like a fez) called a kofiya (or kofia) is a more formal choice of headgear. There are various forms of dress for women, depending on the social role a woman plays and where she lives. In North Yemen, women in cities and towns wore the sharsaf, a black skirt, scarf, and veil ensemble that covers the entire body. In South Yemen, the regime that succeeded the British after 1967 vigorously opposed this women's dress code, and this opposition prevailed especially in the towns and cities. In the countryside, clothing for women tends to be somewhat more utilitarian and may consist of a dress or robe that provides for a greater range of movement and under which, in some parts of Yemen, it is not uncommon for a woman to wear a pair of loose slacks known as a sirwāl. Also in the countryside, a woman's face may or may not be covered, and dresses are sometimes sewn from brightly coloured fabric. Working women frequently wear a broad-brimmed straw hat (dhola) to ward off the sun.' <sup id="cite_ref-692" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-692">[692]</a></sup> Labour was divided along gender lines: 'Women preside over the work of the household, which may be comprised of blood relatives, neighbors, and members of client or servant groups in families of high social status. Women are valued members of the household unit as agricultural producers and are also crucial to the maintenance of the Yemeni ideal of domestic hospitality.' <sup id="cite_ref-693" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-693">[693]</a></sup></dd>

The majority of them cannot pray, or pray incorrectly.... He who does not practice prayer properly is a mere infidel . . .

Gellner 198 I), the lack and the antithesis of a civilization whose centre. is San'a', In slightly later San'ani chronicles (al-Sayaghi 1978; al-Hibshi 1980) one is treated to a chorus of invective against these tribes-these 'followers of the taghut', 'dogs', murdererswho swirl around and sometimes plunder 'San'a' the protected of God' with no explicit reason but the Imamate's weakness and what seems their own inhe~ent wickedness.

Zaydism was established in Yemen by the imam Yahya al-Hadi (d. 911), a descendant of Ali's son Hasan who migrated from Medina to Yemen late in the ninth century and established his capital at the northern highland city of Sada. Unlike Ismaili or Twelver Shiite doctrine, Zaydi theology posits an active, visible imam, or leader of the Muslim community, descended from either Hasan or his brother Husayn, who is learned in the religious sciences and who publicly proves himself worthy of leading the Muslim community, in battle if necessary. What this has meant in Yemeni history is that scions of numerous lines of Hasanid and, less frequently, Husaynid descendants have proclaimed their dawas, or "calls"-occasionally simultaneously, so that the supporters of one line were obliged to fight it out with supporters of another.' <sup id="cite_ref-695" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-695">[695]</a></sup></dd>

(See Mahra Sultanate.) On the Tihāmah coastal plain, in-migrations from Ethiopia and Somalia have occurred over many centuries. There is a clear African admixture in the coastal population as well as a distinct social group known as the Akhdām, who perform menial tasks and are the closest thing to a caste in Yemen. In the far north there are still small remnants of the once-large Jewish communities (most migrated to Israel after 1948), while in the area of Aden and the eastern regions there are distinct Somali, Indonesian, and Indian elements in the population, legacies of the British colonial era as well of economic and political ties extending back over two millennia.'<sup id="cite_ref-700" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-700">[700]</a></sup> The intersection of low social status with the performance of 'impure' and subservient economic roles and the role of ethnicity in this process seem to justify coding this variable for the more hierarchical option. Furthermore, Jews were violently persecuted after the emergence of a Messianic movement. The codebook does not currently provide a category for status discrimination based on religion, but religion and ethnicity could be considered to intersect in the case of the Yemeni Jewish community. Tobi provides a historical description of repressive measures directed at Jews: 'In 1629 power in San'a was retaken by the native populalion after the Turks were driven out by the sons of the Zaydi Imam al-Qasim, who had firsl risen in revolt against them at the end of the previous century. While the Jews did not live at ease under Turkish rule, especially in its last years, as attested by Shalom Shabazi in his commentary to the Pentateuch liemdat Yamim,7 their lot deteriorated under the Zaydi yoke. The latter were religious fanatics and far stricter than the Sunni Ottomans (of the Hanafi school) in their treatment of Jews as ahl aidhimmah. 8 But to the religious facet was added the national facet, for the new Zaydi rulers accused the Jews of siding with the infidel Turks.' <sup id="cite_ref-701" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-701">[701]</a></sup> 'Religious ardour apparently intensified in particular under al-Qasim's son, the Imam Ism3'il al-Mutawakkil, who took power in 1644 and who was zealously religious. 'o Despite all the foregoing, there is no evidence whatever in the Jewish sources that at a certain date prior to the events associated with Shabbetay Zevi in 1667 acts of repression were carried out against the Jews of Yemen. On the other hand, according to various sources the latter expected the coming of the Messiah in the course of the seventeenth century, from the year 1619 on. This was connected with the appearance of two comets that year, according to Yisrael HaKohen of Qubayrah, the city of the priests in the Shar'ab province in southern Yemen.' <sup id="cite_ref-702" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-702">[702]</a></sup> 'In the years immediately following 1619 the Jews of Yemen encountered great distress in the form of apostasy and incarceration and tonure at the hands of the Turkish rulers, worsened by the starvation resuhing from this and from a plague of locusts. Among the casualties were Yosef ben Avigad, Shabazi's father, and members of his family, as he relates in the sequel to the account of the comets in 1619. These harsh events were perceived as the birth-pangs preceding the advent of the Messiah, as indicated by the writing of zakharyah Ha-Zidoni, who in 1626 (1937 of the SE) expected the arrival of the Messiah in 1940 of the SE ("'In the year 1940 You shall accomplish vengeance") (a pun in Hebrew on the number of the year and the word for vengeance).

The straitened circumstances of the Yemeni ex.ile also become clear from the interpretation of the verse in Psalms 70:20: "In our exile we suffer from three calamities, the first is persecutions, wandering and slavery; the second is agony, poverty and humiliation; the third is war, abuse and famine" (p, 136), Moreover, from the author's vision of the future status of the Jews of Yemen following redemption something may be learned of their humiliation and resentment stemming from the special ta:&lt; they had to pay for protection by the Muslim ruler: "When the Messiah from the tribe of Ephrayim will appear [.,,] [in the year 5426 [1666J the [Arab] king [...] who was wandering in the desert [...] will distribule letters all over his kingdom 10 enhance the Jews [",] hoping to find reSI and peace and ease to his nation of the known nalion" (the Jews, p, 110), "The Lord will send a spirit in the tongue of every king and governor to announce in the markets and in the streets, saying: Peace. peace for Israel, they shall not pay any more mindah, bela and halakh06 (p. 138).' <sup id="cite_ref-706" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-706">[706]</a></sup> 'Elsewhere in the work it transpires that in fact during the rule of al-Mutawakkil Isma'il, cases of apostasy mulliplied under threat of persecution and by decree: these are the birth pangs of the Messiah and a hidden means of discovering if indeed there is complete repentance that will justify redemption (pp. 114-115).' <sup id="cite_ref-707" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-707">[707]</a></sup> 'We have observed above that the belief in Shabbetay Zevi in Yemen propagated mainly among the ordinary folk, while the leaders of the San'a community at least, the President Naqqash and the head of the rabbinical court Yihye Ha-Levi, were skeptical about i1.68 As we shall see below, these reservations on the part of these two, and apparently of other leaders in the San'a and other communities, are what saved them from the unnatural death that was the lot of Siayman Jamal.' <sup id="cite_ref-708" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-708">[708]</a></sup> 'A contemporary Yemeni Muslim writer, 'Abd Allah ibn'Ali ibn al· Wazir, was the author of Iibtiq al-liulwti wa-Jihtif ai-Man wa·l-Salwa. Relating to the year 1077 of the Hijrah (beginning 4 July 1666), he sets out extremely important details on the messianic activity in Yemen that year.69 He states that it began in the month Rajab 1077 of the Hijrah, that is, January 1667. Presumably some time passed, at least several months, between the actual start of messianic activity in Yemen and the moment when the Muslims began to take note of it. The Muslim chronicle states, and this is borne out by what we know from the Hebrew sources, that the Jews sold their possessions cheaply and made preparations for their ascent to the Land of Israel, as the Messiah had been revealed.' <sup id="cite_ref-709" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-709">[709]</a></sup> 'This activity brought about an immediate response by the Qa.gi of San'a, Shiha.b aI-Din al-Maswari, who was responsible for public order in the city. He approached the Imam Isma'il, who resided in Sudah,73 for guidance on how to deal with the matter, for the very existence of a messianic movement was perceived by the rulers as a revolt, not only among the Jews but also, and perhaps especially, among the Muslims, principally the Shafi'is in the south and west of Yemen who were ruled by the zaydis. This was because the nature of a messianic movement was to alter the order of government. Nor was this entirely impossible, for we know of the Jewish false Messiah of 1495 in Hadramawt who got up a sizable anny and fought against the Tahiri ru,;,ii The Imam's reply is not known exactly, but its gist was that the actions of the Jews constituted a violation of the laws of protection granted them by the Islamic Slate, an act that released the state from maintaining the protection. The significance of this ruling was that Jewish blood and property were now free for all. because the state was not obliged to protect them. And in fact, as the chronicler relates, after word of the Imam's decision spread, among other places in Kawkaban and Shibam to the northwest of San'a, where there were Jewish communities, the Jewish wives were raped and their goods and property plundered. The rumours continued to spread to the northeast, to the tribal population. A group of men from the Hamdan tribes hastened to San'a to attack the Jews of the city. But its governor, Jamal ai-Din 'Ali ibn al-Mu'ayyad, prevented this act and also punished those who had robbed the Jews, on the grounds that the Imam had not ordered the pillaging even though the Jews' lives and property were unguarded as they had broken the conditions of the protection. The government certainly wished to prevent the actions of the tribes in San'a itself out of fear that hann would befall the entire population, including the Muslims. In general, the governor did not wish to have his authority weakened by actions over which he had no control.' <sup id="cite_ref-710" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-710">[710]</a></sup> 'According to ibn al-Wazir, the stonn abated and the Imam took no funher steps against the Jews. But the Jews themselves, that is, those who held the messianic belief. exploited this time of calm and continued their messianic activity not only in secret but openly, There is no doubt that the official leaders of the San'a community did not participate, except for a certain group headed by one of its sages. The Muslim chronicler relates that in the course of a wine-drinking feast a member of this group became intoxicated and his companions dressed him in the finest garments. This may have been an indication of the messianic aspirations of that individual, as we shall see below. In any event, this man climbed up to the largest fortress of San'a, situated in the eastern outskirts of the city, and attempted to ascend to the throne and the canopy in the fortress, that is, to become ruler of the Muslims. He even made the outspoken demand that the Muslim commanders and soldiers in the fortress place themselves under his command. But instead the latter arrested the man and threw him into the Bustan prison in the city. The Imam was infonned of what had transpired. and he ordered the prisoner to be taken out and executed.' <sup id="cite_ref-711" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-711">[711]</a></sup> 'Be that as it may, the response of the Imam Isma'il al this slage was far harsher than at the previous stage, for now it was a matter of actual insurrection, even though il was instigated by a man whose political strength was apparently very slight. It seems that the messianic activity was not limited 10 the San'a Jewish community alone. The Imam in Sudah heard of the events not only from the governors of San'a and other cities but also from the tribal chiefs.79 Isma'il summoned the Jewish leaders from the major centres at that time, San'a and tlamdah,so and interrogated them. As they could not deny the event, even though they were not devotees of the messiah, he decided to take drastic action against the Jewish communities, no doubt on the assumption that the Jews had violated the conditions of the protection agreement between the Islamic government and themselves by rebelling against the former. Instructions went out from Sudah to all the cities of Yemen and its provinces to strike at the Jews. And sure enough, the orders were fulfilled by the Imam's own troops dispatched from SGdah and presumably by local populations everywhere. But Ism3'il did not stop at this. It seems that he decided to enforce against the Jews the laws of discrimination that were practiced in other Islamic countries but had never been applied under Zaydi rule in Yemen since its beginning at the end of the ninth century.SI The main Hebrew source, Hamami. mentions only two matters: one is the confiscation by the slate of all Jewish property in Yemen, movable goods and real estate, and the regulation that hence· forward the Jews were forbidden to own land; the second is the decree banning the wearing by Jews of turban, or headdresses.82 Of all the decrees and persecution connected with the Sabbatean events in Yemen. some of which are still to be described below, the ban on headdresses became the symbol of the precariousness of the position and rights of the Jews of Yemen, and the entire episode is called by them and in their writings "the headdress decree" (gezerat ha- 'atarot).' <sup id="cite_ref-712" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-712">[712]</a></sup> 'The leaders of the Jewish communities were arrested and tortured in several prisons, and the sentence of death hovered over lhem. As usual in cases of this kind in Yemen, Jews so sentenced were offered their lives in return for conversion to Islam;84 but the offer was rejected.l.S Naqqash, the nagid of the San'a community, was exiled to Qamaran86 in the Red Sea, a mostly deserted island populated by a few fishermen and a handful of villagers who made their living by pearl diving87 and which was used as a prison island for political offenders.88 He remained imprisoned and shackled for two years and only lhen was he released and returned to San'a.89 During the Mawza' exile, in 1679, he was still officiating as the nagid of the San'a community.90 It appears that his release was due to the fact that like other leaders of the San'a and other communities he had not supported the messianic move-ment in Yemen at that time.' <sup id="cite_ref-713" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-713">[713]</a></sup> 'In contrast to this the fate of Jamal was far more bitter. When called before the governor of San'a, not the Imam Isma'il in Sfidah, during the Passover festival in 1667, he apparently did not deny his messianic belief. After arrest and torture "in a place beneath the ground,,91 he was handed over to "a second king in whose hand he used to place the tax", probably the'Amil of San' a, who was in charge of collecting the jizyah tax from the Jews and who therefore bore responsibility for them, and he too "locked him in a place of snakes and scorpions". They sent from San'a to the Imam asking him what to do with Jamal, since in the Zaydi ruling hierarchy the Imam was considered the supreme judge. The latter ordered that he be executed as a rebel against the kingdom who had grievously violated the protection agreement between the Zaydi state and the Jews, although in the history of Yemen Jewry only few cases are known of execution of Jews by the ruler.' <sup id="cite_ref-714" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-714">[714]</a></sup> 'Only then, apparently before the release of Naqqash from Qamaran island, were the leaders of the Jewish communities held in SCidah freed, "after suffering and large ransom", as Hamami writes on the New Moon of Second Adar in 1980 SE (1669), but without mention of the release of Naqqash.

For their part the Jews worked 10 spread and estab· Iish this view. II was also reported that a certain Jewish leader lOl vowed to take Muslim property to compensate for what the Imam Isma'il had confiscated from the Jews. It is related that he actually did so by means of witchcraft that destroyed Muslim propeny and harmed their villages and fields. 102 From a Hebrew source at our disposal, a lament by Shelo~ mo ben Ho!er al_'Uzayri,IOJ we learn that the reference is to the serious drought that occurred in 1669 throughout Yemen. This calamity struck the Jews in panicular, not only on account of the economic structure of the country, in which they were chiefly anisans remote from farming, but also owing to their poverty resulting from the heavy fines imposed on them and the expropriation of their property two years previously. The government, as was its wont, exploited these terrible circumstances, and did not supply the Jews with grain from its stores unless they convened. And indeed, as Hamami,l04 "about five hundred or more of Israel altered their faith, and it was as the generation of apostasy owing to the poverty that was from the start and owing to the famine that visited the earth", 'Uzayri points out not only the great famine but also the wandering of the Jews from place (0 place in search of food, and the decrees imposed on them by the "kingdom of evil" precisely at the time of their woe.' <sup id="cite_ref-716" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-716">[716]</a></sup> 'Some attenuation in the acts of repression against the Jews seems to have taken place towards the end of the life of the Imam Isma'il. In 1084 of the Hijrah (beginning 18 April 1673), he decided to release the propeny of the Jews that had been taken from them six years before. However. he imposed other taxes on the Jews in addition to the jizyah. 'OS The death of 15m3'11 and the ascent to power of his nephew alMahdi Ahmad ibn Hasan sparked the hope among the Jews of Yemen that an end to their suffering had come at last. An expression of this is three poems written by Shabazi in honour of this imam. '06 For our purpose of importance is the third poem, in which Shabazi says (translation from Arabic): "[...J In the rule of Ahmad I travelled peacefully and securely. My song is ended and my words are sealed with greetings of peace, may it embrace the seed of the Imam; there is nothing beyond them except the Messiah".' <sup id="cite_ref-717" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-717">[717]</a></sup> 'But the Jews of Yemen learned immediately that the cup of their suffering had not been filled by the execution, the imprisonment, the extra taxation, the fines, the confiscation of property and the discriminatory laws against them. The principal sources for this period are the Arabic chronicles and the legal opinions of the Muslim sages in Yemen regarding the settlement of the Jews in that country, as well as Shabazi's poems and Yihye Salin's Megillar Ternan. It emerges from Shabazi's poems107 that there was unremining pressure by the Zaydi government on the Jews to convert, and the Decree of the Orphans was renewed. lOB More important for the sUbject under review are the Arabic sources, because they reveal that the Imam Isma'il had already resolved to expel the Jews from Yemen, having concluded from the consequences of the messianic activity that their presence there was not beneficial for Islam and the Yemeni people. 109 The Qagi Shams ai-Islam Ahmad ibn ,Salin ibn abi al-Rijal writes in his opinion on the subject of the expulsion of the Jews thaI Isma'i1 commanded Ihis, and thaI in his own "holy scripl" he wrOle a will on his sickbed close 10 his death 1676, whose essence was Ihat the Jews of Yemen no longer enjoyed any protection by Ihe state and that it was obligatory to expel them from Yemen, Isma'il also willed thai no accounl be taken of any legal authorily, whoever he may be, who argued against the plain interpretation of Ihe hadirh allributed to Muhammad regarding the expulsion of the Jews from the Arabian Peninsula.' <sup id="cite_ref-718" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-718">[718]</a></sup> 'The Imam Isma'il therefore cited previous discussions on the settlement of the Jews in Yemen, and he wished to dismiss any interpretation that would permit their continued settlement. However, for various reasons, apparently economic in the main-the poverty of the country following the droughts-the heads of the Muslims from the family of the prophet Muhammad. the Sadah. succeeded in persuading Isma'il to act moderately, and at least (0 postpone the expulsion order for a certain period of time. Isma'il did not yield completely: although he gave up the idea of expulsion he requested the Muslim leaders who came to visit him during his illness to destroy the synagogues that had been built in Yemen; the intention was apparently those built after the rise of Islam; whose construction was forbidden in the terms of the protection.' <sup id="cite_ref-719" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-719">[719]</a></sup> 'Isma'il did not live to carry out what he desired, but his political testament was binding on his successor, Imam Ahmad. The latter, who like his predecessor was a great zaydi conqueror and expansionist, began to execute the will. On 28 September 1677 an order was sent by the Imam to the man who was eventually to inherit the crown of the imamate, Isma'il's son "Izz aI-Islam Muhammad,ll" on the expulsion of the Jews and the destruction of their synagogues. After giving the order he undertook discussions with the sages of Islam in San'a so as to win their support for the expulsion, which he then ascertained was a matter for controversy among the sages. On the other hand, all were agreed regarding the demolition of the synagogues. So that same year, 1677, the synagogue in San'a was locked up and those in the ai-Sawn area, northwest of San'a, were destroyed.' <sup id="cite_ref-720" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-720">[720]</a></sup> 'Recently additional evidence has been published on the destruction of the synagogues in Yemen in those years, and this seems to indicate that these acts were restricted to the winter of 1678: "The razing of the synagogue of SUsan on the fourth day of the week which is third day of the year 1989 [SE-1678], and the enemie,s forbade us to gather as a quorum of ten for prayer and three scrolls of law were slashed to pieces. May He in His mercy save us and all Israel from all the decrees".' <sup id="cite_ref-721" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-721">[721]</a></sup> 'The consultations on the expulsion of the Jews were prolonged, the basic question being, as stated, if the prophet Muhammad had commanded the expulsion of the Jews from the entire Arabian Peninsula or from the Hijaz alone. liB Finally the Imam Ahmad resolved to implement the expulsion as a matter subject to the discretion of the ruler. as was the opinion of the Qadi ibn abi al_Rijal. l19 The 1ewish sources relate that the Jews were given the chance of converting to Islam in order to forestall the expulsion decree, an offer that they spumed, and that at first the intention was to deport them to the coast of Africa, beyond the Yemen borders. but through the intervention of Muslims close to the government the Imam Ahmad agreed to their expulsion to the Mawza' region in western Yemen near the pon of Mocha. And indeed, in 1679, about three years after Ahmad's succession, the Jews were expelled from all pans of Yemen to Mawza' _ Again, through the agency of the factors mentioned above, on account of the need for Jews in the country's economy as artisans and small traders, they were allowed to return from exile, albeit not to the same quarters and houses, but to new abodes near the cities yet outside the walls; the situation was similar regarding villages. l20 The construction of synagogues was no longer penniued and worship was conducted in private homes converted into prayer houses. In October 1679, after the Jews began their journey into exile, the Imam Ahmad ordered the doors of the San'a synagogue. which had been locked in 1676, to be opened; he took away the books and poured oul the wine kept in its storerooms. On the advice of ',Izz alIslam Muhammad ben Isma'i1 the synagogue was tom down, and in its stead a mosque was built, and given the name masjid al-jala' ("the mosque of the exile").' <sup id="cite_ref-722" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-722">[722]</a></sup></dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Ideological thought distinguishes men and women ♣ [present; absent] ♥</b> “Both supporters and critics of Islam turn to the Qur'an, sunna, and Islamic law to justify their claims about Islam's stance towards women. For more than a millennium, differing interpretive traditions have employed these sources to address and settle disagreements over issues.//As with Judaism and Christianity, gender is an inherent aspect of God's plan for humanity from the first humans. However, unlike her Judeo-Christian counterpart, the Qur'anic Eve (unnamed in the Qur'an, but identified as hawwa' in later sources) is not responsible for tempting Adam into eating the forbidden fruit, which results in their expulsion; they are equally responsible. Furthermore, Islam does not have a doctrine of original sin; Adam and Eve's punishment does not extend to future generations, nor is Eve's role explicitly linked to future women—though medieval scholars, such as al-Tabari, have argued that Eve was solely culpable and that her role reveals women's deficiencies (Stowasser, 1994).//The Qur'an explicitly states that men and women have equal religious responsibility before God and that male and female believers will be rewarded equally (33:35, 40:8). However, in other realms they have differentiated roles and rights. In some cases women have lesser positions than men. For example, two women's testimonies are equivalent to that of a single man (2:282), men have authority over their wives and may discipline them in the case of disobedience (nushuz, 4:34), women typically inherit less than male relatives (4:7–20), and polygamy is permitted under certain circumstances (4:3). However, the Qur'an provides some protections explicitly for women. For example, a bride directly receives the dower (mahr, 4:4), husbands are required to provide maintenance (nafaqa) for their wives (2:233), and husbands should treat their wives kindly (4:19).//Contemporary feminist scholars, particularly Fatima Mernissi (1991), have been critical of the treatment of women in the hadith literature, especially when stripped of its historical context. Mernissi argues that much of the hadith literature stands in contrast to the equality of the Qur'an and the experience of Muhammad's wives, and therefore the authenticity and chains of transmission of certain ahadith, such as the hijab and injunctions against women's political leadership, must be re-examined. Leila Ahmed (1992) undertakes such an explanation, contextualizing the relation between religion and gender in space and across time.//The interpretation and application of the Qur'an and sunna in legal matters is dependent upon a variety of factors, including the legal school, particulars of a given case, and the socio-historical context. While there is a measure of consensus between the four major Sunni schools of jurisprudence, they vary on particulars ranging from a wife's potential recourses if her husband is unable to provide her maintenance to what constitutes equitable treatment in a polygamous marriage. An important distinction between the Sunni schools of jurisprudence and Ithna 'Ashari (Twelver) Shiism is the former's explicit rejection of temporary marriage (mut'ah). In analyzing whether women are disadvantaged in comparison to men in Islamic law, Judith Tucker (2008) concludes that women's status varies substantially between issues. While women have less freedom than men to independently initiate marriage or divorce, Islamic law largely guarantees the property rights of both married and unmarried women and imposes safeguards in the case of divorce.//A key issue in Islamic exegesis is how much of Qur'anic and hadith material relates specifically to Muhammad's wives (Mothers of the Believers, Ummahat al-Mu'minūn) and how much can be generalized as normative practice for all Muslim women. For example, the Qur'an indicates the special status of Muhammad's wives (33:32), and they were under certain restrictions such as not remarrying after Muhammad's death (33:52), stipulations that were not obviously applicable to other Muslim women. Another issue revolves around veiling, concerning the exact manner in which women should dress and whether veiling was a requirement of all Muslim women or merely Muhammad's wives. [...]Ahmed (1991) argues that the rise of the Abbasid dynasty, influenced by Persian and Byzantine practices, represented a decisive turning point for gender equality in public life. Among elite families, the seclusion of women and concubinage became increasingly common.” <sup id="cite_ref-723" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-723">[723]</a></sup> In Yemen, wives were in a weaker legal position than husbands in the case of divorce: 'Islamic law and custom guide contemporary Yemeni marriages, although government regulations establishing ceilings on bride-price are often ignored. The legal marriage age of 16 for girls is also difficult to regulate because births are not routinely recorded. Arranged marriages prevail, but women do have veto power over a prospective groom. Fewer than 5 percent of Yemeni males exercise their option as Muslims to have up to four wives. The difficulty of supporting multiple wives equitably, as Islamic law requires, as well as the high cost of getting married, probably discourages polygyny. Divorce can be accomplished by men with far fewer restrictions than are imposed on women. Customarily, wives (through fathers or brothers) must remunerate their husbands if they wish to terminate the marriage. Legally, fathers' rights to the children after divorce supersede those of mothers.' <sup id="cite_ref-724" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-724">[724]</a></sup> Veiling was common in the North: 'The traditional nature of Yemeni society is reflected in choices of attire, though the native dress of Yemen differs somewhat from that found in other conservative parts of the Arabian Peninsula. Men sometimes wear the full-length, loose-fitting thawb-frequently with a jacket over it-but more often the traditional fūṭah, a saronglike wraparound kilt, is worn with a shirt. The turban is a common type of head covering, and a finely woven bamboo hat (shaped somewhat like a fez) called a kofiya (or kofia) is a more formal choice of headgear. There are various forms of dress for women, depending on the social role a woman plays and where she lives. In North Yemen, women in cities and towns wore the sharsaf, a black skirt, scarf, and veil ensemble that covers the entire body. In South Yemen, the regime that succeeded the British after 1967 vigorously opposed this women's dress code, and this opposition prevailed especially in the towns and cities. In the countryside, clothing for women tends to be somewhat more utilitarian and may consist of a dress or robe that provides for a greater range of movement and under which, in some parts of Yemen, it is not uncommon for a woman to wear a pair of loose slacks known as a sirwāl. Also in the countryside, a woman's face may or may not be covered, and dresses are sometimes sewn from brightly coloured fabric. Working women frequently wear a broad-brimmed straw hat (dhola) to ward off the sun.' <sup id="cite_ref-725" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-725">[725]</a></sup> Labour was divided along gender lines: 'Women preside over the work of the household, which may be comprised of blood relatives, neighbors, and members of client or servant groups in families of high social status. Women are valued members of the household unit as agricultural producers and are also crucial to the maintenance of the Yemeni ideal of domestic hospitality.' <sup id="cite_ref-726" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-726">[726]</a></sup></dd>

If they see someone practice ijtihiid in prayer, by lifting his hands or joining them on his chest or [tucking his feet beneath] his thighs, they condemn him for it, and violence has occurred on account of this. They get together and go to the mosques where one of the 'ulamii' is reading the books of Tradition and start fights there. (ibid.) This, he says, is the fault of shaytans among the learned men, who encourage factionalism.l" 'As for these brutish Arabs, most of them don't pray or fast or perform any of the duties of Islam .. .' (ibid.). This almost patrician disdain combines a particular Islamic rectitude with the conceptual geography of Yemen sketched in Chapter I; al-'Amri paraphrases al-Shawkani's view as follows: First there are those subjects (ra'iiyii) who come under the absolute control of the authority (dawlah) and submit to its orders. The majority of them cannot pray, or pray incorrectly.... He who does not practice prayer properly is a mere infidel . . . The second group consists of those of the far north and east (bilad alqiblah wa-l-mashriq) who have not come under the control of the dawlah. They are ... even worse, since they cannot read or write and they submit to the customary laws of their predecessors (a~kiim al-taghiit), instead of to the shari'ah . . . . Those who do so ... are unbelievers. The third group consists of the townspeople . . . As a result of their ignorance and indulgence, they neglect many of their duties towards God. However, they are quick and readier than others to learn and receive education; if resolved to do so. (al-'Amri 1985: 122) The northern tribes are thus the wolves beyond the walls (d. Gellner 198 I), the lack and the antithesis of a civilization whose centre. is San'a', In slightly later San'ani chronicles (al-Sayaghi 1978; al-Hibshi 1980) one is treated to a chorus of invective against these tribes-these 'followers of the taghut', 'dogs', murdererswho swirl around and sometimes plunder 'San'a' the protected of God' with no explicit reason but the Imamate's weakness and what seems their own inhe~ent wickedness.

Furthermore, we read in the same chapter of the Qur’an: ‘You will never be able to deal equally between (‘’your’’) wives, however much you may desire (‘’to do so’’)’ (4:129).’” <sup id="cite_ref-729" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-729">[729]</a></sup> 'Men may have as many as four wives at the same time, though in practice it is rare for a man to take more than one wife.' <sup id="cite_ref-730" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-730">[730]</a></sup> While polygyny was legal in principle, monogamy was the norm for most: 'Islamic law and custom guide contemporary Yemeni marriages, although government regulations establishing ceilings on bride-price are often ignored. The legal marriage age of 16 for girls is also difficult to regulate because births are not routinely recorded. Arranged marriages prevail, but women do have veto power over a prospective groom. Fewer than 5 percent of Yemeni males exercise their option as Muslims to have up to four wives. The difficulty of supporting multiple wives equitably, as Islamic law requires, as well as the high cost of getting married, probably discourages polygyny. Divorce can be accomplished by men with far fewer restrictions than are imposed on women. Customarily, wives (through fathers or brothers) must remunerate their husbands if they wish to terminate the marriage. Legally, fathers' rights to the children after divorce supersede those of mothers.' <sup id="cite_ref-731" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-731">[731]</a></sup>

<dl><dd><b>♠ charity ♣ present ♥</b> Charity, especially alms-giving is prescribed by Islam: 'As Muslims, Yemenis aspire to fulfill the five tenets of Islam: affirmation of the Islamic creed, prayer, fasting, charity, and pilgrimage.' <sup id="cite_ref-732" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-732">[732]</a></sup> Generosity was valued: 'Looking back from the early twentieth century to the great days of the Qasimis, an anonymous chronicler paints a picture of righteous patronage (al-Hibshi 1980: 300-4): "The times smiled on the people of that age, and the reason was that all of Yemen was in the hand of the state: its ports, [Lower] Yemen, Raymah, 'Utmah, and everywhere, so fodder evengrewin the lands beyondBarat ... The first thing was that the Imam followed the pure shari'ah, even as it affected himself and what he owned. Then the Shaykh al-Islam was reverenced for executing affairs in accordance with God's Book and His Prophet's usage, and no-one accusedhim of taking evena pip or a pip-skin from the parties to a case. The reason for that was that he had a fief ... which paid not less than about 1,000 qadab ... and still had al-Haymah which paid about 100 silverpieces a month. Andeveryone he knewor was close to ate with him [i.e. lived off him], and he himselfsaved nothing of what he got. After him came the sayyids of the Imam's family ... After them came the ministers, five or six of them ... everyone of whom had limitless people living with him [i.e. off his largesse] ..." And so on through the ranks (all of them ad hoc; Zaydi theory says not a word of this organization), down through the servants of servants all claiming their bread, clothes, and money from someone above them, to the lists of the great's benefactions for poor people at the several festivals. A cataract of pious largesse; and the other half of the cycle (the question of income to support this expenditure) is nowhere addressed in detail.' <sup id="cite_ref-733" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-733">[733]</a></sup> 'So far as the tribes are concerned, this need not surprise us. The complement of segmentary equality is very often the gift min allah, from God, which therefore does not require reciprocity; indeed, the position of wealthy leaders in an egalitarian system is scarcely possible without this." But here the ethic of largesse permeated the whole functioning of the state, applying equally to townsfolk and traders, peasants and tribesmen, to everyone who wished for wealth. The lines of payment all ran normal to the axis of precise reciprocity which defines tribes or sections against their neighbours, and each line thus ran parallel to the others; their arrangement in an ordered series ('all of Yemen was in the hand of the state') depended solely on the Imam's 'prestige' (haybah). With or without such subordination, however, local lines of subsidy to this tribe or that persisted, and in practice this was a period at which a distinction was made clear which one finds still in documents very close to our own time: that between tribesmen (qabii'il) and peasants (ra'iyyah), 'subjects', people who pay tax.l" It was prominent shaykhs who formed the link between the two.' <sup id="cite_ref-734" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-734">[734]</a></sup> Dresch mentions charitable donations in times of famine: 'The structure of payments was that of the state itself.

<dd><b>♠ communal dining ♣ present ♥</b> 'Yemenis celebrate the traditional Islamic holidays, including ʿĪd al-Aḍḥā (marking the culmination of the hajj rites near Mecca) and ʿĪd al-Fiṭr (marking the end of Ramadan), as well as the Prophet Muhammad's birthday. Shīʿites observe ʿĀshūrāʾ (commemorating the death of al-Ḥusayn ibn ʿAlī, the Prophet's grandson). The Day of National Unity is May 22, the day on which, in 1990, North Yemen and South Yemen were officially united. A number of other civil and religious holidays also are observed.' <sup id="cite_ref-739" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-739">[739]</a></sup> The following account was taken from a modern-period source, but may hold true for the Qasimid period as well. Communal feasting was practiced on the occasion of major holidays: 'Now let us turn our attention to the two major religious festivals in he Muslim calendar: the 'id al-kabir after the holy month of fast, Ramadan, and the 'id as-saghir that marks the end of the annaual pilgrimage to Mecca. Unfortunately, I had the opportunity to observe only one of these festivals (at the end of Ramadan) while I was in Khawland, though I was assured by tribesmen that the same rituals were enacted in both. On the first morning after the fast had been officially declared at an end, the old and young adult males of the village in which I was staying convened in the selah (flood plain) to greet each other with salutations peculiar to the 'id. The flood plain has special significance. In the Yemeni highlands most villages are built on rock outcrops that jut upwards from the wadi floor, the fertile fields surrounding them irrigated by canals that drain the wadi's plain when it is in flood, during the rainy season twice a year. The rest of the time the wadi floor is dry and used for a variety of purposes, including the transport of animals, the passage of people between villages located along the plain, as the meeting ground for tribal delegations who have been sent to a village to mediate one of its disputes, and for open-air markets that convene once a week. A mosque is usually situated at the rim of the flood plain and the village, casting its sacred canopy over these people and their activities. In short, the flood plain is a general thoroughfare bringing fertility, religious blessing, and hopefully also security. It is not surprising that the religious festival marking the transition of the fast and the beginning of a new year is held in a place saturated with the symbolism of passage, for, as Van Gennep ([1908] 1960) understood, ritual time is often symbolized by movement in space. In the cool hours of early morning on the first day after the fast, the hamlet of Bet al-Bahluli sends a delegation of adult males to march in the wadi toward the hamlet of Dhu l-Mukh, which in turn dispatches a group of adult males toward the former, the two groups meeting halfway. At the head of the delegations are the servants of their respective hamlets, drumming the rhythms of the bara' dance. The men behind them chant a zamil poem appropriate to the religious occasion: "The month of Shawal for Arabs is proclaimed // As the time to break the fast for those who have fasted. Happy is the faster who has been loyal to [God's] demand, // And to those who have not -may they be damned!" "We have put our trust in God. // Our lot can only increase through His generosity. O Lord, let rainds give us (water) to drink // And irrigate the crops and fields." Again, the unmarried boys watch from the sidelines, the women from their houses. As soon as the two delegations stand facing each other a few yards apart, the elder of the first arrivals begins the greeting. "Peace, O tribesmen (lit, faces," he shouts in a high, creaky voice that rises above the din of the drumming and chanting as a signal for the crowd to be silent. The elder continues as before: "May God restore us and you to the saved and the healthy". The presupposition of this formula, of course, is that those addressed are true believers who have remained steadfast in Ramadan. As soon as the elder has finished, the men of the opposing delegation intone in unison the response. "May God restore us and you to the saved and the healthy. May He protect them [the rest of the tribe] from harm." A reception line is formed by the initial group, which now welcomes the new arrivals individually. Each man shakes the other's hand and quickly kisses the back of it, muttering min as-salimin (among the saved), a shibboleth among the community of the faithful. Smiling and laughing, the group now either prays in the mosque at the rim of the flood plain or else retires to an open-air site to hear a sermon about the significance of the 'id and then join in communal prayer. This activity may last a half hour, after which time they retire to their villages behind the drummers, once again chanting zamil poems. The next morning the villagers visit each other and perhaps exchange gifts, the children often skipping from door to door to receive candy; at noon relatives assemble for large communal feasts. Everyone is very much relieved that the hardship of the fast is finally over, though perhaps their joyous mood is also tinged with a slight anticlimactic feeling because the drama of self-discipline that marks the fast has ended.' <sup id="cite_ref-740" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-740">[740]</a></sup> Caton describes wedding celebrations. He does not mention feasts explicitly, but we have assumed that feasting was practiced during weddings: 'In the course of a wedding ceremony there are two crucial events in which zamil performances are the norm: the samrah and the groom's zaffah. The noun samrah is derived from the Arabic Form I verb samar, meaning to spend the evening with friends in restful, idle conversation. Tribesmen gather after dinner to sit and pass the time in someone's mafraj (sitting room), sometimes nearly until dawn, chatting, playing games, and perhaps even dancing. The groom's samrah is supposed to have the same elements of relaxed amusement, but it naturally differs in that the caliber of entertainment is much higher. Professional musicians, a drummer-singer and a flute player, are usually hired to perform the music to which the assembly can dance the mizmar (named after the flute), and all the adult guests are obligated to contribute some lines of verse in the competitive balah poetry or razfah. The excitement builds as the guests arrive in groups of about five to ten during the early evening hours. They are the ones referred to in the poetry as 'ajanib (foreigners). Their zamil poem echoes in the wadi basin in which they are walking and carries through the stillness of the night on high-pitched voices. Upon hearing their chant, the post of the samrah dispatches some young men to greet them at the village entrance with gun salutes and rounds of exploding firecrackers. The thoroughfare to the groom's house beckons in soft white light emanating from the garlands of bulbs strung across the house walls and is astir with children scurrying about and adults doing their rounds of visiting. There is no mistaking the groom's house, which is ablaze with lanterns, strings of bulbs, and torches. Its colored, stained-glass windows glow invitingly like embers in a hearth. The arrivals are conducted to the diwan (hall) in which the celebrants, including the groom, are waiting to receive them. [...] When the delegation has stepped into the room, the assembly rises to its feet to perform the moving ritual greeting known as hal. Room is then made in the already packed hall for the new arrivals. The most prestigious personages, such as sheikhs, are seated nearest the groom; the rest may sit anywhere on the circle according to their preference. Usually a soft, thick oriental carpet is spread under the celebrants for their comfort during the long hours of the groom's samrah; the water pipe is also available, the tobacco laced with the finest incense and the water delicately scented. Each male wears the Yemeni dagger (jambiyyah) -a curved silver blade with a gazelle-horn handle inlaid with old coins- and brings a rifle, which he hangs by its leather strap on the wall pegs. These weapons are symbolic of male fighting prowess and hence honor and the poetry is full of allusions to them.' <sup id="cite_ref-741" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-741">[741]</a></sup>//'The groom has already changed into his brand-new set of clothes during the afternoon zaffah (procession). [...] Throughout the wedding ceremony the groom has to maintain a riding pose and does not participate in the event, such as the afternoon gat chews, the dancing, the poetry, or the shooting matches. He is a passive onlooker. Approximately one hour after the evening prayer, when the guests have been fed dinner, the professional musicians play a stirring drum salute called the tamsih, which incorporates in its music the rhythms of the famous bara' dance (see Adra 1982). This salute is a signal that the poetic events and dances of the evening are to begin. [...] Wedding celebrations may last several days, if not weeks, depending on the social prominence of the groom's family, and it is expected that the samrah be held on each evening of the celebration. On the lelat ad-dakhlak (night of consummation) the festivities reach their greatest intensity. Guests who cannot attend every night of the celebration try to attend at least that evening. Two genres of poetry are commonly performed at the samrah, the most important being a competitive verse composition known as the balah (the other being the dance-verse genre called the razfah). A wedding celebration is thought to be lacking if one or both of these genres is not performed; therefore, a special onus is placed on the guest to contribute in this way to the evening's entertainment. As for the zamil performance, I have already remarked that it occurs en route to the groom's village, but that is not the most crucial ceremony in which it is heard. Far more important is the groom's zaffah, the procession which begins at his house, slowly and majestically winds its way to the mosque, and then retraces its course. At the head of this procession are the village servants, who drum loudly the beat of the bara' dance. Immediately behind them are the guests of the wedding, all of them adult males, marching in columns with their rifles slung over their shoulders. They are wearing multicolored turbans, jackets, and skirts. They form what might be called the chorus of the zamil performance, one half chanting the first line of the poem and the other half chanting the second and final line; the poet usually comes from their ranks. If they feel so inclined, they might begin a dance to accompany the poetic chant and drum or shoot their files at an improvised target. All around them are the adolescent boys, too young to shoot off rifles or compose verse publicly, who gleefully light firecrackers and hurl them in the air to land usually underfoot or on the shoulders of the unsuspecting marchers, who cannot sidestep fast enough the flashing, hopping strings of fire. In the rear of the procession is the groom along with some friends or relatives bearing on their shoulders his mazharah or bouquet, which is composed of branches or acacia and sprigs of basil decjed with strings of different-colored berries, hollow eggs, and various other charms believed to ward off evil and bring good health, fertility, and prosperity. Sometimes a picture of the Haram Mosque in Mecca is stuck inside the bunch of plants, a reminder of the fundamentally sacred significance of the entire ceremony. As in the diwan, the groom is expected to maintain a solemn, dignified, and basically passive mien throughout the procession.//'Although  the women are not publicly present, they can be heard performing the peculiarly shrill ululation of joy (taghrid) from the house rooftops. Their black, veiled figures lean over the parapets four or more stories above the street, from where they throw candy to the children, who chase after these prizes through a haze of blue smoke rising from the exploding firecrackers. The whole affair is a cacophony of noise, a swirling mass of movement and color. The ideal of the poetic performance is that the guests compose a zamil to which the hosts respond; this exchange may be one of friendly teasing, or mutual recognition of honor expressed through praise and lofty compliments, of greeting, or of pious sentiments. The following is an example of such an exchange. First the host's poem: "From us good evening, [as many times as] the star revolves in the sky, // [As many times as] the rifle hits with its accurate bullets. O greeting to the guests, greetings from us all, // Which London announces and is broadcast in Iraq." The illocutionary force of the greeting is intensified by the metaphors of revolving heavenly bodies and the deadly accuracy of tribal marksmanship. Now the guest's poem: "Greetings from us. May thousands fill your mountains. // O defenders of the tribal border with the barrel of the rifle, We came from the same origins. // No one abandons his kinsmen until he dies." The guest poet returns the greeting with equal force and addresses the hosts as "defenders of the tribal border", meaning that they are therefore honorable men. Because the guest is a relative by marriage, he feels obligated to attend the wedding and affirms this obligation by declaring, "no one abandons his kinsmen until he dies.' The ideal of sociality understood as balanced exchange is upheld.' <sup id="cite_ref-742" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-742">[742]</a></sup> Khat parties were also important: 'Unquestionably the most important and distinctive social institution and form of recreation in Yemen is the khat party, or khat "chew." This is especially true in the northern part of the country, but, since the slight increase in general prosperity in the 1970s, the use of khat has spread to virtually all levels of Yemeni society. At least half of all men, and a smaller number of women, attend khat chews (which usually are segregated by gender) with some regularity, and many do so on a daily basis. Khat chews usually begin in the early afternoon after the main meal of the day, and they often go on until the early evening. Much gets done at these pleasurable sessions: gossip is exchanged, serious matters are discussed and debated, political and business decisions are made, business is transacted, disputes and grievances are settled, Yemeni history and lore are passed on, and music and poetry are played and recited.' <sup id="cite_ref-743" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-743">[743]</a></sup></dd>

<p><b>♠ Human sacrifice ♣ 0 ♥</b> ""Our" present religions, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, sometimes called Abrahamic religions, have the theme of human sacrifice right at their inception, with the founding father, Abraham. We are accustomed to the story, which remains a text of "terror and trembling," as Kierkegaard put it. Abraham is commanded by god to "sacrifice" his only son Isaac, and he is willing to do so (Gen. 22). The Hebrew term for this sacrifice is colah, "make to rise upwards," as fire and smoke rise to heaven;10 the action is to cut the throat with a knife and to burn the corpse on wood-the knife and wood expressly mentioned in the text. The human victim must be fettered in order to receive the deadly cut. Abraham does obey his god's command, without even an attempt at protest. The text enjoys the paradox: "the son that you love"; "and the two walked together" (Gen. 22.–19: 2; 8). In Muslim tradition, the place where Abraham "bound" his son is the rock on the temple hill of Jerusalem, which, since Khalif Omar, is covered by the "temple dome" with its golden cupola. Of course, an angel stops Abraham's action at the last moment, pointing to an animal for sacrifice. The text says God was "testing" (nissah) Abraham, and his submissive obedience is highly rewarded.

<dl><dd><b>♠ human sacrifice of an out-group member ♣ absent ♥</b> ""Our" present religions, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, sometimes called Abrahamic religions, have the theme of human sacrifice right at their inception, with the founding father, Abraham. We are accustomed to the story, which remains a text of "terror and trembling," as Kierkegaard put it. Abraham is commanded by god to "sacrifice" his only son Isaac, and he is willing to do so (Gen. 22). The Hebrew term for this sacrifice is colah, "make to rise upwards," as fire and smoke rise to heaven;10 the action is to cut the throat with a knife and to burn the corpse on wood-the knife and wood expressly mentioned in the text. The human victim must be fettered in order to receive the deadly cut. Abraham does obey his god's command, without even an attempt at protest. The text enjoys the paradox: "the son that you love"; "and the two walked together" (Gen. 22.–19: 2; 8). In Muslim tradition, the place where Abraham "bound" his son is the rock on the temple hill of Jerusalem, which, since Khalif Omar, is covered by the "temple dome" with its golden cupola. Of course, an angel stops Abraham's action at the last moment, pointing to an animal for sacrifice. The text says God was "testing" (nissah) Abraham, and his submissive obedience is highly rewarded.

Throughout human history, societal violence has been as prevalent as military violence, and in early seventh-century Arabia one finds numerous forms of societal violence. These included, for instance, female infanticide, along with the abuse of orphans, the poor, and marginal. Against such forms of societal violence, the revelations mediated through Muhammad were clear, incontrovertible challenges to the social order of tribal Mecca. For instance, they prohibit the pre-Islamic Arabian practice of female infanticide as well as other bodily and social abuses through directives set down, transmitted, and encoded in the Qur'an." <sup id="cite_ref-760" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-760">[760]</a></sup></dd>

The historical and legal model was the leadership of the prophet Muhammad. From the Muslim emigration (Hidjra) from Mecca to Medina in 622 – the date which would soon afterwards be fixed as the beginning of the Islamic calendar – onwards he combined the highest secular– judicial and spiritual– religious authority in his person. Later his successor/ representative ( khalifa , 'caliph') would assume this position. Constitutional law usually describes this as the function of an imam, not referring in this instance to the prayer leader in the mosque but to the head of the entire Muslim community. It states that obedience is due to him; not only as a matter of reason but also because law (shar') decrees it. This is often supported by sura 4:59 [4:62]: 'O believers, obey God, and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you (uli l-amr)!' It remains unclear who the last-named are.

<dd><b>♠ bravery ♣ inferred present ♥</b> "Beginning with the classical texts on Islamic law a fundamental bipartition of the world was evolved which would remain - with some modifications - the basis of all deliberation until well into the twentieth century. The Islamic territory (dar al-Islam , House of Islam), within which sharia norms were applied, was in opposition to the rest of the world, regarded as fundamentally hostile and lawless, the House of War (dar al-harb). Classical doctrine did not allow lasting peace treaties but only temporary armistices in cases where the Muslim forces were inferior. For the rest, the commitment to expand the faith (jihad) - which the scholars undoubtedly saw as a primarily military enterprise - in the sense of increasing Muslim territory remained the religious duty of a sufficient number of believers (fard kifaya). It was not possible to enact a restriction of jihad, giving it a defensive intention applying only to those countries under non-Muslim rule which were in conflict with Islamic rule. Classical doctrine did not refer to those Quranic verses which express only a defensive attitude against attack, but considered these to have been abrogated by the 'sword verses' in sura 9:29ff. (regarding abrogation cf. 2.1 above). It is probably no coincidence that this doctrine was formulated during the time of military expansion under the Umayyads and the early Abbasids."<sup id="cite_ref-791" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-791">[791]</a></sup> The following is also somewhat relevant, though imported from the Ottoman- and modern-period data sheet: "Weapons were valued as signifiers of masculinity: 'Yemeni society is tribally based, and trust and assurance most often are measured by degree of consanguinity. Families are very close and are the focus of the individual's primary devotion; one's second allegiance is to the tribe, an extended family unit that ordinarily traces its ties to a common eponymous ancestor. In rural Yemen, state authority is weak, and disputes between tribes are frequently solved through violence. The art of the feud is still quite real, and, as a consequence, Yemen is a gun culture. Virtually every household has at least one weapon, and men and boys often carry firearms in public. Even when not carrying a pistol or a rifle, most Yemeni males-particularly those belonging to a rural tribe-will carry a dagger, the traditional janbiyyah (or jambiyyah), a short, broad, curved blade sheathed on a belt worn across the abdomen and serving as a signal of one's status within social and tribal hierarchies."<sup id="cite_ref-792" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-792">[792]</a></sup></dd>

Men, women, and children share responsibility for the care of livestock. Women gather firewood and water; in some regions, they now receive assistance from the men, who have acquired Japanese trucks. The family's livelihood may also depend on women selling homemade goods and produce in the marketplace.' <sup id="cite_ref-806" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-806">[806]</a></sup> 'Yemen’s difficult terrain, limited soil, inconsistent water supply, and large number of microclimates have fostered some of the most highly sophisticated methods of water conservation and seed adaptation found anywhere in the world, making possible the cultivation of surprisingly diverse crops. The most common crops are cereals such as millet, corn (maize), wheat, barley, and sorghum; myriad vegetables from a burgeoning truck farm industry have appeared on the market in recent years. There has also been extensive cultivation of fruits - both tropical (mangoes, plantains, bananas, melons, papayas, and citrus) and temperate (pears, peaches, apples, and grapes). The two main cash crops in the northern highlands are coffee (Coffea arabica) and khat (qāt; Catha edulis). The coffee trade, which began in the 16th century, was originally based on Yemeni coffee, and, for centuries, coffee was the most important and renowned export of Yemen. The port city of Mocha-from which a distinctive style of coffee takes its name - was the point from which most of Yemen’s coffee was exported between the 16th and 18th centuries, before more-economical plantation cultivation was introduced in other parts of the world. In Yemen the coffee tree grows best in the middle highlands, at elevations of 4,500 to 6,500 feet (1,400 to 2,000 metres), where khat also flourishes.' <sup id="cite_ref-807" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-807">[807]</a></sup> 'The typical Yemeni farmer raises at least some poultry and livestock, typically regional varieties of chickens, goats, sheep, or cattle. Agricultural aid programs sponsored by Western countries in the 1970s and ’80s introduced new varieties of dairy and beef cattle in the more temperate regions of the north, but Yemen still imports much of the livestock and dairy and poultry products it consumes.' <sup id="cite_ref-808" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-808">[808]</a></sup> Coffee and khat were important cash crops: 'The two main cash crops in the northern highlands are coffee (Coffea arabica) and khat (qāt; Catha edulis).

The latter is an evergreen shrub whose young leaves, which contain an alkaloid, are chewed as a mild stimulant. The production and consumption of khat occupy a prominent position in the culture and economy of Yemen. Increased affluence has allowed a growing section of the population to indulge in its use, which the government has attempted - with little success - to discourage. Greater demand has fueled a substantial increase in khat acreage. Although older coffee terraces are often converted to khat as their productivity declines, much of the land being devoted to khat was formerly considered marginal for commercial agricultural purposes and now benefits from regular soil-enhancement programs and terrace-maintenance efforts.' <sup id="cite_ref-809" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-809">[809]</a></sup> Cotton became more common in the 20th century: 'Beginning in the 1970s, the cultivation of cotton - both in the Tihāmah coastal plain in the north and in the coastal plain east of Aden-was strongly supported by the respective national governments, and for a while it contributed significantly to national income.

<p><b>♠ Food storage ♣ absent ♥</b> In the 20th century, the republican government(s) constructed grain storage facilities: 'This mountainous land was hard to govern. During much of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, government authority -and, for that matter, urban traders- found it difficult to centralize agricultural surplus. In 1884 the Ottomans, short of grain, looted the homes of rural people in the vicinity of San'a' and in 1904 Imam Yahya and his supporters raided the homes of San'anis for grain. And much later, in the early years of the Republican regime, the first priority of the central government  was the building of adequate grain storage facilities. During the late 1960s, as often in the past, the threat of famine was a real one and government storehouses were drastically inadequate. This did not mean that cultivators were everywhere left with their surplus, but rather that relations of domination and tax collection were not centralized throughout much of the last two centuries. The farming out of taxes was as common as regular assessment by the central government. Effective coercive power often lay in the hands of rural landlords and leaders, especially the northern shaikhs.' <sup id="cite_ref-818" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-818">[818]</a></sup> So far, the sources have been silent on potential storage facilities constructed by the Ottomans.

There are two basic housing types: houses of reed, thatch, and mud brick, which are largely found in coastal regions; and houses of stone and mud brick, which are more frequently found in the highlands. Throughout the country, access to fresh water and hygienic sewage disposal is poor.

Yemen has a long tradition of irrigated terraced agriculture, although most land was under dry cultivation: 'Yemen’s difficult terrain, limited soil, inconsistent water supply, and large number of microclimates have fostered some of the most highly sophisticated methods of water conservation and seed adaptation found anywhere in the world, making possible the cultivation of surprisingly diverse crops. The most common crops are cereals such as millet, corn (maize), wheat, barley, and sorghum; myriad vegetables from a burgeoning truck farm industry have appeared on the market in recent years. There has also been extensive cultivation of fruits-both tropical (mangoes, plantains, bananas, melons, papayas, and citrus) and temperate (pears, peaches, apples, and grapes).' <sup id="cite_ref-823" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-823">[823]</a></sup> However, irrigation facilities were constructed by local communities, not the state (see agriculture variables).

There are various programs supported and operated by foreign donors that address these needs to some degree.

Zafir Hajjah was finally surrendered after having been held by the Imam’s supporters for a full year. Nasir al-Ahmar admitted that although the water tanks were running dry and his men were exhausted, the surrender itself involved ‘a sum of money’ (shay’ min al-mal).  ‘Ali al-Iryani reckoned it at 11,000 riyals (Zabarah 1956:i. 2/81-2), an enormous sum by the standards of the time.’ <sup id="cite_ref-827" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-827">[827]</a></sup> ‘Al-Hadi Sharaf al-Din died in 1890.

<p><b>♠ Funding for festivals ♣ absent ♥</b> Caton provides a description of 'Id al-kabir celebrations: 'Now let us turn our attention to the two major religious festivals in he Muslim calendar: the 'id al-kabir after the holy month of fast, Ramadan, and the 'id as-saghir that marks the end of the annaual pilgrimage to Mecca. Unfortunately, I had the opportunity to observe only one of these festivals (at the end of Ramadan) while I was in Khawland, though I was assured by tribesmen that the same rituals were enacted in both. On the first morning after the fast had been officially declared at an end, the old and young adult males of the village in which I was staying convened in the selah (flood plain) to greet each other with salutations peculiar to the 'id. The flood plain has special significance. In the Yemeni highlands most villages are built on rock outcrops that jut upwards from the wadi floor, the fertile fields surrounding them irrigated by canals that drain the wadi's plain when it is in flood, during the rainy season twice a year. The rest of the time the wadi floor is dry and used for a variety of purposes, including the transport of animals, the passage of people between villages located along the plain, as the meeting ground for tribal delegations who have been sent to a village to mediate one of its disputes, and for open-air markets that convene once a week. A mosque is usually situated at the rim of the flood plain and the village, casting its sacred canopy over these people and their activities. In short, the flood plain is a general thoroughfare bringing fertility, religious blessing, and hopefully also security. It is not surprising that the religious festival marking the transition of the fast and the beginning of a new year is held in a place saturated with the symbolism of passage, for, as Van Gennep ([1908] 1960) understood, ritual time is often symbolized by movement in space. In the cool hours of early morning on the first day after the fast, the hamlet of Bet al-Bahluli sends a delegation of adult males to march in the wadi toward the hamlet of Dhu l-Mukh, which in turn dispatches a group of adult males toward the former, the two groups meeting halfway. At the head of the delegations are the servants of their respective hamlets, drumming the rhythms of the bara' dance. The men behind them chant a zamil poem appropriate to the religious occasion: "The month of Shawal for Arabs is proclaimed // As the time to break the fast for those who have fasted. Happy is the faster who has been loyal to [God's] demand, // And to those who have not -may they be damned!" "We have put our trust in God. // Our lot can only increase through His generosity. O Lord, let rainds give us (water) to drink // And irrigate the crops and fields." Again, the unmarried boys watch from the sidelines, the women from their houses. As soon as the two delegations stand facing each other a few yards apart, the elder of the first arrivals begins the greeting. "Peace, O tribesmen (lit, faces," he shouts in a high, creaky voice that rises above the din of the drumming and chanting as a signal for the crowd to be silent. The elder continues as before: "May God restore us and you to the saved and the healthy". The presupposition of this formula, of course, is that those addressed are true believers who have remained steadfast in Ramadan. As soon as the elder has finished, the men of the opposing delegation intone in unison the response. "May God restore us and you to the saved and the healthy. May He protect them [the rest of the tribe] from harm." A reception line is formed by the initial group, which now welcomes the new arrivals individually. Each man shakes the other's hand and quickly kisses the back of it, muttering min as-salimin (among the saved), a shibboleth among the community of the faithful. Smiling and laughing, the group now either prays in the mosque at the rim of the flood plain or else retires to an open-air site to hear a sermon about the significance of the 'id and then join in communal prayer. This activity may last a half hour, after which time they retire to their villages behind the drummers, once again chanting zamil poems. The next morning the villagers visit each other and perhaps exchange gifts, the children often skipping from door to door to receive candy; at noon relatives assemble for large communal feasts. Everyone is very much relieved that the hardship of the fast is finally over, though perhaps their joyous mood is also tinged with a slight anticlimactic feeling because the drama of self-discipline that marks the fast has ended.' <sup id="cite_ref-829" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-829">[829]</a></sup> He also mentions wedding celebrations: 'In the course of a wedding ceremony there are two crucial events in which zamil performances are the norm: the samrah and the groom's zaffah. The noun samrah is derived from the Arabic Form I verb samar, meaning to spend the evening with friends in restful, idle conversation. Tribesmen gather after dinner to sit and pass the time in someone's mafraj (sitting room), sometimes nearly until dawn, chatting, playing games, and perhaps even dancing. The groom's samrah is supposed to have the same elements of relaxed amusement, but it naturally differs in that the caliber of entertainment is much higher. Professional musicians, a drummer-singer and a flute player, are usually hired to perform the music to which the assembly can dance the mizmar (named after the flute), and all the adult guests are obligated to contribute some lines of verse in the competitive balah poetry or razfah. The excitement builds as the guests arrive in groups of about five to ten during the early evening hours. They are the ones referred to in the poetry as 'ajanib (foreigners). Their zamil poem echoes in the wadi basin in which they are walking and carries through the stillness of the night on high-pitched voices. Upon hearing their chant, the post of the samrah dispatches some young men to greet them at the village entrance with gun salutes and rounds of exploding firecrackers. The thoroughfare to the groom's house beckons in soft white light emanating from the garlands of bulbs strung across the house walls and is astir with children scurrying about and adults doing their rounds of visiting. There is no mistaking the groom's house, which is ablaze with lanterns, strings of bulbs, and torches. Its colored, stained-glass windows glow invitingly like embers in a hearth. The arrivals are conducted to the diwan (hall) in which the celebrants, including the groom, are waiting to receive them. [...] When the delegation has stepped into the room, the assembly rises to its feet to perform the moving ritual greeting known as hal. Room is then made in the already packed hall for the new arrivals. The most prestigious personages, such as sheikhs, are seated nearest the groom; the rest may sit anywhere on the circle according to their preference. Usually a soft, thick oriental carpet is spread under the celebrants for their comfort during the long hours of the groom's samrah; the water pipe is also available, the tobacco laced with the finest incense and the water delicately scented. Each male wears the Yemeni dagger (jambiyyah) -a curved silver blade with a gazelle-horn handle inlaid with old coins- and brings a rifle, which he hangs by its leather strap on the wall pegs. These weapons are symbolic of male fighting prowess and hence honor and the poetry is full of allusions to them.' <sup id="cite_ref-830" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-830">[830]</a></sup>//'The groom has already changed into his brand-new set of clothes during the afternoon zaffah (procession). [...] Throughout the wedding ceremony the groom has to maintain a riding pose and does not participate in the event, such as the afternoon gat chews, the dancing, the poetry, or the shooting matches. He is a passive onlooker. Approximately one hour after the evening prayer, when the guests have been fed dinner, the professional musicians play a stirring drum salute called the tamsih, which incorporates in its music the rhythms of the famous bara' dance (see Adra 1982). This salute is a signal that the poetic events and dances of the evening are to begin. [...] Wedding celebrations may last several days, if not weeks, depending on the social prominence of the groom's family, and it is expected that the samrah be held on each evening of the celebration. On the lelat ad-dakhlak (night of consummation) the festivities reach their greatest intensity. Guests who cannot attend every night of the celebration try to attend at least that evening. Two genres of poetry are commonly performed at the samrah, the most important being a competitive verse composition known as the balah (the other being the dance-verse genre called the razfah). A wedding celebration is thought to be lacking if one or both of these genres is not performed; therefore, a special onus is placed on the guest to contribute in this way to the evening's entertainment. As for the zamil performance, I have already remarked that it occurs en route to the groom's village, but that is not the most crucial ceremony in which it is heard. Far more important is the groom's zaffah, the procession which begins at his house, slowly and majestically winds its way to the mosque, and then retraces its course. At the head of this procession are the village servants, who drum loudly the beat of the bara' dance. Immediately behind them are the guests of the wedding, all of them adult males, marching in columns with their rifles slung over their shoulders. They are wearing multicolored turbans, jackets, and skirts. They form what might be called the chorus of the zamil performance, one half chanting the first line of the poem and the other half chanting the second and final line; the poet usually comes from their ranks. If they feel so inclined, they might begin a dance to accompany the poetic chant and drum or shoot their files at an improvised target. All around them are the adolescent boys, too young to shoot off rifles or compose verse publicly, who gleefully light firecrackers and hurl them in the air to land usually underfoot or on the shoulders of the unsuspecting marchers, who cannot sidestep fast enough the flashing, hopping strings of fire. In the rear of the procession is the groom along with some friends or relatives bearing on their shoulders his mazharah or bouquet, which is composed of branches or acacia and sprigs of basil decjed with strings of different-colored berries, hollow eggs, and various other charms believed to ward off evil and bring good health, fertility, and prosperity. Sometimes a picture of the Haram Mosque in Mecca is stuck inside the bunch of plants, a reminder of the fundamentally sacred significance of the entire ceremony. As in the diwan, the groom is expected to maintain a solemn, dignified, and basically passive mien throughout the procession.//'Although  the women are not publicly present, they can be heard performing the peculiarly shrill ululation of joy (taghrid) from the house rooftops. Their black, veiled figures lean over the parapets four or more stories above the street, from where they throw candy to the children, who chase after these prizes through a haze of blue smoke rising from the exploding firecrackers. The whole affair is a cacophony of noise, a swirling mass of movement and color. The ideal of the poetic performance is that the guests compose a zamil to which the hosts respond; this exchange may be one of friendly teasing, or mutual recognition of honor expressed through praise and lofty compliments, of greeting, or of pious sentiments. The following is an example of such an exchange. First the host's poem: "From us good evening, [as many times as] the star revolves in the sky, // [As many times as] the rifle hits with its accurate bullets. O greeting to the guests, greetings from us all, // Which London announces and is broadcast in Iraq." The illocutionary force of the greeting is intensified by the metaphors of revolving heavenly bodies and the deadly accuracy of tribal marksmanship. Now the guest's poem: "Greetings from us. May thousands fill your mountains. // O defenders of the tribal border with the barrel of the rifle, We came from the same origins. // No one abandons his kinsmen until he dies." The guest poet returns the greeting with equal force and addresses the hosts as "defenders of the tribal border", meaning that they are therefore honorable men. Because the guest is a relative by marriage, he feels obligated to attend the wedding and affirms this obligation by declaring, "no one abandons his kinsmen until he dies.' The ideal of sociality understood as balanced exchange is upheld.' <sup id="cite_ref-831" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-831">[831]</a></sup>// Caton's material focuses on the performance of poetry: 'A small group of men -approximately six to ten in the average performance- form a circle (halgah) in the middle of the room. They face inward, their arms clasped around each other's shoulders or waists and their feet slowly moving in a simple side step (clockwise or counterclockwise; the direction of movement does not seem to matter). This circle of men is what I call a chorus, though in Arabuc they are referred to as saffen, literally two ranks (lines or groups). One rank or saff chants a refrain, and the other chants a certain part of the verse, the two groups thus alternating their canting throughout the performance of a single poem. The choristers are often the younger men of the wedding party, sometimes even adolescents, who may not yet possess the requisite skill to compose verse but are learning it by performing in the chorus. The poets, whoever they turn out to bem shut their eyes as they listen to the chanting, their faces tense with the effort of composition, their lips silently forming the lines that spring from their imagination. Confident that they have composed a well-formed verse, their faces brighten, and one among their number (which varies from two to five or even more) moves decisively toward the circle and breaks through the linked arms of the choristers, who close ranks behind him. The poet is now in the center of the performance, in the middle of the samrah, and at the heart of the wedding festivities. The collective attends the individual's chant to see how well he plays the game. Cupping one or both hands to the sides of his head, sometimes even plugging his ears with his thumbs [...] -a gesture that simultaneously projects the verse off a natural sounding board so that the whole noisy assembly can hear it and blocks out any palaver that might disturb his concentration (conindicentally this attitude is reminiscent of the mu'adhdhin, who calls the people to prayer)- he walks half of the circle's circumference and at the same time chants the first hermistich (harf) of his turn. Depending on the particular chant, the chorus might introduce at this juncture with a choral refrain, but in any case the power finishes his turn by chanting the second menistich and continuing around to close the circle. (In the case of a third hemistich, which rarely occurs, he describes another half-circle). He then immediately exits from the middle of the circle, and the chorus meanwhile picks up the chanting of the last hemistich of the poet's turn, alternating it with the refrain line. Now it is up to his rivals to continue building it with the refrain line. Now it is up to his rivals to continue building the poem. The performance ought not to depend heavily on the contributions of one person, for the nit is no longer felt to be an evenly matched competition. Throughout the performance the audience is hardly ever still, except when a poet enters the circle, at which time most people want to hear what he has to say and evaluate it. They are quick to laugh at a witty line or exclaim allahu akbar (God is great) in reaction to a particularly good metaphor or adroit turn of phrase. If the poet'S gift to the groom is unsound because it breaks the rules of composition, they will start shouting boisterously harf magsus (a broken hemistich). Occasionally such rowdy criticism incites a quarrel between the poet and his audience, but he his more likely to amend the fault by quickly fashioning another hemistich. If he cannot make a speedy recovery, he will inevitably give to another poet and thereby lose face. As soon as the poet has exited the circle and the chorus has begun chanting again, the audience usually attends to its own matters -resuming a conversation, smoking the water pipe, joking, or just dozing to the hypnotic drone of the chant.' <sup id="cite_ref-832" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-832">[832]</a></sup>//'To summarize, the performance is made up of three concentric circles: the inner one is described by the poet's turn, the middle one comprises the chorus, and the outer one is formed by the seated audience. The penetration of the inner circle by the poet emerging from the outer two and then the exiting back into them is perfectly iconic of the ideal that everyone -whether a member of the audience or the chorus- may be a poet; no one is privileged. In addition, and much more significant, is the fact that the closer someone is to the center, the more intimately he becomes involved in the compositional process: the audience react to the poem, the chorus "carries" it (the Arabic word is shall, which means lift or carry), and the poet composes it. And whereas the audience and chorus look inward, the poet faces them in the middle by looking outward: the individual is alone and being judged by the collectivity. It is certainly the ultimate moment of truth, when honor is being tested and is either recognized or repudiated.' <sup id="cite_ref-833" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-833">[833]</a></sup> 'Each genre of performance-composed poetry (balah, zamil, razfah, and roshan) has its own set of melodies on which the poetry is chanted.' <sup id="cite_ref-834" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-834">[834]</a></sup> It is worth noting that this description dates to the twentieth century. It appears from the above descriptions that festivals were organized by local communities rather than 'publicly' funded.

Zaydis, who belong to the Shia subsect of Islam, are located in the northern and eastern parts of Yemen, whereas Shafis, orthodox Sunnis, live in the southern and coastal regions. Location in the highlands apparently enables Zaydis more successfully to repel invasions than Shafis in the lower lying areas. A smaller Shia subsect, the Ismaili, and also the remnants of an ancient Jewish community, may still be found in certain parts of Yemen.

Competitive poetry duels performed at weddings by men of tribal status are highly valued. In the past, celebrations for circumcision (required of all Muslim males) were particularly elaborate, but now government officials discourage postinfancy circumcisions, thereby undermining the importance of ceremonial specialists.' <sup id="cite_ref-839" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-839">[839]</a></sup> Dances were performed by community members rather than specialists: 'Dances, performed with or without musical accompaniment, are a feature of weddings and other social occasions; these are performed by men and women separately. The male dances are often performed with the janbiyyah dagger.'<sup id="cite_ref-840" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-840">[840]</a></sup> Poetry was popular: 'The most widespread and traditional cultural outlet is oral, in the form of proverbs, popular stories, and poetry; poems that deal with timeless themes such as love and death as well as with Yemeni history, biography, and Islamic themes and traditions are particularly prevalent. Yemen is an integral part of contemporary Arab trends in literature, political essays, and scholarly writing; Yemeni poets, past and present, are among the most esteemed in the Arab world. Among these are the great 10th-century poet and historian al-Hamdānī and such modern writers as novelist Zayd Muṭīʿ Dammāj, poet and political chronicler ʿAbd Allāh al-Baraddūnī, and the prolific poet ʿAbd al-Azīz al-Maqāliḥ. Similarly, the songs and singers of Yemen are highly respected, and some Yemeni instruments (such as the lutelike qanbus, or ṭurbī, now largely replaced by the ʿūd) and genres (such as al-ghināʾ al-ṣanʿānī, or Sanaani song) are quite unique.' <sup id="cite_ref-841" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-841">[841]</a></sup> But it appeared that most poetry was performed by community members rather than entertainment specialists: 'A small group of men -approximately six to ten in the average performance- form a circle (halgah) in the middle of the room. They face inward, their arms clasped around each other's shoulders or waists and their feet slowly moving in a simple side step (clockwise or counterclockwise; the direction of movement does not seem to matter). This circle of men is what I call a chorus, though in Arabuc they are referred to as saffen, literally two ranks (lines or groups). One rank or saff chants a refrain, and the other chants a certain part of the verse, the two groups thus alternating their canting throughout the performance of a single poem. The choristers are often the younger men of the wedding party, sometimes even adolescents, who may not yet possess the requisite skill to compose verse but are learning it by performing in the chorus. The poets, whoever they turn out to bem shut their eyes as they listen to the chanting, their faces tense with the effort of composition, their lips silently forming the lines that spring from their imagination. Confident that they have composed a well-formed verse, their faces brighten, and one among their number (which varies from two to five or even more) moves decisively toward the circle and breaks through the linked arms of the choristers, who close ranks behind him. The poet is now in the center of the performance, in the middle of the samrah, and at the heart of the wedding festivities. The collective attends the individual's chant to see how well he plays the game. Cupping one or both hands to the sides of his head, sometimes even plugging his ears with his thumbs [...] -a gesture that simultaneously projects the verse off a natural sounding board so that the whole noisy assembly can hear it and blocks out any palaver that might disturb his concentration (conindicentally this attitude is reminiscent of the mu'adhdhin, who calls the people to prayer)- he walks half of the circle's circumference and at the same time chants the first hermistich (harf) of his turn. Depending on the particular chant, the chorus might introduce at this juncture with a choral refrain, but in any case the power finishes his turn by chanting the second menistich and continuing around to close the circle. (In the case of a third hemistich, which rarely occurs, he describes another half-circle). He then immediately exits from the middle of the circle, and the chorus meanwhile picks up the chanting of the last hemistich of the poet's turn, alternating it with the refrain line. Now it is up to his rivals to continue building it with the refrain line. Now it is up to his rivals to continue building the poem. The performance ought not to depend heavily on the contributions of one person, for the nit is no longer felt to be an evenly matched competition. Throughout the performance the audience is hardly ever still, except when a poet enters the circle, at which time most people want to hear what he has to say and evaluate it. They are quick to laugh at a witty line or exclaim allahu akbar (God is great) in reaction to a particularly good metaphor or adroit turn of phrase. If the poet'S gift to the groom is unsound because it breaks the rules of composition, they will start shouting boisterously harf magsus (a broken hemistich). Occasionally such rowdy criticism incites a quarrel between the poet and his audience, but he his more likely to amend the fault by quickly fashioning another hemistich. If he cannot make a speedy recovery, he will inevitably give to another poet and thereby lose face. As soon as the poet has exited the circle and the chorus has begun chanting again, the audience usually attends to its own matters -resuming a conversation, smoking the water pipe, joking, or just dozing to the hypnotic drone of the chant.' <sup id="cite_ref-842" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-842">[842]</a></sup>//'To summarize, the performance is made up of three concentric circles: the inner one is described by the poet's turn, the middle one comprises the chorus, and the outer one is formed by the seated audience. The penetration of the inner circle by the poet emerging from the outer two and then the exiting back into them is perfectly iconic of the ideal that everyone -whether a member of the audience or the chorus- may be a poet; no one is privileged. In addition, and much more significant, is the fact that the closer someone is to the center, the more intimately he becomes involved in the compositional process: the audience react to the poem, the chorus "carries" it (the Arabic word is shall, which means lift or carry), and the poet composes it. And whereas the audience and chorus look inward, the poet faces them in the middle by looking outward: the individual is alone and being judged by the collectivity. It is certainly the ultimate moment of truth, when honor is being tested and is either recognized or repudiated.' <sup id="cite_ref-843" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-843">[843]</a></sup> 'Each genre of performance-composed poetry (balah, zamil, razfah, and roshan) has its own set of melodies on which the poetry is chanted.' <sup id="cite_ref-844" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-844">[844]</a></sup>

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Publicly funded or subsidized education ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> The Imamate supported schools, publishing, and libraries: 'Although principally concerned with the administration of schools, Imam Yahya's Maʿarif administration also provided the umbrella for small-scale but significant early departures in state-initiated publishing, library reform, and officially sponsored history writing. The printing equipment in question had been left behind by the departing Turks, and the early imamic usage of it was partly inspired by that of the previous Ottoman administration. Like his school program, the imam's new library was an imaginative hybrid, a recasting of old institutional ideas in newly elaborated forms. The history-writing project, although new to Yemen, bore some resemblance to a far better known scholarly enterprise of the new Turkish Republic.1 These collateral maʿarif efforts were further assertions of a tentative yet determined attitude toward developing the state's identity and extending its authority by means of new textual technologies.' <sup id="cite_ref-845" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-845">[845]</a></sup> 'The first organizational step was the creation of a specially designated space: a new storey was constructed over arcades along the southern side of the Great Mosque (Sanʿaʾ) courtyard. Access to the library (located “south of the east minaret”) was by means of a long flight of steps. There the imam gathered what remained of the old collections together with his own large and newly created endowment. The properly qualified librarian, described in the decree, was to have “comprehensive knowledge of religion and jurisprudence so as to know the relative importance of the books and the disciplines.” This librarian-the scholarly brother of the historian al-Wasiʿi is named as the first holder of the position29-is required to “take a security deposit from each borrower in an amount greater than the value of the book borrowed.” “Tens of thousands of endowed books have been lost,” the imam wrote, “because of the nontaking of security deposits.” With a proper deposit a book could be borrowed for a period of six months. The contractual language of “loan” and “deposit,” and the notion that a book may be constituted as an “endowment,” come directly from the manuals of jurisprudence. In his initial organizing decree for his new library the imam also appointed a second library official, charged with documenting and indexing the collections.30 In the same year, the imam dispatched Muhammad Zabara to Ibb and nearby Jibla, where he was ordered to “find out about the endowment books for teachers and students and compile a listing of them in a register.”' <sup id="cite_ref-846" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-846">[846]</a></sup> Western-style education was introduced in the mid-20th century only and remained inaccessible to much of the general population: 'Modern systems of education were established in both Yemens during the 1960s, but limited resources and a high birth rate ensured that education continued to reach only a fraction of school-age children. For a variety of social and cultural reasons, certain subgroups of the school-age population-most notably girls-remained underrepresented in the system. Despite the dramatic expansion of teacher training, the lack of adequately qualified Yemeni teachers was a major problem in the north; Egyptian and other Arab expatriates largely filled this void. The overall literacy rate remains relatively low, and the disparity between males and females is large. More than two-thirds of men and less than one-third of women are literate.

<p><b>♠ Degree of taxation ♣ present ♥</b> The sources mention taxation, stipends and financial compensation: ‘In the west the Imam suffered further setbacks. From the start of the rising certain northern shaykhs were conspicuous in the area, probably fighting around their own landholdings: Nasir Mabkhut al-Ahmar of al-‘Usaymat and Muhsin al-Qayifi of Kharif around Mahwit […]. Zafir Hajjah was finally surrendered after having been held by the Imam’s supporters for a full year. Nasir al-Ahmar admitted that although the water tanks were running dry and his men were exhausted, the surrender itself involved ‘a sum of money’ (shay’ min al-mal).  ‘Ali al-Iryani reckoned it at 11,000 riyals (Zabarah 1956:i. 2/81-2), an enormous sum by the standards of the time.’ <sup id="cite_ref-861" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-861">[861]</a></sup> ‘Al-Hadi Sharaf al-Din died in 1890. Al-Mansur Muhammad Hamid al-Din, who was in San’a’ at the time, was called on to take the Imamate and had little option but to leave he city. The sayyids of the Sa’dah area took time to organize themselves around him (al-Mahdi Muhammad was still active at Barat), and meanwhile some hundreds of Hashid chiefs came into San’a’, returning still in receipt of large Turkish stipends (al-Hibshi 1980: 393-9). But the rains then failed, and fighting broke out between the tribes just north-east of San’a’. The sorghum crop was ruined in the summer by locusts and the Turks applied severe pressure to the shaykhs of Hajjah, among other areas, presumably to extract taxes […].’ <sup id="cite_ref-862" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-862">[862]</a></sup> It is assumed here that Ottoman coins were in circulation. The Imams produced their own coinage after the departure of the Ottomans: 'Muhammad al-Idrisi died in 1923 and the British, more concerned with the Imam, abandoned the Idrisis to their fate. The Imam was scarcely privy to British policy, however. Before World War I the Italians had supported the Idrisi against the Turks, for which Yahya condemned him as kafir (infidel), but with Britain to face near Aden and the Idrisis seeking British help, Yahya himself now signed a treaty with Italy (1926), which had colonies across the Red Sea.

<p><b>♠ Wages ♣ ♥</b> Note: At the time, most Yemenis were subsistence agriculturalists: 'Various tasks in the cultivation of crops are divided according to sex. Men, women, and children share responsibility for the care of livestock. Women gather firewood and water; in some regions, they now receive assistance from the men, who have acquired Japanese trucks. The family's livelihood may also depend on women selling homemade goods and produce in the marketplace.' <sup id="cite_ref-864" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-864">[864]</a></sup> 'Yemen’s difficult terrain, limited soil, inconsistent water supply, and large number of microclimates have fostered some of the most highly sophisticated methods of water conservation and seed adaptation found anywhere in the world, making possible the cultivation of surprisingly diverse crops. The most common crops are cereals such as millet, corn (maize), wheat, barley, and sorghum; myriad vegetables from a burgeoning truck farm industry have appeared on the market in recent years. There has also been extensive cultivation of fruits-both tropical (mangoes, plantains, bananas, melons, papayas, and citrus) and temperate (pears, peaches, apples, and grapes). The two main cash crops in the northern highlands are coffee (Coffea arabica) and khat (qāt; Catha edulis). The coffee trade, which began in the 16th century, was originally based on Yemeni coffee, and, for centuries, coffee was the most important and renowned export of Yemen. The port city of Mocha-from which a distinctive style of coffee takes its name-was the point from which most of Yemen’s coffee was exported between the 16th and 18th centuries, before more-economical plantation cultivation was introduced in other parts of the world. In Yemen the coffee tree grows best in the middle highlands, at elevations of 4,500 to 6,500 feet (1,400 to 2,000 metres), where khat also flourishes.' <sup id="cite_ref-865" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-865">[865]</a></sup> 'The typical Yemeni farmer raises at least some poultry and livestock, typically regional varieties of chickens, goats, sheep, or cattle. Agricultural aid programs sponsored by Western countries in the 1970s and ’80s introduced new varieties of dairy and beef cattle in the more temperate regions of the north, but Yemen still imports much of the livestock and dairy and poultry products it consumes.' <sup id="cite_ref-866" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-866">[866]</a></sup> Coffee and khat were important cash crops: 'The two main cash crops in the northern highlands are coffee (Coffea arabica) and khat (qāt; Catha edulis).

The latter is an evergreen shrub whose young leaves, which contain an alkaloid, are chewed as a mild stimulant. The production and consumption of khat occupy a prominent position in the culture and economy of Yemen. Increased affluence has allowed a growing section of the population to indulge in its use, which the government has attempted-with little success-to discourage. Greater demand has fueled a substantial increase in khat acreage. Although older coffee terraces are often converted to khat as their productivity declines, much of the land being devoted to khat was formerly considered marginal for commercial agricultural purposes and now benefits from regular soil-enhancement programs and terrace-maintenance efforts.' <sup id="cite_ref-867" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-867">[867]</a></sup> Cotton became more common in the 20th century: 'Beginning in the 1970s, the cultivation of cotton-both in the Tihāmah coastal plain in the north and in the coastal plain east of Aden-was strongly supported by the respective national governments, and for a while it contributed significantly to national income. At the end of the 20th century, a significant decline in world cotton prices, as well as the high costs of initiation and development, meant that the Yemeni cotton industry was not competitive.'<sup id="cite_ref-868" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-868">[868]</a></sup> Accordingly, the below variables might not apply to Ottoman-period Yemen.
