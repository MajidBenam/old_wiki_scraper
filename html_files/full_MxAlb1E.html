</p><p><b>Description of the Ritual System</b>
</p><p>Rituals are described below using archaeological variables due to lack of evidence for discreet rituals.
</p><p><br>
Rites of passage
</p><p>Death
Burials-Present-fewer than ten tombs found from this period-they are rectangular, roofed with stone slabs and no door. Many more non-tomb burials have also been found. <sup id="cite_ref-228" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-228">[228]</a></sup>
</p><p>Grave goods-Present-the poorest graves had  pottery, the richest had many grave goods including conch shell effigies, duck and frog effigies <sup id="cite_ref-229" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-229">[229]</a></sup>
</p><p>Gatherings
Ritual Space
Architecture
Present-in Monte Alban three public buildings, isolated in non-residential area, potentially neutral and sacred area <sup id="cite_ref-230" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-230">[230]</a></sup>
Partially enclosed-two sides closed, two sides open  E-W, with stairs leading into building on both sides. Suggested uses include one side for priests, one for public; or ritual in which participants entered the temple from one side and exited the other. <sup id="cite_ref-231" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-231">[231]</a></sup>
</p><p>At Monte Negro four public buildings described as temples have been found. They vary in shape. Temple T had a 2m high platform. Many temples had columns and contained tombs.
Size-Temple T 8.8 x 6.4m, enclosed
At Monte Negro elite houses have secret tunnels to the temples suggesting that access to the supernatural beings of the temples was differential
</p><p>Plaza-At Tomaltepec, public buildings flank a rectangular plaza 50m on a side. <sup id="cite_ref-232" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-232">[232]</a></sup>
</p><p>Symbolic Carvings-Present-Monte Alban one public building on the North Platform had a tablero covered with stucco serpentine motifs. Carvings on Temple 2 are the same motifs used to represent blood drops at San Jose Mogote. <sup id="cite_ref-233" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-233">[233]</a></sup>
</p><p>Monuments-Present-Over 300 carved stone monuments known as danzantes. Taller than they are wide they are carved with pictures of individuals in different poses. There is some conjecture as to what the individuals are doing; ideas include dancing, swimming, ecstatic priests.  Flannery and Marcus agree with Coe’s idea that they represent “the corpses of captives slain or sacrificed by the rulers of Monte Alban. The figures carved on the stairway risers are analogous to those on prisoner staircases in the Maya region, where anyone ascending the stairway would tread on their bodies.” <sup id="cite_ref-234" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-234">[234]</a></sup> Carvings show sexually mutilated corpse. <sup id="cite_ref-235" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-235">[235]</a></sup>

</p><p>Anthropomorphic Representations
Present-effigy bottles found in grave goods and elsewhere, thought to represent ancestors and gods. Effigy braziers found at Monte Negro. <sup id="cite_ref-236" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-236">[236]</a></sup>
</p><p>Ritual objects
Present -2 obsidian sacrificial daggers were found in Temple T-south in Monte Negro, they are the same type as those used in later periods to remove the hearts of human sacrificial victims, it is concluded that human sacrifice occurred. <sup id="cite_ref-237" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-237">[237]</a></sup>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ public sacrifice rituals ♥</b> "The Zapotec view of the cosmos was therefore materially inscribed on the art and architecture of the Main Plaza with references to sacrifice, warfare, and the underworld to the south and the celestial realm to the north. If I am correct in my interpretation of the Main Plaza, then rituals like human sacrifice and ancestor veneration, which invoked the cosmic creation, were performed amid a material symbol of the Zapotec cosmos. The scale, accessibility, openness, and symbolism of the Main Plaza indicate that it was constructed as an arena where thousands of people could have participated in public rituals. Until the Nisa phase, the Main Plaza was open on its eastern side, making activities on the plaza accessible to commoners living on the terraces below. Crowds could have entered the plaza from the east, moving from the everyday world of their homes below into a sacred space materializing symbolic references to the sacred past of ancestors, deities, and the cosmic creation. Ceremonies included a blending of traditional activities such as autosacrificial bloodletting, ancestor veneration, divination, and ritual feasting with new practices like human sacrifice (Blanton et al. 1999:105- 7; A. Joyce 2000, 2004; Orr 1997, 2001; Urcid 2008). The images on the Building L-sub and Building J programs could be viewed as processions moved past and would have continually communicated the significance of sacrifice and warfare. Sacrificial practices, especially human sacrifice, were particularly significant in contacting deities and ancestors, reenacting the cosmic creation and the sacred covenant, and renewing the world (A. Joyce 2000; Monaghan 1990). Human sacrifice now linked the activation of the sacred covenant to warfare. Enemies would have been redefined not just as competitors, but also in sacred terms as potential sacrificial victims." <sup id="cite_ref-238" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-238">[238]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ women's rituals ♥</b> "Household rituals continued to be dominated by small, modeled figurines similar to those of earlier periods (Martínez López &amp; Winter 1994), suggesting that the domestic rituals of common people had not changed significantly with the founding of Monte Albán." <sup id="cite_ref-260" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-260">[260]</a></sup> NOTE: Women's rituals are here considered "most widespread" because, unlike other rituals, which were confined to specialised buildings, these ones were performed in virtually every house. Moreover, figurines have been found in Monte Alban's hinterland, not just in Monte Alban itself <sup id="cite_ref-261" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-261">[261]</a></sup>. However, Marcus reconstructs two possible women's rituals, and only one can be coded. The divination ritual has been chosen because it is very slightly better understood. However, relevant passages describing the figurine ritual have been included here because it might be useful. "Although there is no sign of women’s tools or activities near our early public buildings, we do find evidence for women’s ritual in three places: the house (yoho quixi or yoho coba); the associated ramada or lean-to (yoho yaha or yoho yaa); and the surrounding dooryard. These activities are believed to include (1) divination by the casting of beans or maize kernels, and (2) communication with recent ancestors through the use of small solid figurines. "Let us begin with divination, which—by analogy with ethnohistoric descriptions—may have been carried out in special basins in the dooryard of the house. Such basins were waterproofed with a layer of lime plaster, then painted in one of the colors associated with the four Zapotec world directions: red, yellow, white, or black. Two such painted basins were discovered in the yard of a San José phase house, Household C3, at San José Mogote (Fig. 9). East of the house was a red-painted basin, while a yellow-painted basin lay 3 m to the south. The red-painted basin was 1.2 m in diameter and recessed 5 cm into the ground; it had been mud-plastered, given a waterproof coating of lime, then painted red with specular hematite. The yellow-painted basin was similar in every way except color. Whether there were once four basins—each painted a different color and oriented to one of the four world directions—is not known, since exposing the relevant areas of the yard would have required the destruction of a later building (Marcus 1989: fig. 8.20). "We know from sixteenth-century documents that Zapotec diviners sat on a mat and cast maize kernels onto the surface of a water-filled basin, noting whether they fell or floated in groups of 2, 3, 5, or 13. This use of water (niça) for casting lots was called tiniyaaya niça, and it was used to determine the cause and cure of illnesses affecting household members; to predict whether a particular day was auspicious for planting or marriage; or to assign a name to a newborn child. We suspect that the painted basins of Household C3 may have served for such divination (Fig. 10). "Zapotec women also petitioned their recently deceased ancestors for guidance, often doing so in or near the house where that ancestor had lived. We suspect, on the basis of ethnographic analogy, that small solid figurines— of which we have found hundreds in household context—provided the medium to which the spirits of specific ancestors could return during this petitioning. Women preferred to petition their female ancestors, which may account for the fact that the majority of these figurines are women." <sup id="cite_ref-262" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-262">[262]</a></sup> "Women’s ritual seems to have been conducted in the house, the adjacent lean-to, and the surrounding dooryard. The recently deceased ancestors—both males and females, but especially females—appear to have been the focus of much of this ritual. Small solid figurines, sometimes arranged in ritual scenes, evidently provided a venue to which the spirits of the ancestors could return; in that venue they were probably consulted, petitioned, and involved in the ongoing affairs of their descendants. Women also made figurines of animals (principally dogs and birds), which may have served the ancestors as “animal agents” like those described for China." <sup id="cite_ref-263" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-263">[263]</a></sup> "In later periods in China, animals continued to be important as lineage emblems, playing roles in ritual and in communicating with the Sky, Earth, and the dead (Chang 1980: 209).The Shang-period Chinese (1200-1000 b.c.) depicted animals on bronze vessels, including dragons or snakes. Such depictions were called wu, a term that has been translated “animal offerings.”According to K. C. Chang (1983: 65): 'to make animal offerings was a concrete means of achieving communication between heaven and earth, the dead and the living. We thus come to the inevitable conclusion that the animal designs on Shang and Chou bronzes are iconographically meaningful: they are images of the various animals that served as the helpers of shamans and shamanesses in the task of communication between heaven and earth, the spirits and the living.'" <sup id="cite_ref-264" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-264">[264]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ women's rituals ♥</b> "Household rituals continued to be dominated by small, modeled figurines similar to those of earlier periods (Martínez López &amp; Winter 1994), suggesting that the domestic rituals of common people had not changed significantly with the founding of Monte Albán." <sup id="cite_ref-290" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-290">[290]</a></sup> NOTE: Though Marcus reconstructs two possible women's rituals, only one can be coded. The divination ritual has been chosen because it is very slightly better understood. However, relevant passages describing the figurine ritual have been included here because it might be useful. "Although there is no sign of women’s tools or activities near our early public buildings, we do find evidence for women’s ritual in three places: the house (yoho quixi or yoho coba); the associated ramada or lean-to (yoho yaha or yoho yaa); and the surrounding dooryard. These activities are believed to include (1) divination by the casting of beans or maize kernels, and (2) communication with recent ancestors through the use of small solid figurines. "Let us begin with divination, which—by analogy with ethnohistoric descriptions—may have been carried out in special basins in the dooryard of the house. Such basins were waterproofed with a layer of lime plaster, then painted in one of the colors associated with the four Zapotec world directions: red, yellow, white, or black. Two such painted basins were discovered in the yard of a San José phase house, Household C3, at San José Mogote (Fig. 9). East of the house was a red-painted basin, while a yellow-painted basin lay 3 m to the south. The red-painted basin was 1.2 m in diameter and recessed 5 cm into the ground; it had been mud-plastered, given a waterproof coating of lime, then painted red with specular hematite. The yellow-painted basin was similar in every way except color. Whether there were once four basins—each painted a different color and oriented to one of the four world directions—is not known, since exposing the relevant areas of the yard would have required the destruction of a later building (Marcus 1989: fig. 8.20). "We know from sixteenth-century documents that Zapotec diviners sat on a mat and cast maize kernels onto the surface of a water-filled basin, noting whether they fell or floated in groups of 2, 3, 5, or 13. This use of water (niça) for casting lots was called tiniyaaya niça, and it was used to determine the cause and cure of illnesses affecting household members; to predict whether a particular day was auspicious for planting or marriage; or to assign a name to a newborn child. We suspect that the painted basins of Household C3 may have served for such divination (Fig. 10). "Zapotec women also petitioned their recently deceased ancestors for guidance, often doing so in or near the house where that ancestor had lived. We suspect, on the basis of ethnographic analogy, that small solid figurines— of which we have found hundreds in household context—provided the medium to which the spirits of specific ancestors could return during this petitioning. Women preferred to petition their female ancestors, which may account for the fact that the majority of these figurines are women." <sup id="cite_ref-291" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-291">[291]</a></sup> "Women’s ritual seems to have been conducted in the house, the adjacent lean-to, and the surrounding dooryard. The recently deceased ancestors—both males and females, but especially females—appear to have been the focus of much of this ritual. Small solid figurines, sometimes arranged in ritual scenes, evidently provided a venue to which the spirits of the ancestors could return; in that venue they were probably consulted, petitioned, and involved in the ongoing affairs of their descendants. Women also made figurines of animals (principally dogs and birds), which may have served the ancestors as “animal agents” like those described for China." <sup id="cite_ref-292" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-292">[292]</a></sup> "In later periods in China, animals continued to be important as lineage emblems, playing roles in ritual and in communicating with the Sky, Earth, and the dead (Chang 1980: 209).The Shang-period Chinese (1200-1000 b.c.) depicted animals on bronze vessels, including dragons or snakes. Such depictions were called wu, a term that has been translated “animal offerings.”According to K. C. Chang (1983: 65): 'to make animal offerings was a concrete means of achieving communication between heaven and earth, the dead and the living. We thus come to the inevitable conclusion that the animal designs on Shang and Chou bronzes are iconographically meaningful: they are images of the various animals that served as the helpers of shamans and shamanesses in the task of communication between heaven and earth, the spirits and the living.'" <sup id="cite_ref-293" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-293">[293]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ public sacrifice rituals ♥</b> "The Zapotec view of the cosmos was therefore materially inscribed on the art and architecture of the Main Plaza with references to sacrifice, warfare, and the underworld to the south and the celestial realm to the north. If I am correct in my interpretation of the Main Plaza, then rituals like human sacrifice and ancestor veneration, which invoked the cosmic creation, were performed amid a material symbol of the Zapotec cosmos. The scale, accessibility, openness, and symbolism of the Main Plaza indicate that it was constructed as an arena where thousands of people could have participated in public rituals. Until the Nisa phase, the Main Plaza was open on its eastern side, making activities on the plaza accessible to commoners living on the terraces below. Crowds could have entered the plaza from the east, moving from the everyday world of their homes below into a sacred space materializing symbolic references to the sacred past of ancestors, deities, and the cosmic creation. Ceremonies included a blending of traditional activities such as autosacrificial bloodletting, ancestor veneration, divination, and ritual feasting with new practices like human sacrifice (Blanton et al. 1999:105- 7; A. Joyce 2000, 2004; Orr 1997, 2001; Urcid 2008). The images on the Building L-sub and Building J programs could be viewed as processions moved past and would have continually communicated the significance of sacrifice and warfare. Sacrificial practices, especially human sacrifice, were particularly significant in contacting deities and ancestors, reenacting the cosmic creation and the sacred covenant, and renewing the world (A. Joyce 2000; Monaghan 1990). Human sacrifice now linked the activation of the sacred covenant to warfare. Enemies would have been redefined not just as competitors, but also in sacred terms as potential sacrificial victims." <sup id="cite_ref-319" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-319">[319]</a></sup></dd>

<p>We are interested here in any systems of thought and behavior that can influence people's actions, which we term a <i>Normative Ideology</i>.  Normative ideologies are thought-systems concerned with the correct behavior of people, governments/leaders, and other groups (and particularly the relationships between these groups).
</p><p>Mainly, this will be a religious or ritual system. As usual, when we mention Religious or Ritual System our focus  is on the 'official cult', defined the same way as in the Rituals section:
</p>
<dl><dd>With the official cult we refer to the set of collective religious practices that are most closely associated with legitimation of the power structure (including elites, if any).</dd></dl>
<p>However, Normative Ideologies are not restricted to religious/ritual systems. They include other thought systems, such as philosophy or anything that prescribes a particular pattern of behaviour. An example is  classical Greek philosophy, such as the works of Plato and Aristotle, who were concerned with correct or moral behaviour and whose thoughts influenced the actual practice of several societies (the empire of Alexander the Great, notably).

</p><p><b>♠ Rulers control supernatural energy ♣ inferred present ♥</b> "The role of nobles as ritual specialists, especially sacrificers, dramatically communicated and reinforced their identities as mediators between commoners and the sacred." <sup id="cite_ref-643" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-643">[643]</a></sup> However, the following is also worth noting: "If the number of vessels interred as burial offerings is related to a person’s commensal networks and perhaps to the number of people participating in the mortuary ceremony, then both nobles and influential commoners had extensive social ties. Effigy vessels and urns, sometimes depicting Cocijo, and a variety of zoomorphic vessels usually representing animals associated with water including ducks, conch shells, frogs, and toads are much more common in tombs and burials with elaborate offerings. These data suggest that associations with rain and the rain god were related to status, both achieved and ascribed by birth.

<p><b>Human sacrifice</b> (HS) is defined as deliberate and ritualized killing of an individual to please or placate supernatural beings. Common examples of supernatural beings are gods and ancestors, including a recently deceased one. In other words, sacrificing humans to follow a high-status individual in the afterlife is a legitimate example of HS. HS is distinct from capital punishment, however, even for offenses against religion (e.g., burning of heretics, punishment of vestals for transgressions). Such practices should be coded as <b>Capital Punishment for Religious Offenses</b>. Execution of 'witches' even if regularly occurring at funerals of a high-status individual is not HS. We can reflect such practices under <b>Capital Punishment for Witchcraft</b>. See Law, Robin. 1985. Human Sacrifice in Pre-Colonial West Africa. African Affairs 84 (334):53-87 for further discussion.

<dd> <b>♠ Public markets ♣ suspected unknown  ♥</b> "We also have no evidence that any production took place in nondomestic, state-supervised workshops; rather craft manufacture appears to have remained in residential contexts. Instead of a redistributive economy, we postulate that much Period I exchange occurred in marketplaces frequented by household producers and consumers (Blanton 1983; Blanton, Kowalewski, Feinman, and Appel 1982:65-68; Feinman, Blanton, and Kowalewski 1984). If production was primarily in the hands of households, it is hard to see how distribution or exchange could have been controlled by a central political institution. Market exchange and marketplaces certainly were important when the Spanish first described sixteenth-century Oaxaca, and they continue to be important institutions to this day (Beals 1975; Cook and Diskin 1976). It seems reasonable to suggest that these thriving contact-period institutions had a long prior history, even though it is difficult to identify market exchange or even marketplaces archaeologically. We still lack indisputable evidence for this hypothesis. Our surveys did find at least one site that had features consistent with a marketplace - a low hill in the middle of the Valle Grande area, south of Monte Albán, not in one of the district capitals or other civic-ceremonial centers, but between them, at the intersection of three proposed district boundaries. The site dates to Early and Late I. It has no mounds; instead it has a large (55 by 38 meters), open, easily accessible platform bordered by large boulders. There is an unusual amount of artifactual evidence here for specialized production: misfired pottery, dense concentrations of chipped chert and quartzite, a tunnel into bedrock apparently to mine quartz, two circular bedrock features that may have served in a grinding or pounding operation, and a bark beater for making paper (Blanton, Kowalewski, Feinman, and Appel 1982:262).

<p><b>♠ Irrigation works ♣ inferred present ♥</b> "The series of civic water control features connecting the North Platform area with the North Barranca reservoir constitutes such an integrated system. The functions of drainage, collection, filtration, transport, and impoundment of water for domestic use are performed by specialized water control features. Independent construction of these specialized features is not likely since they are of little use when not operating as part of the complete system. This indicates a certain amount of central planning on the part of the Monte Alban elite. The planning of this system may have taken place as early as Late Monte Alban I (400-150 B.C.) since the North Platform was well underway by this time and a test excavation made by Kuttruff and Autry (1978) into the base of the diversionarydefensive wall which forms the reservoir in the North Barranca indicates a Late Monte Alban I construction date. Beginning of the system may be traced to the Early Monte Alban I phase (500-400 B.C.) since Caso, Bernal, and Acosta (1967: 96) report an Early Monte Alban I platform with a drain carved into bedrock in their North Platform excavations. While the degree of centralization needed to construct and maintain the system is unknown, the presence of a functionally complex water supply system, combined with the monumental architecture of the Main Plaza, indicate a centralized authority able to plan, mobilize, and coordinate labour on a large scale. Thus, the civic water supply system adds another dimension which must be considered in discussions about the classification of Monte Alban as urban or the centre of a military confederacy. Agricultural water control features are also present at Monte Alban. The most complex agricultural water control system is the dam and canal system which irrigated approximately 50 h. of the Xoxocotlan piedmont east of Monte Alban. This system was in use during Early and Late Monte Alban I (550-I50 B.C.) and was abandoned at the beginning of Monte Alban II. The agricultural system is smaller and less complex than the civic system and probably could have been managed and maintained by the population which lived along the canal. It has been estimated that the Xoxocotlan piedmont agricultural system could have fed, at most, 250 people (O'Brien, et al. i979; Mason, et al. I977). The civic water control system, however, probably supplied water to a substantial percentage of the population of Monte Alban, estimated by Blanton (1978: 30) to have been over 15,000 during the Classic period."<sup id="cite_ref-716" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-716">[716]</a></sup> "As early as the San José phase, maize farmers in the Valley of Oaxaca supplemented water from rainfall with simple irrigation techniques (Flannery et al. 1967). Their repertoire included pot or well irrigation - a labor-intensive strategy that can be employed in many alluvial zones of the valley. One aspect of well irrigation is that it can be implemented by a single farmer or the members of one household. Early Oaxaca farmers also likely secured water by building modest check dams and small channels to divert water from seasonal runoffs and the temporary streams that run during the rainy season. These irrigation techniques also required no central management and little or no labor from outside the household. Neither large-scale irrigation systems nor massive networks of canals have been important during the long history of this region."<sup id="cite_ref-717" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-717">[717]</a></sup>  The use of small scale canal irrigation systems is inferred from the presence of settlements in the piedmont area (which would require some water control), but direct evidence for irrigation is found in the later periods.
