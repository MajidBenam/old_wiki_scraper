<dl><dd>The Badarian, a Neolithic archaeological culture located in Upper Egypt and dating from c. 4400 to 3300 BCE, was first described in 1928 by archaeologists Guy Brunton and Gertrude Caton-Thompson, who excavated in the Badari district near Assyut.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> Its relationship to an earlier culture, called the Tasian, is unclear,<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> but there is some evidence to link it to the later Naqada I period in Upper Egypt.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> Little is known of the everyday lives of the people who occupied the Badarian sites: our information comes mainly from the numerous grave sites in the region around Assyut.</dd></dl>
<p><i>Population and political organization</i>
</p>
<dl><dd>Research on Badarian sites has yielded a total of about 600 graves and 40 poorly documented settlements.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> The culture was first identified in the el-Badari region, near the modern city of Sohag, but several small sites near the villages of Qau el-Kebir, Hammamiya, Mostagedda, and Matmar are also categorized as Badarian.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> Characteristic Badarian material culture has also been discovered much further south at Mahgar Dendera, Armant, Elkab, and Hierakonpolis, as well as to the east of the Nile in the Wadi Hammamat.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The archaeology of the period has inevitably been affected by the flooding of the Nile over the millennia: any larger, more permanent settlements were likely situated close to the great river and subsequently washed away or covered with alluvium.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> Surviving remains come from raised desert spurs and include 'huts and windbreaks associated with hearths and large, well-shaped granary pits or silos'.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> A Badarian settlement at Deir Tasa covered an area of about 5000 square metres.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> At the Seshat standard of 50-200 inhabitants per hectare, this gives us an estimated population between the range of 25 and 100 inhabitants.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Evidence from Badarian settlements shows that the people who occupied these sites were primarily engaged in agriculture and animal husbandry,<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> but we know trade also occurred. Badarians imported raw materials like wood, turquoise, shells and ivory and exchanged goods with groups from as far away as Palestine, the Red Sea and Syria.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> Model boats found at the site of Merimda to the north 'suggest that boats and canoes were already in use [in Egypt] before 4500 B.C.'<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Very little can be concluded about Badarian political and social structure, but analysis of grave goods shows that there was an unequal distribution of wealth, and that the wealthier graves tended to be kept separate within the cemeteries.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> However, no monumental remains have been found so it is likely that higher-status members of society did not command a significant labour force.</dd></dl>

</p><p>Evidence for warfare in the Sudan goes back to the Upper Paleolithic period. "When the Aswan Dam was built, a great deal of archaeology was undertaken along the Nile River in Upper Egypt and Sudan. From this research scholars know that toward the end of the Paelolithic, about ten thousand to two thousand years ago, a graveyard was used by foragers along the Nile. Evidence was found there for warfare as intense as any known from anywhere in the past. The graveyard held the remains of fifty-nine people, at least twenty-four of whom showed direct evidence of violent death, including stone points from arrows or spears within the body cavity, and many contained several points. There were six multiple burials, and almost all those individuals had points in them, indicating that the people in each mass grave were killed in a single event and then buried together."<sup id="cite_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-82">[82]</a></sup>
</p><p>Another reference for this: "A total of 59 skeletons of men, women and children were recovered from a Qadan cemetery ... believed to be around 12,000 years old. ... A second unusual feature of the burials was the placement of 110 stone artefacts, almost all in positions that suggest they had penetrated the bodies as either arrow or spear points. ... Indeed, several pieces were found still embedded in the sphenoid bones of the skull, in positions that indicate the projectiles had entered from under the lower jaw. In all, more than 40 per cent of the burials contained these smallf flake points. Four persons had suffered multiple wounds, with points still embedded in their bones. In the majority of cases, however, the points were not embedded in bone but lay within the skeletal remains, suggesting they had penetrated the soft tissue. One grave yielded eight bodies that had apparently been buried together. Fractures on the arms and deep cut marks on the legs give further testimony to the violent nature of their deaths."<sup id="cite_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-83">[83]</a></sup>

One grave yielded eight bodies that had apparently been buried together. Fractures on the arms and deep cut marks on the legs give further testimony to the violent nature of their deaths."<sup id="cite_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-85">[85]</a></sup>

However, we know that the graves were dug in soft, sandy gravel or limestone detritus, which could be easily dug into with primitive tools<sup id="cite_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-88">[88]</a></sup>. Shape of the grave is not clearly defined but it was more or less oval and roofed by the mats<sup id="cite_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-89">[89]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-90">[90]</a></sup>.

There is no evidence of putting effort into preserving the bodies in any way, but the internal organs had always disappeared<sup id="cite_ref-93" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-93">[93]</a></sup>.
There were some differences between graves of males and females. In poorer groups the size was different<sup id="cite_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-94">[94]</a></sup>. Guy Brunton has said that "the graves which were not sexed were in most cases plundered, and we may therefore conclude that they were richer than the smaller untouched ones<sup id="cite_ref-95" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-95">[95]</a></sup>", but according to Trigger, this fact does not necessarily indicate a lack of social stratification<sup id="cite_ref-96" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-96">[96]</a></sup>.
The typical burial kit contained food, and accessories like stone pallets, ivory spoons and vases, all of which appear to have been associated with the grinding and use of green face-paint<sup id="cite_ref-97" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-97">[97]</a></sup>.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ competitive feast ♥</b> "The rich resources of the Nile combined with the new domesticates could be effectively and intensively exploited. Ambitious individuals would be able to collect considerable surpluses and organise competitive feasts in order to control labour, loyalties and loans, thus gaining power and prestige (Hakansson 1994; Hayden 2003)." <sup id="cite_ref-99" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-99">[99]</a></sup> Based on his ethnoarchaeological studies of transegalitarian Southeast Asian societies, Hayden <sup id="cite_ref-100" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-100">[100]</a></sup> writes: "Some of the major conclusions that I and my students have developed are that feasts are critical for the conversion of surplus production into social and political ties through the creation of debt relationships and the display of mutual support (Adams 2001; Clarke 2001; Perodie 2001; Hayden 2001a). Feasting relationships are fundamental to structuring power relationships within communities, and have even been described as an institution comparable to parliamentary democracy (Clarke 2001). Typically, support networks and competition between networks operate primarily at the level of lineages or corporate kindreds (such as the tongkonans in the Torajan area), with only a loose correspondence between individual household production and feasting activity. However, in all situations, it is clear that feasting constitutes the single most important consumption activity of surpluses and that there is significant competition to display wealth at the most important feasts. Feasts can also be used to underwrite major labour-intensive projects such as house building, irrigation works, planting and harvesting (Dietler and Herbrich 2001; Dietler 1990)."</dd>

Ambitious individuals would be able to collect considerable surpluses and organise competitive feasts in order to control labour, loyalties and loans, thus gaining power and prestige (Hakansson 1994; Hayden 2003)." <sup id="cite_ref-124" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-124">[124]</a></sup> Based on his ethnoarchaeological studies of transegalitarian Southeast Asian societies, Hayden <sup id="cite_ref-125" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-125">[125]</a></sup> writes: "Some of the major conclusions that I and my students have developed are that feasts are critical for the conversion of surplus production into social and political ties through the creation of debt relationships and the display of mutual support (Adams 2001; Clarke 2001; Perodie 2001; Hayden 2001a). Feasting relationships are fundamental to structuring power relationships within communities, and have even been described as an institution comparable to parliamentary democracy (Clarke 2001). Typically, support networks and competition between networks operate primarily at the level of lineages or corporate kindreds (such as the tongkonans in the Torajan area), with only a loose correspondence between individual household production and feasting activity. However, in all situations, it is clear that feasting constitutes the single most important consumption activity of surpluses and that there is significant competition to display wealth at the most important feasts. Feasts can also be used to underwrite major labour-intensive projects such as house building, irrigation works, planting and harvesting (Dietler and Herbrich 2001; Dietler 1990)."</dd>

In some cemeteries, there is evidence for dismemberment of the body, a burial custom not attested in earlier times. Parts of the body were buried or reburied separately; in a number of cases the skull has been detached from the body and in a tomb at Naqada several skulls and long bones have been carefully laid out along the walls of the tomb.
