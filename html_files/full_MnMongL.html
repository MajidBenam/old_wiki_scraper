<dl><dd>After the Yuan dynasty collapsed in 1368, Toghon Temur, its last emperor retired with his army to Mongolia, where he established a new state, with Karakorum as its capital, that extended from Manchuria to Kyrgyzstan between the Great Wall of China and Lake Baikal.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> The new Mongolian polity was actually a loose alliance of six tribal confederations or tümens united under a common Khan, and the Khalkhas were one of these confederations. The Khalkhas were themselves divided into the Northern and Southern Khalkhas, and the Northern Khalkhas were divided into left-flank and right-flank Khalkhas For much of their history, the Khalkhas fought against the neighbouring Oirat confederation, with only a few decades' truce in the first half of the seventeenth century. In 1662, conflict flared up between the left-flank and right-flank Khalkhas, but it was the Oirats' invasion under Zungharian leadership that led to the fall of the Khalkha confederacy, as it pushed the Khalkhas to request Beijing's protection, which the Chinese emperor granted in 1691, in exchange for political submission.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup></dd></dl>

</p><p>"Despite the growing intimacy of Manchu-Mongol ties, one major Mon- gol leader, Ligdan (Linden) Khan of the Chahars, resolutely opposed the growing Manchu power. As the last descendant of Chinggis Khan, he held an official Yuan seal and viewed himself as the legitimate representative of the Mongolian imperial tradition. But after his losses in battle to the Man- chus in 1628 and 1632, the Manchus took over the Yuan seal and enrolled the Eastern Mongols as a whole in the banner system. Ligdan Khan’s son married a Manchu princess after Ligdan died of smallpox in Qinghai. The Chahar and Khalkha Mongols comprised 384 niru with 19,580 families, the Khorcin 448 niru with 22,308 families." <sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>
</p><p>So the total population of the Chahar and Khalkhas in the 1630s was comprised between 58,740 and 156,640 people using an estimate of 3-8 people per family. Halving this figure to exclude the Chahar, we get a rough population estimate of 30,000-80,000 people for the Khalkhas.

was headed by the grandson of Abtai Khan, the Tüsheet khan Ghombodorji. It consisted of three large aymaqs (princedoms). The largest and most important of these was the aymaq of the Tüsheet khan himself. The other two aymaqs of the right and left flanks were under the direct control of their own khans, who were subordinate to the Tüsheet khan. The leader of the left-flank aymaq was the Sechen khan, and of the right-flank aymaq, the Jasaghtu khan. As previously, the aymaqs continued to be divided into qoshuns, which were headed by jasaq noyans. The Tüsheet khan’s aymaq had two large qoshuns, the Sechen khan’s a single qoshun and the Jasaghtu khan’s four small qoshuns.

In implementation of this decision, Altan Khan and Khutughtai Sechen Khongtaiji received the head of the Yellow Hat sect, the third Dalai Lama, with great pomp in 1577. The Tümed and Ordos Mongols con- verted simultaneously to Buddhism. On meeting the Dalai Lama at Altan Khan’s head- quarters, Abtai Khan also declared his desire to convert the whole of northern Mongolia to the Buddhist faith.&nbsp;» <sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>

It was famous for its extreme monasticism, theocracy eventually symbolized by the person of the Dalai Lama reigning from Lhassa, and a complex system of reincarnations. This also meant a lasting and mutually supportive relationship between the Mongol and Tibetan churches, which began in 1578 when Sonam-Gyatso (or bSod-nams rgya-mts’o, if we follow the generally accepted scholarly transliteration), chief of the Tibetan church, came to Mongolia to organize the new junior branch. It was at that point that the title Dalai Lama appeared for the first time - a Mongolian-Tibetan hybrid with the connotation of “Universal Lama” - apparently bestowed upon the Tibetan prelate by Altan Khan and from then on assumed by the spiritual and temporal chief of the Tibetan church. Sonam-Gyatso then returned to Tibet, but not without leaving in Mongolia a substitute of sorts, a “Living Buddha” who then resided at the aforementioend Köke-khoto or Huehot, a city in Inner Mongolia near the northeastern bend of the Yellow River and now the capital of China’s Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region." <sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup>

Furthermore, as in the case of the Holy Roman Empire, the Northern Yuan or the Mongolian state was highly fragmented. Just as the individual territorial princes of the Empire were following one or the other Christian orders, the Mongol princes were also divided into the followers of the Red and Yellow sects of Lamaism. While German rulers were in conflict over the issue of sovereignty, the conflict in the Mongol world was much fiercer. The Mongol Great Khan was trying to subdue the recalcitrant princely domains, while the princes were fiercely defending their sovereignties over their immediate domains.//"In fact, the 1640 assembly was preceded by the 1637 religious war between Tsogt Khun Taiji of Khalkha, supporting Red Hat sects, and the Oirat force led by Güüshi Khan Törü-Baikhu of

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Great Quriltai ♥</b> <i>To be confirmed by experts. There is no evidence in the literature to suggest that later Mongols gathered at the quriltai like their ancestors, but this seems a reasonable inference to make.</i> "The quriltai was a large gathering of people coming from distant places, which could last for many weeks. At its centre was the discussion of pressing issues by members of Chinggis Khan’s family, imperial sons-in-law, captains of the army and others; a notable feature of the quriltai is the participation of women. The discussions were accompanied by feasting and drinking and the wearing of elaborate robes. The quriltai was an institution suited to and partially reflecting the reality of the Mongols’ nomadic existence. 'In a pastoral nomadic economy and society in which a wide dispersal of people and herds was ecologically necessary, it is not surprising to find the existence of a consultative institution which brought together people from great distances.' It served the practical function of bringing leaders together to allow important decisions to be made, usually through creating consensus through discussion; it fostered unity among the participants and reinforced or clarified relations of superiority or inferiority. It sometimes contained extremely important ritual elements, such as the seating of the khan on a throne, the removing of belts and hats in order to salute the new ruler, or an elaborate and expensive redistribution of goods with the aim of promoting loyalty."[...] As for attendance at quriltais being compulsory, this is demonstrated by the delays in holding quriltais, where one or the other of those whose presence was expected declined to come. For example, the quriltai for the enthronement of Güyük was delayed for three years because some of the princes refused to come.[...] While it was difficult to coerce people to come, pressure could be applied, for example in the form of the threat of Menggeser, Möngke’s ǰarγuči, who decreed that the punishment for non-attendance and holding one’s own private festivities was decapitation; a law aimed at rivals for the position of qa’an who might have tried to hold their own quriltais.[...] "Secondly, the decisions taken were binding; ‘dissenting opinions’ were not allowed and everyone who attended was bound to support the quriltai’s decisions. It is because the decisions were binding that some tried so hard to avoid attending certain quriltais, or felt betrayed if they attended and the outcome was not what they had anticipated. [...] "Moreover, the main reason for holding a quriltai was often to give legal force to decisions which, in fact had already been taken. Decisions about succession were often settled through military means or negotiation long before a quriltai, yet a quriltai gave the decision its legitimacy and legal force. Various concrete actions during the quriltai, such as an enthronement or the distribution of gifts, helped give legitimacy to the decisions taken but even these actions would not be sufficient for legitimacy if the attendance were not as expected. All this shows that the quriltais were a legal institution. [...] "However, its legal aspect was not restricted to the legislative task of formally making decisions about succession to leadership, administrative or military matters. Rather, as Mansura Haidar has noted, it also had a judicial function in that legal cases were often judged during quriltais." <sup id="cite_ref-112" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-112">[112]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b>♠ Orthopraxy checks ♣ present ♥</b> "In the fifth moon of summer [of the sixth year of Ögödei's reign: May 30-June 27, 1234], the emperor (Ögödei) was at the place [called] Ta-lan Ta pa (Dalan Daba(n)). He assembled the imperial princes and the sundry officials at a Great Quriltai, where he decreed [the following] articles and ordinances (t 'iao-ling), saying: "Whenever a quriltai is being held and there are those who do not attend but instead hold private feasts, they should be decapitated. As for all who go in and out of the imperial restricted quarters, each has [his] attendants. [Whether] men or women, they may have only ten people as attendants, and they must not mix with each other while going in and out. In the army, for every ten men, there should be appointed a chief of ten (chia-chang). They are to obey their military commanders; those who act improperly on their own authority will be sentenced to punishment. As for a chief of ten (chia-chang) who because of [official] business comes to the imperial quarters, he must then [in his absence] appoint one person as a temporary assistant and one person in charge of external affairs, and the two people must not improperly without authorization come and go. As for those who violate [this ordinance], punish them. As for government matters, if a person ought not to speak of them but does speak, box his ears. If he again breaks [this ordinance], beat him with the light stick (ch'ih). If he breaks [this ordinance] for a third time, beat him with the heavy stick (chang). If he breaks [this ordinance] for a fourth time, sentence him to death. As for the sundry chiliarchs (ch'ien-hu), if one should exceed [the authority of] the myriarch (wan-hu) by walking in front of him, shoot him with a wood-tipped arrow. As for the centurions (po-hu), the chiefs of ten (chia-chang), and the sundry troops, if they violate [this ordinance], their punishment shall be the same. As for those who do not comply with this law (fa), dismiss them. From this time onward, if the number of troops who have come to a quriltai is insufficient, make up the number from nearby wings (of the army). Common people whether at home or in the army are prohibited from making a noisy clamour. In all cases when coming to the quriltai, use one tethering rope for [every] fifty fine horses; five men as guards; three men to feed emaciated horses; and three men to look after the place where one dismounts from horses (ch'i-lieh-ssu/Mongolian: kires). If but one or two horses are stolen, then sentence [the thieves] to death. As for the common people's horses which should not be tied at the place where one dismounts from horses (ch'i- lieh-ssu), forthwith confiscate them and give them to the people who care for the tigers and leopards (hu-pao-jen) for feed. As for women who make clothes for the chih-sun (jisuin) feasts which are not in accordance with the [sumptuary] regulations, as well as [women] who are jealous (tu-che), they shall be sentenced to the punishment of riding a cow bareback around the center of the capital, and then they shall have their property collected in order that [the husband] may remarry." <sup id="cite_ref-156" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-156">[156]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ divination ♥</b> <i>To be confirmed by experts. There is no evidence in the literature to suggest that later Mongols practiced divination rituals like their ancestors, but this seems a reasonable inference to make.</i> "Divining by reading the cracks in burnt bones, an almost universal practice in ancient Eurasia, was the major method of divination in the MONGOL EMPIRE and was practiced until recent times. While in ancient Shang China tortoise shells were burned by a piece of hot iron, the Mongols always used sheep scapula, or shoulder blades, and simply placed them in a fire. The great khans of the Mongol Empire used scapulimancy to divine the will of heaven (TENGGERI) before virtually every decision. CHINGGIS KHAN carried a charred sheep pelvis as an amulet. This divination was performed by the khans themselves, by shamans (bö’e, modern böö), and sometimes by foreign divination experts, such as YELÜ CHUCAI (1190-1244). The inquirer first had to whisper to the shoulder blade, and then the blade was burned. A straight vertical crack meant yes, and a horizontal crack or splintering meant no." <sup id="cite_ref-172" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-172">[172]</a></sup> Franciscan missionary William of Rubruck had this to say: "I learnt that [the Khan] does nothing in the world without first consulting these bones; he does not even allow a person to enter his dwelling without first consulting them. This kind of divination is done as follows when he wishes to do anything, he has brought him three of these bones not previously charred, and holding one, he thinks of the thing about which he wishes to consult it, whether he shall do it or not; and then he hands it to a servant to burn. And there are two little buildings beside the dwelling in which he lives, in which they burn these bones, and these bones are looked for diligently every day through-out the whole camp." <sup id="cite_ref-173" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-173">[173]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ divination ♥</b> <i>To be confirmed by experts. There is no evidence in the literature to suggest that later Mongols practiced divination rituals like their ancestors, but this seems a reasonable inference to make.</i> "Divining by reading the cracks in burnt bones, an almost universal practice in ancient Eurasia, was the major method of divination in the MONGOL EMPIRE and was practiced until recent times. While in ancient Shang China tortoise shells were burned by a piece of hot iron, the Mongols always used sheep scapula, or shoulder blades, and simply placed them in a fire. The great khans of the Mongol Empire used scapulimancy to divine the will of heaven (TENGGERI) before virtually every decision. CHINGGIS KHAN carried a charred sheep pelvis as an amulet. This divination was performed by the khans themselves, by shamans (bö’e, modern böö), and sometimes by foreign divination experts, such as YELÜ CHUCAI (1190-1244). The inquirer first had to whisper to the shoulder blade, and then the blade was burned. A straight vertical crack meant yes, and a horizontal crack or splintering meant no." <sup id="cite_ref-241" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-241">[241]</a></sup> Franciscan missionary William of Rubruck had this to say: "I learnt that [the Khan] does nothing in the world without first consulting these bones; he does not even allow a person to enter his dwelling without first consulting them. This kind of divination is done as follows when he wishes to do anything, he has brought him three of these bones not previously charred, and holding one, he thinks of the thing about which he wishes to consult it, whether he shall do it or not; and then he hands it to a servant to burn. And there are two little buildings beside the dwelling in which he lives, in which they burn these bones, and these bones are looked for diligently every day through-out the whole camp." <sup id="cite_ref-242" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-242">[242]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ drinking gatherings ♥</b> "[Papal envoy] Rubruck observed that drinking gatherings in the tent of the master or leading figure of the group was always preceded by ritual offerings. First, the steward sprinkled some of the drink on the household effigies, which included, 'by the entrance on the women's side, an idol with a cow's udder for the women who milk the cows, for this is a woman's job. On the other side of the door towards the men is another image with a mare's udder, for the men who milk the mares' (in Dawson 1955: 96). Then the steward stepped outside the tent holding a goblet of drink and sprinkled three times toward the south, genuflecting each time, in honor of fire, then toward the east in honor of the air, toward the west in honor of water, then toward the north for the sake of the dead (Jackson and Morgan 1990: 76). Returning to the tent, the steward and two attendants offered drink to the master and his wife. Before the master drank, he poured a libation of wine onto the ground 'as its share.' Should the master be mounted, the offering would be poured on the horse's neck or mane before drinking began. "Only after the offerings were made could drinking start, initiated by the master. A musician stood near the <i>kumiss</i> [fermented mare's milk] pitchers at the door, and when the master began to drink, the steward called 'Ha!' and the musician struck up. When the master had drunk, the steward shouted again, the musician stopped, then 'they all drink round in turn, men and women alike, and at times compete with one another in quaffing in a thoroughly distasteful and greedy fashion' (Rubruck in Jackson and Morgan 1990: 77). According to Carpini [another Papal envoy] (in Dawson 1955: 57), no Mongol prince ever drank, especially in public, without there being singing and guitar playing for them. At feast, the guests clapped their hands and danced to the sound of the music while the master was drinking, the men in front of the master and the women in front of the mistress. Drinking games were a feature of these gatherings. Anyone reluctant to take up a drinking challenge would be seized, and his ears pulled vigorously until his mouth opened and the drink could be poured in, while the others clapped and danced." <sup id="cite_ref-310" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-310">[310]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ blood brotherhood ritual ♥</b> In the fifth century BCE, Herodotus says they were performed by the Scythians <sup id="cite_ref-350" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-350">[350]</a></sup> (typically the first people mentioned in histories of Central Eurasia, even though they never reached as far as our NGA), we know that the Khitan performed them in the tenth century at least <sup id="cite_ref-351" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-351">[351]</a></sup>, and we know that the Mongols performed them in subsequent centuries <sup id="cite_ref-352" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-352">[352]</a></sup>. This suggests continuity between the Scythians, Khitan and Mongols, which in turn suggests that the blood brotherhood ritual was probably performed by peoples that inhabited Central Eurasia after the Scythians and before the Khitan - and these people may well have included the Xiungnu. "Herodotus also tells us that the Scythians give each other sworn pledges by pouring their blood, mixed with wine, into a bowl in which they dip a sword, arrows, an axe and a javelin before drinking from it. We may note that the use of arrows in making a 'blood-brother' agreement is evidenced in the case of Genghis Khan and also in East (or Chinese) Turkistan (now Sinkiang or Xinjiang in north-west China): there, as generally among the Turks and Mongols, the weapons represent the souls of men themselves." <sup id="cite_ref-353" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-353">[353]</a></sup> "Arrows (along with bows, saddles, horses, and gowns) also figure in ritual exchanges made between two men who agree to be blood-brothers." <sup id="cite_ref-354" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-354">[354]</a></sup>. "Found in many Turco-Mongol nomadic societies, the ritual of blood brotherhood involved drinking from a cup into which blood from both parties had been poured. The 'brothers' would then exchange gifts and usually spend some time living in the same YURT, or <i>ger</i>.

Rulers following Buddhism after the late 16th century would have believed in karma. Although there is no submission to a religious figure in Buddhism, the concept of karma acknowledges that every action is taken into account to determine whether one's life (and future reincarnations) will be improved or undergo hardships. This concept takes the agency away from gods and kings: karma could mature after thousands of years and come to fruition. External disasters, for instance, can be the manifestation of collective karma. <sup id="cite_ref-409" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-409">[409]</a></sup></dd>

</p><p><b>♠ Description of the Normative Ideology ♣ ♥</b> "In 1581 Abatai Khan invited a lama from HOHHOT to the Khalkha and converted to Buddhism (see SECOND CONVERSION). In 1585 he built the great monastery ERDENI ZUU. In 1639 the left-flank Khalkha nobility recognized the son of the Tushiyetu Khan Gombo-Dorji (fl. 1639-55), the grandson of Abatai Khan, as an INCARNATE LAMA, the FIRST JIBZUNDAMBA KHUTUGTU. After this first Bogda (Holy One), known as Zanabazar (1635-1723), returned from study in Tibet in 1651, he became the supreme authority among the Khalkha." <sup id="cite_ref-432" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-432">[432]</a></sup> "The Second Conversion refers to the Buddhist missionary movement from 1566 to around 1650, through which Buddhism became the sole authorized religion among the Mongols. [...] From 1585 to 1588 the Third Dalai Lama personally toured southwest Inner Mongolia. In 1585 a ruler of KHALKHA (Mongolia proper), ABATAI KHAN (1554-88), learned about Buddhism from a party of merchants from the Tumed region and began building a temple. The next year he personally visited the Dalai Lama at Altan Khan’s capital, Guihua (modern HOHHOT). [...] "Mantras and numbered categories, such as the Three Jewels, the 'six syllables' om mani padme hum, and the eightfold restraint (moral rules), transmitted basic instruction. Neichi Toin and his patrons rewarded anyone who memorized the mantra of the fierce protector deity Yamantaka. Neichi Toin was later accused of freely giving out Yamantaka initiations to commoners and was recalled from the mission field by the Manchu emperor on advice of the Fifth Dalai Lama in 1652. Key political leaders, both male and female, everywhere received the Tantric Hevajra initiation. "Conversion narratives suggest varied patterns for individual conversion. Neichi Toin rejected the world when he saw the death throes of a pregnant wild ass he and his friends had shot. Altan and Abatai converted after successful campaigns had confirmed their leadership; they saw reestablishing the 'TWO CUSTOMS' (khoyar yosu) of religion and state as a way of confirming their success. Miracles, healings, and supernatural contests played a role. Reading Mongolian translations of Buddhist hagiographies and viewing the splendor of mandalas and other Tantric rituals are also mentioned as strengthening weak faith. Although not treated in detail in the sources, it seems clear that women played the leading role in promoting conversion; virtually every strong male adherent can be linked to a devout woman, either his wife or a blood relative. "The Second Conversion was fiercely intolerant of the native Mongolian religion. The JEWEL TRANSLUCENT SUTRA (1607) boasts that under Altan Khan 'the mad and stupid shamans were annihilated and the shamanesses humiliated.' Khutugtai Sechen Khung-Taiji prescribed harsh penalties for funerary blood sacrifices, making or sacrificing to an ONGGHON (spirit figurines), or striking a monk. Instead, yurts were to have six-armed Mahakalas worshiped with fasting and bloodless offerings, and funerals were to be marked by almsgiving. In Khorchin government messengers accompanied by Neichi Toin’s disciples collected enough ongghons to fill a YURT, all of which were burned. Later codes, such as the 1640 MONGOL-OIRAT CODE, reduced unrealistically severe penalties to more practical livestock fines but kept the prohibitions on shamanist activity. "Apart from these laws, few other Mongolian practices were directly banned. Human sacrifice disappeared rapidly. Individual hunting and the eating of horse flesh were discouraged, but collective public hunts continued and were enshrined in the Mongol-Oirat Code. Strikingly, the EIGHT WHITE YURTS, or shrine of CHINGGIS KHAN, with its blood sacrifices, remained an integral part of government even in a Buddhist utopia such as the CHAGHAN TEuKE (White history). "This new exclusivist vision of dGe-lugs-pa Buddhism also targeted the older orders still found in eastern and northern Mongolia. The Fifth Dalai Lama (1617-82) told an eminent Mongolian lama returning from education in Tibet: 'If you propagate the Old Teaching in the Mongol lands it will only bring bad luck! If anybody else tries to spread them, you must stop him!'" <sup id="cite_ref-433" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-433">[433]</a></sup> "Two Customs (Khoyar Yosu) This concept, along with the allied concept of “offering site and almsgiver” (or priest and patron), linked the Buddhist religion to imperial rule in Inner Asia. The “Two Customs” of Buddhist religion (shashin) and monarchical rule (tOrO) established a mutually harmonious relation between the two fundamental orders of society, celibate monks and married householders. The monarch served as an “almsgiver” (Oglige-yin ejen, from Tibetan yon-bdag) to the monks, who served as an “offering site” (takhil-un oron, from Tibetan mchod-gnas). The monarch also had the duty to ensure the discipline of the monastic community (sangha), expelling the unfit. From the Tangut XIA DYNASTY (1038-1227) on, the monarch would ideally receive an initiation into one of the great Tantric Buddhist deities following a preparatory course of study with fastings and meditations and would prostrate himself before his lama- teacher. While shocking to defenders of imperial prerogatives, this Tantric pupil-teacher relation was the acme of the “almsgiver-offering-site” relation. (Although the translation “two principles” has become common, the word yosu in Mongolian is always “custom,” with its implication of past tradition.)" <sup id="cite_ref-434" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-434">[434]</a></sup>

Consequently, Buddhism’s ethical system emerged resting squarely on a body of preestablished forms of family practice, and supported by a fairly codified sociolegal system that had already taken form under the aegis of the Brahmanical tradition, sometime before the sixth-century bce. Thus, as a relatively late arriver, Buddhism accepted, tacitly, many of the given forms of social praxis in India. And, even when Buddhism sought to redefine religious goals and family values, these efforts were manifested vis-a-vis patterns that had already been in place for centuries.

If we take care of our own spiritual development, we render a service to others; and if we develop love towards others, we thereby also help ourselves. Accordingly, it is explicitly stated, someone who pursues the path of salvation only for his or her own benefit is to be censured, while the one who follows the path for one’s own benefit and for the benefit of others is to be commended (see AN 7:64).' <sup id="cite_ref-465" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-465">[465]</a></sup> 'Three segments of the Noble Eightfold Path (3 - 5) are traditionally subsumed under the principle of morality (sila): ‘right speech’ (3), ‘right action’ (4) and ‘right livelihood’ (5).

From monks and nuns complete sexual abstention is demanded. ‘Right livelihood’ means abstaining from those sources of income which involve harming other beings: trading in weapons for instance, or trading in living beings, meat, intoxicants or poison; also included is the avoidance of fraud and avarice.' <sup id="cite_ref-466" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-466">[466]</a></sup>

This term is usually translated as ‘merit’ and refers to certain significant kinds of action that are regarded as auspicious and potent deeds. Essentially, merit is good ‘karma’ ( karman/kamma)&nbsp;: wholesome ( kuśla/kusala ) deeds which plant seeds that bear fortunate and pleasant fruits, whether in this life or lives to come, and thereby create conditions for further meritorious action in the future. These are the kinds of action that conduce to the development of the qualities of the eightfold path. Moreover it is making merit that binds the lay and monastic communities together. The traditional ‘bases of merit’ are generosity (dāna), ethical conduct ( śīla/sīla ), and meditation ( bhāvanā ). [...]The practice of good conduct takes the form of commitment to the five precepts usually recited in conjunction with the three refuges: (1) to refrain from harming living creatures, (2) to refrain from taking what is not given, (3) to refrain from sexual misconduct, (4) to refrain from false speech, (5) to refrain from intoxicants that cause heedlessness (see pp. 170- 2). In addition the lay disciple may on special occasions (traditionally the full moon ‘observance’ days) or for longer periods take the eight precepts, replacing the third precept (refraining from sexual misconduct) with complete sexual abstinence and adding (6) refraining from eating after midday, (7) refraining from attending entertainments and using perfumes, etc., and (8) refraining from using luxurious beds.”<sup id="cite_ref-498" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-498">[498]</a></sup> “The nature of bad action is usually illustrated by reference to a list of the ten courses of unwholesome action ( karma/kamma-patha ) which consist of three bodily courses of action (taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct), four vocal courses of action (lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech, frivolous speech), and three mental courses of action (covetousness, ill-will, wrong view). [...] Essentially the psychological states that motivate the ten unwholesome courses of action— strong greed, hatred, and delusion —lead to rebirth in the unhappy destinies or ‘descents’: in a hell realm, as a hungry ghost, an animal, or a jealous god.

So, for example, in the very popular Sigālovāda Sutta (DN 31): Children should honour their parents, be grateful and support them when they are in need or grow old; parents should show their love to their children by teaching them virtue, training them for a profession and passing on their inheritance when it is due; [...] a husband should minister to his wife ‘by honouring her, by not disparaging her, by not being unfaithful to her, by giving authority to her, by providing her with adornments’.

<dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of in-group loyalty ♣ unknown: 1368-1580ce; inferred absent: 1581-1689ce ♥</b> “As mentioned before, the development of a loving mind towards all beings, whether friend or foe, is the aim of one of the meditative practices of early Buddhism (see above p. 53f ). In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsāric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f ). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21).” <sup id="cite_ref-509" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-509">[509]</a></sup> “[...] Buddhism maintained a fairly flexible posture vis-a-vis competing religions and never sought to require laity to identify themselves exclusively as Buddhist or to rely singularly on the Buddhist clergy for all their spiritual needs.” <sup id="cite_ref-510" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-510">[510]</a></sup></dd>

Some texts affirm that even killing in self-defence, or in defence of family or friends, is wrongful, and in general an attitude of non-resistance in the face of violence is commended. The commentary to the Dhammapada relates how on one occasion when the Buddha's kinsmen, the Sakyas, were under attack, they allowed themselves to be slaughtered rather than break the First Precept.

In fact rather a precise correlation exists here: dominated by greed one becomes a hungry ghost, a class of beings ever discontent and anguished because of being unable to satisfy their greed; dominated by hatred one enters one of the hell realms where one suffers terrible pain; dominated by ignorance one becomes an animal ruled by the instincts of food and reproduction.” <sup id="cite_ref-516" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-516">[516]</a></sup> “The heart of Buddhist spiritual life, whether lay or monastic, is punya (Pali punna).

<dd><b>♠ in-group loyalty ♣ inferred present ♥</b> In Mongolian society: “Vassal-like relationships that greatly conditioned actions and attitudes were promoted by Chinggis Khan and, in contrast to feudalistic thought or practice in the West, were much less egalitarian. Relationships were rather unilateral, demanding certain duties and performances from the subordinate vassal but making few demands upon the lord. [...] Loyalty became an iron rule in Mongolian society as Chinggis Khan set an important precedent of paternalistic concern can be seen in the fact that there no notable rebellion or case of disobedience among his close followers and consequently no instances of execution, purge, or extreme punishment. This ethic of loyalty helps to explain why the descendants of Chinggis and their rule were maintained for oven seven centuries. The stress on the principle of loyalty is further illustrated by the element ‘’batu’’, meaning ‘faithfulness’. commonly found in many Mongol names.” <sup id="cite_ref-524" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-524">[524]</a></sup></dd>
