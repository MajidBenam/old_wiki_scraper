<p>The Mongols began as one of a group of nomadic tribes living on the Central Asian Steppe. Temujin or Temuchin (later called Chinggis Khan) became Khan (king), united the different Mongol families and incorporated other tribes such as the Tatars into the 'Mongols'. He was acknowledged as the leader of all the Central Asian tribes in 1206 CE.  With this force he moved out of the Steppe in search of new territory. First, the Mongols attacked northern China between 1211 and 1215 CE. In 1218 they moved west into Iran, attacking the main cities of the region.  They attacked southern Russia in 1240 and the German lands in 1241. The empire did not expand any further into Europe, but turned its attention back to China and the Middle East. Khubilai Khan moved into southern China; Hulegu captured Baghdad and destroyed the Abbasid caliphate. This represented the height of the Empire in terms of territory and achievement. Indeed, so vast was this empire that the Mongols split it into four regions under four Khans: the Golden Horde in Russia, the Chagatai Khanate in Central Asia, the Great Yuan in China and the Ilkhanate in Iran and Iraq, c. 1300. Over time this became independent dynasties and states. <sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> The Mongols were able to mobilise large numbers of troops for their armies. All adult males under 60 were eligible for mass mobilization. All were required to provide their own horses and equipment. This meant that even though Mongol soldiers may not have been the best troops in terms of ability or equipment, they had advantages of size and discipline over their opponents. This was strengthened by Chinggis Khan reforms which introduced a decimal system of organising the army - diving up troops up into units from ten to 10, 000.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>

Thánh Tông paid tribute to Uriyangqadai, who had quickly evacuated Vietnam to escape malaria."<sup id="cite_ref-164" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-164">[164]</a></sup>

mass executions, which he calls immense savagery (or cruelty) in terms that evoke modern genocides: The Mongols took all women, children, and old men (Thomas emphasizes that they took those who did not fight); made them sit in a line and take off their clothes so that they would not be stained by blood; and then killed them all.61 The systematic nature of the Mongol massacres is brought into relief by these procedures and by the effort invested to maximize efficiency (such as the care taken to assure that the clothes of the victims will not be stained)."<sup id="cite_ref-165" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-165">[165]</a></sup>

<p>A collective ritual is a ritual in which two or more people participate. With the official cult we refer to the set of collective ritual practices that are most closely associated with legitimation of the power structure (including elites, if any).

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Great Quriltai ♥</b> "The quriltai was a large gathering of people coming from distant places, which could last for many weeks. At its centre was the discussion of pressing issues by members of Chinggis Khan’s family, imperial sons-in-law, captains of the army and others; a notable feature of the quriltai is the participation of women. The discussions were accompanied by feasting and drinking and the wearing of elaborate robes. The quriltai was an institution suited to and partially reflecting the reality of the Mongols’ nomadic existence. 'In a pastoral nomadic economy and society in which a wide dispersal of people and herds was ecologically necessary, it is not surprising to find the existence of a consultative institution which brought together people from great distances.' It served the practical function of bringing leaders together to allow important decisions to be made, usually through creating consensus through discussion; it fostered unity among the participants and reinforced or clarified relations of superiority or inferiority. It sometimes contained extremely important ritual elements, such as the seating of the khan on a throne, the removing of belts and hats in order to salute the new ruler, or an elaborate and expensive redistribution of goods with the aim of promoting loyalty.</dd>
<dd>"[...] As for attendance at quriltais being compulsory, this is demonstrated by the delays in holding quriltais, where one or the other of those whose presence was expected declined to come. For example, the quriltai for the enthronement of Güyük was delayed for three years because some of the princes refused to come. [...] While it was difficult to coerce people to come, pressure could be applied, for example in the form of the threat of Menggeser, Möngke’s ǰarγuči, who decreed that the punishment for non-attendance and holding one’s own private festivities was decapitation; a law aimed at rivals for the position of qa’an who might have tried to hold their own quriltais. [...]</dd>
<dd>"Secondly, the decisions taken were binding; ‘dissenting opinions’ were not allowed and everyone who attended was bound to support the quriltai’s decisions. It is because the decisions were binding that some tried so hard to avoid attending certain quriltais, or felt betrayed if they attended and the outcome was not what they had anticipated. [...]</dd>
<dd>"Moreover, the main reason for holding a quriltai was often to give legal force to decisions which, in fact had already been taken. Decisions about succession were often settled through military means or negotiation long before a quriltai, yet a quriltai gave the decision its legitimacy and legal force. Various concrete actions during the quriltai, such as an enthronement or the distribution of gifts, helped give legitimacy to the decisions taken but even these actions would not be sufficient for legitimacy if the attendance were not as expected. All this shows that the quriltais were a legal institution. [...]</dd>
<dd>"However, its legal aspect was not restricted to the legislative task of formally making decisions about succession to leadership, administrative or military matters. Rather, as Mansura Haidar has noted, it also had a judicial function in that legal cases were often judged during quriltais." <sup id="cite_ref-169" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-169">[169]</a></sup></dd>

That amount of food must have been intended to feed the armies which were sent to the quriltai. Rashid al-Din mentions in passing that Batu sent "an army of three tuimens,"i.e., up to thirty thousand troops, to the Onon- Keruilen site of the 1251 quriltai. Similarly, Rashid al-Din lists twenty-six people who attended Temiir Qayan's quriltai, following the death of Qubilai, and his list trails off with 'and other princes, emirs, and princesses, such that it would be impossible to enumerate them all.'" <sup id="cite_ref-175" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-175">[175]</a></sup> Similarly, Papal envoy Carpini wrote that, in addition to the Mongol "tribal elite", "some four thousand envoys in all", from places such as China and Russia, were also present at the quriltai he witnessed <sup id="cite_ref-176" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-176">[176]</a></sup>.</dd>

<dd><b>♠ Orthopraxy checks ♣ present ♥</b> "In the fifth moon of summer [of the sixth year of Ögödei's reign: May 30-June 27, 1234], the emperor (Ögödei) was at the place [called] Ta-lan Ta pa (Dalan Daba(n)). He assembled the imperial princes and the sundry officials at a Great Quriltai, where he decreed [the following] articles and ordinances (t 'iao-ling), saying: "Whenever a quriltai is being held and there are those who do not attend but instead hold private feasts, they should be decapitated. As for all who go in and out of the imperial restricted quarters, each has [his] attendants. [Whether] men or women, they may have only ten people as attendants, and they must not mix with each other while going in and out. In the army, for every ten men, there should be appointed a chief of ten (chia-chang). They are to obey their military commanders; those who act improperly on their own authority will be sentenced to punishment. As for a chief of ten (chia-chang) who because of [official] business comes to the imperial quarters, he must then [in his absence] appoint one person as a temporary assistant and one person in charge of external affairs, and the two people must not improperly without authorization come and go. As for those who violate [this ordinance], punish them. As for government matters, if a person ought not to speak of them but does speak, box his ears. If he again breaks [this ordinance], beat him with the light stick (ch'ih). If he breaks [this ordinance] for a third time, beat him with the heavy stick (chang). If he breaks [this ordinance] for a fourth time, sentence him to death. As for the sundry chiliarchs (ch'ien-hu), if one should exceed [the authority of] the myriarch (wan-hu) by walking in front of him, shoot him with a wood-tipped arrow. As for the centurions (po-hu), the chiefs of ten (chia-chang), and the sundry troops, if they violate [this ordinance], their punishment shall be the same. As for those who do not comply with this law (fa), dismiss them. From this time onward, if the number of troops who have come to a quriltai is insufficient, make up the number from nearby wings (of the army). Common people whether at home or in the army are prohibited from making a noisy clamour. In all cases when coming to the quriltai, use one tethering rope for [every] fifty fine horses; five men as guards; three men to feed emaciated horses; and three men to look after the place where one dismounts from horses (ch'i-lieh-ssu/Mongolian: kires). If but one or two horses are stolen, then sentence [the thieves] to death. As for the common people's horses which should not be tied at the place where one dismounts from horses (ch'i- lieh-ssu), forthwith confiscate them and give them to the people who care for the tigers and leopards (hu-pao-jen) for feed. As for women who make clothes for the chih-sun (jisuin) feasts which are not in accordance with the [sumptuary] regulations, as well as [women] who are jealous (tu-che), they shall be sentenced to the punishment of riding a cow bareback around the center of the capital, and then they shall have their property collected in order that [the husband] may remarry." <sup id="cite_ref-212" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-212">[212]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ census ♥</b> Buell <sup id="cite_ref-228" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-228">[228]</a></sup> defines the census as the "act whereby the Mongols formally and ritually took possession of conquered peoples and territories by enumerating them prior to their redistribution."</dd>
<dd>"The census first appeared among the Mongols in 1206 when CHINGGIS KHAN numbered his people as part of his DECIMAL ORGANIZATION. In the SECRET HISTORY OF THE MONGOLS, Chinggis Khan ordered SHIGI QUTUQU, the first JARGHUCHI (judge) of the MONGOL EMPIRE, to record in a “blue register” (köke debter) all the households under their proper decimal units. The register was to be a permanent record of the assignment of the people to their units. This first census was remarkably complete; when Chinggis Khan put his companion (NÖKÖR) Degei over the 'hidden households,' they made only 1,000 out of the 95,000 counted. Since all Mongols served the government in the same way, this census did not divide them into categories, although the merits of the decimal unit commanders were recorded and updated in the registers. Chinggis repeated the census around 1225.</dd>
<dd>"The conquest of the sedentary regions required new census practices. In Chinggis Khan’s time subjects in a newly conquered city were sorted and classified, but there was no written register of the subject population. ÖGEDEI KHAN (1229-41) ordered the first census of sedentary peoples under Mongol control in 1233 in North China. This first census of the subject peoples led to a debate between YELÜ CHUCAI and Mahmud Yalavach (see MAHMUD YALAVACH AND MAS‘UD BEG) over the definition of a household. In China, where the extended family was the ideal, married sons living with their father were one household, but in Turkestani and Mongol practice every adult man was head of a separate household for tax purposes. Yelü Chucai prevented the application of this standard to China, at least temporarily.</dd>
<dd>"In 1235 Shigi Qutuqu was sent as judge to North China, and the census was repeated with much greater thoroughness. Local censuses also took place in the 1240s in Russia and TURKEY. GÜYÜG Khan (1246-48) ordered an empirewide census, but his death aborted the enterprise. Thus, it was MÖNGKE KHAN (1251-59) who in 1252 first counted the empire’s entire population. The extent of the empire made the census very time consuming; while that of North China was completed in 1252, Novgorod in the far northwest was not counted until winter 1258-59.</dd>
<dd>"The new census was far more complicated than the old census, counting not just the number of households but also the number of men aged 15 to 60 and the number of fields, livestock, vineyards, and orchards. Since some subject people paid taxes while others served in the military, there were separate registers of military and civilian households. Another registry listed those in the personal appanages of the Mongol nobility. Within the civilian register craftsmen were also listed separately, while in the military registers auxiliary and regular households were distinguished. Clergy of the approved religions were separated and not counted. The census took place in winter, during the slack season, and evaders faced beatings and even execution. In Novgorod, Armenia, and other tributary districts the census and the regressive taxation it facilitated sparked popular riots and resistance. The large census teams combined both Mongol clerks from the court of the khans and experienced local staff, at least where it was available, as in China and Iran. When the new 'blue register' was completed, probably in both the local administrative language and in Uighur or Mongolian, one copy was returned to Qara Qorum and one copy kept for the local administration.</dd>
<dd>"As taxation, corvée, and military levies depended on census records, government power depended on a regular census, yet in all the Mongol successor states the census eventually lapsed. In the Mongol YUAN DYNASTY of China the records were revised yearly from 1262 to 1275. After that year the conquest of South China and a general slackening of administration broke off the yearly census. The vastly enlarged realm was counted in 1291-93 and again in 1330, but efforts to increase tax revenues by accurately investigating land holdings failed in the face of widespread opposition. The census of military households likewise lapsed after 1289. In the IL-KHANATE in Iran the census continued in HÜLE’Ü’s reign (1256-65) but then lapsed until the time of GHAZAN KHAN (1295-1304), who ordered a new census. In the GOLDEN HORDE a second census was carried out in 1274-75. The lapse of the census marked the transformation of Mongol rule from a charismatic regime based on expansion into a traditional regime based on support of a stable upper class." <sup id="cite_ref-229" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-229">[229]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ divination ♥</b> "Divining by reading the cracks in burnt bones, an almost universal practice in ancient Eurasia, was the major method of divination in the MONGOL EMPIRE and was practiced until recent times. While in ancient Shang China tortoise shells were burned by a piece of hot iron, the Mongols always used sheep scapula, or shoulder blades, and simply placed them in a fire. The great khans of the Mongol Empire used scapulimancy to divine the will of heaven (TENGGERI) before virtually every decision. CHINGGIS KHAN carried a charred sheep pelvis as an amulet. This divination was performed by the khans themselves, by shamans (bö’e, modern böö), and sometimes by foreign divination experts, such as YELÜ CHUCAI (1190-1244). The inquirer first had to whisper to the shoulder blade, and then the blade was burned. A straight vertical crack meant yes, and a horizontal crack or splintering meant no." <sup id="cite_ref-270" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-270">[270]</a></sup> Franciscan missionary William of Rubruck had this to say: "I learnt that [the Khan] does nothing in the world without first consulting these bones; he does not even allow a person to enter his dwelling without first consulting them. This kind of divination is done as follows when he wishes to do anything, he has brought him three of these bones not previously charred, and holding one, he thinks of the thing about which he wishes to consult it, whether he shall do it or not; and then he hands it to a servant to burn. And there are two little buildings beside the dwelling in which he lives, in which they burn these bones, and these bones are looked for diligently every day through-out the whole camp." <sup id="cite_ref-271" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-271">[271]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ drinking gatherings ♥</b> "[Papal envoy] Rubruck observed that drinking gatherings in the tent of the master or leading figure of the group was always preceded by ritual offerings. First, the steward sprinkled some of the drink on the household effigies, which included, 'by the entrance on the women's side, an idol with a cow's udder for the women who milk the cows, for this is a woman's job. On the other side of the door towards the men is another image with a mare's udder, for the men who milk the mares' (in Dawson 1955: 96). Then the steward stepped outside the tent holding a goblet of drink and sprinkled three times toward the south, genuflecting each time, in honor of fire, then toward the east in honor of the air, toward the west in honor of water, then toward the north for the sake of the dead (Jackson and Morgan 1990: 76). Returning to the tent, the steward and two attendants offered drink to the master and his wife. Before the master drank, he poured a libation of wine onto the ground 'as its share.' Should the master be mounted, the offering would be poured on the horse's neck or mane before drinking began. "Only after the offerings were made could drinking start, initiated by the master. A musician stood near the <i>kumiss</i> [fermented mare's milk] pitchers at the door, and when the master began to drink, the steward called 'Ha!' and the musician struck up. When the master had drunk, the steward shouted again, the musician stopped, then 'they all drink round in turn, men and women alike, and at times compete with one another in quaffing in a thoroughly distasteful and greedy fashion' (Rubruck in Jackson and Morgan 1990: 77). According to Carpini [another Papal envoy] (in Dawson 1955: 57), no Mongol prince ever drank, especially in public, without there being singing and guitar playing for them. At feast, the guests clapped their hands and danced to the sound of the music while the master was drinking, the men in front of the master and the women in front of the mistress. Drinking games were a feature of these gatherings. Anyone reluctant to take up a drinking challenge would be seized, and his ears pulled vigorously until his mouth opened and the drink could be poured in, while the others clapped and danced." <sup id="cite_ref-339" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-339">[339]</a></sup></dd>

<dd> <b>♠ Constraint on executive by government ♣ inferred present ♥</b>  One of the most important measures undertaken by Chinggis Khan in the field of the civil administration was the codification of laws under the title of Yeke Jasa (The Great Law). Although this work has not yet come to light, data from various sources prove beyond doubt the existence of a written version. According to an authoritative source, the history of cAta ̄’ Malik Juwayn ̄ı: In accordance and agreement with his [Chinggis’s] own mind, he established a rule for every occasion and a regulation for every circumstance, while for every crime he fixed a penalty. And since the Tatar peoples had no script of their own, he gave orders that Mongol children should learn writing from the Uighurs, and that these Yasas and ordinances should be written down on rolls. These rolls are called the Great Book of Yasas and are kept in the treasury of the chief princes. Whenever a khan ascends the throne, or a great army is mobilized, or the princes assemble and begin to consult together concerning affairs of state and administration thereof, they produce these rolls and model their actions thereon, and proceed with the disposition of armies or the destruction of provinces and cities in the manner therein prescribed.14  In general, the Great Jasa represented a code of laws which is said to have been prescribed by Chinggis Khan for the various spheres of social life and in military, organizational and administrative affairs. It also dealt with religious beliefs, court ceremonial, civil rules, general conduct and justice, and so on. Thus it laid down the juridical basis for the newly born Mongol state. Moreover, with the creation of the Mongol empire, it eventually became the most authoritative handbook of Mongol jurisprudence, to be strictly followed throughout the expanse of the empire.  <sup id="cite_ref-423" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-423">[423]</a></sup></dd>

Chinggis Khan thus replaced Teb Tenggeri as the empire’s voice of heaven’s will. The Secret History of the Mongols detailed the repeated signs that heaven had destined him for rule, from the blood clot he held in his hand at his birth to the oxen that butted Jamugha’s tent and bellowed, “Heaven and Earth have taken counsel: Let Temüjin be Lord of the Nation.” Contemporary stories from people in contact with the Mongols emphasized that Chinggis Khan was not just a conqueror but a Moseslike lawgiver and prophet for the new nation. In future years, after conquering the sedentary powers, Chinggis Khan would fashion a distinctive religious policy that saw all religions as praying to one god, or heaven. Heaven’s will was made known primarily by success in this life, and Chinggis expected religious figures to recognize that his extraordinary career was the direct result of heaven’s favor and not a chance event. Despite his conflict with Teb Tenggeri, Chinggis Khan sought out holy men of various religions, and those who impressed him by their irreproachable conduct and wisdom would receive tax privileges and immunities for them and their followers." <sup id="cite_ref-430" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-430">[430]</a></sup></dd>

Only Hiile'ii (q.v.) and a few Ca'adai princes (see Ca'adai Ulus) recognized him, the rest of the Mongolian world did not. Ariq-boko convened his own quviltai and also had himself elected qan. He was recognized in Mongolia, in most of the Ca'adai ulus, and in the Golden Horde (q.v.). The Mongolian world now had two gun. A clash was inevitable. Ariq-boko had been left behind in Mongolia (q.v.) by Mongke to secure his central province and hold the capital of Qaraqorum (q.v.). He enjoyed wide support because of his traditional values. By contrast, many Mongols distrusted Qubilai as too Chinese. The civil war lasted four years. Qubilai won, thanks to the superior resources of China and the organizational abilities of his advisors. Ariq-boko surrendered in 1264 and died two years later. Qubilai recovered Mongolia, but never reconciled with the Golden Horde in Russia, and soon lost his remaining influence in the Ca'adai ulus. ” <sup id="cite_ref-442" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-442">[442]</a></sup></dd></dl>

In 1256, with the pacification of Iran, MÖNGKE KHAN (1251-59) divided up appanages there as well. Thus, Cha’adai and his descendants, for example, held not only their nomadic grounds around Almaligh, but also Kat and Khiva towns in Khorazm, Taiyuan prefecture in Shanxi, and certain cities and towns in Iran. As a result the empire was interlaced with a network of interlocking appanages that kept every prince directly interested in every region. YELÜ CHUCAI, speaking for the Chinese officials and generals, protested to Ögedei that this distribution could lead to a disintegration of the state. Ögedei thus decreed that the appanage holders could appoint overseers (DARUGHACHI) and judges (JARGHUCHI) in the appanages, but the court would appoint other officials and collect taxes. While every two regular households paid one catty of silk in tax to the central government, in the appanages every five households paid one catty, the lighter burden compensating for what they paid to the appanage holders. Appanage households thus became known in Chinese as “five-households-silk households” (wuhusi hu).

<p><b>♠ Funding for festivals ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> “The Mongol conquests of Transoxania and Khurasan, with their destruction of urban centres, had an adverse effect on culture, including the dramatic and performing arts, at least temporarily. Many musicians, singers, virtuoso dancers and actors had to emigrate to neighbouring countries, while those who remained eventually doubtless served the followers of Chinggis and the Mongol governors. There were fewer small ensembles of musicians, singers and actors, and large troupes became a rarity; during this period, most performers operated as individuals: as bakhsh ̄ıs and qissagu ̄ys (story-tellers) and madda ̄hs (eulogists), or as isolated musicians, singers and actors. The local populations were nevertheless able to preserve their potential for artistic expression and this led to a gradual resurgence of artistic traditions. This process gathered momentum as Islamic and Turkish institutions were accepted and absorbed by the Mongol conquerors and as they abandoned their nomadic way of life; hence festivals, both religious and secular, began to revive."  <sup id="cite_ref-532" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-532">[532]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Degree of taxation ♣ ♥</b> Any range should start at 0 considering the following cases of tax exemption: "In the Turco-Mongolian tradition, exemption from imposts was one of the most important privileges accorded to classes and persons. [...] In the MONGOL EMPIRE the title darqan was also a title of honor, but with a somewhat different connotation. In the famous SECRET HISTORY OF THE MONGOLS the range of possible rights and exemptions associated with the word darqan or its derivatives include: the right to nomadize freely over wide territory, the right to hold women captured in war without forwarding them to the khan, immunity to prosecution for up to nine transgressions, the right to serve as quiver bearers for the khan, and the right to drink the ötög, a special ceremonial liquor (probably a milk liquor) offered at the great assemblies (QURILTAI). All these rights were hereditary, being granted “unto the seed of the seed.” Rewards of subjects and goods inevitably accompanied them, too.
While many in the Mongol elite received these exemptions, the actual title of darqan was mostly reserved for those outside the ruling inner circle.  [...] Tax exemption was also granted to other people in the empire who did not have such exalted status. Criminals exempted from punishment in return for frontline service were called darqan. All craftsmen were enrolled on the census and placed under direct state control. In return they too were exempted from taxes. This exemption made them darqan; one meaning of darkhan in modern Mongolian is simply “craftsman.” Those persons dedicated to the service of the palace-tents (ORDO) of the deceased Chinggis were also freed from imposts and hence also received the name of darkhad (plural of darkhan)." <sup id="cite_ref-536" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-536">[536]</a></sup>

Let them, bringing forth one sheep from one hundred sheep. . . 27 Alba and qubchur were paid in kind.

In 1256, with the pacification of Iran, MÖNGKE KHAN (1251-59) divided up appanages there as well. Thus, Cha’adai and his descendants, for example, held not only their nomadic grounds around Almaligh, but also Kat and Khiva towns in Khorazm, Taiyuan prefecture in Shanxi, and certain cities and towns in Iran. As a result the empire was interlaced with a network of interlocking appanages that kept every prince directly interested in every region. YELÜ CHUCAI, speaking for the Chinese officials and generals, protested to Ögedei that this distribution could lead to a disintegration of the state. Ögedei thus decreed that the appanage holders could appoint overseers (DARUGHACHI) and judges (JARGHUCHI) in the appanages, but the court would appoint other officials and collect taxes. While every two regular households paid one catty of silk in tax to the central government, in the appanages every five households paid one catty, the lighter burden compensating for what they paid to the appanage holders.

YELÜ CHUCAI, speaking for the Chinese officials and generals, protested to Ögedei that this distribution could lead to a disintegration of the state.

Although the members of the imperial clan could claim shares of other revenue collected according to another formula, it was still the qan who distributed it.&nbsp;» <sup id="cite_ref-542" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-542">[542]</a></sup></dd>
