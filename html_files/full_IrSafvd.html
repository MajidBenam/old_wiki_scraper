<p>The Safavid period of rule in Persia (1501-1722 CE) was begun by Shah Ismail (1501-1524 CE) and is known as a 'gunpowder empire' due to the now widespread use of artillery and muskets on the battlefield.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup>
</p><p>Shah Ismail, whose original power base was near the Caspian sea, began the conquest of Iran with the capture Tabriz from the Ak Koyunlu. He declared that the state religion was Shi'ia and the Safavids were decisive for the spread of Shi'ism in Iran.
</p><p>While initially the governing system was "largely a continuation of its Aq Qoyunlu counterpart and its Turco-Mongolian traditions"<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup> it eventually became a "highly cen­tralized and complex bureaucratic system"<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> based at the Safavid court in the capital city.  The highest officials of the Safavid court included the Vazir-e-azam (chief minister), Amir al-omard (commander in chief of the army, later titled Sepdhsdldr-e koll-e lasgar-e Iran), the Sadr (judiciary and religious minister), and vice-regent. <sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup>
</p><p>As a defensive measure against Ottoman attacks Shah Tahmasp (1524-1576) moved the capital from Tabriz to Qazvin, but Shah Abbas I (1587-1629 CE) moved it again, further south, to a new monumental city at Isfahan. Under Shah Abbas Isfahan’s population grew to 200,000.<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup> The rule of Shah Abbas I (1587-1629 CE) is widely thought of as representing the peak Safavid achievement. Incredible wealth acquired from the state monopoly over the silk trade, was spent on large-scale building works. Abbas also made key reforms to improve the administration and the army.<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Ashura ♥</b> Procession on tenth day of Muharram among Shi'a. "The most common ambulatory ritual observance is dasta, or procession. There is no doubt that the Hosayn dasta was influenced by ritual parades lamenting the unjust and sudden deaths of such heroes as Tammuz in Mesopotamia and Siavos in Transoxania. The dasta in Moḥarram and Safar developed from simple processions into complex rituals occurring annually among Shi'ite communities worldwide. The most notable feature of the dasta is the self-mortification of the participants in tandem with accompanying cymbals and drums. Marchers chant dirges and threnodies, curse the villains of Karbala (FIGURE 1). Canetti describes the dasta as “an orchestra of grief” (p. 150). [...] When Shi'ite Islam became the state religion in Persia in 907/1501, popular rituals including dasta helped to spread the faith across the Iranian plateau. Foreign residents who spent time in Persia during the 17th and 18th centuries have left very rich accounts of dastas they witnessed, providing a record of the development of this ritual’s pageantry. The majority of popular Shi'ite rituals are conducted in the open, in public spaces, and can be viewed by passers-by. Western visitors to Iran—diplomats, merchants, and missionaries—were fascinated with these rituals and have given us, from the early 17th century onward, quite extensive written accounts of what they saw. [...] A steady increase was observed in the number of participants in the dasta costumed to represent various characters and episodes from the battle at Karbala. Wheeled floats with living tableaux were constructed to pass in front of the multitudes of penitent spectators. A vivid description of the Moḥarram parades was made in 1737 by Thomas Salmons and Matthias Van Goch (pp. 249-53): 'Outstanding in the large public processions are the big theatrically arranged wagons showing scenes of his [Ḥosayn’s, P.Ch.] life and his deeds, his battles, and his death. These wagons are often pulled about accompanied by people, in armor, flags, and emblems of war of victory, depicting some of Hussein’s deeds. For example, a wagon representing the death of Hussein has a deck-like cover coated with sand to represent the arid battlefield. Underneath people are lying thrusting their heads, arms and hands through holes in the cover so they will lie on the sand above to appear as dismembered limbs sprinkled with blood or red paint and colored with a deathly pallor so as to look most natural. Hussein, pallid and bloody, is lying on the other wagon. Several living doves sit on his body, while others are nesting in his blood. After a while, the men under the cover release their bonds, two at a time, so that they can ‘fly to Medina’ to announce Hussein’s death to his sister. Wherever this wagon passes, the people set up such a wailing to show their grief in so many ways and with such conviction, imitation, and naturalistic representations that one wonders at their capacity to give vent to such appropriate signs of suffering so realistically. Their spirit shows through plainly in this impersonation, nor do they spare their bodies: in zeal or desperation, they shed their blood, wound themselves, or are wounded in fights with others; they carry out their intentions with such zeal that it sometimes leads to their own death. It is not possible to tell the difference between feigned dizziness, fainting, and the real thing. One must consider what the stricken people on these tragic wagons endure while presenting their limbs, decapitated heads, hands, and legs in such an uncomfortable position while lying there as if they were dead themselves. [They do this] in all kinds of weather during the processions. Still they suffer rather than move or do something which would disturb that verisimilitude which might be lost.'" <sup id="cite_ref-301" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-301">[301]</a></sup></dd>

Underneath people are lying thrusting their heads, arms and hands through holes in the cover so they will lie on the sand above to appear as dismembered limbs sprinkled with blood or red paint and colored with a deathly pallor so as to look most natural.

Their spirit shows through plainly in this impersonation, nor do they spare their bodies: in zeal or desperation, they shed their blood, wound themselves, or are wounded in fights with others; they carry out their intentions with such zeal that it sometimes leads to their own death.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Friday prayer ♥</b> "The Friday prayer is a duty of the community; it contains a short sermon, khutba*, which consists of two parts. It gives some advice usually based on the Koran or the hadith, and a prayer for the ruler of the government. To be mentioned in the khutba meant to be the legitimate ruler. Women rarely attend the Friday prayer but prefer to pray at home.The daily prayers are explained in the Koran as acts of humility and adoration. At the end of the prayer the Muslim can mention his/her personal requests. While traveling or in war or under duress, one can perform the noon and afternoon or sunset and night prayers together. One also has numerous opportunities to perform additional prayers of two or more rak'a each, e.g., during solar or lunar eclipses; when performing the rain prayer; when entering or leaving the house or the mosque—in short, some pious Muslims use every opportunity to perform a brief salat. The belief in the purifying power of ritual prayer is intense; the Prophet compared it to a stream of water that washes off sins five times a day. The performance of the prayer at the prescribed time constitutes ideally a means of educating Muslims to punctuality, cleanliness, and, since there is no ranking in the mosque, equal participation in the life of the community. Prayer can also lead to ecstatic experiences, and when one observes a praying Muslim who is oblivious of everything around him and seems to have drawn himself, as it were, out of this world to stand humbly before the Lord, one realizes best whence Islam derives its vital strength.To perform the salat, a clean spot suffices, be it in the fields, in the train, or in one's shop or office. A small prayer rug guarantees the cleanliness of the place. However, even in the Prophet's lifetime a place for congregational worship was established, called masjid, "the place where one prostrates" (hence the word Mosque). The great mosque, where the Friday prayer is held and which was found in each quarter, is called jami'*, "the gathering [mosque]."Mainly in the eastern part of the Islamic world, one finds small open prayer places called musalla*, and for the gathering of large congregations at the two 'id*, the end of Ramadan and the Feast of Offerings, one sometimes uses an 'idgah*, a vast enclosure with a prayer niche."<sup id="cite_ref-331" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-331">[331]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Nowruz ♥</b> "The festive celebration of Nowruz during the Safavid period is well attested (see bibliography). In preparation to it, commanders, ministers, favored officials, rich merchants, and guild leaders were given pieces of land in the vast park of Bāḡ-e Naqš-e Jahān of Isfahan to decorate and illuminate. Each group set up tents with canopies of silk and brocade, and erected booths variously embellished; servants offered drinks and sweets to large crowds for several days. In the royal palace, a large table cloth (sofra) was spread on the floor of the Hall of Mirrors (tālār-e āʾina), and on it were placed large bowls of water and plates of various fruits, greeneries, sweets, and colored eggs. According to Chardin (II, p. 267), in keeping with an ancient Iranian tradition, on the eve of Nowruz people send each other colored eggs as gifts. The shah gave some five hundred of them to his womenfolk. The eggs are encased in gold and decorated with four miniature paintings. The shah sat at the head of the sofra, amongst the royal women he favored most, who were all bedecked in jewelry. They engaged in pleasant conversation, and then, at the shah’s command, female dancers, musicians, and singers entered and entertained the audience. In another chamber the court astronomer was trying to determine the exact moment of 'the turn of the year' (taḥwil-e sāl, that is, when the Sun entered the sign of Aries at the vernal equinox). As soon as he gave the sign that the New Year had arrived, pages sent off firecrackers into the sky, and, seeing this, the household female servants let out cries of exultation thereby announcing the good news to the king and his companion. At the same time, the news was made public by some palace guards firing off their muskets and citadel guards their cannons, whereupon an official band occupying the center of the great town square (Meydān-e naqš-e jahān) beat on their drums and kettledrums and blew into their wind instruments (sornāy). Shouts of joy filled the air; eunuchs opened special bags of wild rue (esfand) and sprinkled seeds into the fire, causing the air to be pleasantly scented. The shah, as all other Iranians, gazed at a bowl of water the moment the year 'turned,' believing that 'water is the symbol of prosperity' (āb rowšanāʾi-st, lit. ‘water is light’) and if one looks at it at the turn of the year he would enjoy happiness all year long. A few prayers (usually Qurʾanic verses, extensively cited by Majlesi, II) were recited, and everyone wearing new clothes drank some water or rosewater, congratulated elders, kinsfolk and friends, and partook of sweets. Elders presented gifts to the members of household, relatives, servants, and friends, and distributed alms to the poor, dervishes, and local sayyeds (descendants of the Imams). In the palace, the shah held a great banquet with wine and music for military commanders, senior civil officials, foreign envoys and notable merchants. In other households elaborately prepared dinners were served, and in general everyone enjoyed the occasion with drinks, music, visitation, and exchanges of gifts and pleasantries. Children were particularly happy, and enjoyed the holidays running around, receiving various gifts, playing various games (specially the 'egg-cracking game,' similar to the children’s game of conkers played with chestnuts in the West), and watching polo, wrestling, and horse racing. The gifts exchanged depended on the status of the individuals. The shah sat in the audience hall and distributed gifts, usually gold and or silver coins placed in small colorful bags, to the courtiers, kinsfolk, household servants and foreign envoys. He received in turn precious gifts from his harem, ministers, representatives of social groups and professions, provincial governors, and envoys of neighboring countries. The usual 'gifts' to the shah included slave girls (especially from Armenia and Georgia, some of whom ended up as royal wives and others were given to favorite officials), money, prized horses, and beasts of burden with precious saddlery (for the gifts exchanged between the governor of Fārs province and Shah ʿAbbās I see Arberry, p. 19). The shah and rich notables also ordered the slaughter of livestock according to religious rites and distributed the meat to the needy. During the following days, people went outdoors and spent the time in the open air playing, feasting, horseracing and, when possible, hunting." <sup id="cite_ref-405" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-405">[405]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Ashura ♥</b> Muharram procession. "The most common ambulatory ritual observance is dasta, or procession. There is no doubt that the Hosayn dasta was influenced by ritual parades lamenting the unjust and sudden deaths of such heroes as Tammuz in Mesopotamia and Siavos in Transoxania. The dasta in Moḥarram and Safar developed from simple processions into complex rituals occurring annually among Shi'ite communities worldwide. The most notable feature of the dasta is the self-mortification of the participants in tandem with accompanying cymbals and drums. Marchers chant dirges and threnodies, curse the villains of Karbala (FIGURE 1). Canetti describes the dasta as “an orchestra of grief” (p. 150). [...] When Shi'ite Islam became the state religion in Persia in 907/1501, popular rituals including dasta helped to spread the faith across the Iranian plateau. Foreign residents who spent time in Persia during the 17th and 18th centuries have left very rich accounts of dastas they witnessed, providing a record of the development of this ritual’s pageantry. The majority of popular Shi'ite rituals are conducted in the open, in public spaces, and can be viewed by passers-by. Western visitors to Iran—diplomats, merchants, and missionaries—were fascinated with these rituals and have given us, from the early 17th century onward, quite extensive written accounts of what they saw. [...] A steady increase was observed in the number of participants in the dasta costumed to represent various characters and episodes from the battle at Karbala. Wheeled floats with living tableaux were constructed to pass in front of the multitudes of penitent spectators. A vivid description of the Moḥarram parades was made in 1737 by Thomas Salmons and Matthias Van Goch (pp. 249-53): 'Outstanding in the large public processions are the big theatrically arranged wagons showing scenes of his [Ḥosayn’s, P.Ch.] life and his deeds, his battles, and his death. These wagons are often pulled about accompanied by people, in armor, flags, and emblems of war of victory, depicting some of Hussein’s deeds. For example, a wagon representing the death of Hussein has a deck-like cover coated with sand to represent the arid battlefield. Underneath people are lying thrusting their heads, arms and hands through holes in the cover so they will lie on the sand above to appear as dismembered limbs sprinkled with blood or red paint and colored with a deathly pallor so as to look most natural. Hussein, pallid and bloody, is lying on the other wagon. Several living doves sit on his body, while others are nesting in his blood. After a while, the men under the cover release their bonds, two at a time, so that they can ‘fly to Medina’ to announce Hussein’s death to his sister. Wherever this wagon passes, the people set up such a wailing to show their grief in so many ways and with such conviction, imitation, and naturalistic representations that one wonders at their capacity to give vent to such appropriate signs of suffering so realistically. Their spirit shows through plainly in this impersonation, nor do they spare their bodies: in zeal or desperation, they shed their blood, wound themselves, or are wounded in fights with others; they carry out their intentions with such zeal that it sometimes leads to their own death. It is not possible to tell the difference between feigned dizziness, fainting, and the real thing. One must consider what the stricken people on these tragic wagons endure while presenting their limbs, decapitated heads, hands, and legs in such an uncomfortable position while lying there as if they were dead themselves. [They do this] in all kinds of weather during the processions. Still they suffer rather than move or do something which would disturb that verisimilitude which might be lost.'" <sup id="cite_ref-445" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-445">[445]</a></sup></dd>

</p><p><b>♠ Description of the Normative Ideology ♣  ♥</b> "The Safavid period marks an obvious watershed in the religious history of Iran in that it witnesses the elevation of Twelver Shi'ism to the position of state religion and the practical fusion of Iran and Shi'ism into a single religio-national entity. Although the proximate causes of this process are to be sought in a Turkmen military invasion of Iran from the west and north-west, followed by an influx of Shi'i scholars from Arab lands, there can be no doubt that a species of marriage between Shi'ism and the Iranian national consciousness had been concluded by the close of the Safavid era." <sup id="cite_ref-491" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-491">[491]</a></sup> It is worth noting that, for the most part, the differences between Sunni and Shi'i Islam do not affect the variables we are interested in. "The central distinguishing theological feature of Shi‘ism is the belief in rational divine justice. Contrary to the dominant Sunni position that God’s actions and commands define the nature of justice, the Shi'a contend that God is just in a manner that humans can rationally understand. This has a number of practical consequences. First and foremost, it necessitates (i) free will, because God cannot justly punish humans for actions that He compels them to perform, and (ii) an explanation for evil that does not implicate God. Second, it permits the inclusion of reason (unconnected to revealed texts) among the sources of Islamic law. This is an outcome of the belief that humans are capable of distinguishing justice from tyranny and right from wrong without recourse to revelation. Third, rational divine justice has two implications for the Imamate: (i) God acts with a necessary kindness and grace (lutf ) toward human beings because He is invested in their living successful and upright lives. This being the case, He provides continual guidance in the form of prophets and Imams. (ii) God prefers justice on Earth, which allows for (or even requires) an activist agenda that legitimizes the overthrow of a tyrannical ruler under the leadership of a qualified Imam. These three consequences of rational divine justice contrast sharply with Sunnı beliefs and clearly demarcate the boundary between the two communities. The next chapter turns to perhaps the institution most closely associated with Shiiism, the Imamate." <sup id="cite_ref-492" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-492">[492]</a></sup> "Every Shi'i group holds that ‘Ali was the legitimate successor to the Prophet based on either a formal or an informal designation. According to the Shi'a, 'Ali was not merely the rightful political head of the community but also wielded spiritual authority. He was an Imam as conceived of in the Qur'anic verses that open this chapter, guaranteeing that the community would not be led astray and providing divinely inspired leadership. [...] The historical basis for the Shi'i institution of the Imamate stems from a belief in the special qualities and role of 'Ali. A number of Muslims claimed a distinctive charismatic bond (walaya) with 'Ali during his lifetime that transcended simple loyalty or political support. In time, this veneration grew to include 'Ali's larger household and (eventually) a select number of his lineal descendants. As the heirs of the charismatic mantle of both 'Ali and the Prophet, these descendants became focal points for both Shi'i political aspirations and popular piety." <sup id="cite_ref-493" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-493">[493]</a></sup> The main aspect of Shi'ism that would normally affect our variables--its suspicion towards the secular state--did not emerge as a significant aspect of normative ideology under Safavid rule: "Divergences involving the relationship between religion and state came to the fore in this period. The Safavids never resolved the tension between a religious hierarchy that was in theory only beholden to the Hidden Imam, and a state built around ancient Persian notions of divine kingship. In the period of Shah 'Abbas II we hear of high-ranking ulema who went well beyond advocating a more active part in governing the realm for the religious leaders, and openly called for direct clerical governance by declaring the rule of the shah illegitimate; though too much should not be made of this, for it was certainly not a general tendency, and overall, clergy-state relations were marked by pragmatism and a functional division of labor. The ulema, convinced of the need for a monarch as the patrimonial head of the body-politic, overwhelmingly acquiesced in the status quo, whereby the secular state wielded ultimate power, served the state in a variety of bureaucratic offices, and paid no more than lip service to the normative notions of Twelver Shi'ism, including the illegitimacy of the secular state. Coexistence of the religious and the secular, and implicit accommodation to the power of the latter is also visible in the judicial system. Religious law and customary law existed side by side. Invariably, though, customary law ('orf), prevailed over the shari'a (shari'a), especially in criminal cases, and most people are said to have favored government courts over religious courts. Worldly power, in sum, always trumped religious authority, and even as the shah’s status as morshed diminished, he did not lose the ability to maintain himself at the apex of the pyramid and above the vortex of the never-ending power struggle." <sup id="cite_ref-494" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-494">[494]</a></sup>

<dd> <b>♠ Ideological thought equates men and women ♣ [present; absent] ♥</b> “Both supporters and critics of Islam turn to the Qur'an, sunna, and Islamic law to justify their claims about Islam's stance towards women. For more than a millennium, differing interpretive traditions have employed these sources to address and settle disagreements over issues.//As with Judaism and Christianity, gender is an inherent aspect of God's plan for humanity from the first humans. However, unlike her Judeo-Christian counterpart, the Qur'anic Eve (unnamed in the Qur'an, but identified as Hawwa' in later sources) is not responsible for tempting Adam into eating the forbidden fruit, which results in their expulsion; they are equally responsible. Furthermore, Islam does not have a doctrine of original sin; Adam and Eve's punishment does not extend to future generations, nor is Eve's role explicitly linked to future women—though medieval scholars, such as al-Tabari, have argued that Eve was solely culpable and that her role reveals women's deficiencies (Stowasser, 1994).//The Qur'an explicitly states that men and women have equal religious responsibility before God and that male and female believers will be rewarded equally (33:35, 40:8). However, in other realms they have differentiated roles and rights. In some cases women have lesser positions than men. For example, two women's testimonies are equivalent to that of a single man (2:282), men have authority over their wives and may discipline them in the case of disobedience (nushuz, 4:34), women typically inherit less than male relatives (4:7-20), and polygamy is permitted under certain circumstances (4:3). However, the Qur'an provides some protections explicitly for women. For example, a bride directly receives the dower (mahr, 4:4), husbands are required to provide maintenance (nafaqa) for their wives (2:233), and husbands should treat their wives kindly (4:19).//Contemporary feminist scholars, particularly Fatima Mernissi (1991), have been critical of the treatment of women in the hadith literature, especially when stripped of its historical context. Mernissi argues that much of the hadith literature stands in contrast to the equality of the Qur'an and the experience of Muhammad's wives, and therefore the authenticity and chains of transmission of certain ahadith, such as the hijab and injunctions against women's political leadership, must be re-examined. Leila Ahmed (1992) undertakes such an explanation, contextualizing the relation between religion and gender in space and across time.//The interpretation and application of the Qur'an and sunna in legal matters is dependent upon a variety of factors, including the legal school, particulars of a given case, and the socio-historical context. While there is a measure of consensus between the four major Sunni schools of jurisprudence, they vary on particulars ranging from a wife's potential recourses if her husband is unable to provide her maintenance to what constitutes equitable treatment in a polygamous marriage. An important distinction between the Sunni schools of jurisprudence and Ithna 'Ashari (Twelver) Shiism is the former's explicit rejection of temporary marriage (mut'ah). In analyzing whether women are disadvantaged in comparison to men in Islamic law, Judith Tucker (2008) concludes that women's status varies substantially between issues. While women have less freedom than men to independently initiate marriage or divorce, Islamic law largely guarantees the property rights of both married and unmarried women and imposes safeguards in the case of divorce.//A key issue in Islamic exegesis is how much of Qur'anic and hadith material relates specifically to Muhammad's wives (Mothers of the Believers, Ummahat al-Mu'minun) and how much can be generalized as normative practice for all Muslim women. For example, the Qur'an indicates the special status of Muhammad's wives (33:32), and they were under certain restrictions such as not remarrying after Muhammad's death (33:52), stipulations that were not obviously applicable to other Muslim women. Another issue revolves around veiling, concerning the exact manner in which women should dress and whether veiling was a requirement of all Muslim women or merely Muhammad's wives. [...]Ahmed (1991) argues that the rise of the Abbasid dynasty, influenced by Persian and Byzantine practices, represented a decisive turning point for gender equality in public life. Among elite families, the seclusion of women and concubinage became increasingly common.” <sup id="cite_ref-513" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-513">[513]</a></sup></dd>

Leila Ahmed (1992) undertakes such an explanation, contextualizing the relation between religion and gender in space and across time.//The interpretation and application of the Qur'an and sunna in legal matters is dependent upon a variety of factors, including the legal school, particulars of a given case, and the socio-historical context. While there is a measure of consensus between the four major Sunni schools of jurisprudence, they vary on particulars ranging from a wife's potential recourses if her husband is unable to provide her maintenance to what constitutes equitable treatment in a polygamous marriage. An important distinction between the Sunni schools of jurisprudence and Ithna 'Ashari (Twelver) Shiism is the former's explicit rejection of temporary marriage (mut'ah). In analyzing whether women are disadvantaged in comparison to men in Islamic law, Judith Tucker (2008) concludes that women's status varies substantially between issues. While women have less freedom than men to independently initiate marriage or divorce, Islamic law largely guarantees the property rights of both married and unmarried women and imposes safeguards in the case of divorce.//A key issue in Islamic exegesis is how much of Qur'anic and hadith material relates specifically to Muhammad's wives (Mothers of the Believers, Ummahat al-Mu'minun) and how much can be generalized as normative practice for all Muslim women. For example, the Qur'an indicates the special status of Muhammad's wives (33:32), and they were under certain restrictions such as not remarrying after Muhammad's death (33:52), stipulations that were not obviously applicable to other Muslim women. Another issue revolves around veiling, concerning the exact manner in which women should dress and whether veiling was a requirement of all Muslim women or merely Muhammad's wives. [...]Ahmed (1991) argues that the rise of the Abbasid dynasty, influenced by Persian and Byzantine practices, represented a decisive turning point for gender equality in public life. Among elite families, the seclusion of women and concubinage became increasingly common.” <sup id="cite_ref-518" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-518">[518]</a></sup></dd>

His subjects famously revered him as an incarnation of the divine. The humiliating defeat against the Ottomans at the Battle of Chaldiran left many to wonder about the direct link between the shah and the heavenly realm, though not enough to end the association. Isma'il's successor, Shah Tahmasb (r. 1524-76) continued to be venerated as a god-like figure to the point where people would reverently kiss the doors of his palace and considered any water the shah had touched a cure against fever. [...] Safavid shahs retained their divine aura until the last days of the dynasty, even as some clerics began to criticize them for personal behavior unbecoming to Muslim rulers. It is tempting to think that this aura—charismatic, divinely inspired, imperial—helps explain why no Safavid ruler was ever deposed and that, with the possible but unproven exception of Shah Ismaʿil II (d. 1578), none was ever assassinated. Compare this to the Ottoman state, where one sultan, Osman, was killed in 1622 and seven out of fourteen of his successors were ousted in the next two centuries.

When these circumstances do not exist, polygamy ceases to flourish and monogamy is, as now, the norm. Moreover, even in these conditions, there is a further requirement of equity or justice mentioned in the Qur’an: ‘if you fear that you cannot deal justly (‘’with so many’’), then one only’ (4:3).

<dd><b>♠ Official cult forbids human sacrifice for in-group member ♣ present ♥ </b> "“Our” present religions, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, sometimes called Abrahamic religions, have the theme of human sacrifice right at their inception, with the founding father, Abraham. We are accustomed to the story, which remains a text of “terror and trembling,” as Kierkegaard put it. Abraham is commanded by god to “sacrifice” his only son Isaac, and he is willing to do so (Gen. 22). The Hebrew term for this sacrifice is colah, “make to rise upwards,” as fire and smoke rise to heaven;10 the action is to cut the throat with a knife and to burn the corpse on wood—the knife and wood expressly mentioned in the text. The human victim must be fettered in order to receive the deadly cut. Abraham does obey his god’s command, without even an attempt at protest. The text enjoys the paradox: “the son that you love”; “and the two walked together” (Gen. 22.1-19: 2; 8). In Muslim tradition, the place where Abraham “bound” his son is the rock on the temple hill of Jerusalem, which, since Khalif Omar, is covered by the “temple dome” with its golden cupola. Of course, an angel stops Abraham’s action at the last moment, pointing to an animal for sacrifice. The text says God was “testing” (nissah) Abraham, and his submissive obedience is highly rewarded. The text also states that god accepted the ram “instead of” (tachath) Isaac. One way to discard the terror of the story is to introduce a perspective of historical progress: God was replacing human sacrifice by animal sacrifice. This could be termed an advance in civilization. The Islamic interpretation comes close to this interpretation, as it makes this a founding myth for el eid.” <sup id="cite_ref-542" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-542">[542]</a></sup> “If we begin in 611 rather than 9/11, the first expression of violence and Islam is not violence directed by or sanctified through Islam but rather violence against Muslims. Often that violence was a response to efforts by early Muslims to curtail pre-Islamic forms of violence. Throughout human history, societal violence has been as prevalent as military violence, and in early seventh-century Arabia one finds numerous forms of societal violence. These included, for instance, female infanticide, along with the abuse of orphans, the poor, and marginal. Against such forms of societal violence, the revelations mediated through Muhammad were clear, incontrovertible challenges to the social order of tribal Mecca. For instance, they prohibit the pre-Islamic Arabian practice of female infanticide as well as other bodily and social abuses through directives set down, transmitted, and encoded in the Qur’an." <sup id="cite_ref-543" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-543">[543]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ care/harm ♣ present ♥</b> One of the seven positive commands in Islam is to care for the needy. "Give to the near of kin their due, and also the destitute and the wayfarer, and do not squander your substance wastefully.... But if you turn away from them (the needy), because you are still waiting for your Lord's bounty that you are expecting, then (at least) speak to them a kind word. Do not tie your hand to your neck (do not be miserly) nor stretch it without any restraint (do not be extravagant) for then you should sit down rebuked, denuded (17:23- 9)." <sup id="cite_ref-567" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-567">[567]</a></sup> "Charitableness, helpfulness, helping one's kith and kin, concern for neighbours, assisting the weak and oppressed, and nursing the sick are all activities that are highly valued in Islamic ethics." <sup id="cite_ref-568" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-568">[568]</a></sup> "The third pillar is almsgiving, obligatory charity or welfare money for the poor (zakat). For most purposes, this involves the payment each year of two and a half per cent of one's capital or accumulated wealth and assets, excluding such items as primary residence, car and professional tools. Only certain people are qualified to receive obligatory charity. There are, of course, other forms of charity over and above the obligatory zakat, which can be donated to such recipients as seem appropriate.//Islam stands for brotherhood and social justice and it asserts that the poor and the needy have rights to the wealth of the rich. Payment of almsgiving represents the duty to care for the community's social welfare. It is a great sin not to share one's wealth with the needy and to let them suffer from hunger and disease. Zakat is a duty enjoined by God and undertaken by Muslims in the interest of society as a whole. However, it is also of humanitarian and socio-political value as well as being motivated by spiritual and moral concerns. It is an effective instrument for cultivating the spirit of social responsibility on the part of the contributor and the feeling of security and belonging on the part of the recipient. The Qur'an says 'Those who spend their wealth by night and day, in private and public shall be rewarded by their Lord. No fear shall come upon them, neither shall they grieve' (2:274)." <sup id="cite_ref-569" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-569">[569]</a></sup> "Charity does not consist merely of offering help to the needy; rather it includes anything one does which is of good to others. A hadith of the Prophet mentions that charity includes removing thorns from the road and smiling at one's brother. And open-handedness in spending and giving are to be practised not only towards the poor but also towards one's family, relatives, friends, neighbours, guests and even strangers. Generosity and hospitality are thus highly valued qualities among Muslims in every part of the world. Allah's command to help each other in goodness is not only limited to Muslims, but it covers the whole of mankind in matters that bring virtue to all human beings." <sup id="cite_ref-570" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-570">[570]</a></sup></dd>

[...](Qur'an, 17:31- 7)." <sup id="cite_ref-571" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-571">[571]</a></sup> Moreover, justice is one of the key Islamic virtues: <i>In all their dealings, Muslims are required to stand firmly for justice even if it be against themselves or their kith and kin: 'O you who believe! Stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to Allah, even though it be against yourselves, or your parents, or your kindred, and whether it be against rich or poor, for Allah is nearer to both (than you are)' (4:135)." <sup id="cite_ref-572" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-572">[572]</a></sup> However, it's worth noting that "the adulteration of weights and measures" belonged to the domain of "non-Quranic law"<sup id="cite_ref-573" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-573">[573]</a></sup>.</i></dd>
<dd><b>♠ in-group loyalty ♣ ♥</b></dd>
<dd><b>♠ respect for authority ♣ present ♥</b> Safavid rule partly rested on pre-Islamic notions of divine kingship: "Shah Isma'il, the first Safavid ruler to hold territorial power, was a charismatic king of transcendent stature whose career represented a remarkable merger of the ancient Iranian concept of kingship and Twelver Shi'ism's millenarian, redemptive impulse. His subjects famously revered him as an incarnation of the divine. The humiliating defeat against the Ottomans at the Battle of Chaldiran left many to wonder about the direct link between the shah and the heavenly realm, though not enough to end the association. Isma'il's successor, Shah Tahmasb (r. 1524-76) continued to be venerated as a god-like figure to the point where people would reverently kiss the doors of his palace and considered any water the shah had touched a cure against fever. [...] Safavid shahs retained their divine aura until the last days of the dynasty, even as some clerics began to criticize them for personal behavior unbecoming to Muslim rulers. It is tempting to think that this aura—charismatic, divinely inspired, imperial—helps explain why no Safavid ruler was ever deposed and that, with the possible but unproven exception of Shah Ismaʿil II (d. 1578), none was ever assassinated. Compare this to the Ottoman state, where one sultan, Osman, was killed in 1622 and seven out of fourteen of his successors were ousted in the next two centuries. [...] Even in later times, Safavid shahs continued to be revered as incarnations of the divine by their subjects." <sup id="cite_ref-574" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-574">[574]</a></sup></dd>

The most famous personal example of chastity in the Qur'an is the Virgin Mary: 'And (<i>remember that blessed woman</i>) who guarded her chastity' (21:91)." <sup id="cite_ref-575" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-575">[575]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ kinship ♣ present ♥</b> One of the seven positive commands in Islam is to be kind to one's parents: <i>Your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him, and that you show kindness to your parents. If either or both of them attain old age with you, (show no sign of impatience, and) do not (even) say 'fie' to them; nor rebuke them, but speak kind words to them. And lower unto them the wing of humility and tenderness and say: 'Lord, be merciful to them both, as they did care for me when I was small.' Your Lord best knows what is in your minds. If you are righteous, He surely was ever Forgiving to those who turn (to Him). [...](17:23- 9)." <sup id="cite_ref-576" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-576">[576]</a></sup> In Classical Islamic law, "Maintenance law reflects types of living together in patriarchal structures of extended families. [...] Traditionally the duty of providing maintenance fell nearly exclusively on men [...].The decision-making competence within the family is closely linked to the duty to provide maintenance: significant neglect in either area is one of the few grounds on which a woman may divorce her husband. [...] Primarily, wives and needy dependent children are entitled on principle; sons until they are of age (meaning legally competent), daughters until they marry and after the husband's death or after a divorce has taken effect and the claim to alimony becomes void. [...] Other needy family members, such as parents, grandparents and grandchildren, may also claim a right to maintenance[...]."<sup id="cite_ref-577" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-577">[577]</a></sup></i></dd>
<dd><b>♠ bravery ♣ present ♥</b> "Beginning with the classical texts on Islamic law a fundamental bipartition of the world was evolved which would remain - with some modifications - the basis of all deliberation until well into the twentieth century. The Islamic territory (dar al-Islam , House of Islam), within which sharia norms were applied, was in opposition to the rest of the world, regarded as fundamentally hostile and lawless, the House of War (dar al-harb). Classical doctrine did not allow lasting peace treaties but only temporary armistices in cases where the Muslim forces were inferior. For the rest, the commitment to expand the faith (jihad) - which the scholars undoubtedly saw as a primarily military enterprise - in the sense of increasing Muslim territory remained the religious duty of a sufficient number of believers (fard kifaya). It was not possible to enact a restriction of jihad, giving it a defensive intention applying only to those countries under non-Muslim rule which were in conflict with Islamic rule. Classical doctrine did not refer to those Quranic verses which express only a defensive attitude against attack, but considered these to have been abrogated by the 'sword verses' in sura 9:29ff. (regarding abrogation cf. 2.1 above). It is probably no coincidence that this doctrine was formulated during the time of military expansion under the Umayyads and the early Abbasids."<sup id="cite_ref-578" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-578">[578]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ respect for property ♣ present ♥</b> "Theft. Traditional Islamic penal ordinances (hudud) distinguish between two kinds: al-sariqah al-sughra (simple theft), requiring amputation of the right hand, and al-sariqah al-kubra, the meaning of which is contested but which requires the amputation of the right hand and left foot. Any amputation is carried out only after stringent evidentiary requirements are satisfied. In the opinion of most jurists, a theft induced by hunger is not subject to amputation. Repeat offenders may be subject to additional amputations and imprisonment. Murder during the commission of theft results in the death penalty. Hudud ordinances are considered primarily deterrant and, due to their strict evidentiary requirements, are rarely invoked." <sup id="cite_ref-579" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-579">[579]</a></sup></dd></dl>
