<dl><dd>The Old Kingdom period of Egypt covers the Third to Sixth ruling Dynasties, a period stretching from about 2650 to 2150 BCE. Seshat divides this period into two groups, the 'Classic' Old Kingdom period, covering the First through Fifth Dynasties (roughly 2650-2350 BCE), and the 'Late' Old Kingdom, comprising turbulent Sixth Dynasty (2350-2150 BCE). This dynasty witnessed a decentralization of the king's authority, leading to the First Intermediate Period, or Period of the Regions.</dd></dl>
<p><i>Population and political organization</i>
</p>
<dl><dd>The kings of the Sixth Dynasty were still based at the capital in Memphis. Lower Nubia, over 1000 km away from the Egyptian centre, was organized into six small chiefdoms under the Sixth Dynasty.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> The <i>hwt</i>, once a royal possession and conveyor of central authority, was now dominated by a powerful provincial nobility that viewed their area of control as hereditary property<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> - a development enshrined in the governor's new title, 'great chief of the nome'.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> It appears that military institutions did not change significantly from the Early to the Late Old Kingdom: there was still no permanent, state-run standing army.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Long viewed as an incarnation of an ancient sky and falcon god called Horus, from the Fourth Dynasty onward the Egyptian king also was considered the son of a sun god, Ra.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> Ra grew in importance during the Old Kingdom and, around the beginning of the Fifth Dynasty, had essentially become an Egyptian state god. During the Sixth Dynasty the sun temples in which Ra was worshipped became large institutions maintained by donations and landed property.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> In contrast to the earlier age, during the Sixth Dynasty it was promotion within the sun temples that became the route to high office within the palatial bureaucracy.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> Priests would not become full-time professionals until the New Kingdom: at this time, they worked rotating shifts.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> Nevertheless, large-scale temple building for a wide range of local gods, including Khenti-amentiu at Abydos; Min at Koptos; Hathor at Dendera; Horus at Hierankonpolis; and Satet at Elephantine, underlines the florescence of religious expression as well as the command of a large labour pool by the king and local elites more generally during the Sixth Dynasty.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The growing power of local elites, commanding religious and administrative authority as well as great agricultural wealth and control over labour in the form of corvée dues, undermined the central power of Sixth-Dynasty rulers. After the death of King Pepi II (r. 2278-2184 BCE), there were repeated contests over the succession.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> Eventually, these conflicts, coupled with the declining authority of the kings and possibly periods of famine caused by successive harvest failures due to poor Nile flooding, led to the collapse of centralized authority and the onset of the First Intermediate Period, or Period of the Regions.</dd></dl>

"It would appear that prior to the Fifth Dynasty the existence of a cohesive multi-tiered administration for granaries is not borne out by the evidence, due perhaps to a paucity of the sources, but more likely to the fact that granary management, being carried out by the vizier's office, may have lacked distinguishable traits. A hierarchical bureaucracy sets in only during the latter parts of the Old Kingdom..." "towns were likely to have been in charge of the daily operations of their own granaries ...

Each king built a new sun-temple and their proximity to the pyramid complexes, as well as their similarity to the royal funerary monuments in plan, suggest that they were built for the afterlife rather than the present. A sun-temple consisted of a valley temple linked by a causeway to the upper temple. The main feature of the upper temple was a massive pedestal with an obelisk, a symbol of the sun-god. An alter was placed in a court open to the sun. ... Like pyramid complexes, sun-temples were endowed with land, received donations in kind on festival days, and had their own personnel." <sup id="cite_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-60">[60]</a></sup>

This has been a matter of controversy since John Taylor (1859) first observed the division of perimeter by the height of the Great Pyramid (1760/280) produced an answer of 2 pi.<sup id="cite_ref-120" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-120">[120]</a></sup> The number of Pi - 2 Phi - Phi being the golden mean - (3.1415-2.618 = 0.523) also equals the length of the Egyptian royal cubit in centimeters. There is no written evidence from mathematical papyris the Ancient Egyptians used the meter for length, and the royal cubit is known to have slightly varied in length. Nevertheless there are large number of geometrical relationships in the construction of the Great Pyramid, such as the proportions of the King's chamber. Future discoveries may reveal textual evidence.</dd>

If royal funerals in the Old Kingdom were in any way similar to non-royal funerals from later phases of Egyptian history, they likely included a long procession to the tomb, an elaborate ceremony known as "Opening of the Mouth" which was performed by a priest and featured animal sacrifice, and dancing <sup id="cite_ref-215" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-215">[215]</a></sup>.

In Takeshi Inomata, Lawrence S. Coben (eds.)  Archaeology of Performance: Theaters of Power, Community, and Politics, 273) Other members of his family all travelled with him. As the boats sailed along the river, the Lector Priest read from a scroll of “magical utterances”. The barge bearing the pharaoh’s coffin then was docked at the pyramid harbour.</i></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ daily offering ♥</b> "The daily offering ritual was performed in every functioning temple three times a day, in imitation of human meal times. [...] The offering ritual is known from the Old Kingdom, from the Pyramid Texts and the economic records of Neferirkare at Abu Sir, and it continued to be the essential temple ritual throughout Egyptian history. "The ritual consisted of the physical maintenance of the god, followed by the presentation of food and drink. All ritual actions were made in the name of the king, and it is he who is shown in the temple reliefs, although in reality a priest acted in his stead. Each morning as the sun rose, the temple staff would assemble for duty. The daily ritual involved a variety of ranks of priests - <i>wabs</i>, lector priests, and God's Fathers are specifically mentioned. The Chief Priest would be specially purified in a section of the temple called the <i>per duat</i> or 'the house of morning.' There, he washed his body with water, was purifed with incense, and rinsed his mouth with natron. Texts record, 'There was performed for him all ceremonies that are performed for the king,' transforming him from a priest into a proper surrogate for the king. He then joined the other priests, who had also undergone purification. They gathered the materials needed for the ritual and proceeded to the temple's sanctuary. Before entering, they began a series of recitations that accompanied their preparations - the utterance for lighting the fire; the utterances for taking the incense, putting the brazier on the censer, and putting incense on the fire; and, finally, the 'utterance for advancing to the holy place.' The sense that the ritual was in theory performed by the king is evidence in the Chief Priest's first ritual words: 'It is the king who sends me.' "Each step of the ritual was highly symbolic, referred to mythic events, and was accompanied by a set liturgy. To begin the ritual, the priest awakened the god who slept in the sealed shrine. Holding a candle, he entered the sanctuary, chanting, 'Awake in peace! May your awakening be peaceful!' He broke the seals of the door bolts of the shrine, and drew back the bolts - an action that was equated with removing the fingers of Seth from the eye of Horus. The priest then 'opened the sight of the god' as he swung open the doors of the shrine, and he 'kissed the ground,' prostrating himself before the god's shrine. Each ritual step was punctuated with a specific recitation and an offering of incense and adoration of the deity. In preparation for removing the god from his shrine, the priest scattered pure white sand on the floor of the sanctuary, symbolizing the mound of creation from which all life sprang. He then recited a liturgy for 'Laying Hands Upon the God,' and removed the statue from the shrine, placing it on the sand. After more purifications, the priest removed the deity's outer linen garments and jewelry and wiped away the unguents from the previous day's ritual. Once the statue was suitably cleansed, the priest offered the god lengths of red, white, and green cloth that symbolized the blood of Isis, the uraeus, and fertility. This was followed by the presentation of green and black eye cosmetics. The god was adorned with bracelets, a broad collar, and anklets, and given the appropriate scepters and headdress. The statue was then wrapped in his 'great garment', probably a linen wrapper such as those that were found with the divine statues in the tomb of Tutankhamun. "Now fully awakened and ready for the day, the god was presented with flowers, food, and drink. Economic texts specify that the food offerings consisted of grain, vegetables, wine, and cuts of meat and fowl. When the god was considered to be done, an interval that is not specified in the texts, the food was taken away and the god was readied for sleep. After further purifications, the god was returned to his shrine, the doors closed and seal. As a final ritual, the king performed the 'Bringing of the Foot,' in which he grasped a broomlike <i>had</i>-plant and backed out of the sanctuary, sweeping his footprints from the room. This procedure not only left the sanctuary in good order, but, it was believed, also prevented evil from approaching the god, presumably by following the footprints of the priest-king. "A version of this ritual was repeated at midday and in the evening. The evidence for how elaborate these other two daily rituals were is inconclusive, but it is clear that the morning service was the most complete. The evening service may have been essentially food offerings, but the shrine was not opened, and the activity took place in the antechamber rather than directly before the god." <sup id="cite_ref-279" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-279">[279]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ royal hunt ♥</b> "The task of the hunt came to be seen as a testament to the physical superiority of the hunter over the spiritual powers of the animal world. A successful hunt qualified the hunter as a leader and it especially legitimized the power of the ruler or king (as, for example, the royal hunts portrayed on the chest of Tutankhamun or the hunting scenes of Ramesses III in Medinet Habu). The importance of the hunt in qualifying the powers of Egypt's ruler resulted in an eventual reservation of the hunt as a privilege for the king. For example, during the height of the Old Kingdom, only the king was allowed to go hunting equipped with bow and arrow, and he had the reserved right to hunt specific game animals—above all the wild bull and the lion. Other instances of royal hunting privileges included the harpooning of the hippopotamus in the Nile Delta's marshes, bird-hunting with throw sticks in the papyrus thicket, and the spear-hunting of fish with two-pronged spears. "In the hunting scenes of private tombs from the Old Kingdom, the tomb owner was not shown as the hunter. He participated in the hunt only as a spectator, while the members of his household joined as helpers (for example, in leading the hounds, handling the bent sticks, or lassoing game). Only during the fifth dynasty do nonroyal tomb owners join actively in the hunt (the first documented examples being Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep in Saqqara), where the first depictions of fishing and of bird-hunting in the papyrus thicket were also found. The nonroyal tomb owner in his role as hunter was then given the same qualifying symbols as the ruler. The adaptation of royal hunting privileges for nonroyal tomb owners became evident toward the end of the Old Kingdom, when they were shown hunting with bow and arrow (the first known depiction is the rock tomb of Ankehtifi in Moʿalla). "The ritualistic interpretation of the hunt in ancient Egypt means that hunting was not considered a sport or recreation. An evaluation of hunting as a sport is possible only after the rituals have lost meaning; thus, during the Middle Kingdom, the king and his noble officials went hunting for the first time as a recreation. The concept of open and closed seasons for hunting was unknown to the Egyptians. In depictions of hunting scenes from the Old and the Middle Kingdom, the hunt was portrayed mostly in spring—in the mating season and when the young are born. "[...] "There is very little documentation for trapping in the historic period, in which animals were caught either dead or alive in traps, nets, pits, tight enclosures, and other manmade structures. In an Old Kingdom tomb, two lions were shown being transported in cages on sleighs, and they were probably caught by trapping. In the historic period, most hunts took place as a single-file ambush, in which hunters with varying types of equipment participated. Hounds (and probably hunting leopards) were also used. Many depictions document that the ambush took place in the flat, open landscape of the desert. Fences and nets were erected to close off the area on two sides, with lateral barricades set up parallel. From the opposite open sides, the hunters and beaters would approach with their hounds, herding the game with cries and by beating sticks. While the royal hunter shot the choicest game (wild bull and lion) with bow and arrow, the other participants fell upon the game with bent clubs, axes, or lassos; some caught it with bare hands. "[...] "The exaggerated accounts of royal prowess in the hunt cannot be taken as 'huntsman's slang,' because such accounts were written in order to praise the king. The victorious hunt of the king metaphorically made 'game' of Egypt's enemies, and they fled in horror from the attacking king. They also ran like 'herds of game' from the attacking ruler, it was said." <sup id="cite_ref-357" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-357">[357]</a></sup></dd>

<p><b>♠ Rulers are legitimated by gods ♣ present ♥</b> The ideology of state was a 'social contract' between the king and his subjects. This contract was, however, not one made between the ruler and the people (and e.g. enshrined in a written constitution); it was one signed with the gods. The king who failed to carry through his side of the contract would expect to lose favour with the gods. The people, for their part, could not legitimately rebel on their own evaluation of the king's performance; only given signs that the gods did not consider the king legitimate.
</p><p>"In the case of Ancient Egypt, the ideology of the state, promoted through religious, artistic and literary texts, was centred around the divine right of the king to secure the submission of his subjects to his royal will in return for their right to expect protection, subsistence and the preservation of Maat (order, justice, righteousness) in society."<sup id="cite_ref-535" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-535">[535]</a></sup>

</p><p>"But, perhaps, the most definitive expression of the king's acting like Ra is that he puts Maat in the place of isfet, its opposite. As the texts say: 'Heaven is at peace; earth is in joy. For they have heard the king has set right (in the place of wrong) (PT 1775) and 'Unas has come forth from the Island of Fire. Unas has set Maat in it in the place of isfet' (PT 265). The putting of Maat in the place of isfet or replacing evil with good is fundamental to both royal and later general human responsibility. Thus the Pyramid Texts establish the basis of moral justification. ... In the Pyramid Texts, then, Maat is a moral claim for justification before history and heaven, humanity and God by the king. This moral claim is at the same time the core of the claim which legitimates the king's rule ... Bergman calls Maat 'the fundamental state myth'".<sup id="cite_ref-538" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-538">[538]</a></sup>

No HS; HS of prisoners inferred present; HS of criminals inferred present (expert disagreement). According to Te Velde, human sacrifice was very occasionally practiced in Ancient Egypt <sup id="cite_ref-586" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-586">[586]</a></sup>. From the fact that he doesn’t provide specific dates, it seems reasonable to infer that Te Velde’s statement applies to the whole of Ancient Egyptian history. Unfortunately, Te Velde does not provide information regarding the specific categories of people that were deemed to be suitable for sacrifice, though he does express skepticism that this fate was reserved for prisoners of war: “Schulman believes that conquered enemies who were the prisoners of war of the victorious army on its return were ceremonially sacrificed as thank offerings. The Egyptians certainly condemned rebels to death and undoubtedly practiced war with sometimes barbaric methods. However, the regular killing of people during temple rituals is rather different to killing in the heat of battle or execution after a legal trial. For the time being, I believe that the rebels or enemies of the pharaoh were generally symbolically killed, for example in representations. [...] However, I do not want to imply that in the thousands of years of Egyptian history there were no instances when attitudes hardened, when men turned symbolism into reality and literally rather than symbolically sacrificed other men.” <sup id="cite_ref-587" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-587">[587]</a></sup>. NB As for the specific practice of retainer sacrifice, it appears that it existed “only for a brief period at the very beginning of pharaonic civilization." <sup id="cite_ref-588" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-588">[588]</a></sup> "It would certainly be overly ambitious to opine that execration rites always featured human sacrifice; however, it is very fair to postulate that many did so. The lack of other human remains makes it difficult to say more, though the accident of preservation allows the possibility that this may have been a regular feature, at least in the Middle and New Kingdoms, from whence our two known examples come. Perhaps little can be said for the Old Kingdom. The execration deposits in our crowded Giza and Saqqara finds likely did not have a human element to the rites. Still, it is plausible, and the evidence will be categorized thus." <sup id="cite_ref-589" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-589">[589]</a></sup> "Grimm’s interpretation can best be understood in light of other events, some of which will be discussed more fully in chapter 6 but must be mentioned now in order to properly evaluate Grimm’s claim. The cage at Giza likely represents the continuation of a practice evidenced in pre-dynastic times. A rock drawing of a royal procession in Gebel Sheikh Suleiman from the late Pre-dynastic Period, roughly contemporary with Narmer,47 depicts an Egyptian warship possibly cruising over enemies who are being cast in front of its keel. Besides the enemies who are perhaps) flung into the water, one is shown bound to the front of the ship, seemingly hanging over the water.48 It is impossible to tell whether or not those who were being thrown into the water were already dead; though the possibility that they could escape the river if not dead makes their deceased state more likely. The bound prisoner appears to almost certainly be alive. This is somewhat reminiscent of scenes from Hierakonpolis Tomb 100 and of the Painted Linen from Gebelein in Turin, in which smiting a prisoner is also associated with a royal barque.49 A royal barque is also depicted above the decapitated prisoners on the Narmer Palette. Taken together, we see a steady stream of evidence that transporting and slaying prisoners in association with the royal barque was part of royal processions from the era of Hierakonpolis Tomb 100 (c. 3500 BCE) through at least the Giza era (c. 2500 BCE). [...] The existence of such a cage in connection with the fourth-dynasty complex is strong evidence that such a practice was part of that time period. Indeed, it is hard to imagine that it would be included in the funerary complex of Khufu if it were not an important and consistently needed ritual object. We can therefore postulate that in the Fourth Dynasty, and probably on a continual basis from at least the time of the Gebel Sheikh Suleiman pre- dynastic depiction more than half a millenia earlier, enemies were regularly carried on ships as part of a ritual that almost certainly included their slaughter." <sup id="cite_ref-590" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-590">[590]</a></sup> However, this sacrifice might not have been for the benefit of a deity, but part of the trappings of royal power (RA's comment).

However, its ritual context and theological implications indicate that it probably did. Assuming the existence of such a rite as is described in the hymn, we are still unsure of when it was enacted, but it is likely that the rite existed for some time before its immortalization in the pyramids and that it continued to exist at least to its middle-kingdom expression in the Coffin Texts, where it specifies what types of people were to be slaughtered." <sup id="cite_ref-591" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-591">[591]</a></sup> This evidence compiled by Muhlestein suggests that HS may have been practiced, and should be coded as inferred present.

The lack of other human remains makes it difficult to say more, though the accident of preservation allows the possibility that this may have been a regular feature, at least in the Middle and New Kingdoms, from whence our two known examples come. Perhaps little can be said for the Old Kingdom. The execration deposits in our crowded Giza and Saqqara finds likely did not have a human element to the rites. Still, it is plausible, and the evidence will be categorized thus." <sup id="cite_ref-615" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-615">[615]</a></sup> "Grimm’s interpretation can best be understood in light of other events, some of which will be discussed more fully in chapter 6 but must be mentioned now in order to properly evaluate Grimm’s claim. The cage at Giza likely represents the continuation of a practice evidenced in pre-dynastic times. A rock drawing of a royal procession in Gebel Sheikh Suleiman from the late Pre-dynastic Period, roughly contemporary with Narmer,47 depicts an Egyptian warship possibly cruising over enemies who are being cast in front of its keel. Besides the enemies who are perhaps) flung into the water, one is shown bound to the front of the ship, seemingly hanging over the water.48 It is impossible to tell whether or not those who were being thrown into the water were already dead; though the possibility that they could escape the river if not dead makes their deceased state more likely. The bound prisoner appears to almost certainly be alive. This is somewhat reminiscent of scenes from Hierakonpolis Tomb 100 and of the Painted Linen from Gebelein in Turin, in which smiting a prisoner is also associated with a royal barque.49 A royal barque is also depicted above the decapitated prisoners on the Narmer Palette. Taken together, we see a steady stream of evidence that transporting and slaying prisoners in association with the royal barque was part of royal processions from the era of Hierakonpolis Tomb 100 (c. 3500 BCE) through at least the Giza era (c. 2500 BCE). [...] The existence of such a cage in connection with the fourth-dynasty complex is strong evidence that such a practice was part of that time period. Indeed, it is hard to imagine that it would be included in the funerary complex of Khufu if it were not an important and consistently needed ritual object. We can therefore postulate that in the Fourth Dynasty, and probably on a continual basis from at least the time of the Gebel Sheikh Suleiman pre- dynastic depiction more than half a millenia earlier, enemies were regularly carried on ships as part of a ritual that almost certainly included their slaughter." <sup id="cite_ref-616" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-616">[616]</a></sup> However, this sacrifice might not have been for the benefit of a deity, but part of the trappings of royal power (RA's comment). The Cannibal hymn is further evidence of potential HS: "As with so many occurrences examined in this book, we cannot be certain if the Cannibal Hymn represents a ritual that actually involved ritual slaying. However, its ritual context and theological implications indicate that it probably did. Assuming the existence of such a rite as is described in the hymn, we are still unsure of when it was enacted, but it is likely that the rite existed for some time before its immortalization in the pyramids and that it continued to exist at least to its middle-kingdom expression in the Coffin Texts, where it specifies what types of people were to be slaughtered." <sup id="cite_ref-617" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-617">[617]</a></sup> This evidence compiled by Muhlestein suggests that HS may have been practiced, and should be coded as inferred present. However, the consensus in Egyptology has long been that HS was absent.  <sup id="cite_ref-618" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-618">[618]</a></sup></dd></dl>

My proposition here is thus that these various sources suggest that in ancient Egypt the wages to which free labourers were viewed as being entitled were viewed in social terms and expressed in terms of an economic value or price, rather than being defined or understood solely in terms of production. This labour value was thus not related to the product, but rather to the labour."<sup id="cite_ref-709" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-709">[709]</a></sup>
