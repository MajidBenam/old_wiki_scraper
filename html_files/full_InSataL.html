[...] Chronological reconstructions fall into two groups. Advocates of the now largely discredited 'long chronology' support the maximal span of c. 475 years derived from the literal reading of the [Puranic king lists] [...]. This interpretation is problematic given the historical context of the Puranas, the lack of concordance among the texts, and the lack of supporting numismatic or incriptional evidence for many of the rulers named. "Advocates of the more widely accepted 'short chronology' [...] combine Puranic records with other lines of numismatic, archaeological, and textual evidence and date the Satavahana rule from the beginning of the first century BCE to the end of the second century CE. Even here, many scholars are reluctant to assign absolute dates to specific kings and those who do often select quite disparate dates and name different rulers.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Asvamedha ♥</b> The asvamedha is an elaborate ritual performed by a consecrated king, with the help of hundreds of retainers. Its central act consists of the sacrifice of a horse (there is debate as to whether this sacrifice was literal or symbolic). This horse had been allowed to roam freely, escorted by 300 armed men and 100 horses, in the period preceding the ritual: a year according to most sources, although it is possible that this "year" was actually only one or a few days. The king could claim whichever territory the horse wandered into, whether it belonged to him or not. As for the sacrifice itself, it was preceded by the sacrifice of a dog (or a different animal, or several animals), and followed by mock-copulation between the queen and the dead horse, as well as by the recitation, on the part of the king, of obscene phrases. This ritual was performed rarely, and only by particularly powerful kings. It had many aims. According to Doniger <sup id="cite_ref-173" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-173">[173]</a></sup>, its main aim was to purify the king from the bloodshed that his position as ruler of an empire made inevitable, and to provide him with the pretext of conquering new territories. According to Zaroff <sup id="cite_ref-174" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-174">[174]</a></sup>, it was meant "to strengthen social bonds, assure military victory and [the] well being of the community". According to Kak <sup id="cite_ref-175" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-175">[175]</a></sup>, it was meant to "regenerates the powers and the fame of the king".</dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ puja ♥</b> "While the Yajna was central during Vedic times, the ceremonial rites of Puja became widespread in the post-Vedic or classical period [i.e. circa 400 BCE-300 CE], coming to the foreground as the quintessential Hindu ritual. [...] "Appearing initially in the scenic rites of sacred dramas and more fully developed within the textual tradition of the Agamas, Puja or Deva Puja was a form of religious ritual that Hindus began to perform on a variety of occasions to petition or show respect to their chosen gods or goddesses. Puja may be defined as any act of showing reverence to a god, a spirit, or another aspect of the divine through invocations, prayers, offerings, songs, and rituals. An essential part of Puja for the Hindu devotee is making a personal connection with the divine. Most often the contact is facilitated through an object: an element of nature, a sculpture, a vessel, or a painting. During Puja an image or other symbol of the god serves as a means of gaining access to the divine. The icon is not the deity itself; rather it is believed to be filled with the deity’s cosmic energy or spirit. [...]. "Many devout Hindus in the modern world still perform Puja once or twice a day. As such, Puja should be done after a shower or bath, and it is recommended that Puja rites be performed before food intake to ensure purity (sattva) and full concentration (dhyana). Puja is performed on special occasions in addition to the daily ritual. [...] "Puja normally includes activities or observances like meditation (dhyana), the practice of austerity (tapas), chanting (mantra), scripture reading (svadhyaya), offering food (naivedya) and prostrations (ashtanga pranama, dandavat). The individual may apply a tilaka mark on the forehead with sandalwood paste and then a vermillion (kumkum) dot in its centre. This signifies submission to the divine presence. "Puja is usually concluded with an Arati ceremony to the deity, including a series of offerings. Puja may be performed by an individual or as part of a group. The ritual may be observed in silence or accompanied by prayers and songs. [...] "As part of the overall Puja ritual sequence, an Arati ceremony is usually conducted in which the flame from burning wicks soaked in ghee (clarified butter) or camphor is offered to one or more Devas or Devis. [...] In relation to food offerings, it takes place just after the food is placed on the altar and 'consumed' by the deity. Generally Arati is performed during most all Hindu ceremonies and occasions. The activity involves the clockwise movement of the offered article, whether incense, flower, lamp wick, plate, or other, before the image or symbol and is generally accompanied by the singing of songs in praise of a deva or holy person. In the process the article itself is supposed to acquire sacred power. The priest may then circulate the article, especially the plate with burning lamp wick, among all those present, who cup their downturned hands over the flame and then raise their palms to their forehead. The purificatory blessing, passed from the divine to the flame, has now been passed to the devotee. [...] "One of the purposes of performing Arati is to ward off evil effects and the malefic influence of the 'evil eye.' [...] "The Vishnudharmasutra (chapter 65) provides one of the earliest (ca. 300 b.c.e. ) detailed descriptions of Deva Puja of Vishnu. This Puja ceremony has integrated the Vedic chanting of the Gayatri Mantra and the Purusha-Sukta. The Pujaprakasa section presents the details of this Deva Puja in sixteen stages or Upacaras that have become more or less standardized in temple ritual sequences: avahana (invite), asana (offer seat), padya (wash feet), arghya (wash hands), acamaniya (offer water to drink), snana (bathe), vastra (clothe), yajnopavita (offer sacred thread), anulepana (offer sandalwood paste), gandha (offer fragrances), puspa (offer flowers), dhupa (offer incense), dipa (offer lamp wick), naivedya (offer food), namaskara (offer prostrations), pradakshina (circumambulate) and visarjana (conclude).

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Spring Festival ♥</b> The Spring Festival appears to be one of the oldest Hindu celebrations.<sup id="cite_ref-302" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-302">[302]</a></sup> Because it has changed through time and is performed somewhat differently in different regions, but no accounts appear to exist of how it was performed in this polity specifically, the ritual coded here is a generic, "essential" version. "With respect to the fundamental characteristics of the Vasantotsava as found in the above Sanskrit texts, we can fruitfully focus our attention in four general directions. Firstly, the Spring Festival crosses sectarian boundaries. It is a popular festival celebrated by several sects as well as outside any readily identifiable sectarian context. No main deity or group of deities is here the consistent object of devotion; the Vasantotsava may be celebrated by all, regardless of private or public devotional affiliations. Second, the element of fire appears in some context in almost all descriptions of this festival: it is a symbol of death, renewal, transformation and purification. Third, the significance of the marriage motif with respect to the Vasantotsava is indicated by a number of texts including the Bhavisya Purana (as previously noted). [...] Fourth and finally the rituals of the Vasantotsava revolve, to a greater or lesser extent, around sensuality. The festival is a fertility festival and erotic motifs from both the mortal and the immortal realms are freely combined with fertility motifs. These four components of the Spring Festival will be treated in turn in the sections that follow. "[...] "The eroticism of the spring celebrations as found in the Ratnavali is characterized by a certain amount of social freedom and licentiousness. Thus the Spring Festival is a peculiar mix of control and freedom: the festival occurs within the city under the auspices of kings and Brahmins and at the same time social barriers are purposefully broken down and the erotic permeates the ritual. The breakdown of social relationships is indicated by rituals such as playing 'Holi' (throwing colored powder), mixing of castes and men and women in the streets, sex, licence, and powder. Eroticism and sexual licence as brought out in the throwing of powder and dancing which comprise this festival reflect the sexual potency of the season." <sup id="cite_ref-303" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-303">[303]</a></sup></dd>

<p>Unlike the preceding rituals, the most dysphoric collective ritual may not belong to the official cult, but may be practiced by another group that has a significant role in the polity. When selecting the relevant ritual do keep in mind that we are foremost interested in rituals containing the highest intensity of dysphoria even though they may contain other elements that are less emotional or even euphoric. Furthermore, we are interested in peak levels of dysphoria for participants or ritual specialists (not the audience or sacrificial victims). Also, as we are interested in how these dysphoric moments are remembered it is necessary for the participants not normally to die during the rituals.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ ♥</b> Ajivika initiations may have been dysphoric, but little is known about them, particularly in terms of how they may have been practiced in Mauryan times:<b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ ♥</b> daily/weekly/monthly/yearly/once per generation/once in a lifetime. Code the frequency of participating in a ritual from the perspective of the ritual specialist (e.g. priest). Entertainers (acrobats, dancers, actors...) are considered as ritual specialists. If the ritual's frequency does not fit within any of the suggested categories--for example, if it is performed every three days, or every twelve years--use the category that is closest, then specify the exact frequency in the description field.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ ♥</b> daily/weekly/monthly/yearly/once per generation/once in a lifetime. Code the frequency of participating in a ritual from the perspective of the participants. This group of participants does not include the ritual specialists, like priests. It also does not include sacrificial victims. However, highly engaged audiences (audiences who are processing, jeering, ...) are considered as participants. Audiences consisting of passive spectators or witnesses are coded for in the next variable. When it is difficult to distinguish between a highly engaged audience and an audience consisting of passive spectators, code these audiences here.

<dd> <b>♠ Number of power transitions ♣ 16-30  ♥</b> ‘All constructions rely heavily on the Puranic king lists, with their attendant interpretative complications (i.e., that they are Brahmanical elite texts written in a particular political context long after the events they purport to report [Ray 1986:34]). Chronological reconstructions fall into two groups. Advocates of the now largely discredited “long chronology” support the maximal span of c.475 years derived from a literal reading of the Puranas (Nilakanta Sastri 1975: 92-4; Mirashi 1981), and view the Satavahana polity as emerging directly after the Mauryan collapse. This interpretation is problematic given the historical context of the Puranas, the lack of concordance among the texts, and the lack of supporting numismatic or inscriptional evidence for many of the rulers named. Advocates of the more widely accepted “short chronology” (Ray 1986; Shastri 1987, 1991; Parasher-Sen 1993; Goyal 1995) combine Puranic records with other lines of numismatic, archaeological, and textural evidence and date the Satavahana rule from the beginning of the first century BCE to the end of the second century C.E. Even here, many scholars are reluctant to assign absolute dates to specific kings and those who do often select quite disparate dates and name different rulers. Nonetheless, the shorter chronology is the more reasonable given current evidence, and the version developed by Himanshu Ray (1986: 33-50, following Dehejia 1972) will be used in this chapter... the calendrical dates should be considered approximations. Although various Puranas list several intervening Satavahana rulers that fill the 111 year gap between the two periods of rule presented in Table 6.1, no other sources survived to verify their existence, and the relation between earlier and later rulers is murky. This gap suggests that the Satavahana empire is best characterized as having been marked by two brief periods of imperial florescence with an intervening period of political regionalization or “collapse.” Like the Mauryans, the success of individual rulers in forging a large imperial polity as not transformed into an effective administrative structure that could weather periods of internal and external dissension or the reigns of less effective rulers. ’ <sup id="cite_ref-353" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-353">[353]</a></sup> Simuka (before 100 BCE), Kanha (100-70 BCE)Satakarni I (70-60 BCE), Satakarni II (50-25 BCE), Kshatrapa interregnum, Gautamiputra Satakarni (86-110 CE), Pulumavi (110-138 CE), Vashishtiputra Satakarni (138-145 CE), Shiva Shri Pulumavi (145-152 CE), Shiva Skanda Satakarni (145-152 CE), Yajna Shri Satakarni (152-181 CE), Vijaya Satakarni (???), Chandra Shri (???),Pulumavi II (???), Abhira Isvasena (???), Madhariputra Sakasena (???), Haritiputra Satakarni (???) <sup id="cite_ref-354" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-354">[354]</a></sup> ‘The Matsya Purana makes the broad statement that there were nineteen kings in the dynasty, while three manuscripts actually name thirty kings.

No post-Maurya dynasty can boast of so many coins as the Satavahanas. They were certainly much larger than what can be attributed to the Mauryas. This would imply stronger control over the officials. Hoards of the Roman gold coins found in the Satavahana territory may have been used for large-scale transactions or as bullion.

Along with the high-value silver punch-marked coins and the Roman gold coins, the Satavanhanas circulated a series of copper and potin coins of different denominations for low-value transactions. They also issued bilingual (Tamil and Prakrit) legend-bearing coins. The interaction between the centre and the periphery was maintained through hierarchized administrative and revenue units extending vertically and thus reaching the primary producer at village level. At the upper level of the bureaucracy there were title-holders such as mahatalavara, amatya (minister), rastrapalaka (provincial governor) and mahasenapati (army commander), functioning at a level below royalty.

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Monogamy ♣ present ♥</b>  “Notwithstanding the Hindu ideal of monogamous marriage as a saṃskara, a one-to-one union for life, traditional Hindu law clearly permitted polygamy to men in certain situations and on certain grounds.

However, polygamy was also in practice, especially among the nobles.

<dd><b>♠ Social class ♣ present ♥</b> "There have been a number of attempts to underplay, to question, and to lampoon the hierarchical inequality and even the existence of the caste system. As we will also see it differs, in some degree, from region to region. However, the concepts of varna and, more importantly, jāti lie at the heart of the caste system and they form an ideal core around which the complexity of detail and difference can then be erected. [...] Thus the four varnas are the Brahmins who represent priesthood and learning, the Kshatriyas who represent the warriors and kings, who protect the people, the Vaishyas who represent the people who engage in agriculture, farming and trade, and the Shūdras who represent the servants who look after and serve the others. The Brahmins fulfil the function of the mouth, the Kshatriyas fulfil the function of the arms, the Vaishyas fulfil the function of the thighs, and the Shūdras fulfil the function of the feet. The model is clearly a hierarchy but it is a complementary hierarchy and unity, wherein the different elements sustain one another. [...] In practice the key to the caste system are the sub-castes, or jātis. There are a great number of these in each varna, and in practice there is a hierarchy within each set so that only certain jātis can marry and eat with each other. Not all Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas or Shūdras can marry or eat together. Those privileges are confined to a limited number of jātis within each varna. [...] Clearly there have been changes in the system over long centuries. Particular jātis have elevated themselves through economic means, through disputing status, through propaganda, through moving, through changing religion, and so on. But on the whole, over such a long period of time, the system has remained strong, especially in the villages. [...] The strength of the caste system has been enhanced by another principle emphasised by Dumont (1980) in his classical work entitled ‘’Homo Hierarchicus: The Caste System and its Implications’’. According to Dumont, in addition to the distinctions already outlined that fit varnas and jātis into hierarchies, another must be added. This distinction takes caste hierarchical divides beyond the kind of class distinctions found in eighteenth-century Britain or in the Ancien Regime in Europe, by stressing the opposition between purity and pollution. Caste difference, according to this classification, goes beyond class differences into this other realm of ritual purity and pollution. The Brahmins are the highest and purest varna, and the Dalits are the lowest, in that they are outside varna and are impure altogether. The other varnas rank in between. Pollution occurs in different ways. It occurs through bodily contact of one sort or another, with menstrual cycles, through birth and death, through emissions such as faeces, urine and saliva, and through contact with night-soil, dirty clothes, unswept rooms and so on. Thus marriage and sex have to function within the correct set of jātis in the correct varna. Polluting jobs such as laundering and sweeping are done by people of lower castes so that the blood of people of higher castes can remain ‘pure’. Equally menstrual activity among older women makes them more ‘impure’ than men or pre-menstrual virgins, and therefore women are more polluting than men. They will thus often live semi-separately while menstruating, during which time they will also avoid going to the temple and therefore ‘polluting’ the gods. Furthermore, untouchable Dalits were prohibited from entering many temples before the post-Independence freedom-of-temple-entry legislation and even now they are kept out of some temples in many villages. [...] It is also true to say that Dumont’s thesis suffers from exaggeration and other matters are important in discussing caste.

<p><b>♠ Rulers are gods ♣ present ♥</b> “Divinity was cheap in ancient India. Every brahman was in a sense a god, as were ascetics with a reputation for sanctity. Householders sponsoring and financing sacrifices were in theory raised to divinity, at least for the duration of the ceremony, while even sticks and stones might be alive with inherent godhead. Moreover the gods were fallible and capable of sin.

<p><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of equality ♣ absent ♥</b> Caste system. "There have been a number of attempts to underplay, to question, and to lampoon the hierarchical inequality and even the existence of the caste system. As we will also see it differs, in some degree, from region to region. However, the concepts of varna and, more importantly, jāti lie at the heart of the caste system and they form an ideal core around which the complexity of detail and difference can then be erected. [...] Thus the four varnas are the Brahmins who represent priesthood and learning, the Kshatriyas who represent the warriors and kings, who protect the people, the Vaishyas who represent the people who engage in agriculture, farming and trade, and the Shūdras who represent the servants who look after and serve the others. The Brahmins fulfil the function of the mouth, the Kshatriyas fulfil the function of the arms, the Vaishyas fulfil the function of the thighs, and the Shūdras fulfil the function of the feet. The model is clearly a hierarchy but it is a complementary hierarchy and unity, wherein the different elements sustain one another. [...] In practice the key to the caste system are the sub-castes, or jātis. There are a great number of these in each varna, and in practice there is a hierarchy within each set so that only certain jātis can marry and eat with each other. Not all Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas or Shūdras can marry or eat together. Those privileges are confined to a limited number of jātis within each varna. [...] Clearly there have been changes in the system over long centuries. Particular jātis have elevated themselves through economic means, through disputing status, through propaganda, through moving, through changing religion, and so on. But on the whole, over such a long period of time, the system has remained strong, especially in the villages. [...] The strength of the caste system has been enhanced by another principle emphasised by Dumont (1980) in his classical work entitled ‘’Homo Hierarchicus: The Caste System and its Implications’’. According to Dumont, in addition to the distinctions already outlined that fit varnas and jātis into hierarchies, another must be added. This distinction takes caste hierarchical divides beyond the kind of class distinctions found in eighteenth-century Britain or in the Ancien Regime in Europe, by stressing the opposition between purity and pollution. Caste difference, according to this classification, goes beyond class differences into this other realm of ritual purity and pollution. The Brahmins are the highest and purest varna, and the Dalits are the lowest, in that they are outside varna and are impure altogether. The other varnas rank in between. Pollution occurs in different ways. It occurs through bodily contact of one sort or another, with menstrual cycles, through birth and death, through emissions such as faeces, urine and saliva, and through contact with night-soil, dirty clothes, unswept rooms and so on. Thus marriage and sex have to function within the correct set of jātis in the correct varna. Polluting jobs such as laundering and sweeping are done by people of lower castes so that the blood of people of higher castes can remain ‘pure’. Equally menstrual activity among older women makes them more ‘impure’ than men or pre-menstrual virgins, and therefore women are more polluting than men. They will thus often live semi-separately while menstruating, during which time they will also avoid going to the temple and therefore ‘polluting’ the gods. Furthermore, untouchable Dalits were prohibited from entering many temples before the post-Independence freedom-of-temple-entry legislation and even now they are kept out of some temples in many villages. [...] It is also true to say that Dumont’s thesis suffers from exaggeration and other matters are important in discussing caste. Nevertheless, there is at least an element of truth in the notion that purity and pollution has relevance in any discussion of caste.” <sup id="cite_ref-479" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-479">[479]</a></sup>

It occurs through bodily contact of one sort or another, with menstrual cycles, through birth and death, through emissions such as faeces, urine and saliva, and through contact with night-soil, dirty clothes, unswept rooms and so on. Thus marriage and sex have to function within the correct set of jātis in the correct varna. Polluting jobs such as laundering and sweeping are done by people of lower castes so that the blood of people of higher castes can remain ‘pure’. Equally menstrual activity among older women makes them more ‘impure’ than men or pre-menstrual virgins, and therefore women are more polluting than men. They will thus often live semi-separately while menstruating, during which time they will also avoid going to the temple and therefore ‘polluting’ the gods. Furthermore, untouchable Dalits were prohibited from entering many temples before the post-Independence freedom-of-temple-entry legislation and even now they are kept out of some temples in many villages. [...] It is also true to say that Dumont’s thesis suffers from exaggeration and other matters are important in discussing caste. Nevertheless, there is at least an element of truth in the notion that purity and pollution has relevance in any discussion of caste.” <sup id="cite_ref-490" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-490">[490]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of monogamy ♣ absent ♥</b>  “Notwithstanding the Hindu ideal of monogamous marriage as a saṃskāra, a one-to-one union for life, traditional Hindu law clearly permitted polygamy to men in certain situations and on certain grounds. In this, Hindu law is similar to Islamic law in approach, as well as to Chinese law and African laws, all of which tolerate polygamy to some extent. Meyer (1952: 108) wrote that (p.378) polygamy in India is ‘as old as the hills and does not form the slightest offence in the Brahmanic system’, although since Vedic times monogamy is seen as the ideal. This is confirmed by Mitra (1965: 49) with quotes from earlier sources, to the effect that ‘the fundamental conception of marriage was monogamous and not polygamous’. M. Basu (2001: 28)summarizes the traditional position: ‘Vedic literature generally endorsed monogamy and [it] was considered the best practice of the highest virtue. However, polygamy was also in practice, especially among the nobles. A number of such instances of polygamy are available not only in later Vedic literature, but also in the Rig Veda.’” <sup id="cite_ref-491" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-491">[491]</a></sup>

These virtues that are said to be common to all humans are known as sadhārana (common) or sanatana (eternal) dharma. For example, the Law of Manu (X:63) argues that non-injury, truth, not stealing, purity and control of the senses summarise dharma for the four castes. Elsewhere Manu (VI:91- 2) asserts that avoiding backbiting, hypocrisy, greed, infatuation, anger and discontent is approved dharma for all the stages of life. The problem is that there are different views as to what the actuality of universal dharma is. Radhakrishnan, for example, argues for a sanatana dharma, based upon Advaita Vedanta thought, that is said to be present in all religious traditions. It is a kind of perennial philosophy that is at the heart of every religious tradition not just at the heart of the Hindu tradition. Others concentrate upon a universal dharma within the Hindu tradition itself but there is no absolute consensus as to what it is. Nevertheless, in theory, the ethical virtues of compassion, generosity, gratitude, and non-violence are universally regarded by most Hindus.” <sup id="cite_ref-494" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-494">[494]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Number of officially sanctioned supernatural beings ♣ polytheistic ♥</b> "According to one popular formula, there are 330 million gods in Hinduism. Nevertheless, most Hindus have believed that there is ultimately one deity, and that the diversity of other gods are his or her emanations or manifestations, representing his or her agency in particular contexts. [...] The three gods most commonly worshipped as the ultimate in Hindu traditions are Visnu, Siva, and the Goddess, variously called Devī, "Goddess," and Sakti, "Power." This triad of deities must be distinguished from an overlapping group of three deities who are conceived in the Puranas and other authoritative traditions to perform particular cosmic functions - Brahma, who creates the universe anew in each vast cosmic cycle, and also, in some accounts, bestows the Veda upon humanity; Visnu, who preserves the universe by intervening to rectify problems through his avataras, "descents" or "incarnations"; and Siva, who destroys the universe at the end of each cosmic cycle. [...] [W]hichever deity is conceived as the ultimate is understood to be the source who emanates the others, both the triad who perform the aforementioned cosmic functions and lower supernatural beings, and thus to be the ultimate agent in their actions. [...] There are numerous other important deities besides those frequently conceived as a monotheistic ultimate. One of the most important of these is Ganesa, a son of Siva with the head of an elephant, believed to be a protective figure that removes obstacles. Another is Hanuman, the monkey-god who helped Rama in his battle against Ravana, idealized for his devotion to Rama and Sīta. Other deities important in particular regions include the South Indian Ayappa, regarded as the son of Siva and a female avatara of Visnu; and smallpox goddesses such as the North Indian Sitala." <sup id="cite_ref-521" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-521">[521]</a></sup></dd>

Every good deed brings a reward, and every bad deed a punishment. The terms ‘reward’ and ‘punishment’ are deceptive, however; for karma is not seen as a set of rewards and punishments doled out by a just God, but in impersonal terms, as the working of natural law. Karma attracts reactions to moral agents like an ethical law of gravity. Benevolent actions produce good results for the person who engages in them.

They are, in theory if not always in fact, the key scholars in the Hindu tradition. The Kshatriyas have traditionally been seen, again in theory if not always in practice, as the rulers who maintain society, uphold dharma and protect the householder system. They built and sponsored temples, protected their subjects and their deities and, to that extent, the Brahmins recognised a ruler’s overlordship. However, the kingly role in ruling and guardianship duties involved more ‘polluting tendencies’ than were usual in a Brahmin’s life. The Brahmins have had a dual role in society. Those who are active priests in temples have engaged in functions that involve being given gifts by worshippers and such temple priests are more involved with lower castes. Paradoxically Brahmins who are versed in promoting scholarship and in advancing religious learning but who do not act as serving priests are, in general, more widely admired because they have less contact with the public. Thus Brahmins who are not priests can be more akin to those renouncers engaged in lifelong learning and spirituality, rather than in the hurly-burly of householder life.

According to Dumont, in addition to the distinctions already outlined that fit varnas and jatis into hierarchies, another must be added. This distinction takes caste hierarchical divides beyond the kind of class distinctions found in eighteenth-century Britain or in the Ancien Regime in Europe, by stressing the opposition between purity and pollution. Caste difference, according to this classification, goes beyond class differences into this other realm of ritual purity and pollution. The Brahmins are the highest and purest varna, and the Dalits are the lowest, in that they are outside varna and are impure altogether. The other varnas rank in between. Pollution occurs in different ways. It occurs through bodily contact of one sort or another, with menstrual cycles, through birth and death, through emissions such as faeces, urine and saliva, and through contact with night-soil, dirty clothes, unswept rooms and so on. Thus marriage and sex have to function within the correct set of jatis in the correct varna. Polluting jobs such as laundering and sweeping are done by people of lower castes so that the blood of people of higher castes can remain ‘pure’. Equally menstrual activity among older women makes them more ‘impure’ than men or pre-menstrual virgins, and therefore women are more polluting than men. They will thus often live semi-separately while menstruating, during which time they will also avoid going to the temple and therefore ‘polluting’ the gods. Furthermore, untouchable Dalits were prohibited from entering many temples before the post-Independence freedom-of-temple-entry legislation and even now they are kept out of some temples in many villages. [...] It is also true to say that Dumont’s thesis suffers from exaggeration and other matters are important in discussing caste. Nevertheless, there is at least an element of truth in the notion that purity and pollution has relevance in any discussion of caste." <sup id="cite_ref-538" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-538">[538]</a></sup></dd>

The householder’s business is the maintenance and support of those in the other three stages of life: the students who have not yet entered into the world of work, the retirees who have seen the birth of grandchildren and spotted their first gray hairs, and the renunciants, those who have left behind not only the world of work and material possession but who have also left behind family and self-interest for a life focused on spiritual freedom. Householders are the ones with material wealth, and their responsibility, their dharma, is to share it with others. [...] The link between the world of the householder and the world of the renunciant is gift giving - dana. The classic image is of the renouncer with the begging bowl, making the rounds for alms. On a daily basis, in Hindu society, food is given to sannyasins and sadhus, the world renouncers who have "cast off" from the settled world of "this shore."<sup id="cite_ref-541" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-541">[541]</a></sup> However, no evidence could be found for actual enforcement of this behaviour--e.g. punishment for not giving food to renouncers.

<p><b>State Intervention in Economy</b>

<dl><dd> <b>♠ The state regulates banking ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> ‘A vital aspect of the commercial infrastructure was the guild system. During the post-Mauryan centuries the guilds came to play a crucial role in the success of both domestic and international trade. Known in India as shreni, the guilds can be described as associations of professional people, merchants or artisans. They acted variously as trade unions, cooperative organisations, regulatory bodies or even banks. They existed in various crafts and trades; there were, for example, guilds of potters, goldsmiths, bead and glass makers, ivory carvers, musicians and carpenters. The rules of work, the quality control over finished goods, the fixing of prices, the recruitment of labour from a specific occupational caste for a particular trade - these were all overseen by each craft guild. Rich merchants and many ruling dynasties invested in the guilds, making them viable and flourishing. The guilds, in turn, provided large donations to religious foundations and monasteries. The guilds of merchants, who were known as shreshthins, acted also as bankers, financiers and trustees. Large sums were loaned out, bearing interest rates of between 12 and 15 per cent, with higher rates carried for the sea trade. Another aspect of the commercial infrastructure was the great increase in the minting of coins during the post-Mauryan centuries. For the numismatist, the best of the early coins of India were those struck by the Indo-Greek kings and the Kushan monarchy. Through the foreign influence of the Persians, the Greeks and the Romans, the quality of Indian coins greatly improved over the older punch-marked coins. Made from gold, silver, copper or tin, the variety of coins proved especially useful for variant trading economies in different regions; and the huge quantity of local and foreign coins also made it easier for merchants to engage in forward speculation in goods and capital.’ <sup id="cite_ref-571" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-571">[571]</a></sup></dd>

Takshashila is perhaps best known because of its association with Chanakya. The famous treatise Arthashastra... by Chanakya, is said to have been composed in Takshashila itself... According to scattered references which were only fixed a millennium later, it may have dated back to at least the 5th century BCE. There is some disagreement about whether Takshashila can be considered a university. While some consider Taxila to be an early university or centre of higher education, others do not consider it a university in the modern sense, in contrast to the later Nalanda University. Takshashila is described in some detail in late Jataka tales, written in Sri Lanka around 5th century CE.  <sup id="cite_ref-584" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-584">[584]</a></sup></dd>

Owing to their knowledge of astrology and ability to forecast  rain, the Brahmins enjoyed respect among the rural people. Besides, they were the educated class of that age, and also pioneers of culture and progressive agriculture in the South. Kosambi states, ‘The brahmins acted as pioneers in undeveloped localities; they first brought plough agriculture to replace slash-and-burn cultivation, or food-gathering. New crops, knowledge of distant markets, organisation of village settlements and trade also came with them. As a result, kings or kings-to-be invited brahrnins, generally from the distant Gangetic basin, to settle in un-opened localities. Almost all extant copper plates (which have been discovered all over the country by the ton) are charters which- from the fourth century onwards -record land-grants to brahmins unconnected with any temple. In addition, every village would set apart a lot or two of land plus a fixed though small share of village harvests for the cults and priests, brahmin or not. Brahmins, however, claimed and generally received exemption from all taxes; they even claimed a specially low rate of interest on loans, and other  privileges.’ <sup id="cite_ref-590" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-590">[590]</a></sup></dd>
