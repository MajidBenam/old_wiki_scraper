<p><b>♠ RA ♣ Eva Brandl; Dennis Spencer ♥</b> DS contributed the general description.
</p><p><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b>
</p><p><br>
<b> ♠ UTM zone ♣ 52 V ♥ </b> 'Yakutia is a 3,100,000-square-kilometer territory (over four times the size of Texas), in eastern Siberia (the Soviet Far East). Located at approximately 56 to 71 degree north latitude and 107 to 152 east longitude, it is bounded by Chukotka to the northeast, Buriatia in the south, and the Evenk region to the west. Its northern coast stretches far above the Arctic Circle, along the East Siberian Sea, whereas its southern rim includes the Stanovoi Mountains and the Aldan plateau. Its most majestic river, the Lena, flows north along cavernous cliffs, into a long valley, and past the capital, Yakutsk. Other key river systems, where major towns have developed, include the Aldan, Viliui, and Kolyma. About 700,000 named rivers and streams cross Yakutia, which has some agricultural land, but is primarily nonagricultural taiga, with vast resources of gold, other minerals, gas, and oil. Tundra rims the north, except for forests along the rivers. Notorious for extremes of cold, long winters, and hot, dry summers, Yakutia has two locations that residents claim to be the "coldest on earth": Verkhoiansk and Oimiakon, where temperatures have dipped to -79 degrees Celsius. More typical are winters of 0 to -40 degrees Celsius and summers of 10 to 30 degrees Celsius.' <sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Original name  ♣ Sakha ♥ </b> 'The Yakut, who prefer to call themselves "Sakha," [...] are the farthest-north Turkic people, with a consciousness of having once lived farther south kept alive by legends and confirmed by historical and archaeological research.' <sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Alternative names  ♣  Urangkhai Sakha; 'Yakut'; 'Yakutians' ♥ </b> The term "Yakut" is frequently found in our sources to refer to the Sakha people. However, Sakha is the preferred self-designated term. Therefore, out of respect, we generally prefer “Sakha” instead of "Yakut", except for source titles and direct quotations.'The Yakut, who prefer to call themselves "Sakha," [...] are the farthest-north Turkic people, with a consciousness of having once lived farther south kept alive by legends and confirmed by historical and archaeological research.' <sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Peak Date  ♣ 1850-1900 CE ♥ </b> During the Russian period, Czarist administrative and political control was established over Sakha territory: 'By 1642 the Lena valley was under tribute to the czar; peace was won only after a long siege of a formidable Yakut fortress. By 1700 the fort settlement of Yakutsk (founded 1632) was a bustling Russian administrative, commercial, and religious center and a launching point for further exploration into Kamchatka and Chukotka. Some Yakut moved northeast into territories they had previously not dominated, further assimilating the Evenk and Yukagir. Most Yakut, however, remained in the central meadowlands, sometimes assimilating Russians. Yakut leaders cooperated with Russian commanders and governors, becoming active in trade, fur-tax collection, transport, and the postal system. Fighting among Yakut communities decreased, although horse rustling and occasional anti-Russian violence continued. For example, a Yakut Robin Hood named Manchari led a band that stole from the rich (usually Russians) to give to the poor (usually Yakut) in the nineteenth century. Russian Orthodox priests spread through Yakutia, but their followers were mainly in the major towns. By 1900 a literate Yakut intelligentsia, influenced both by Russian merchants and political exiles, formed a party called the Yakut Union. Yakut revolutionaries such as Oiunskii and Ammosov led the Revolution and civil war in Yakutia, along with Bolsheviks such as the Georgian Ordzhonikidze.' <sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> Given the importance of increasing 'modernization' for the revolutionary developments of the early 20th century, the peak period should be identified with the latter half of the 19th century.

<p><b> ♠ Duration  ♣ 1632-1900 CE ♥ </b> In the early 17th century, Cossack expeditions invaded Sakha territory and exacted tribute from the population: 'By 1620 a report had reached Tobolsk from the Mangaseya Cossacks of the Great (Lena) River and the Lena Yakut. In 1631 they descended by the Viliui River, a tributary of the Lena, to the Lena River and imposed tribute on the adjacent Yakut. In 1632 a party of Cossacks under the command of the Boyar’s son, Shakov, took tribute in sables from a clan of Viliui horse-breeding Yakut. The Viliui River farther up from its mouth was occupied by Tungus only. The northern boundary of the distribution of the Yakut at that time was the mouth of the Viliui. The whole Lena Valley from the mouth of the Viliui River to the south, at a distance of about 500 kilometers (or 710 miles) was occupied by Yakut. In their possession were also all the Lena islands of that region, rich in  pasture lands. There is no definite information as to how far inland they penetrated at that period. We may admit, however, that the Yakut, being horse and cattle breeders, were hardly inclined to move into the dense forests far from the majority of their tribesmen, i.e., far from the Lena Valley. In the beginning of the seventeenth century the Yakut abode on the western banks of the Lena must have been the territory of the two present  uluses  of Yakutsk District, Namskij and Western Kangalassky. There, according to Yakut traditions, was the first place of refuge of their mythical forefather, the “Tatar” Elliei. From there a part of his nearest descendants could also have emigrated over the Lena islands to the eastern banks of the Lena River, where excellent pastures are as abundant as on the western banks.' <sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> During the Russian period, Yakutia came under Czarist political and administrative control: 'By 1642 the Lena valley was under tribute to the czar; peace was won only after a long siege of a formidable Yakut fortress. By 1700 the fort settlement of Yakutsk (founded 1632) was a bustling Russian administrative, commercial, and religious center and a launching point for further exploration into Kamchatka and Chukotka.

</p><p><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ loose ♥ </b> Sakha clan and tribal organization was decentralized: 'Kinship and politics were mixed in the hierarchical council system that guided AQA-USA, AIMAK, and DZHON. Yakut explanations of DZHON in the nineteenth century included concepts like "people," "community," or "tribe," territorially defined. Councils were composed of ranked circles of elders, usually men, whose leaders, TOYONS, were called nobles by Russians. A lineage head was BIS-USA-TOYON; respected warriors and hunters were BATYR. Lineage councils decided major economic issues, interfamily disputes, and questions of blood revenge for violence committed against the group. AIMAK and DZHON councils were infrequent, dealing with issues of security, revenge, alliance, and, before Russian control, war. Through war, slaves were captured for service in the wealthiest TOYON households. Kin-based councils were rare by the nineteenth century and had little influence on twentieth-century politics.' <sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> 'Key kin relations are based on a patrilineage (AQA-USA) that traces membership back nine generations. Within this, children born to a specific mother are distinguished as a group (YE-USA), and may form the basis for different households (KORGON). Historically, more distant kin were recognized on two levels, the AIMAK (or territorial NASLEG), with one to thirty lineages, and the DZHON (or territorial ULUS), composed of several AIMAK. These larger units were united by alliances, including for common defense, alliances, and by economic relations; these links were renewed at councils and festivals.' <sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> 'The Sakha are thought to be an admixture of migrants from the Lake Baikal region with the aborigines of the Lena-probably mostly Evenk (Evenki), who have contributed much to their culture. Other evidence, however, points to a southern ancestry related to the Turkic-speaking tribes of the steppe and the Altai Mountains. The early history of the Sakha is little known, though epic tales date from the 10th century. In the 17th century they had peacefully assimilated with other northern peoples and consisted of 80 independent tribes, subdivided into clans.' <sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>  During the early Russian period, the Czarist administrative structure was superimposed on the Sakha system: 'No less significant changes occurred in the administrative organization of the Yakut country. In the seventeenth century Yakutsk was the center of a great independent country directly subordinate to Moscow, although for some specific questions it was dependent on the governors of Tobolsk. In the time of Peter the Great, Yakutsk entered into the newly organized Siberian Goubernyia (government) and with the division of the Siberian government into provinces was included in Irkutsk Province. In 1775 Irkutsk Province was organized into a government and the Yakut country formed one of the provinces of the new government. In 1783 the government was again reorganized into a vice-royalty composed of four provinces, one of which was Yakutsk Province. In 1797 the vice-royalty was abolished and the government restored. In [Page 225] 1805 under the Emperor Alexander I, the Yakut country was made a separate province dependent upon Irkutsk. In 1852 the Yakut country was given a separate governor. After the revolution in February, 1917, a commissar was appointed by the Provisional Government.' <sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ vassalage ♥ </b> In the 17th century, the Czar regime started to exact tribute from the Sakha population while gradually integrating Siberia into the general administration: 'By 1620 a report had reached Tobolsk from the Mangaseya Cossacks of the Great (Lena) River and the Lena Yakut. In 1631 they descended by the Viliui River, a tributary of the Lena, to the Lena River and imposed tribute on the adjacent Yakut.

<dl><dd><b> ♠ preceding (quasi)polity  ♣ Sakha Tribes ♥ </b> Before the Russian invasions, the territory was governed by independent Sakha and other tribes: 'Yakut oral histories begin well before first contact with Russians in the seventeenth century. For example, OLONKHO (epics) date at least to the tenth century, a period of interethnic mixing, tensions, and upheaval that may have been a formative period in defining Yakut tribal affiliations. Ethnographic and archaeological data suggest that the ancestors of the Yakut, identified in some theories with the Kuriakon people, lived in an area near Lake Baikal and may have been part of the Uighur state bordering China. By the fourteenth century, Yakut ancestors migrated north, perhaps in small refugee groups, with herds of horses and cattle. After arrival in the Lena valley, they fought and intermarried with the native Evenk and Yukagir nomads. Thus, both peaceful and belligerent relations with northern Siberians, Chinese, Mongols, and Turkic peoples preceded Russian hegemony. When the first parties of Cossacks arrived at the Lena River in the 1620s, Yakut received them with hospitality and wariness. Several skirmishes and revolts followed, led at first by the legendary Yakut hero Tygyn.' <sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup></dd>

Yakut revolutionaries such as Oiunskii and Ammosov led the Revolution and civil war in Yakutia, along with Bolsheviks such as the Georgian Ordzhonikidze. The consolidation of the 1917 Revolution was protracted until 1920, in part because of extensive opposition to Red forces by Whites under Kolchak. The Yakut Republic was not secure until 1923. After relative calm during Lenin's New Economic Policy, a harsh collectivization and antinationalist campaign ensued. Intellectuals such as Oiunskii, founder of the Institute of Languages, Literature and History, and Kulakovskii, an ethnographer, were persecuted in the 1920s and 1930s. The turmoil of Stalinist policies and World War II left many Yakut without their traditional homesteads and unaccustomed to salaried industrial or urban work.

The early history of the Sakha is little known, though epic tales date from the 10th century. In the 17th century they had peacefully assimilated with other northern peoples and consisted of 80 independent tribes, subdivided into clans.' <sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> During the Czarist period, cross-cultural exchanges with Russian settlers and administrators were of primary importance: 'By 1620 a report had reached Tobolsk from the Mangaseya Cossacks of the Great (Lena) River and the Lena Yakut. In 1631 they descended by the Viliui River, a tributary of the Lena, to the Lena River and imposed tribute on the adjacent Yakut. In 1632 a party of Cossacks under the command of the Boyar’s son, Shakov, took tribute in sables from a clan of Viliui horse-breeding Yakut. The Viliui River farther up from its mouth was occupied by Tungus only. The northern boundary of the distribution of the Yakut at that time was the mouth of the Viliui. The whole Lena Valley from the mouth of the Viliui River to the south, at a distance of about 500 kilometers (or 710 miles) was occupied by Yakut. In their possession were also all the Lena islands of that region, rich in  pasture lands. There is no definite information as to how far inland they penetrated at that period. We may admit, however, that the Yakut, being horse and cattle breeders, were hardly inclined to move into the dense forests far from the majority of their tribesmen, i.e., far from the Lena Valley. In the beginning of the seventeenth century the Yakut abode on the western banks of the Lena must have been the territory of the two present  uluses  of Yakutsk District, Namskij and Western Kangalassky. There, according to Yakut traditions, was the first place of refuge of their mythical forefather, the “Tatar” Elliei. From there a part of his nearest descendants could also have emigrated over the Lena islands to the eastern banks of the Lena River, where excellent pastures are as abundant as on the western banks.' <sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> 'By 1642 the Lena valley was under tribute to the czar; peace was won only after a long siege of a formidable Yakut fortress. By 1700 the fort settlement of Yakutsk (founded 1632) was a bustling Russian administrative, commercial, and religious center and a launching point for further exploration into Kamchatka and Chukotka. Some Yakut moved northeast into territories they had previously not dominated, further assimilating the Evenk and Yukagir. Most Yakut, however, remained in the central meadowlands, sometimes assimilating Russians. Yakut leaders cooperated with Russian commanders and governors, becoming active in trade, fur-tax collection, transport, and the postal system. Fighting among Yakut communities decreased, although horse rustling and occasional anti-Russian violence continued. For example, a Yakut Robin Hood named Manchari led a band that stole from the rich (usually Russians) to give to the poor (usually Yakut) in the nineteenth century. Russian Orthodox priests spread through Yakutia, but their followers were mainly in the major towns. By 1900 a literate Yakut intelligentsia, influenced both by Russian merchants and political exiles, formed a party called the Yakut Union. Yakut revolutionaries such as Oiunskii and Ammosov led the Revolution and civil war in Yakutia, along with Bolsheviks such as the Georgian Ordzhonikidze.' <sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> Wikipedia provides 13,100,000 km squared as the total extent of Siberia <sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup>. We have opted for Siberia rather than Sakha as the supra-cultural entity in question, hence the large number. This remains open to re-evaluation.</dd></dl>
<p><b> ♠ Capital  ♣ Yakutsk ♥ </b> The Sakha were initially not organized around a capital: 'As horse and cattle breeders, the Yakut had a transhumant pattern of summer and winter settlements. Winter settlements comprised as few as twenty people, involving several closely related families who shared pasture land and lived in nearby yurts (BALAGAN) with surrounding storehouses and corrals. The yurts were oblong huts with slanted earth walls, low ceilings, sod roofs and dirt floors. Most had an adjoining room for cattle. They had substantial hearths, and fur-covered benches lining the walls demarcated sleeping arrangements according to social protocol. Yurts faced east, toward benevolent deities. In summer families moved to larger encampments with their animals. The most ancient summer homes, URASY, were elegant birch-bark conical tents. Some could hold one hundred people. Their ceilings soared at the center point, above a circular hearth. Around the sides were wide benches placed in compartments that served as ranked seating and sleeping areas. Every pole or eave was carved with symbolic designs of animals, fertility, and lineage identities.' <sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> Yakutsk was established by Russian invaders 'In 1632 the Russian invaders erected a little fortress called Lesnoi Ostroshek, on the eastern bank of the Lena; ten years later they transferred it seventy kilometers to the south, where it became the center of the territory under the name of the City of Yakutsk. The fortress, now the City, of Olekminsk was erected by a Cossack party under the command of Buza in 1635. In the summer of 1637 Buza built two flat-bottomed ships, called  kocha,  and descended to the mouth of the Lena River, and traveled in an easterly direction on the Polar Sea. Not far from the mouth of the Omoloi River he was barred by ice and was compelled to abandon his ships. For three weeks his party walked over mountain ridges until they arrived at the upper reaches of the Yana River, where they met Yakut and took many sable skins from them as tribute.' <sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup>

Yakutsk province covered a territory of considerable size: 'Sakha, also called Yakutiya or Yakut-Sakha, Yakutiya also spelled Yakutia, Udachnaya: diamond mine republic in far northeastern Russia, in northeastern Siberia. The republic occupies the basins of the great rivers flowing to the Arctic Ocean-the Lena, Yana, Indigirka, and Kolyma-and includes the New Siberian Islands between the Laptev and East Siberian seas.

In the seventeenth century Yakutsk was the center of a great independent country directly subordinate to Moscow, although for some specific questions it was dependent on the governors of Tobolsk. In the time of Peter the Great, Yakutsk entered into the newly organized Siberian Goubernyia (government) and with the division of the Siberian government into provinces was included in Irkutsk Province. In 1775 Irkutsk Province was organized into a government and the Yakut country formed one of the provinces of the new government. In 1783 the government was again reorganized into a vice-royalty composed of four provinces, one of which was Yakutsk Province. In 1797 the vice-royalty was abolished and the government restored. In [Page 225] 1805 under the Emperor Alexander I, the Yakut country was made a separate province dependent upon Irkutsk. In 1852 the Yakut country was given a separate governor. After the revolution in February, 1917, a commissar was appointed by the Provisional Government.' <sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup> This regional integration was an artefact of Russian imperial rule. The decentralized political organization of the Sakha themselves makes the identification of a reliable and realistic code more difficult.
</p><p><b> ♠ Polity Population ♣ ♥ </b> People. Yakutsk province was sparsely populated: 'The population to the north of the Verkhoyansk Ridge is very small. This region has only 0.01 man to a quadratic mile, or 1 man to 100 square miles. Settlements are confined to the river valleys and the shores of large lakes abounding in fish. The tundra dweller of Siberia seldom settles on the seacoast or on the adjacent islands, as do the American Eskimo. Since off shore the sea is quite shallow the hunting of sea mammals has not been developed; for instance, the ocean between the mouth of the Kolyma River and the Sviatoi Nos to the west is only seven meters deep at a distance of ten or twenty miles from shore. West of the Chukchee are no sea-going peoples and no skin boats. Late in the fall, when snowstorms begin to rage on the tundra, the nomadic natives wander southward to the protection of the forests.' <sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup> During the Russian period, settlers entered the province: 'The influx of Russian peasants (particularly along the Lena Valley on account of the construction of the mail route in 1773) created the right conditions for mutual influence between Russian and Yakut cultural elements. By the end of the 17th and 18th centuries, agriculture began to be practiced by the Yakuts, though at first it was a very slow business and Russian-type houses began to appear. Nevertheless, even in the 19th century the number of Russian settlers was comparatively small.' <sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup> Due to economic hardships the Sakha population may have decreased during that period: 'These circumstances undoubtedly discourage the activity of the Yakut, who no longer endeavors to procure wealth, because it is the likeliest means of making him the object of persecution. Thus property, tranquillity, and population decrease. The princes or chiefs dwelling near towns acquire their luxuries, and oppress their dependant tribes to procure wine and brandy in addition to their koumis: this was never known among them till the year 1785. I will farther add, that in 1784 the district of Gigansk produced 4834 tributary natives; but in 1789 their number amounted only to 1938. Mr. Bonnar, the captain of the district of Zashiversk, told me, that the tributary nations in his circle amounted to only half the number that they were five years ago and that these were very poor indeed.”' <sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup> Unfortunately, Sauer does not seem to provide figures for the entirety of the province, and neither for individual clans.

Stables, corrals, and haying developed in conjunction with hardy breeds of cattle and short, fat, furry horses. Richer families owned hundreds of horses and cattle; poorer ones raised a few cattle or herded for others. A huge variety of dairy products, including fermented mare's milk, (Russian: KUMYS), was the staple food, with meat for special occasions. The diet was augmented by hunting (bears, elk, squirrels, hare, ferrets, fowl), fishing (salmon, carp, MUSKSUN, MUNDU), and, under Russian influence, agriculture (cereals). Wealthy Yakut hunted on horseback using dogs. The poorest Yakut, those without cattle, relied on fishing with horsehair nets and, in the north, herded reindeer like their Evenk and Yukagir neighbors.' <sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup> When agriculture became more common, the Sakha living near Russian settlements adopted more permanent log houses: 'When living near cities or Russian settlements, the Yakut abandon their earth huts and live in log houses of the Russian type. Fig. 23 illustrates a log house of a rich Yakut elder on the Lena River not far from the City of Yakutsk.' <sup id="cite_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup> Russian settlers established peasant villages: 'Being agriculturists exclusively, they could not follow their calling in the tundras of Turukhansk and they addressed a request to the government that they be transferred to Yakutsk Province. The request was granted. Beginning in 1860 groups of skoptzy were transferred to Yakutsk Province. By 1885, near the cities of Yakutsk, Olekminks, and Viliuisk, and on the Aldan River (near Ust-Maisk) they had ten villages with a population of 1181. This was a strange society which would have become extinct in fifty years had not additional convicted persons been exiled every year and thus replaced the departed. Industrious and with sufficient means, the skoptzy developed agriculture on a great scale and thus contributed to its success in the Yakut country. Early in the summer, they arranged hot beds which were protected during the cold nights; thus they grew the most delicate edible plants as early in the season as is possible only in a warm climate. Between 1885 and 1890 they had under cultivation 13,625 acres of land and were striving to seize the State lands. They employed Yakut laborers and thus the latter learned to cultivate the land.' <sup id="cite_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup> Russian invaders also built fortresses and riverside towns: 'In 1632 the Russian invaders erected a little fortress called Lesnoi Ostroshek, on the eastern bank of the Lena; ten years later they transferred it seventy kilometers to the south, where it became the center of the territory under the name of the City of Yakutsk.

The Dolgans, Yakuts and Evenks had to pay the fur-tax as “natives” and formed “clans” headed by princelings, while the tundra peasants were forced to pay a poll tax, were formed into a “community” and headed by an elder. People living many hundreds of kilometers away from the nearest centers were economically dependent on the merchants who monopolized supplies to the region, bought up all the furs, and cruelly exploited the population.' <sup id="cite_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup> 'These circumstances undoubtedly discourage the activity of the Yakut, who no longer endeavors to procure wealth, because it is the likeliest means of making him the object of persecution.

</p><p>[(5) Russian Imperial Authorities; (4) Russian District Governors; (3) the Russian District Administration;] (2) Councils of Clan Unions and Tribal Units (Dzhon/Ulus) (1) Clan (Aimak/Nasleg) and Lineage (Aqa-Usa) Councils comprised of Elders, Prophets (Sesen) and Leaders (Toyon) or 'Princelings'
</p><p>Until at least the 19th century, lineage councils were the primary administrative bodies: 'Kinship and politics were mixed in the hierarchical council system that guided AQA-USA, AIMAK, and DZHON. Yakut explanations of DZHON in the nineteenth century included concepts like "people," "community," or "tribe," territorially defined. Councils were composed of ranked circles of elders, usually men, whose leaders, TOYONS, were called nobles by Russians. A lineage head was BIS-USA-TOYON; respected warriors and hunters were BATYR. Lineage councils decided major economic issues, interfamily disputes, and questions of blood revenge for violence committed against the group. AIMAK and DZHON councils were infrequent, dealing with issues of security, revenge, alliance, and, before Russian control, war. Through war, slaves were captured for service in the wealthiest TOYON households. Kin-based councils were rare by the nineteenth century and had little influence on twentieth-century politics.' <sup id="cite_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-57">[57]</a></sup> 'Key kin relations are based on a patrilineage (AQA-USA) that traces membership back nine generations. Within this, children born to a specific mother are distinguished as a group (YE-USA), and may form the basis for different households (KORGON). Historically, more distant kin were recognized on two levels, the AIMAK (or territorial NASLEG), with one to thirty lineages, and the DZHON (or territorial ULUS), composed of several AIMAK. These larger units were united by alliances, including for common defense, alliances, and by economic relations; these links were renewed at councils and festivals.' <sup id="cite_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup> 'Prophets' and other elders dominated most councils: 'According to tradition, the seseny played no minor role in assemblies in the past.  The word sesen comes from the same root as the verb sesenibin - I advise, I think, I predict.

(Namsk Ulus, 1888).  I will note that in this testimony sesen is used in the sense of sorcerer.  The sesen decided disputed questions on the basis of custom, and gave advice when the clan was undergoing hard times.  At ysyakh, before the games and contests  began, the sesen of each clan or clan union would look over their own wrestlers; and they would remove those who were not good enough, who had recently sinned with a woman, who did not restrain themselves sufficiently in eating and drinking, so that they would not bring  shame to their own people. They found all this out by feeling the body of the wrestlers, and by looking into their eyes and face. (Namsk Ulus, 1891).  In the Bayagantaysk Ulus, when I asked who had named the rivers, hills, and other natural features, they answered: It must be the sesen - the old, ancient men, who knew everything!  (Bayagantaysk Ulus, 1885).' <sup id="cite_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-61">[61]</a></sup> Sesens were often from the toen class: 'Since within the clan many sesen were at the same time toen, i.e., the representatives of separate groups, they wielded enormous influencein clan councils. Usually in legends they  are simply called old men - ogonior.' <sup id="cite_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-62">[62]</a></sup> Clan unions and tribal units also held council: 'They wielded less importance in councils of clan unions: there the first place was held by the heads of the clans, bis' usa toeno.' <sup id="cite_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-63">[63]</a></sup> The Russian administration reinforced kin-based hierarchies and superimposed a supratribal structure onto the Sakha system: 'The system of tsarist administration was no different here from what existed in any other part of Northern Siberia. The Dolgans, Yakuts and Evenks had to pay the fur-tax as “natives” and formed “clans” headed by princelings, while the tundra peasants were forced to pay a poll tax, were formed into a “community” and headed by an elder. People living many hundreds of kilometers away from the nearest centers were economically dependent on the merchants who monopolized supplies to the region, bought up all the furs, and cruelly exploited the population.' <sup id="cite_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-64">[64]</a></sup> 'If they have claims against their subordinate clansmen, the clan-chiefs bring complaints: 1.  The headman--to the nasleg princelings and clan elders.  If unsatisfied with their decision, or in case of noncompliance, they may complain to the authorities. 2.  The princelings--first, to the clan elders in their jurisdiction, and in the case of noncompliance or dissatisfaction with their decision, to the ulus headmen, and finally, to the authorities. 3.  The clansmen among themselves--to the clan elders and nasleg princelings, and in the case of noncompliance to the ulus headman; and finally to the authorities.' <sup id="cite_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup> Sakha leaders cooperated with Russian imperial administrators, collecting taxes for them and contributing to the establishment of the emerging postal system in Siberia: 'Most Yakut, however, remained in the central meadowlands, sometimes assimilating Russians. Yakut leaders cooperated with Russian commanders and governors, becoming active in trade, fur-tax collection, transport, and the postal system. Fighting among Yakut communities decreased, although horse rustling and occasional anti-Russian violence continued.' <sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup>

Yet one can hardly be sure that a Yakut, professing the ancient faith, has given up his shamanist creed, or that he does not have recourse to the latter. I have personally known two shamans, one of them in the Yakutsk district, the other on the Kytach island on the mouth of the Lena, who were both known as followers of the ‘ancient faith.’' <sup id="cite_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-69">[69]</a></sup> There where black and white shamans: 'Supernatural power was attributed to blacksmiths, since their art was considered a divine gift. The old Sakha religion had many supernatural spirits, good and evil. Black shamans dealt with evil spirits and could be benevolent or harmful; white shamans were concerned with spiritual intercession for human beings. Two major religious festivals were celebrated with ritual use of koumiss (fermented mare’s milk), one in spring for good spirits and one in fall accompanied by blood sacrifices of livestock for evil spirits.' <sup id="cite_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-70">[70]</a></sup> Shamans officiated at seasonal festivals: 'The most important festival among the Yakut is connected with the preparation and use of kumiss, and is called  ysyax,  or kumiss festival. It has both a social and a religious significance. During the summer, in olden times, every rich man arranged a kumiss festival, at which all members of the clan assembled and were entertained. Other people, and frequently whole clans, were invited; and during the festival, defensive and offensive leagues were concluded. Every such festival commenced with sacrifices, and was accompanied with songs, dances, games, horse and foot races, and other contests.' <sup id="cite_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup> 'The first night of the festival is in honor of Big-Lord ( Ulu-Toyon ) and the evil spirits of the upper world subordinate to him. The second night is in honor of  Axsan Duolai  and his subordinates, the evil spirits of the lower world. To all of these evil spirits, in addition to the libations of kumiss made to the benevolent deities, blood sacrifices of cattle and horses are also made. This ceremony, according to Trostchansky,  is superintended by nine male and nine female shamans.' <sup id="cite_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-72">[72]</a></sup> Shamans were compensated for their services, but did not receive sufficient payments for their livelihood: 'I at least never heard anything about a wealthy shaman; on the contrary, the shaman often gets no more than 5 kopeks for healing a sick eye. And how little is this sum worth north of Yakutsk! Some Yakuts refused to accept a twenty kopeks coin for a hazel-hen I wanted to buy, saying that they could not manage to use the money; if it had an eye, they would have used it as a button; but as there was no such, I was to take it back. The smallest unit for them is the ruble.' <sup id="cite_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-73">[73]</a></sup> Contact with Russian Orthodox priests was irregular: 'The aborigines seldom have an opportunity to see a priest of the ancient faith. In view of the enormous extension of the parishes, of the scattered settlements, and of the extraordinary difficulties in securing communications, he is hardly in a position to see each member of his faith once a year; and if he visits him in one of the settling-places he may not stay longer than two or three days because he must be through with his travel as long as the paths and roads are practicable. One may safely estimate that eight [probably eighty rather than eight, given the context: comment by RA] per cent of the aborigines population has never seen a Christian church. His eminency, the former Yakut bishop Dionysius even told me that sometimes priests had died without having communicated, leaving a written confession of sins.' <sup id="cite_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-74">[74]</a></sup> Accordingly, the material is coded for Sakha rather than Orthodox institutions.

Khudiakov has a legend about Khaptagay-batyr and his son Khokhoe-batyr, and their three khosun: Sappy, Yngkabyl, and Batagyyan, who roamed about in the seventeen forties, during the time of Pavlutskii, in the north of the Yakutsk Oblast.

Sometimes the clan would choose such people out of their own number and deliberately send them out on a searching party.

These were chosen people and were also called bagatyr, baatyr, batyr, or batur; strictly speaking in the Yakut language this word means valorous, exceptionally manly, bold, strong, and clever.

<p><b> ♠ Occupational complexity ♣ absent ♥ </b> The Sakha were initially nomadic pastoralists: 'Traditional pastoralism in central Yakutia required homestead self-reliance, with intense dependence on calves and foals in a harsh climate. Stables, corrals, and haying developed in conjunction with hardy breeds of cattle and short, fat, furry horses. Richer families owned hundreds of horses and cattle; poorer ones raised a few cattle or herded for others. A huge variety of dairy products, including fermented mare's milk, (Russian: KUMYS), was the staple food, with meat for special occasions. The diet was augmented by hunting (bears, elk, squirrels, hare, ferrets, fowl), fishing (salmon, carp, MUSKSUN, MUNDU), and, under Russian influence, agriculture (cereals). Wealthy Yakut hunted on horseback using dogs. The poorest Yakut, those without cattle, relied on fishing with horsehair nets and, in the north, herded reindeer like their Evenk and Yukagir neighbors.' <sup id="cite_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-80">[80]</a></sup> Most implements were made in the home: 'Before iron was imported, ironworkers used ore from local marshes. Similarly, ceramics from local clay preceded Russian pottery. Most homemade crafts were for household use: decorated birch-bark containers, leather bags, dairy-processing equipment, horsehair blankets, fur clothing, benches, hitching posts, and elaborately carved wooden containers (including CHORONS for KUMYS).' <sup id="cite_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-81">[81]</a></sup> 'Although occupations within a household were divided by gender and status, the atmosphere was usually one of productive group activity. All participated in hay making, cattle herding, and milking, but, in general, horses were more a male preserve and cattle a female responsibility. Women tended children and fires, prepared food, carried water, and made clothing and pottery. Men handled more strenuous firewood preparation, house building, sled making, hunting, fishing, and mowing. Ivory carving and wood- and metalworking were male tasks.' <sup id="cite_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-82">[82]</a></sup> Sieroszewski reports some trades, such as carpentry and blacksmithing, for the south: 'In the north, where most of the household utensils are mad at home, all are prepared with the aid of only these clumsy implements.  In the south, where trades are kept separate to a greater degree, a carpenter owns, besides these, a wide and a narrow saw, planes, a brace and bit, chisels, and sometimes even a rasp. But everywhere the axe is most important. The Yakut handle the axe in a masterly fashion and are excellent carpenters. The majority of the churches in the Yakutsk Okrug and almost all the house s in the town of Yakutsk have been built by Yakut carpenters. In their carpentry work they use the same methods, the same compass for cutting, the same pitch rope, plumb, triangle, and ruler as do the Russians. The head of the carpenters artel, the elder carpenter, is called the regulator, after the Russian fashion. But their chief instruments, the axes and knives, have retained their ancient shape.They weigh from two to no more  than four pounds, and cost from fifty kopecks to one ruble. The Yakut cut with them smoothly, cleanly, and quickly; they are ready to fashion even small pieces with an axe.' <sup id="cite_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-83">[83]</a></sup> 'As with other Siberian peoples, Yakut shamans (OIUN if male, UDAGAN if female) combine medical and spiritual practice.

One-seventh of all the households were entirely without sowings, and many were only able to sow a few hundredths of a hectare each. Most of the households (97 percent) had to do without factory-made agricultural implements. Stockbreeding produced extremely poor results. The owners of large areas of land and abundant livestock i.e.,-the kulaks and toyons, grew rich, but not so much by raising the level of land cultivation and animal husbandry as by exploiting the poor and middle peasants.' <sup id="cite_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-85">[85]</a></sup> Temporary wage labour was slightly more common in areas close to Russian settlements: 'The Yakut are unwilling to hire themselves out on a daily basis, although the daily rate of pay is always higher than the monthly or yearly rates.  Among themselves they hardly ever do this. This has begun to come into custom only in the vicinity of cities, and only very lately. The Skoptsy were particularly responsible for spreading this custom.  The Skopsty usually pay their workers in flours, baked bread, potatoes, brick tea, and sugar; only rarely in money and  in cotton goods.' <sup id="cite_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-86">[86]</a></sup>

These toyon wars and raids were one of the factors which speeded up the decomposition of the clan commune. The ruined members of the commune were reduced to the status of “balyksyts” (poor people without cattle, or fishermen), or else became the indentured slaves of the toyons. Most of the slaves (kuluts or bokans) originated in this way.' <sup id="cite_ref-96" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-96">[96]</a></sup> We need to confirm whether any Sakha warriors joined the Russian military at the time.

One may safely estimate that eight [probably eighty rather than eight, given the context: comment by RA] per cent of the aborigines population has never seen a Christian church.

<p><b> ♠ Formal legal code ♣ absent: 1632-1889 CE; present: 1890-1900 CE ♥ </b> During the Russian period, some Russian legal concepts were adopted by the Sakha: 'N. P. Pripuzov gathered his material among the Yakuts living in the Yakutsk district, i. e., in the midst of that part of the Yakut tribe among whom we may rightly expect to encounter some traces of the action of Russian customary and legislative norms upon the customary law of the Yakuts. All the more interest attaches to the norms of the Yakut customary law noted by the compiler, which, despite the long association of the Yakuts with the Russians, have survived as a valuable vestige of the ancient familial-clan foundations. But no less interest attaches to certain juridical customs, communicated by the compiler, which have been worked out by the Yakuts under the obvious influence of the Russians; the structure of Yakut life is changing its aspect; the new conditions of life which are coming to birth demand new norms for their satisfaction. The latter are sometimes borrowed from Russian neighbors, come into contradiction with the bases of the ancient life and undergo certain changes under the influence of the archaic views on legal relations.' <sup id="cite_ref-124" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-124">[124]</a></sup> But Sakha trials were based on prior agreements between the contending parties rather than codified law: 'Agreements and contracts, both written and oral, are taken as a basis for all trials and settlements; therefore, if there is no quarrel about the contents of an agreement, the decision is quick, but if anyone refuses to abide by an agreement, and it was oral, his opponent may prove it with witnesses, and, if there are no witnesses, the quarrel is decided by an oath.' <sup id="cite_ref-125" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-125">[125]</a></sup> '“As a nation they are unsocial, litigious, and vindictive. An injury received by one of them is very rarely forgotten, and, if he cannot revenge it himself, he will leave the feud to his son. Their passion for litigation is excessive: they will frequently undertake difficult and expensive journeys, in a cause where perhaps the matter in dispute is not of the value of a rouble. Their unsocial dispo-sition, which leads them to prefer settling by single families at a distance from each other, is strikingly contrasted with the cheerful and ready hospitality which they show to strangers. They very seldom settle in communities, and it is only along the route from Jakuzk to the Aldan, where the country is more populous, that such settlements are now and then to be met with; but beyond the Werchojansk chain, the solitary  jurti  are often hundreds of wersts apart, so that the nearest neighbours may not see each other for years. Such distances are far greater than can be required on account of pasture, and are rather to be ascribed to the disposition which leads them to seek solitude, and to avoid all social intercourse.”' <sup id="cite_ref-126" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-126">[126]</a></sup> Criminal cases were transferred to courts applying Russian law only after 1889: 'Nevertheless until very r ecently and even criminal cases such as beatings, personal injury, and thefts, even for a considerable amount, as long as a house was not broken into, were judged by the clan administration.  Only from the year 1889, when an order came out to proceed against the trible authorities  if they did not communicate such matters, have thefts begun to be referred to the Russian courts and judged according to Russian laws. For theft the Yakut usually punished wealthy people by a fine which was two or three times the value of the stolen article, depending on the circumstances. For beatings and personal injuries they sentenced the guilty party to support the injured party during his disablement or to pay him a lump sum.  Now the guilty are put in prison, and to the great horror of their neighbors they usually leave out and out scoundrels.  Such crimes as the violation of women, the breaking of agreements, fraud, and forgery were apparently unknown to the Yakut and went unpunished. But the violation of the wedding agreement was provided for by the kalym. At the present time most of the cases and statements of claim which come before the clan administrations concern the violation of boundary lines and various disputed lands.' <sup id="cite_ref-127" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-127">[127]</a></sup> Clerical courts occasionally prosecuted polygamy prior to that date: 'Such polygamy, which is tolerated for the above reasons, and which has existed since ancient times and does not do any harm, had not become bad in the judgement of the Yakut, and no regulations for the abolition of this custom have been set up by the Yakut.  However, since the Yakut adopted the Christian faith, and as they have become enlightened by strict surveillance and sometimes by indulgent reprimands from the eparchial priests, it has been gradually dying out, but nevertheless denunciations on this subject are made concerning people who have lawfully wedded wives but keep the others, and people who had several wives before conversion and married one of them in church without leaving the others, who were left at home with their children;  in the case of such a denunciation the local authorities, on the grounds of the repugnance of the Christian religion for this custom, pressed formal charges, and the guilty parties were handed over to the clerical court as fornicators, and the cases were decided according to general state laws, which constituted and still constitute and extreme burden for the Yakut.' <sup id="cite_ref-128" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-128">[128]</a></sup> Sieroszewski's material on punishment seems to refer to Yakut assemblies rather than Russian courts: 'In 1867, according to official data, 1870 cases were judged in the upravas in the vicinity of Yakutsk:  out of the total, 1855 concerned land disputes; in the Vilyuysk Okrug, out of 3786 cases, more than half had to do with land. Besides levying fines the Yakut also punish a guilty party by reprimanding him publicly,  before the assembly, by sending him on some job, or putting him into solitary confinement.  The latter is apparently a Russian innovation.  Punishment with birch-rods was quite unknown to the Yakut in the past. Even now they have recourse to this very rarely and with great distaste.  In the north they did not even know  what this was like, and once, in the Kolymsk Ulus, when the assembly did not known what to do with one of its disobedient members and decided, on the advice of some Yakut who had come from the south, to flog him, they turned to me with questions: where should we beat him?, and do we have to lay him down and undress him or is that not permitted? (Kolymsk Ulus, Undzha, 1883).  Usually the influence of the commune is quite sufficient to exert necessary compulsion.  In the south, where the  ties of the commune have weakened, we find disobedient people whose cattle are taken away as a punishment,  or who are forced to obey.  Many decisions of the clan assemblies astonished me by their strangeness, but once I looked closer into their life and made thorough inquiries into their motives I always found at the bottom a deep respect for the individual and a striving toward equality.  Naturally I say nothing about those decisions which are demonstrably incorrect, and not in accord with custom and the conscience of the people, but which they have been forced to make because of the economic pressure of unscrupulous rich people or because of administrative arbitrariness.' <sup id="cite_ref-129" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-129">[129]</a></sup>

Even in harvest years, when in winter one can buy four for one ruble eighty kopecks a pood, a pood of seeds costs two rubles.  This i s due to the fact that in the first place, they use selected grain for seeds, so that not every homeowner is willing to sow with his own seeds, and secondly, because most Yakut sow less grain than they use. Rich Yakut naturally take advantage of this, and encouraged by the spring season of bad roads and the constant pecuniary embarrassment of the Yakut they loan seeds and make profits of one hundred percent on them.  I must remark that in general the Yakut still have not learned how to store grain.  Their grain warehouses and , even the public warehouses, are in almost all cases so poorly constructed that grain which has lain there for two or three years is no longer good f or seeds.  Sometimes it becomes so moldy that it is hard to eat flour prepared from it.  This inability to keep grain in storage supports the custom of handing out public seeds as a loan, pood for pood, to well-to-do clan heads, even in harvest years. Because of this many warehouses are found to be empty in poor crop years, and this factor is just about the strongest hindrance to the success of agriculture.  At such times there are exceedingly few seeds in the okrug.  A poor crop of grain usually concides with a small harvest of grass, and therefore a lack of milk.  The grain is consumed.  It is remarkable that the raising of grain has been strengthened even in the more northern regions, but only where there are large permanent stores of seeds, either in the form of Russian agricultural settlements or Yakut homesteads operating on a large scale.  There are very few Yakut carrying on the raising of grain on a large scale for commercial purposes. Even such rich Yakut as, for example, Syrom yatnikov, of the Bayagantaysk Ulus sowed only for themselves, something like one desiatin per household; there were four household in all.

<dl><dd><b> ♠ Roads ♣ present ♥ </b> The Russian administration constructed some roads that were reliable year-round: 'Outside the City of Yakutsk, the use of the wheeled cart, adopted from the Russians, is very limited throughout the Province. Roads suitable for wheeled transport are rare. They extend only 1036 kilometers: from Yakutsk to Viliuisk (600 km.) and from Viliuisk to Suntar (436 km.). I myself had the opportunity to use a wheeled cart when traveling from Yakutsk about sixty miles to the east to the Churupcha settlement.' <sup id="cite_ref-160" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-160">[160]</a></sup> Russians and Sakha relied on sledges and waterways where roads were absent or not passable: 'All the other roads are swampy and in summer were passable only on horseback; even this means of transportation is very difficult, particularly in the northern districts. In winter sledges are everywhere drawn by horses; in the northern districts reindeer and dogs are also used. Many Tungus, Lamut, and Yukaghir use the reindeer for riding, particularly in the mountainous districts between the great rivers. In summer small steamers ply the Lena and Viliui rivers. On the Yana, Indighirka, and Kolyma rivers and their tributaries large boats are used for carrying freight as well as for passengers. During the winter freight carried on pack-horses or by reindeer sledges from the shores of the Okhotsk Sea (Okhotsk, Yamsk, Ayan or Ola) over the mountains to the upper course of the Kolyma River, is floated down on pontoon-like rafts consisting of two large boats covered with a bridge. Such rafts are provided with a rudder and are propelled with long poles. As they cannot be poled up the river they are sold to the inhabitants of Nishne Kolymsk, who make boats of different sizes from them. Recently I learned that a steamer coming through Bering Strait now visits Nishne Kolymsk every summer, bringing flour and other commodities for sale or exchange for furs.' <sup id="cite_ref-161" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-161">[161]</a></sup> 'Of the large wooden objects used, the Yakut boat, sleigh, and wagon carry so many traces of various later influences in their shape and workmanship that it is extremely difficult to determine their original forms and trace the extent of each outside influence.  All these are recent Yakut acquisitions. In many places the wagon is unknown to the present day.  It was only with difficulty that I could explain the idea of the wheel to the Kolymsk Yakut, and they could not discern any difference in transportation along the ground between a wagon and a sleigh, on which they carry loads even in summer. Even sleighs are little used by the Yakut in these remote northern regions, and then only with dogs and reindeer. The use of the yoke and the shaft-bow is unknown to the Yakut, and when they infrequently have to harness horses for some traveling government officials, they harness them to those  same reindeer narty - using the same reindeer straps which are thrown over the saddle. Then the coachman gets on this horse, or on the one in front of it.  It is understandable that both the horse and those riding in the sleigh become extremely fatigued from the constant jerking and shaking.' <sup id="cite_ref-162" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-162">[162]</a></sup> The use of harness dogs was also common: 'In West Siberia the harness is very strange: the breech-band is put on the body in front of the breast bone, and a belt issuing from the breech-band is placed between the legs of the animal, so that it pulls with its pelvis.  The east-siberian harness is of the breast variety: the breechband is placed on the breast  of the dog and belts from it cover the sides of the animal towards the alik (the hauling belt which takes the place of theconnecting pole).  On the road each dog carries between 2 and 2 1/2 pouds.  The full team consists of twelve dogs with the thirteenth acting as leader.  In travel the dogs are fed with raw, frozen and dried fish. At home special dog food is made for them.  No matter how hungry they may be the Yakut dogs will not eat bread: on smelling it they will move away as if it were a stone.  At the same time they eat cowberry, golubitsu, and currant, picking them directly from the bushes,--and some varieties of grass and roots.  However, it is not difficult to get them used to eating bread by mixing flour in small quantities with the fish soup.  Between 50 and 70 herrings are to be provided for a harness team of 12 dogs, the number depending on how well-fed the animals are. In autumn, before the beginning of the travel, the Yakuts always train and put into shape th n the beginning, the dogs are given a rest every 5 viersts.  The young dogs are trained by harnessing them up with the experienced ones: the most intelligent and best trained dog must be selected as leader.  Trips of several thousand viersts  can be made with good dogs but travelling in such cases is not fast.  Using twelve dogs with a burden of 20 pouds one may in spring, travelling over a short distance and on a compact, smooth road--cover between 150 and 200 viersts a day.  The usual ride does not exceed 60-70 viersts, and on a bad road the travelled distance does not exceed 30 or 40 viersts a day.' <sup id="cite_ref-163" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-163">[163]</a></sup></dd>

The fortress, now the City, of Olekminsk was erected by a Cossack party under the command of Buza in 1635. In the summer of 1637 Buza built two flat-bottomed ships, called  kocha,  and descended to the mouth of the Lena River, and traveled in an easterly direction on the Polar Sea. Not far from the mouth of the Omoloi River he was barred by ice and was compelled to abandon his ships.

<dl><dd><b> ♠ Ceremonial site ♣ absent ♥ </b> For the celebration of seasonal festivals, the Sakha built non-permanent altars: 'The spring kumiss festival takes place in the open air. In the midst of a large smooth grass meadow a kind of altar is erected. This consists of two posts with a crossbeam, and three young birch-trees with young shoots on them (see Plate XVII). The altar is hung round with sacrificial horsehair, and on the ground in front of it are placed ornamented birch-bark and ox-hide barrels filled with kumiss. The skin barrels are tied to the altar-frame by long ornamented straps of soft elk-leather. This is done so that the vessels, when softened by the liquid in them, shall not collapse. The ceremony commences by sacrifices to Lord Bright-Creator and to other “creators.” Their names are uttered by the steward of the festival, who may be a shaman or an elder member of the clan. The sacrifices consist of libations of kumiss, in the direction of the dawn, to every deity; and formerly horses were often consecrated by being driven to the east.' <sup id="cite_ref-170" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-170">[170]</a></sup> Russian Orthodox settlers and missionaries introduced churches: 'In the north, where most of the household utensils are mad at home, all are prepared with the aid of only these clumsy implements.  In the south, where trades are kept separate to a greater degree, a carpenter owns, besides these, a wide and a narrow saw, planes, a brace and bit, chisels, and sometimes even a rasp. But everywhere the axe is most important. The Yakut handle the axe in a masterly fashion and are excellent carpenters. The majority of the churches in the Yakutsk Okrug and almost all the houses in the town of Yakutsk have been built by Yakut carpenters. In their carpentry work they use the same methods, the same compass for cutting, the same pitch rope, plumb, triangle, and ruler as do the Russians. The head of the carpenters artel, the elder carpenter, is called the regulator, after the Russian fashion. But their chief instruments, the axes and knives, have retained their ancient shape.They weigh from two to no more  than four pounds, and cost from fifty kopecks to one ruble. The Yakut cut with them smoothly, cleanly, and quickly; they are ready to fashion even small pieces with an axe.' <sup id="cite_ref-171" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-171">[171]</a></sup> We have assumed that churches were attended by Russians rather than the Sakha at the time, as the spread of Christianzation could be slow and patchy.</dd>
<dd><b> ♠ Burial site ♣ present ♥ </b> Stone monuments were placed over graves: 'The position of sons in the parental home is considerably more independent than that of the daughters. Nevertheless, in personal relations the patriarchal parental authority finds a many-sided application. In addition to the right of giving sons out for adoption, a right which is limited with respect to the sons by the condition that the adoption take place within the confines of the clan, the parents can put their sons out to hire or to apprenticeship. Parents further have the right to use the earnings of their children; their labor goes to the profit of the family; they are obliged to support their parents, and in the event of non-fulfillment of this obligation, the parents can make complaint before the elders of the clan, who, in accordance with the earnings of the son, or his competence order him to support his father. But all these rules have significance only as long as  the son has not left the household or married. In general, if the parents feed, clothe their children, “seek their good,” and the children feed and support their parents in their old age, bury them decently after death, hold a wake on the 40th day [RCH: on the 40th day the soul of the deceased departs from the earth] and finally place a stone monument over the grave, they are considered to have mutually fulfilled their obligations.' <sup id="cite_ref-172" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-172">[172]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b> ♠ Enclosures ♣ absent ♥ </b> Livestock was kept in corrals: 'As horse and cattle breeders, the Yakut had a transhumant pattern of summer and winter settlements. Winter settlements comprised as few as twenty people, involving several closely related families who shared pasture land and lived in nearby yurts (BALAGAN) with surrounding storehouses and corrals. The yurts were oblong huts with slanted earth walls, low ceilings, sod roofs and dirt floors. Most had an adjoining room for cattle. They had substantial hearths, and fur-covered benches lining the walls demarcated sleeping arrangements according to social protocol. Yurts faced east, toward benevolent deities. In summer families moved to larger encampments with their animals. The most ancient summer homes, URASY, were elegant birch-bark conical tents. Some could hold one hundred people. Their ceilings soared at the center point, above a circular hearth. Around the sides were wide benches placed in compartments that served as ranked seating and sleeping areas. Every pole or eave was carved with symbolic designs of animals, fertility, and lineage identities.' <sup id="cite_ref-173" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-173">[173]</a></sup> Meadows were fenced in, but differed greatly in size: 'The Yakut call the shares of mowable land kyure,  which means the enclosure around a meadowwhich in other words means that the share encloses that amount of land from which a rick of hay can be gathered.  Formerly, one must assume, the size of a kyure was quite indeterminate.  It meant in general a meadow where hay was mowed and  ricks were placed. Now the conception of kyure is more definite, but its size still varies greatly.  Even within   the limits of the clan the kyure are of various kinds: some are better, some are worse; some are bigger, some are smaller. But this is not important. In time this can be evened out.  The main thing is to obtain from the assembly the right for kyure.  (Namsk Ulus, 1892).  The size of many kyure depends, besides the quality of the soil, its fertility, and so forth, on certain unrelated circumstances: the length of time the land has been held and the natural boundaries of the valley. The Yakut rarely divide land in strips, most often they do it by valleys. Some valleys, which are held by rich people and village usurers, are considered to by kyure (by tradition), but are strictly speaking two or three times larger than the usual  size for that area. The sizes of the kyure, within the confines of the same clan, do not vary as much to  the extent that the kyure of different clans and even more so, of different naslegs, do. The kyure are different in different places: the people of the Odeysk Nasleg have entirely different kyure than do the people of the Madutsk or Betyunsk naslegs.  In those naslegs there are kyure from which one hundred loads of hay may be gathered.  In the meantime, in the Kusagannel'sk Nasleg a kyure of the same class  gives only twenty loads, while we, in the Namsk Nalseg, gather forty loads from  one kyure and eighty loads from another. And so it is everywhere!  The kyure of the Kusagannel'sk Yakut are small, because there all the clans joined their land together, and then divided it among them, giving land to every one who wanted a kyure and could make use of one. Thus small kyure resulted. And even now they divide they land all the time. On the other hand there are few people among them who do not have a kyure, while we have large kyure, but many are left without any land at all.  In other naslegs there is more free land; there the kyure are large also (Namsk Ulus, 1891).  To determine the size of a kyure, the rick, bugul, is used as the unit of measurement. They say: a kyure of such and such a number of ricks. The rick also serves as the minimum unit of measurement in equalizing land; they take away or add such and such a number of ricks of land. Thus in reality the Yakut strictly speaking do not divide land, but divide grass.' <sup id="cite_ref-174" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-174">[174]</a></sup> The Sakha also kept livestock in enclosed pastures: 'The Yakut keep their work horses close to their house, in summer in enclosed pastures, while in winter in open enclosures where they feed them hay.  A steed is supposed to be alloted ten loads of hay (200 poods) for the winter.  The old-fashioned Yakut consider it a great sin to place horses under a roof in the cattle-house.  They say that horses do not live with such masters, that all sorts of misfortunes befall their herds.  Nevertheless I saw, in a frightful  snowstorm, how a Yakut who had been wandering all night led his chilled and tired horse into the yurt.  The animal resisted and did not want to go inside at all; it was necessary to push it in forcibly.  During a trip a Yakut often cleans off the ice, snow, and frost which form on his horse; with equal care he frees its nostrils from the ice which constantly forms on them in severe cold.  The rider often examines the saddle-girths carefully, corrects the position of the saddle, and stops and rests the horse for at least two minutes every ten versts.  Thanks to this the horse remains fresh the whole trip, and an experience Yakut rider considers it especially flattering to himself to make a hard journey and keep the horse  dry and vigorous.  This form of treatment, as we see, differs sharply from that of the Buryat and the Mongols; the Mongols like to ride their horses very fast, at a gallop, going several dozen versts without dismounting.' <sup id="cite_ref-175" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-175">[175]</a></sup> We have assumed that these enclosures were attached to individual households rather than any communal entities.</dd>
<dd><b> ♠ Mines or quarries ♣ absent ♥ </b> During the Russian period, mining companies entered Sakha territory and traded with the natives: 'The tribe as a whole, while engaged in horse and cattle breeding as their chief occupation, began to increase the number of their horned cattle at the expense of their number of horses. Of cow’s milk they could make, for use during the long winter, butter, a kind of cheese, and some other milk products which cannot, as we shall see later, be made from mare’s milk. The Russian gold-mining companies on the rivers Olekma and Vitim proved profitable buyers of these cattle, and this gave an impetus to the raising of them. Finally, the cultivation of cereal plants, borrowed from the Russians in the southern parts of the Yakut Province, where the climate allows of it, has made such progress in the last twenty years, that at present agriculture is the chief occupation, and bread the staple food, of many Yakut families of the District of Yakutsk, and particularly of that of Olekminsk. Nowadays large droves of horses, and [Page 260] mares for milking, can be found only in those districts far removed from the centres of influence of Russian culture, and they belong to a few very rich families.' <sup id="cite_ref-176" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-176">[176]</a></sup> It is unclear from this description whether the Sakha were employed in the mining industries, or whether their connection to miners was confined to trade. We have assumed the latter, but this is open to re-evaluation.</dd>
<dd><b> ♠ Other site ♣ absent ♥ </b> The Sakha built sheds for calves and other livestock: '“Outside there are usually sheds for the cows,  which in winter are placed under cover and fed with hay, and in extreme cold weather are even brought into the  jurte;  whereas the horses are left to shift for themselves as well as they can, by scraping away the snow to get at the withered autumn grass. It is only when they are about to make a journey that they are given hay for a few days previously.”' <sup id="cite_ref-177" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-177">[177]</a></sup> 'The gestation period of the mares lasts eight months; calving begins at the end of April and continues until the appearance of the gnats. For this period each owner divides his herd into two parts: one part consists of bucks, and the other of mares. This is done because the bucks run much faster than the cows with calf and may exhaust the latter, and especially the calves which have just been born and are still weak. Along with the bucks are sent the reindeer dogs, which may tear the calves to pieces. The herd is reunited at the end of approximately one month, when the calves have already grown up and are able to follow after the bucks. If the reindeer are in the tundra at the time of calving, the herd of mares is driven to the woods, where they pick out places which are sheltered from the wind; in order to prevent the calves from being frozen, sheds--called daldaakaan--are sometimes built; these are in the shape of a semicircular shed made out of poles which are erected upright and covered on the leeward side with old pieces of “nyuk.” ( )' <sup id="cite_ref-178" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-178">[178]</a></sup> We have assumed that these sheds were attached to individual households rather than any communal entities.</dd></dl>

A clay pot is called  küös;  a metal kettle is called salyr  . Even in places where, as in the northern districts of Yakut Province, no pottery is made at present, the word  küös  is well known and used as a linear measure. In terms of linear measure one may say, “one pot,” “two pots,” “pot of a walker, horse, or ox rider.” For küös   (pot) the Yakut understand a distance of from seven to twelve versts (from 6.6 to 8 miles). Translating küös   in terms of time, it means a period during which a pot with meat for an average family is cooked. In Afghanistan küös   is used as a linear measure of about eighteen miles. Böhtlingk distinguishes the word  küös  as a unit of time from  kös  as a linear measure as does Pekarsky in his Yakut-Russian dictionary, where he interprets  kös  as a term for a day’s journey from one camping place to another.' <sup id="cite_ref-180" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-180">[180]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b> ♠ Area ♣ present ♥ </b> Area was measured by the amount of produce associated with a given plot of land: 'The unit of measurement of land among the Yakuts was the “rick” ([unknown]γ[unknown]γ[unknown]), a plot of land from which one hayrick could be mown (the size of the rick ranged from 10 to 30 cartloads, sometimes as many as 40 or 60). These allotments made up plots [...] which were extremely varied in size, depending on the “class,” and there were three or four “classes.” One first-class plot [...] was equal to two secondclass plots [...] and three or four third-class plots (kenniki or [...]). The population was also divided into three or four classes: the toyon households belonged to the first class, and received a first-class plot, the middle households were usually assigned to the second class and the poorer people to the third and fourth classes, each receiving the corresponding clan plot. Thus, the system itself gave the toyons plots of land which were three or four times larger than those of the poorer people. It is true that in return for this the toyons had somewhat greater obligations, but the difference in their extent was extremely small. However, this inequality was by no means the only thing. The toyons actually possessed much more land, having seized it in a variety of different ways. For example, they had several plots, rather than just one, by registering them in the names of their children, workers and so on. It was also the custom to give officials (who were more often than not themselves toyons) additional plots of land, so-called [...] (from the Russian word “ukaz” [edict]), for which, incidentally, there was no payment. The influential toyons also obtained extra plots called ugayy (or kharyy).  Furthermore, the toyons frequently enjoyed the right of possessing larger plots, sometimes through inheritance, cleared from the forest or formed at the site of a drained lake. The leasing of land was also common.' <sup id="cite_ref-181" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-181">[181]</a></sup> Shares in mowable land varied considerably: 'The Yakut call the shares of mowable land kyure,  which means the enclosure around a meadowwhich in other words means that the share encloses that amount of land from which a rick of hay can be gathered.  Formerly, one must assume, the size of a kyure was quite indeterminate.  It meant in general a meadow where hay was mowed and  ricks were placed. Now the conception of kyure is more definite, but its size still varies greatly.  Even within   the limits of the clan the kyure are of various kinds: some are better, some are worse; some are bigger, some are smaller. But this is not important. In time this can be evened out.  The main thing is to obtain from the assembly the right for kyure.  (Namsk Ulus, 1892).  The size of many kyure depends, besides the quality of the soil, its fertility, and so forth, on certain unrelated circumstances: the length of time the land has been held and the natural boundaries of the valley. The Yakut rarely divide land in strips, most often they do it by valleys. Some valleys, which are held by rich people and village usurers, are considered to by kyure (by tradition), but are strictly speaking two or three times larger than the usual  size for that area. The sizes of the kyure, within the confines of the same clan, do not vary as much to  the extent that the kyure of different clans and even more so, of different naslegs, do. The kyure are different in different places: the people of the Odeysk Nasleg have entirely different kyure than do the people of the Madutsk or Betyunsk naslegs.  In those naslegs there are kyure from which one hundred loads of hay may be gathered.  In the meantime, in the Kusagannel'sk Nasleg a kyure of the same class  gives only twenty loads, while we, in the Namsk Nalseg, gather forty loads from  one kyure and eighty loads from another. And so it is everywhere!  The kyure of the Kusagannel'sk Yakut are small, because there all the clans joined their land together, and then divided it among them, giving land to every one who wanted a kyure and could make use of one. Thus small kyure resulted. And even now they divide they land all the time. On the other hand there are few people among them who do not have a kyure, while we have large kyure, but many are left without any land at all.  In other naslegs there is more free land; there the kyure are large also (Namsk Ulus, 1891).  To determine the size of a kyure, the rick, bugul, is used as the unit of measurement. They say: a kyure of such and such a number of ricks. The rick also serves as the minimum unit of measurement in equalizing land; they take away or add such and such a number of ricks of land. Thus in reality the Yakut strictly speaking do not divide land, but divide grass.' <sup id="cite_ref-182" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-182">[182]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b> ♠ Volume ♣ present ♥ </b> 'When the haystacks are sold or evaluated their size is determined in different ways, depending on the locality: by ricks, loads, and bulas.  A load of one true sagene of hay is considered equal to a cubic sagene of unpressed hay; it weighs approximately twenty poods and, converting this figure to ricks, counts as twenty ricks.  The bulas is a different measure and is used primarily in the north.  A pulas or bulas is strictly speaking the distance between the ends of the fingers of one's outstretched hands.    A haystack that is the height of a man is measured by these spans, and it takes its name according to the size of the circumference: six, seven, or nine bulas. The height is assumed to be a minimum of one and one-quarter sagenes not counting the top. The method of counting by bulas is rather confused.  In the south it is customary to assume that a haystack of ten bulas is equal to twenty loads, i.e. four hundred Yakut ricks of one pood each.

<dd><b> ♠ Time ♣ present ♥ </b> The Sakha initially used a lunar calender: 'The ancient Yakut divided the year into lunar months ( yi-syl ). According to Jonov, one year ( tögürüksyl ) in our calendar was regarded as two years: spring and summer were counted as one year and fall and winter as another. Consequently, the time count in old Yakut traditions is much confused. For example, after two years in our count had passed, the Yakut may have said that four years had elapsed. The month was divided into two sections. The first half, until full moon, was called “the new” ( sañata ); the second half, following the full moon, “the old” ( ärgätä ). The days in the first half of the month are enumerated regularly from one to fifteen; in the second half, they are counted in reverse order, from fifteen to one. Thus, there are two fifteenth days in the month, one at the end of the first half and another at the beginning of the second half. Some moments in the phases of the moon are poetically defined; for instance, of the first day of the first half of the month, the Yakut say:  kys jaxtar kylamanbin kurduk kylbayan taxs[unknown]yta,  it glistened like the eyelash of a young girl; of the twenty-eighth day (the Yakut second day of the second half of the month) they say:  xotun jaxtar ytarhatyn iämähin saha ärgi[unknown]ciyä baranyta,  it ends like the size of a woman’s earring.' <sup id="cite_ref-185" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-185">[185]</a></sup> Jochelson's material suggests that the Sakha may have allowed for leap months in order to reconcile the lunar reckoning with the rhythm of the seasons: 'The month, the Yakut say, has exactly thirty days. When asked how many months there are in a year, they usually answer: twelve. But this is difficult to compromise with their actual method of reckoning, since, were this so the  to-yya  (hay month) would, during certain years, fall in winter. This is impossible. There are some corrections. It appears that the Yakut have more than twelve month names.' <sup id="cite_ref-186" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-186">[186]</a></sup> 'The New Year according to our calendar falls about the end of the Yakut eight month ( axsynyy ); thus, the Yakut  kulun tutar  almost coincides with March. When this was pointed out to them the Yakut  themselves wondered, “How it was that in former times the foals were tied and the mares milked so early.” At present mares foal in the twelfth month ( m[unknown]us ustar ) and even in the first month ( balyk [unknown]yr ), approximately in April or May. The Yakut begin to milk their mares in the first month ( balyk[unknown] yr ). But to clear up these moot points, it should be noted that the names for two more months are known:  atyjax yya  (the month of pitchfork, i.e., of drying hay) and  balahañña k[unknown]irär yi  (the month of changing the summer dwelling for the winter house). The Yakut usually say that the first of these two months is the same as  tördünyü  (the fourth), but they are confused concerning the second month. Mr. V. M. Jonov is of the opinion that both names were inserted between the months  to yya  and  bäcinyi,  instead of  tördünyü,  when the month names failed to match the corresponding season. Thus we have a thirteen month year. Jonov found that the Yakut agreed with him in this explanation.' <sup id="cite_ref-187" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-187">[187]</a></sup> Christian Sakha adopted the Orthodox calender: 'After becoming Christians the Yakut no longer followed this method of reckoning time, but oriented themselves by the Christian holidays, for instance:  kirisiäniye  (Russian,  krestcheniye ), baptism, January sixth;  Kiristiäp  (Russian,  Kristov ). Easter:  Orosuospa  (Russian  Rozhdestvo ), Christmas;  bul[unknown]astar  (Russian,  Vlasii ), or  ynax tañarata  (cow’s holiday), February eleventh. Russians regard Saint Vlasii as the protector of domestic cattle and among the Yakut this saint replaced the female deity, Ayisit, of their old mythology. Among the Yakut are experienced individuals who know the number of days between holidays since it is easier to deal with immovable feasts. For movable festivals, they must often consult their priest. On the wall of every Yakut dwelling is a calendar, usually consisting of a small board with holes corresponding to the number of days in the year.  The immovable feasts are marked by crosses over the holes. A wooden peg is placed in the hole to indicate the current date, thus showing whether it is an ordinary day or a holiday. Fig. 1 shows a circular calendar; the inner circle has seven perforations, corresponding to the seven days of the week. A peg is shown in the hole for Sunday, over which there is a cross. The outer ring has thirty holes. When the month has thirty-one days, the peg is kept in the last hole for two days. If the month has twenty-nine or twenty-eight days, the peg must be transferred to the first day of the next month. The calendar is called kün ahar,   it counts the days, or  sibaska  (Russian,  svyatzy,  calendar of saints), or  nädiälä asarar mas,  board which shows the week.' <sup id="cite_ref-188" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-188">[188]</a></sup> Weeks were introduced during the Russian period: 'The Yakut began to count the month by weeks only after Russianization.

<dl><dd><b> ♠ Mnemonic devices ♣ present ♥ </b> Balzer only mentions memorial hitching posts: 'The most important ceremony, associated with a founding Yakut ancestor named Ellei, is the annual summer YHYAK festival, a celebration of seasonal change, of KUMYS (fermented mare's milk), and of kin solidarity. Once a religious celebration led by a shaman, the ceremony has been adapted since World War I into a secular commemoration of Yakut traditions. Practiced in villages and towns, it features opening prayers (ALGYS) and libations of KUMYS to the earth. Although some Yakut debate its "authenticity," the festival still includes feasting, horse racing, wrestling, and all-night line dancing to improvised chants. It lasts three joyous days in Suntar, where it is especially famed. Wedding rituals, pared down from previous eras, center around memorial hitching posts (SERQE), carved for the occasion, with couples honored by prayers, special food, and dancing. New rituals marking wedding anniversaries and graduations at all educational levels include the placement of SERQE, on which names of those honored are carved. But traditional rituals of birth, supplicating the goddess of fertility, Aiyycyt, have become less popular, with some Yakut women even mocking the restrictions that were once associated with beliefs about female impurity.

<dl><dd><b> ♠ Lists, tables, and classifications ♣ absent ♥ </b> Russian administrators composed clerical documents: 'The people became rapidly impoverished, and the order of the voivode to the clerk Evdokim Kurdiukov in 1685 already mentions the arrears in the treasury and orders the yassak gatherers to treat the people in arrears in the following way: from them who have no cattle take, because of their povetry and extreme need one cherno-cherevyya and one sivodushatyya fox from each, and for a sable, two red foxes from each. This same document orders him to make a census of the people, and their goods and cattle: collect the taxes for the current year, 193 (1685) in full, and collect the arrears for the past years, from each as much as possible. Similar censuses were taken earlier also, and their character may be judged by the census of Grishka Krivogornitsyn in 170 (1671) “for the Meginsk volosts” There we find mentioned not only the taxes and the amounts in arrears, but also the houses, wives, number of workers in the family. There is information about those who have died and those who have run away. Moreover the name and clan of every person is given. The personal and clan nicknames, of course are very much corrupted in these notes, and changed to conform with the Russian style, but it is not hard to determine what they actually are. The yassak books and these censuses were the materials out of which was later created the present system of Yakut self-government.' <sup id="cite_ref-209" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-209">[209]</a></sup> But the Sakha probably had little to no access to these.</dd>
<dd><b> ♠ Calendar ♣ absent ♥ </b> The Sakha initially used a nonwritten lunar calender: 'The ancient Yakut divided the year into lunar months ( yi-syl ). According to Jonov, one year ( tögürüksyl ) in our calendar was regarded as two years: spring and summer were counted as one year and fall and winter as another. Consequently, the time count in old Yakut traditions is much confused. For example, after two years in our count had passed, the Yakut may have said that four years had elapsed. The month was divided into two sections. The first half, until full moon, was called “the new” ( sañata ); the second half, following the full moon, “the old” ( ärgätä ). The days in the first half of the month are enumerated regularly from one to fifteen; in the second half, they are counted in reverse order, from fifteen to one. Thus, there are two fifteenth days in the month, one at the end of the first half and another at the beginning of the second half. Some moments in the phases of the moon are poetically defined; for instance, of the first day of the first half of the month, the Yakut say:  kys jaxtar kylamanbin kurduk kylbayan taxs[unknown]yta,  it glistened like the eyelash of a young girl; of the twenty-eighth day (the Yakut second day of the second half of the month) they say:  xotun jaxtar ytarhatyn iämähin saha ärgi[unknown]ciyä baranyta,  it ends like the size of a woman’s earring.' <sup id="cite_ref-210" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-210">[210]</a></sup> The use of calenders by Christian Sakha resembles mnemonic devices more closely than written documents: 'After becoming Christians the Yakut no longer followed this method of reckoning time, but oriented themselves by the Christian holidays, for instance:  kirisiäniye  (Russian,  krestcheniye ), baptism, January sixth;  Kiristiäp  (Russian,  Kristov ). Easter:  Orosuospa  (Russian  Rozhdestvo ), Christmas;  bul[unknown]astar  (Russian,  Vlasii ), or  ynax tañarata  (cow’s holiday), February eleventh. Russians regard Saint Vlasii as the protector of domestic cattle and among the Yakut this saint replaced the female deity, Ayisit, of their old mythology. Among the Yakut are experienced individuals who know the number of days between holidays since it is easier to deal with immovable feasts. For movable festivals, they must often consult their priest. On the wall of every Yakut dwelling is a calendar, usually consisting of a small board with holes corresponding to the number of days in the year.  The immovable feasts are marked by crosses over the holes. A wooden peg is placed in the hole to indicate the current date, thus showing whether it is an ordinary day or a holiday. Fig. 1 shows a circular calendar; the inner circle has seven perforations, corresponding to the seven days of the week. A peg is shown in the hole for Sunday, over which there is a cross. The outer ring has thirty holes. When the month has thirty-one days, the peg is kept in the last hole for two days. If the month has twenty-nine or twenty-eight days, the peg must be transferred to the first day of the next month. The calendar is called kün ahar,   it counts the days, or  sibaska  (Russian,  svyatzy,  calendar of saints), or  nädiälä asarar mas,  board which shows the week.' <sup id="cite_ref-211" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-211">[211]</a></sup> 'The Yakut began to count the month by weeks only after Russianization. Thus, for week, they use the Russian word  nädiälä  ( nedielya ).

The ermine is a predatory, bold, and curious animal. When irritated it will attack even  human beings.  Cases are known of the ermine inflicting serious wounds on people, for it attempts to cut through the blood vessels on the neck, where it ascends with exceptional speed and agility.

Butter began to go into circulation only when the Russians came and built a city, and particularly when they began to buy it for the mines, maintained the Namsk Yakut (1891).  The Yakut monetary unit ary, which means one bezem of heated butter of two and one-half funts testifies to the trading significance of butter.  In remote corners the Yakut often convert the price of goods from a monetary basis to a butter basis, and express hiring prices and selling prices of objects offered in terms of butter.  The majority of women are only familiar with this system, and get confused in trying to count with money.  Butter comprises one of the most important food products of the Yakut. The poorest Yakut tries to have it on his table  on feast days, and even the stingiest master must feed his workers butter at least once a week.  The Yakut consume butter in various ways: they eat it in hard pieces, they drink it crumbled with kumiss, they drink it in tea, and they drink warm heated butter in its pure form.  In their climate this beverage is far from distasteful, and when coming back chilled from hunting, or frozen through during a long winter journey I would willingly drink a full dish of it myself.  It warms one quickly, and restore's one's strength and vigor, just like grape wine.  A Yakut is able to drink not more than one-half a funt at a gulp, but can drink up to two and one-half funts over a certain period of time, stopping to rest. Sturdy fellows who are able to drink five to ten funts at one time are known in every section , but I do not think that there are more than two or three in the oblast capable of drink one-half a pood; I do not know a their ability to drink a large quantity of melted butter just as Russians boast of their ability to drink large quantities of vodka.' <sup id="cite_ref-218" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-218">[218]</a></sup></dd>

For everyday use the son is more widely used than the sangyyakh everywhere. I only came across sangyyakh used for everyday wear once or twice, in very remote regions.  These were good-looking, light caftans, reaching a little below the knees and sewn out of striped calfskin.  They were cut to the shape of the body, were worn without any undergarments, and outlined the figure perfectly; the absence of a collar and the small opening in front which bared the neck made them looklike the coquettish costumes of the south.  There are indications that the sangyyakh, which is also called sanynyakh was much mo ed to be buried in sangyyakh, and a couple would be dressed in sangyyakh for their wedding; this practice is still followed in the north.  A sangyyakh is given as the wedding present of the mother-in-law.  Finally, in the north shamans perform their mysteries dressed in a  woman's sangyyakh, in the absence of their regular costume (Kolymsk Ulus, 1883).  But in the south the sangynyakh is becoming rarer and rarer; there the son has become the national costume of the Yakut. It has followed them into their new colonies everywhere. Its use, together with the Yakut language, has spread to the local Russians and to the Yakutized Tungus and Yukaghir. It is worn, with only small changes, by Yakut of both sexes, and of the most widely varied circumstances and ages. Even if the assumption that it was brought here by the Cossaks no earlier than in the seventeenth century is true, such a firmly established and universal use of this garment shows that there were corresponding beginnings in the national taste and that in practice its forms turned out to be utilitarian as well. And thus: the puffs on the shoulders offer splendid protection from cold and keep the shoulder muscles protected from dampness;it is, after all, these muscles which when riding are most susceptible to the effects of bad weather.  Again, the wing-like inserts protect the thighs, stomach, and seat of the rider, and do not allow the flaps of the coat to come apart very much.' <sup id="cite_ref-231" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-231">[231]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b> ♠ Couriers ♣ present ♥ </b> Sieroszewski mentions couriers, but their status as professionals is unclear: 'I spent the autumn of 1884 in the Kolymsk Ulus, at Engzha,  in the home of the old man Ivan Sleptsov, who had just been chosen prince of the Second Kangalas Nasleg.   Once, in the middle of October, a courier was sent to us from the valley of Ungdzha, with an invitation to a wedding.  The clansmen invited their prince, and I was invited to come along.  We had to travel approximately seventy versts on horse-back; we spent one night on the road and arrived at the home of the Yakut Dmitrii, who was holding the wedding, at daybreak on the next day.  He was  giving away his daughter in marriage, and the forthcoming festivity was the first and most important of the  marriage ceremonies.  Approaching the homestead we constantly outrode groups of mounted Yakut, while near the house we encountered a group of women leading a cow.  These all were people belonging to the clan of the  bride: they were hurrying to the wedding.  The bridal trainof the bridegroom, it turned out, was riding behind us.  It consisted of the father of the bridegroom, his uncle,  the match-maker - some distant relative, and an elder cousin of the bridegroom.  All of them were dressed in their best costumes, and rode on their best horses along the road in single file, one behind the other.  At the very end of the procession rode the young bridegroom and led behind him a pair of horses, loaded with  meat. The match-maker also led a pair of pack horses.' <sup id="cite_ref-232" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-232">[232]</a></sup> On the other hand, the material on the growing postal system (see below) seems to support this.</dd>
<dd><b> ♠ Postal stations ♣ present ♥ </b> During the Russian period, Sakha leaders participated in the growing postal system: 'Yakut oral histories begin well before first contact with Russians in the seventeenth century. For example, OLONKHO (epics) date at least to the tenth century, a period of interethnic mixing, tensions, and upheaval that may have been a formative period in defining Yakut tribal affiliations. Ethnographic and archaeological data suggest that the ancestors of the Yakut, identified in some theories with the Kuriakon people, lived in an area near Lake Baikal and may have been part of the Uighur state bordering China. By the fourteenth century, Yakut ancestors migrated north, perhaps in small refugee groups, with herds of horses and cattle. After arrival in the Lena valley, they fought and intermarried with the native Evenk and Yukagir nomads. Thus, both peaceful and belligerent relations with northern Siberians, Chinese, Mongols, and Turkic peoples preceded Russian hegemony. When the first parties of Cossacks arrived at the Lena River in the 1620s, Yakut received them with hospitality and wariness. Several skirmishes and revolts followed, led at first by the legendary Yakut hero Tygyn. By 1642 the Lena valley was under tribute to the czar; peace was won only after a long siege of a formidable Yakut fortress. By 1700 the fort settlement of Yakutsk (founded 1632) was a bustling Russian administrative, commercial, and religious center and a launching point for further exploration into Kamchatka and Chukotka. Some Yakut moved northeast into territories they had previously not dominated, further assimilating the Evenk and Yukagir. Most Yakut, however, remained in the central meadowlands, sometimes assimilating Russians. Yakut leaders cooperated with Russian commanders and governors, becoming active in trade, fur-tax collection, transport, and the postal system. Fighting among Yakut communities decreased, although horse rustling and occasional anti-Russian violence continued. For example, a Yakut Robin Hood named Manchari led a band that stole from the rich (usually Russians) to give to the poor (usually Yakut) in the nineteenth century. Russian Orthodox priests spread through Yakutia, but their followers were mainly in the major towns. By 1900 a literate Yakut intelligentsia, influenced both by Russian merchants and political exiles, formed a party called the Yakut Union. Yakut revolutionaries such as Oiunskii and Ammosov led the Revolution and civil war in Yakutia, along with Bolsheviks such as the Georgian Ordzhonikidze.' <sup id="cite_ref-233" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-233">[233]</a></sup> Sieroszewski mentions post horses and post roads: 'The most ancient of the yassak are apparently the post-horses. Even in the order given to the clerk Kurdiukov in 1685 we find a mention that the yassak gatherers should  not misuse this obligation: do not take away the good horses from the Yakut   too much, and give them, the natives, your own poor horses in return for their good ones. This was apparently done often and the news of it even reached Moscow.  In view of this it was ordered to take in the service of the Great Sovereigns... bulls and horses; whatever kind they give you, to ride on it.    Besides this guides and coachmen were needed. Gmelin used Yakut oarsmen during his entire journey of 1732, from the boundary of the Yakutsk Oblast.

For example, OLONKHO (epics) date at least to the tenth century, a period of interethnic mixing, tensions, and upheaval that may have been a formative period in defining Yakut tribal affiliations. Ethnographic and archaeological data suggest that the ancestors of the Yakut, identified in some theories with the Kuriakon people, lived in an area near Lake Baikal and may have been part of the Uighur state bordering China. By the fourteenth century, Yakut ancestors migrated north, perhaps in small refugee groups, with herds of horses and cattle. After arrival in the Lena valley, they fought and intermarried with the native Evenk and Yukagir nomads. Thus, both peaceful and belligerent relations with northern Siberians, Chinese, Mongols, and Turkic peoples preceded Russian hegemony. When the first parties of Cossacks arrived at the Lena River in the 1620s, Yakut received them with hospitality and wariness. Several skirmishes and revolts followed, led at first by the legendary Yakut hero Tygyn. By 1642 the Lena valley was under tribute to the czar; peace was won only after a long siege of a formidable Yakut fortress. By 1700 the fort settlement of Yakutsk (founded 1632) was a bustling Russian administrative, commercial, and religious center and a launching point for further exploration into Kamchatka and Chukotka. Some Yakut moved northeast into territories they had previously not dominated, further assimilating the Evenk and Yukagir. Most Yakut, however, remained in the central meadowlands, sometimes assimilating Russians. Yakut leaders cooperated with Russian commanders and governors, becoming active in trade, fur-tax collection, transport, and the postal system. Fighting among Yakut communities decreased, although horse rustling and occasional anti-Russian violence continued. For example, a Yakut Robin Hood named Manchari led a band that stole from the rich (usually Russians) to give to the poor (usually Yakut) in the nineteenth century. Russian Orthodox priests spread through Yakutia, but their followers were mainly in the major towns. By 1900 a literate Yakut intelligentsia, influenced both by Russian merchants and political exiles, formed a party called the Yakut Union. Yakut revolutionaries such as Oiunskii and Ammosov led the Revolution and civil war in Yakutia, along with Bolsheviks such as the Georgian Ordzhonikidze.' <sup id="cite_ref-235" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-235">[235]</a></sup> Sieroszewski mentions post horses and post roads: 'The most ancient of the yassak are apparently the post-horses. Even in the order given to the clerk Kurdiukov in 1685 we find a mention that the yassak gatherers should  not misuse this obligation: do not take away the good horses from the Yakut  too much, and give them, the natives, your own poor horses in return for their good ones. This was apparently done often and the news of it even reached Moscow.  In view of this it was ordered to take in the service of the Great Sovereigns... bulls and horses; whatever kind they give you, to ride on it.    Besides this guides and coachmen were needed. Gmelin used Yakut oarsmen during his entire journey of 1732, from the boundary of the Yakutsk Oblast.   Some Yakut families were transplanted to the Olekminsk, Okhotsk, Ayan, Verkhoyansk, and Kolymsk post roads  to maintain the post-horses.' <sup id="cite_ref-236" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-236">[236]</a></sup></dd>

In the time of Peter the Great, Yakutsk entered into the newly organized Siberian Goubernyia (government) and with the division of the Siberian government into provinces was included in Irkutsk Province. In 1775 Irkutsk Province was organized into a government and the Yakut country formed one of the provinces of the new government. In 1783 the government was again reorganized into a vice-royalty composed of four provinces, one of which was Yakutsk Province. In 1797 the vice-royalty was abolished and the government restored. In [Page 225] 1805 under the Emperor Alexander I, the Yakut country was made a separate province dependent upon Irkutsk. In 1852 the Yakut country was given a separate governor.

</p><p><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b>
</p><p>Note: The material was coded for Sakha parties rather than Cossack troops. The potential involvement of Sakha fighters with Russian troops under Czarist rule remains in need of confirmation.
</p><p>Eva: there were Mongolian incursions into parts of Siberia from the 13th century onwards, and after the breakup of the Golden Horde a Khanate was established. However, the sources we reviewed didn't devote much attention to this aspect of Siberian history because their major concern was with Sakha ethnography and the relationship between Siberians and imperial Russia. In addition, Siberia is vast and to the best of my knowledge the Khans only controlled one bit of it. Accordingly, I coded based on the assumption that the Khans did not exert control over the Sakhat 'nobles' in the middle ages. However, that was a working assumption made based on the sources I had access to at the time, and the advice I give is based on that educated guess I made from my sources. I have found no evidence that the Khans controlled any part of what is now the Sakha Republic, which is where our NGA is. Despite all that, this is definitely an issue we have to bring up with an expert, even if it's just for the sake of our own peace of mind.

<p><b> ♠ Standing armies ♣ absent ♥ </b> Sakha warriors and spies fought for their clans and tribes, and were not professionals in the conventional sense of the term: 'Yakut warriors ( säpi, säpi kisita ) were usually mounted horsemen ( minjär ), but there were also foot soldiers ( sat[unknown]ykisita ). Their weapons ( säp ) consisted of a light bent bow ( s[unknown]a ), a quiver ( käsäx, s[unknown]adax ), and arrows ( aya ) .' <sup id="cite_ref-266" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-266">[266]</a></sup> 'These warriors formed a chain of movable, vigilant pickets around the settlements. In case of war they formed the kernel of the fighting detachment -- sari  Some of the bolder ones went to find their fortune, dzhol.  They would go far into unknown territory, among foreigners, either by themselves or with companions.  Such detachments would not take their cattle with them and often traveled on foot.  They made their living exclusively by hunting, fishing, and looting. The Yakut kept these habits for a long time, until very recently. Khudiakov has a legend about Khaptagay-batyr and his son Khokhoe-batyr, and their three khosun: Sappy, Yngkabyl, and Batagyyan, who roamed about in the seventeen forties, during the time of Pavlutskii, in the north of the Yakutsk Oblast.  In the Kolymsk Okrug (1882), I wrote down a legend about the two Yakut brothers who were the first to make their way into the kolymsk Krai. Their names have been forgotten.  In the Namsk Ulus I was told a legend about the Vilyuysk Yakut Tangas-Boltongo who also wandered by himself somewhere in the little-known, remote regions of the Vilyuysk Okrug. He was called a bagatyr, just as the old epic heroes.  Apparently he lived in the beginning of the present century; this is indicated by the name of a Yakut hunter of the Namsk Ulus, Betyunsk Nasleg, Chaky clan, whom he encountered: his name was Soldat.  Soldiers appeared  in the Yakutsk Oblast only in the last century, at the time of the Kamchatka campaigns of Pavlutskii.  Then Middendorf mentions solitary Yakut hunters whom he encountered far from their native tribes in the mountains of the Amur Basin. Such bold fellows served their clans as a sort of voluntary spies, searching out new pastures suitable for settlement in case some sort of unpleasantness or inconvenience should arise in the homeland. They brought back word of new lands, of the peoples they had encountered, the details of the route, and the obstacles involved. Sometimes the clan would choose such people out of their own number and deliberately send them out on a searching party. The tales The Golden Eagle and the Teal, and The Flying Winged Creatures hint at this.  These were chosen people and were also called bagatyr, baatyr, batyr, or batur; strictly speaking in the Yakut language this word means valorous, exceptionally manly, bold, strong, and clever. But these people did not have any special rights in the clan besides the usual rights gained through personal superiority.' <sup id="cite_ref-267" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-267">[267]</a></sup> Military operations were lead by war-leaders, who formed a military aristocracy based on heredity and personal military success: 'Just as now, common matters were managed by the clan assembly.  Matters of war and minor legal cases, which demanded quick settlement without any delays, were managed by a war leader -- toen -- acknowledged by the rest of the people. According to the Yakut this service was hereditary, on the strength of their belief that an eaglet is always an eagle; a young crow is always a crow.  But this hereditary right was not strictly followed. Thus, the heir of the Borogon toen, Legey, was not his son, but a foreign adopted son who had been bought for money.  Another saga relates,  with full consciousness of the legality of such a matter, that the Tungus chose as their toen a Yakut, Khaptagay-batyr, because of his valor. The sago says: No Lamut (Tungus), no matter who, will kill you.  Now you be our lord (toen).  If a Lamut will not obey your word, let there be a sin upon him.   The toen always had in addition the title of bagatyr (valorous) and in the popular conception his traits of character had to correspond with those demanded of a hero.  But he would not wander by himself, nor look for adventures, but would always live where the clan was and only leave in time of war, at the head of the mounted and armed detachment.' <sup id="cite_ref-268" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-268">[268]</a></sup> 'We can judge how large these unions sometimes were by the fact that in 1634  600 Yakut warriors under the leadership of prince Mymak took part in a battle on the right bank of the Lena, in which the army of ataman  Galkin was crushed and all his horses were lost.' <sup id="cite_ref-269" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-269">[269]</a></sup> 'At this period, however, the clan-tribal structure was already in a state of decomposition. The tribes and clans were headed by the military aristocracy-the toyons. These possessed large herds of cattle and employed the labor of slaves and dependent fellow clansmen on their farms; they were also the military leaders. Heading detachments of armed servants and junior fellow clansmen, the toyons raided each other’s territory, and frequently looted the farms of the free members of the community, seizing their cattle and destroying their economic independence. These toyon wars and raids were one of the factors which speeded up the decomposition of the clan commune. The ruined members of the commune were reduced to the status of “balyksyts” (poor people without cattle, or fishermen), or else became the indentured slaves of the toyons. Most of the slaves (kuluts or bokans) originated in this way.' <sup id="cite_ref-270" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-270">[270]</a></sup> It is unclear from the sources reviewed so far whether Sakha warriors were also recruited by Cossack invaders.

<p><b>♠ Inter-polity wars ♣ present: 1632-1642 CE; absent: 1643-1900 CE ♥</b> The stereotypes and legends described here seem to hint at a history of violent inter-tribal conflict: "The Yakut treat the Tungus haughtily, but give their warlike abilities their due: cunning like a Tungus, they say.  A Tungus is quick; even in his sleep he can sense that an arrow is directed toward him, and slip away. (Kolymsk Ulus, 1882). We conquered the Tungus thanks to their stupidity....

A Tungus warrior comes to his house to gain revenge, but he too is killed by the Yakut. Then, becoming frightened at the consequences, the murderer gathers his clan and persuades them to fall upon the tungus first, in order to protect themselves. The clan agrees and arms itself for the campaign, but to everyone's satisfaction the matter is settled peacefully, the feuding parties separate, and exchange presents. On the way back the Yakut meet some Russians and, bribed by them, jointly attack the Tungus again.  (Namsk Ulus, 1891)." <sup id="cite_ref-272" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-272">[272]</a></sup> The historical facts bear this out: ""By the fourteenth century, Yakut ancestors migrated north, perhaps in small refugee groups, with herds of horses and cattle.

Thus, both peaceful and belligerent relations with northern Siberians, Chinese, Mongols, and Turkic peoples preceded Russian hegemony." <sup id="cite_ref-273" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-273">[273]</a></sup> But feuding and inter-tribal violence decreased after Russian occupation: "Yakut leaders cooperated with Russian commanders and governors, becoming active in trade, fur-tax collection, transport, and the postal system.

Russian empire builders, spearheaded by Cossack bands, then pushed down the Lena and built three forts in the Yakut heartland, one of which would become the city of Yakutsk. As was true in the rest of Siberia, the Russians demanded yasak, or tribute in the form of fur, from the indigenes. The Yakut resisted, but they were divided into feuding clans and hampered by outmoded military technology. Resistance also provoked devastating Cossack raids on the scattered hamlets and homesteads of the vulnerably semi-sedentary Sakha.

In case of war they formed the kernel of the fighting detachment -- sari Some of the bolder ones went to find their fortune, dzhol.  They would go far into unknown territory, among foreigners, either by themselves or with companions.  Such detachments would not take their cattle with them and often traveled on foot.  They made their living exclusively by hunting, fishing, and looting. The Yakut kept these habits for a long time, until very recently. Khudiakov has a legend about Khaptagay-batyr and his son Khokhoe-batyr, and their three khosun: Sappy, Yngkabyl, and Batagyyan, who roamed about in the seventeen forties, during the time of Pavlutskii, in the north of the Yakutsk Oblast..." <sup id="cite_ref-312" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-312">[312]</a></sup>

Councils were composed of ranked circles of elders, usually men, whose leaders, TOYONS, were called nobles by Russians. A lineage head was BIS-USA-TOYON; respected warriors and hunters were BATYR. Lineage councils decided major economic issues, interfamily disputes, and questions of blood revenge for violence committed against the group. AIMAK and DZHON councils were infrequent, dealing with issues of security, revenge, alliance, and, before Russian control, war.

</p><p>"It is possible that some of the Yakuts nasal fractures are sports injuries. Czaplicka (1916) describes a popular Yakuts game called maasyuk that in many respects is similar to soccer. The ball is made of raindeer skin and is kicked and butted about with the head and 'propelled by almost any means short of manslaughter' (Czaplicka 1916:117-118). Fouling is not penalized and if a kick is impossible, the ball may be picked up and thrown. In view of the clinical evidence that nasal fractures are a common result of collisions between soccer players (Frenguelli et al. 1991), this type of sports injury may well account for some of the nasal fractures, especially among Yakuts men."<sup id="cite_ref-319" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-319">[319]</a></sup>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Ayy ysyaxa ♥</b> "Spring festival is called Ayy ysyaxa (“kumiss festival in honor of the ‘creators’ ”). During the summer, in olden times, every rich man arranged a kumiss festival, at which all members of the clan assembled and were entertained. Other people, and frequently whole clans, were invited; and during the festival, defensive and offensive leagues were concluded. Every such festival commenced with sacrifices, and was accompanied with songs, dances, games, horse and foot races, and other contests. The spring kumiss festival takes place in the open air. In the midst of a large smooth grass meadow a kind of altar is erected. This consists of two posts with a crossbeam, and three young birch-trees with young shoots on them. The altar is hung round with sacrificial horsehair, and on the ground in front of it are placed ornamented birch-bark and ox-hide barrels filled with kumiss. The skin barrels are tied to the altar-frame by long ornamented straps of soft elk-leather. The ceremony commences by sacrifices to Lord Bright-Creator and to other “creators.” Their names are uttered by the steward of the festival, who may be a shaman or an elder member of the clan. The sacrifices consist of libations of kumiss, in the direction of the dawn. The steward addresses a prayer to the “creators,” begging for blessings,-increase of horses and cattle, a good harvest of hay, good health for the people and animals, and an abundance of food. Then he takes the kumiss-festival ladle , and makes a libation, in the direction of the dawn, to the benevolent deities . Then, while making a libation to the ground, he addresses the local deity, “the owner of the place” (än doidu iccitä), asking him not to harm the inhabitants of the spot and the members of the clan. After that, the steward, with the help of the sacrificial ladle, proceeds to divine. He throws the ladle towards the sky: and if it falls with the front part upwards, it portends the granting by the deities of future abundance; and all the people utter the joyful cry Uru!   Then the boys and girls give the goblets with the sacrificial kumiss, according to the directions of the steward, to the elder and honored members of the clan, both male and female. These, after placing themselves,-the men on the right and the women on the left of the altar,-drink off the kumiss from the goblets, and pass them on to the less important and the younger people." <sup id="cite_ref-320" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-320">[320]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-321" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-321">[321]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Weddings ♥</b> Weddings were subject to a high degree of ritualization, resembling peacemaking procedures between two families: 'Traditionally, for wealthy Yakut, marriage could be polygamous. More common, however, was monogamy, with occasional remarriage after the death of a spouse. Arranged marriages were sometimes politically motivated. Patrilineage exogamy was reckoned strictly; those one could marry were called SYGAN. Until the 1920s many marriage arrangements were complicated and protracted, involving financial, emotional, and symbolic resources of the bride's and groom's extended families. This included the matchmaking ritual; several formal payments of animals, furs, and meat to the bride's family; informal gifts; and extensive dowries. Some families permitted poor grooms to work in their households as a replacement for the bride-price. Occasionally bride-capture occurred (it may have been more common in pre-Russian times). Wedding ceremonies and their attendant feasts, prayers, and dancing, were held first at the household of the bride's parents, then at that of the groom's. The couple usually lived or settled in a nearby yurt.' <sup id="cite_ref-363" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-363">[363]</a></sup>//Kharuzin also describes the wedding proceedings: 'On the day of the wedding the choom of the father of the bride and that of the father of the bridegroom were set up side by side. Depending on the degree of their prosperity the owner of each of the chooms slaughtered between one and five deer and treated the assembled guests. In addition, the bridegroom slaughtered one more deer and sent its meat to the father of the bride. Aided by his friends the bridegroom would next catch the deer for the black kalym. At the same time, near the choom of the bride, other young men caught deer that were to be handed over as dowry. Out on the street, meanwhile, the bride would dance in the company of her girl friends and of other young men. Having caught the deer for the black kalym, the young men tied them up to the back of the narta of the match-maker who, with the deer behind him, rode in front of the bridegroom.//'Upon approaching the choom of the bride the matchmaker and the bridegroom rode around her choom in the direction of the movement of the sun. The matchmaker would then enter the choom alone and announce: The son-in-law has arrived. At the same time the people present would let the deer in a special enclosure built by stretching lassoes between trees and by setting up of overturned nartas . A great number of guests would arrive together with the bridegroom. Out on the street the matchmaker would lead the bridegroom to the father of the bride. The bridegroom would pull behind him a vazhenka ( nyal'dzhin ) tied to a leather strap. Upon approaching his future father-in-law he would hand the animal over to him. The bridegroom together with the guests would then remain outside while in the choom preparations were made for a feast and a wedding bed was set up for the newlyweds. The making of the bed was entrusted to one of the relatives of the bride.//'While the guests stood outside and waited for the beginning of the feast, the matchmaker would make numerous sorties from the choom of the bride and in a light-hearted way inform them of what was going on inside the choom. At the same time the father of the bride would received the deer of the black kalym. In the east tundra all the brought deer were accepted without any argument; in the Noril'-skiy rayon, however, the father of the bride would frequently pronounce some animals unacceptable and would send them back expecting other animals in their stead. In the case of a demanding father the business of receiving the deer would occasionally extend into the late evening.//'If the father of the bride was a snob he would make the guests freeze outside for a long time. When, at long last, the feast and the bed were ready and the deer of the black kalym all checked, the match-maker would lead the bridegroom into the choom and would make him pray in front of the ikons. The bride stationed herself by the side of the bridegroom and prayed together with him. After the prayers were ended the matchmaker would say to the bridegroom: Bow to the big father-in-law and ask for his blessing. The bride and the bridegroom would then make a low bow before the parents and came up to receive their blessing as well as the blessing of the relatives older than the bride. All of them blessed the young people, gave them their hands to kiss, and proffered their best wishes. The matchmaker would at this point, give ten rubles to the father of the bride, and to all her relatives pieces of cloth and kerchiefs. In Noril'sk in the place of money the matchmaker gave the bride's father a fox skin, and to her mother a polar fox skin or a fur coat. These presents were called yungyu --prayer or request. After these presents had been made all the relatives of the bride got up and shook the bridegroom's hand. There were no handshakes between these relatives and the members of the bridegroom's entourage.//'After the blessing ceremony was over the bride and the bridegroom were placed behind the bed curtain. Only then would the guests be let in in a strictly observed order. The guests would be brought in from outside by the relatives, who would lead them by the hand--the adult relatives accompanying the adult guests, and children-relatives--other children. The guests would be taken to places that were asssigned to them. The closest relatives and the most honored guests as well as foreigners (Yakut, Russians, Tungus) would be let in first. To avoid mistakes the relatives of the bride asked their friends as to who should come in and in what order. Before the guests were let in two people would be selected from among those who were known for their talents as improvisers. The two chosen men were to play the role of people who predict the future ( yr kerderer dzhon ). One of these men was selected by the relatives of the bridegroom, the other----by the relatives of the bride. The presence of these men was not an essential part of the wedding ceremony.//'When all the honored guests were seated the bride's father would ask them: Guests! What do you have to say? The matchmaker would answer: We have a word to say. Then a representative of the bridegroom would get us and colorfully and ornately would describe the future life of the young people and the peace and harmony of their household. He would also describe the number of the children they were going to have, how rich they were going to be, etc. He would end his speech by saying: My words ended, now is your turn. Thereupon a similar speech would be made by a representative of the bride. The guests predicted a happier life for the bridegroom or the bride, depending on which side gave the better speech. After this a woman relative of the bride poured out tea and took charge of the serving of the food. After the first meal, i.e. after drinking the tea, and before the opening of the table ( ostuolu asyar inniger ), i.e. the serving of the meal, all the guests would go out on the street and dance until the second meal was served. The ceremony of distributing the kalym ( sulu tuttarar ) would be taking place at the same time.//'The wedding bed was transported to the choom of the bridegroom before the arrival of the bride herself. In front of the procession rode the matchmaker; he was followed by the bridegroom, behind whom was the bride, and behind the latter the deer loaded with the bride's dowry. The bride put on two coats made out of cloth ( sontap ) and a Siberian fur-coat ( dokha ), embroidered with patterns ( ardaydakh sangyyakh ). In the Noril'skiy rayon the size of the dowry was decided upon in the course of the negotiations conducted by the matchmaker; in other places the custom was different and the size of the dowry depended on that of the kalym. If the kalym consisted of sixty deer, the number of deer given with the dowry would be forty-five. A rich dowry consisted of sixty or seventy selected deer of various ages, among them no harness or old deer. Nor more than two or three deer could be included in a rich dowry. In addition to the deer a rich dowry would consist of seven and the poor one of five nartas, harnessed to the best deer (a pair of deer harnessed to each narta of the rich dowry, and a single deer harnessed to each narta of the poor one). In addition to the nartas a dowry included a narta choom, to which were harnessed four deer.//'When the bride's train approached the choom of the bridegroom, the matchmaker would go to the parents of the bridegroom and announced to them the arrival of the bride. The newlyweds would then travel three times around the choom in the direction of the movement of the sun. In the Noril'skiy rayon the bride rode around the choom by herself; after she had entered the choom the deer were led around the choom by some one else. This ceremony was called the entrance of the hearth ( sarany bullarar ). The bride was led into the choom of the bridegroom by a respected old woman who could not be her relative. The bride and the bridegroom prayed together before the ikon, and then, with a deep bow to the bridegroom's father and mother, asked for their blessing and came up to kiss their hands. The parents of the bridegroom then blessed the newlyweds and wished them a happy life. At this point the bride would give the bridegroom's parents presents of money or of valuable skins; these presents had to be much more valuable that those given by the bridegroom to the parents of the bride, for the father of the bride would want to put up a front before the bridegroom's father. In the bridegroom's choom the guests were again treated to a feast, which was served to them in two shifts. In the ancient times a shaman would always be invited to a wedding. Before the beginning of the feast he would stand dressed not in his ceremonial but in his ordinary garments, and leaning upon a deer staff of the bride called upon beneficent gods and spirits to be kind to the newlywed, and for himself wished them a happy and prosperous life. After this address by the shaman the first group of honored guests sat down to the feast.'//'The bridegroom's father would next come out to glance at the deer that were brought as a dowry, and offered the people who helped him in the equipping of the kalym to chose the animals they wanted.//'After the end of the festivities the father would inspect the dowry in the light of the day (this custom was not practised by the Noril'skiye Dolgani): he would go out of the choom, open up the trunks and examine their contents. If it turned out that the amount of the dowry was not equivalent to the amount of the kalym, the stinginess of the bride's parents would be disapprovingly commented on by all those present. As a rule, the father of the bride tried to include in the dowry as many valuable things as he could, for fear that otherwise he might disgrace himself. The inspection described above ended the ceremonies of the Dolgani wedding. The assembled guests would spend the day in eating, in games and in dancing, and would depart in the late evening. The father and the mother of the bride stayed with the bridegroom for a period of three days. Before their departure the father of the bridegroom would present the parents of the bride with one deer (ogo kereryu) which was to be looked upon by them as their daughter. The animal thus given as a present was highly valued. On the morning of the third day the young wife poured out tea. During the tea drinking her father would publicly instruct her as follows: From this time on you must obey your husband. Your mother-in-law now stands in the place of your own mother. Your father-in-law in the place of your father. Respect and obey them and do not quarrel with them.' <sup id="cite_ref-364" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-364">[364]</a></sup>//Elders played a prominent role alongside parents and shamans: 'The oldest kinsman in the clan, or the [unknown]iye-[unknown]usa , is always heaped with honors, if he is both rich and has never been put on trial. To him pertains the jurisdiction in trifling quarrels between kinsfolk. The following ceremonies serve to recall the religious functions that he (Ysekh) formerly exercised: a. At the time of the spring festival, which bears a strictly clan character, they bring to him, first of all, a large wooden vessel ( Choron ) containing kumiss; he pronounces a prayer of thanks to the gods and then pours the kumiss upon the fire. b. At the time of the arrival of the betrothed at the bridegroom’s yurt, they take from the sleigh of the betrothed, and place upon a table in front of the fire place the boiled head of a horse, whose eyes are covered with butter, to whose ears are attached intestines filled with horse’s blood, and a wooden cup filled with butter. After this the betrothed enters the yurt, and stands, having first untied her girdle, on the right side of the komelok [RCH: i. e., the fireplace] where she is met by the oldest kinsman, whose place is sometimes taken nowadays by the most honored guest, who, kneeling, throws into the fire 41 pieces of meat, blood and butter, and blesses the bride. For the completion of this ceremony, whose obvious object is to unite the bride with the bridegroom’s home, the oldest kinsman secures for his use the head, blood and butter brought into the yurt, and in addition the sum of one ruble.' <sup id="cite_ref-365" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-365">[365]</a></sup>//NOTE: Weddings and nuptials were not coded in the Ritual Database.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ childbirth purification ceremonies ♥</b> Purification ceremonies in general, including ceremonies meant to propitiate spirits, seem to have been performed fairly frequently by the Sakha--at least in the nineteenth century: 'Although parents are responsible for a child while it is growing, it may itself be punished for disrespect towards the spirits. When he has reached maturity, marries, and establishes his own household, he selects a place to build a house, but it has its owner-spirit from whom it is necessary to obtain permission to proceed. When the house, stall, and shelter for cattle are ready, each of these buildings, as well as the new fireplace, has its own “owners” with whom it is important to enter into good relations. To procure food and clothing for the family it is necessary to hunt in the woods and to fish in the lakes, but forests and waters have their own owners, without whose permission one cannot use the utilities they supervise. That the family may have adequate provision, the cattle must propagate, and for this, corresponding spirits must be propitiated. For the cattle, one needs to store hay, but grass grows in places belonging to particular owners. While traveling, a man passes the possessions of different owners, who must be conciliated with gifts or appropriate prayers. Thus, we see a well organized system in the relations of man to the circle of spirits. However, a closer investigation shows the system to consist of heterogeneous elements.' <sup id="cite_ref-401" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-401">[401]</a></sup>//As an example of this type of ritual, customs surrounding childbirth will be coded here--they are particularly well-documented.  'The choom of the woman who gave birth to a child was regarded as impure. Only three people were allowed to reside in it: the mother herself, a midwife, and a third woman who kept up the fire in the fire place, prepared food, and washed the dishes; all this had to be done by the third woman, for the midwife, like the mother, was considered impure and was not supposed to touch the fire until the navel cord fell off the child's belly. Women who brought foodstuffs, or came to ask about the health of the mother, were not allowed to enter the choom and conversed and handed over what they brought through the open door.' <sup id="cite_ref-402" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-402">[402]</a></sup>//After childbirth, purification ceremonies and feasts were held: 'The mother was given the best kind of diet, consisting of doughnuts (sushki), toasted white bread and meat of the fat deer calf. If the mother was unmarried her father would ask that a deer be provided by the person responsible for the birth of the child&nbsp;: Let him, would say the father on such occasions, send food for his child. The duties of the father of an illegitimate child was confined to only providing such food. On the third day after the birth of the child the sent deer would be slaughtered in the presence of assembled guests and a feast would be held on the same day the mother got up from her couch, and a ceremony of purification would take place to honor the occasion. The midwife cleansed the mother, the child, the servant and herself, and all things which either of them touched, with the smoking juniper or the light tar of a tree, which, for this purpose, had been placed into a ladle filled with hot coal.' <sup id="cite_ref-403" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-403">[403]</a></sup>//Childbirth rituals are not covered in the Ritual Database; accordingly, the codes follow the eHRAF material gathered so far.</dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Shamanistic Healing Ritual ♥</b> Shamans cured sickness and cast out malevolent spirits: 'Vitashevsky gives a vivid description of a performance at which he was present. 1 He came too late to see its initiation, called oloxxo oloror (on the seat he is seated) and, he understood, at this point the shaman’s voice and the drum beats should be weak and almost listless. When he entered the earth hut the shaman was sitting on a small bank in its eastern corner, so that he had to pass between him and the fireplace. The shaman wore his shamanistic coat and his assistant dried the hut master’s drum by the fire. The shaman asked for a tobacco pipe. He inhaled the smoke several times and asked for the drum and stick which were given to him. He rose, walked a few steps, and jerking his shoulders and head up and down, he tried to beat the drum, but rejected it because it was wet. He asked that his own drum be dried. This was done very quickly. Evidently his drum was already dry. Now began the second or preliminary stage, called mäñniyär and sürgüyar 2 when the shaman searched for the direction in which to locate [Page 121] the evil spirit that captured the sick man’s soul. And, indeed, at times he stopped beating and gazed into the distance. In the beginning of the act the shaman beat the drum slightly and sang in a low voice, but gradually his voice and the drum beatings rose to a climax and the shaman turned his face to the southern window of the hut. The act lasted from fifteen to twenty minutes. During the performance the shaman imitated the neighing of a horse and the cry of some bird.//'The third act consisted in inhaling from the sick man the evil spirits causing the illness, and in dispatching them to the south. The shaman had to dispatch four evil spirits. First the shaman sat on the floor behind the fireplace, not far from the entrance, holding in his left hand a jalbyr (see above) which he stretched out in the direction of the patient. Gradually, still in a sitting position, he moved toward the sick man, singing louder and shaking his head more and more. At a distance of about a meter from the sick man he rose from the floor and sat on a bank prepared for him. He continued to cry out his incantations, touching the sick man with his jalbyr . This movement is called jalbiyal . Slowly the shaman rose from the bank and, dropping the jalbyr, bent over the sick man. In a powerful voice he commanded his spirits to fulfil his order and to pass from the patient. He pretended to swallow them in order to dispatch them to their dwelling places. To this end, he ran out to the yard and after dispatching the spirits to the “south” he fainted. He was taken up and carried into the hut, quite exhausted. Then the shaman started for the “upper” world and brought back one of the souls, the kut, of the sick man which had deserted him, having been frightened off by the evil spirits. The shaman looked around to see whether any evil spirit was left near the patient. Once more he pretended to start for the “upper” world and he fainted when he returned to this world. He was revived by his assistant and the shaman sang his last incantation. This was the final act of the performance. Vitashevsky was unable to record the text of the performance for the following reasons: it was almost dark in the hut; in spite of his perfect knowledge of the Yakut language many expressions in the performance were incomprehensible to him; the use of a phonograph to record the text would be prohibited by the shaman or otherwise influence the performance. When Vitashevsky invited the shaman to his hut for an interview the latter declined the invitation, saying that a shamanistic performance was too serious a subject for futile curiosity. The shaman, learning of Vitashevsky’s presence during his performance, said that it would fail to benefit the sick man. Sieroszevski refers in his [Page 122] book on the Yakut 1 to a shamanistic incantation, but other students of the Yakut criticized the authenticity of his text. I was more successful with Yukaghir and Tungus shamans. For a remuneration they recited their incantations in my phonograph and also dictated to me in order that I might be able to compare the two versions. In my work on the Yukaghir 2 I gave the Yukaghir text of a shamanistic performance on the Yassachnaya River. But the shaman himself, whose mother was a Yakut woman, originally recited the text in Yakut, which appeared in the Russian edition of my Yukaghir texts published by the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1900 (p. 118).' <sup id="cite_ref-436" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-436">[436]</a></sup>//Sauer also provides a description of a shamanistic healing performance: '“When a sick Socha sends for a shaman to appease the wrath of the evil spirits that torment him, the sorcerer takes a switch, ties a few hairs from the mane of a horse to the end of it, walks and jumps about the sick person, waves his switch, and conjures the demons to appear and relate the cause of their tormenting him, and how they are to be appeased. After some time has passed in this invocation, he starts, pretends to see the spirits, and, listening to their admonition for some time, turns to the patient, and tells him whence the spirits came; that it was with a view of destroying him, but that they might be induced to accept as a sacrifice, instead of him, a fat mare or a cow, mentioning the particular colour. This is immediately procured; for whoever has one answering the description readily gives it. The offering being procured, the shaman dresses himself in full form, walks with his switch to the possessed, embrances him, and commands the demons to leave him; then, rising in great agitation, he suddenly springs upon the offering, raving and shouting as much as he possibly can: the beast now starting, and being restless, is a proof of the pain that it endures from the demon. The following morning the sacrifice is led to the place appointed, which is always on a rising ground at the entrance into a wood. Four poles are driven into the ground, on which they erect a stage covered with twigs, wheron the offering is slain and skinned. The flesh is dressed and eaten on the spot; the bones collected, wrapped up in the twigs that were on the scaffold, put inside the skin of the animal, and stuck at the top of some tree on the spot: if the sacrifice was to the aërial spirits, the head is directed upwards; if to the spirits of the pit, the head is looking downwards. The sorcerer then, arrayed in his magic robes, takes his tambour, and begins his formal spells; beating his tambour, raving, jumping, and using an unintelligible jargon in the most extravagant manner; his long hair hanging over his face, he conjures the spirit of the sacrifice to its demons, and the demons to their proper place of retirement; seems, several times during his incantations, to faint, during which paroxysms he receives the inspired power of prognosticating the fate of the diseased, and the day either of his restoration to health, or of his death. If 121 he prove mistaken, it is not regarded as arising from want of skill, but the unacceptableness of the sacrifice, which is occasionally renewed till he dies or recovers. If a shaman acquaints any family that some demon is intent on inflicting a punishment, offerings are made to avert the evil; not of live beasts, but the rich skins of animals, which are hung up in a conspicuous part of the hut, and buried with the owner when he dies.”' <sup id="cite_ref-437" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-437">[437]</a></sup>.</dd>

</p><p>Note: Until at least the 19th century, lineage councils were the primary 'administrative' bodies on the local level: 'Kinship and politics were mixed in the hierarchical council system that guided AQA-USA, AIMAK, and DZHON. Yakut explanations of DZHON in the nineteenth century included concepts like "people," "community," or "tribe," territorially defined. Councils were composed of ranked circles of elders, usually men, whose leaders, TOYONS, were called nobles by Russians. A lineage head was BIS-USA-TOYON; respected warriors and hunters were BATYR. Lineage councils decided major economic issues, interfamily disputes, and questions of blood revenge for violence committed against the group. AIMAK and DZHON councils were infrequent, dealing with issues of security, revenge, alliance, and, before Russian control, war. Through war, slaves were captured for service in the wealthiest TOYON households. Kin-based councils were rare by the nineteenth century and had little influence on twentieth-century politics.' <sup id="cite_ref-489" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-489">[489]</a></sup> 'Key kin relations are based on a patrilineage (AQA-USA) that traces membership back nine generations. Within this, children born to a specific mother are distinguished as a group (YE-USA), and may form the basis for different households (KORGON). Historically, more distant kin were recognized on two levels, the AIMAK (or territorial NASLEG), with one to thirty lineages, and the DZHON (or territorial ULUS), composed of several AIMAK. These larger units were united by alliances, including for common defense, alliances, and by economic relations; these links were renewed at councils and festivals.' <sup id="cite_ref-490" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-490">[490]</a></sup> 'Prophets' and other elders dominated most councils: 'According to tradition, the seseny played no minor role in assemblies in the past.  The word sesen comes from the same root as the verb sesenibin - I advise, I think, I predict. Legend portrayes the seseny as  white-haired, honored, experienced elders.' <sup id="cite_ref-491" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-491">[491]</a></sup> 'This dignity was neither elective nor hereditary, but not every old man was considered to be a sesen.  For  this he had to have a special gift of prophecy - in other words: an acknowledged intellect, experience, and knowledge.  In difficult moments the heroes of olongo frequently turn to such advice-giving, honored, light-eyed Old Men-Talkers.' <sup id="cite_ref-492" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-492">[492]</a></sup> 'In the past we did not decide anything without sesen.  (Namsk Ulus, 1888).  I will note that in this testimony sesen is used in the sense of sorcerer.  The sesen decided disputed questions on the basis of custom, and gave advice when the clan was undergoing hard times.  At ysyakh, before the games and contests  began, the sesen of each clan or clan union would look over their own wrestlers; and they would remove those who were not good enough, who had recently sinned with a woman, who did not restrain themselves sufficiently in eating and drinking, so that they would not bring  shame to their own people. They found all this out by feeling the body of the wrestlers, and by looking into their eyes and face. (Namsk Ulus, 1891).  In the Bayagantaysk Ulus, when I asked who had named the rivers, hills, and other natural features, they answered: It must be the sesen - the old, ancient men, who knew everything!  (Bayagantaysk Ulus, 1885).' <sup id="cite_ref-493" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-493">[493]</a></sup> Sesens were often from the toyon class: 'Since within the clan many sesen were at the same time toen, i.e., the representatives of separate groups, they wielded enormous influencein clan councils. Usually in legends they  are simply called old men - ogonior.' <sup id="cite_ref-494" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-494">[494]</a></sup> Clan unions and tribal units also held council: 'They wielded less importance in councils of clan unions: there the first place was held by the heads of the clans, bis' usa toeno.' <sup id="cite_ref-495" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-495">[495]</a></sup> The Russian administration reinforced kin-based hierarchies and superimposed a supratribal structure onto the Sakha system: 'The system of tsarist administration was no different here from what existed in any other part of Northern Siberia. The Dolgans, Yakuts and Evenks had to pay the fur-tax as “natives” and formed “clans” headed by princelings, while the tundra peasants were forced to pay a poll tax, were formed into a “community” and headed by an elder. People living many hundreds of kilometers away from the nearest centers were economically dependent on the merchants who monopolized supplies to the region, bought up all the furs, and cruelly exploited the population.' <sup id="cite_ref-496" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-496">[496]</a></sup> 'If they have claims against their subordinate clansmen, the clan-chiefs bring complaints: 1.  The headman--to the nasleg princelings and clan elders.  If unsatisfied with their decision, or in case of noncompliance, they may complain to the authorities. 2.  The princelings--first, to the clan elders in their jurisdiction, and in the case of noncompliance or dissatisfaction with their decision, to the ulus headmen, and finally, to the authorities. 3.  The clansmen among themselves--to the clan elders and nasleg princelings, and in the case of noncompliance to the ulus headman; and finally to the authorities.' <sup id="cite_ref-497" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-497">[497]</a></sup> Sakha leaders cooperated with Russian imperial administrators, collecting taxes for them and contributing to the establishment of the emerging postal system in Siberia: 'Most Yakut, however, remained in the central meadowlands, sometimes assimilating Russians. Yakut leaders cooperated with Russian commanders and governors, becoming active in trade, fur-tax collection, transport, and the postal system. Fighting among Yakut communities decreased, although horse rustling and occasional anti-Russian violence continued.' <sup id="cite_ref-498" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-498">[498]</a></sup> Due to the complexities of this situation, some of the below variables might not apply to the Sakha.

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from military ♣ absent ♥</b> Sakha warriors and spies fought for their clans and tribes: 'Yakut warriors ( säpi, säpi kisita ) were usually mounted horsemen ( minjär ), but there were also foot soldiers ( sat[unknown]ykisita ). Their weapons ( säp ) consisted of a light bent bow ( s[unknown]a ), a quiver ( käsäx, s[unknown]adax ), and arrows ( aya ) .' <sup id="cite_ref-499" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-499">[499]</a></sup> 'These warriors formed a chain of movable, vigilant pickets around the settlements. In case of war they formed the kernel of the fighting detachment -- sari  Some of the bolder ones went to find their fortune, dzhol.  They would go far into unknown territory, among foreigners, either by themselves or with companions.  Such detachments would not take their cattle with them and often traveled on foot.  They made their living exclusively by hunting, fishing, and looting. The Yakut kept these habits for a long time, until very recently. Khudiakov has a legend about Khaptagay-batyr and his son Khokhoe-batyr, and their three khosun: Sappy, Yngkabyl, and Batagyyan, who roamed about in the seventeen forties, during the time of Pavlutskii, in the north of the Yakutsk Oblast.  In the Kolymsk Okrug (1882), I wrote down a legend about the two Yakut brothers who were the first to make their way into the kolymsk Krai. Their names have been forgotten.  In the Namsk Ulus I was told a legend about the Vilyuysk Yakut Tangas-Boltongo who also wandered by himself somewhere in the little-known, remote regions of the Vilyuysk Okrug. He was called a bagatyr, just as the old epic heroes.  Apparently he lived in the beginning of the present century; this is indicated by the name of a Yakut hunter of the Namsk Ulus, Betyunsk Nasleg, Chaky clan, whom he encountered: his name was Soldat.  Soldiers appeared  in the Yakutsk Oblast only in the last century, at the time of the Kamchatka campaigns of Pavlutskii.  Then Middendorf mentions solitary Yakut hunters whom he encountered far from their native tribes in the mountains of the Amur Basin. Such bold fellows served their clans as a sort of voluntary spies, searching out new pastures suitable for settlement in case some sort of unpleasantness or inconvenience should arise in the homeland. They brought back word of new lands, of the peoples they had encountered, the details of the route, and the obstacles involved. Sometimes the clan would choose such people out of their own number and deliberately send them out on a searching party. The tales The Golden Eagle and the Teal, and The Flying Winged Creatures hint at this.  These were chosen people and were also called bagatyr, baatyr, batyr, or batur; strictly speaking in the Yakut language this word means valorous, exceptionallymanly, bold, strong, and clever. But these people did not have any special rights in the clan besides the usual rights gained through personal superiority.' <sup id="cite_ref-500" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-500">[500]</a></sup> Military operations were lead by war-leaders, who formed a military aristocracy based on heredity and personal military success: 'Just as now, common matters were managed by the clan assembly.  Matters of war and minor legal cases, which demanded quick settlement without any delays, were managed by a war leader -- toen -- acknowledged by the rest of the people. According to the Yakut this service was hereditary, on the strength of their belief that an eaglet is always an eagle; a young crow is always a crow.  But this hereditary right was not strictly followed. Thus, the heir of the Borogon toen, Legey, was not his son, but a foreign adopted son who had been bought for money.  Another saga relates,  with full consciousness of the legality of such a matter, that the Tungus chose as their toen a Yakut, Khaptagay-batyr, because of his valor. The sago says: No Lamut (Tungus), no matter who, will kill you.  Now you be our lord (toen).  If a Lamut will not obey your word, let there be a sin upon him.   The toen always had in addition the title of bagatyr (valorous) and in the popular conception his traits of character had to correspond with those demanded of a hero.  But he would not wander by himself, nor look for adventures, but would always live where the clan was and only leave in time of war, at the head of the mounted and armed detachment.' <sup id="cite_ref-501" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-501">[501]</a></sup> 'We can judge how large these unions sometimes were by the fact that in 1634  600 Yakut warriors under the leadership of prince Mymak took part in a battle on the right bank of the Lena, in which the army of ataman  Galkin was crushed and all his horses were lost.' <sup id="cite_ref-502" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-502">[502]</a></sup> 'At this period, however, the clan-tribal structure was already in a state of decomposition. The tribes and clans were headed by the military aristocracy-the toyons. These possessed large herds of cattle and employed the labor of slaves and dependent fellow clansmen on their farms; they were also the military leaders. Heading detachments of armed servants and junior fellow clansmen, the toyons raided each other’s territory, and frequently looted the farms of the free members of the community, seizing their cattle and destroying their economic independence. These toyon wars and raids were one of the factors which speeded up the decomposition of the clan commune. The ruined members of the commune were reduced to the status of “balyksyts” (poor people without cattle, or fishermen), or else became the indentured slaves of the toyons. Most of the slaves (kuluts or bokans) originated in this way.' <sup id="cite_ref-503" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-503">[503]</a></sup> We need to confirm whether any Yakut warriors joined the Russian military at the time. Accordingly the code may be in need of re-evaluation.</dd>

Pripuzov gathered his material among the Yakuts living in the Yakutsk district, i. e., in the midst of that part of the Yakut tribe among whom we may rightly expect to encounter some traces of the action of Russian customary and legislative norms upon the customary law of the Yakuts. All the more interest attaches to the norms of the Yakut customary law noted by the compiler, which, despite the long association of the Yakuts with the Russians, have survived as a valuable vestige of the ancient familial-clan foundations. But no less interest attaches to certain juridical customs, communicated by the compiler, which have been worked out by the Yakuts under the obvious influence of the Russians; the structure of Yakut life is changing its aspect; the new conditions of life which are coming to birth demand new norms for their satisfaction. The latter are sometimes borrowed from Russian neighbors, come into contradiction with the bases of the ancient life and undergo certain changes under the influence of the archaic views on legal relations.' <sup id="cite_ref-504" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-504">[504]</a></sup> But Sakha trials were based on prior agreements between the contending parties rather than codified law: 'Agreements and contracts, both written and oral, are taken as a basis for all trials and settlements; therefore, if there is no quarrel about the contents of an agreement, the decision is quick, but if anyone refuses to abide by an agreement, and it was oral, his opponent may prove it with witnesses, and, if there are no witnesses, the quarrel is decided by an oath.' <sup id="cite_ref-505" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-505">[505]</a></sup> '“As a nation they are unsocial, litigious, and vindictive. An injury received by one of them is very rarely forgotten, and, if he cannot revenge it himself, he will leave the feud to his son. Their passion for litigation is excessive: they will frequently undertake difficult and expensive journeys, in a cause where perhaps the matter in dispute is not of the value of a rouble. Their unsocial dispo-sition, which leads them to prefer settling by single families at a distance from each other, is strikingly contrasted with the cheerful and ready hospitality which they show to strangers. They very seldom settle in communities, and it is only along the route from Jakuzk to the Aldan, where the country is more populous, that such settlements are now and then to be met with; but beyond the Werchojansk chain, the solitary  jurti  are often hundreds of wersts apart, so that the nearest neighbours may not see each other for years. Such distances are far greater than can be required on account of pasture, and are rather to be ascribed to the disposition which leads them to seek solitude, and to avoid all social intercourse.”' <sup id="cite_ref-506" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-506">[506]</a></sup> Clan elders fulfilled judicial, but also ceremonial and other duties: 'The oldest kinsman in the clan, or the  [unknown]iye-[unknown]usa , is always heaped with honors, if he is both rich and has never been put on trial. To him pertains the jurisdiction in trifling quarrels between kinsfolk. The following ceremonies serve to recall the religious functions that he (Ysekh) formerly exercised a. At the time of the spring festival, which bears a strictly clan character, they bring to him, first of all, a large wooden vessel ( Choron ) containing kumiss; he pronounces a prayer of thanks to the gods and then pours the kumiss upon the fire. b. At the time of the arrival of the betrothed at the bridegroom’s yurt, they take from the sleigh of the betrothed, and place upon a table in front of the fire place the boiled head of a horse, whose eyes are covered with butter, to whose ears are attached intestines filled with horse’s blood, and a wooden cup filled with butter. After this the betrothed enters the yurt, and stands, having first untied her girdle, on the right side of the  komelok  [RCH: i. e., the fireplace] where she is met by the oldest kinsman, whose place is sometimes taken nowadays by the most honored guest, who, kneeling, throws into the fire  pieces of meat, blood and butter, and blesses the bride. For the completion of this ceremony, whose obvious object is to unite the bride with the bridegroom’s home, the oldest kinsman secures for his use the head, blood and butter brought into the yurt, and in addition the sum of one ruble.' <sup id="cite_ref-507" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-507">[507]</a></sup> Clans handled offences and litigation in assemblies of elders: 'I shall end this survey of Yakut clan institutions and their self-government by a note about Yakut legal  procedure. Strictly speaking the Yakut court is the assembly: the clan, nasleg, or ulus assembly, depending on the circumstances. These courts are under each other's jurisdiction as courts of appeal. The Yakut enjoy waging law suits against each other and witnessing court proceedings. More important matters are always handed over to the assembly.  At the assembly the wealthy people usually put in their comments, which  areheard attentively, and although the final judgement is pronounced by the chairman of the assembly, he usually simply transmits a condensed form of the general opinion. The ligitants stand before the presiding clansmen with their heads bare, and, frequently nodding their heads and, while making the most important points, making deep bows from the waist, each in turn expound their case. Witnesses are called forth and interrogated on the spot, while unruly witnesses are brought by policemen. The judges always have to sit.  In some localities it is customary  for the judges to wear caps on their head.' <sup id="cite_ref-508" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-508">[508]</a></sup> Sakha assemblies relied on witnesses and oaths: '4.  When a complaint is brought, the defendant is summoned and if he admits the claim against him to be just, a decision is made, and if not, witnesses are summoned by the nasleg corporals, who are paid by the petitioner for the service.  At the end of the case,  the petitioner gets this payment back, along with other losses, from the defendant if the latter is convicted.  If he is not convicted and the petition proves unjust, these losses are imposed on the petitioner as a penalty. 5.  Converted witnesses are questioned under an oath made before an image of God.  After they have kissed the image, they briefly declare that they will tell the genuine truth about what is asked them, and, if not, that they will incur the wrath of God and be deprived of His blessings, etc.  Priests are not required to make this oath. 6.  Unconverted witnesses are administered an oath in which they bow to a fire and swear that they will be deprived of God's blessings, etc., if they give false testimony. 7.  Claims and disputes to which there are no witnesses are decided by an oath administered in the manner described above.  If both the plaintiff and the defendant wish to take it, the oath is usually given to the defendant. 8.  Important and complex claims, such as those concerning big thefts, disputed places, etc., are settled on the basis of instructions given on June 30, 1728 by the ambassador plenipotentiary to China, Count Ragunzinskiy, to the frontier guards Firsov and Mikhalev,;  the clan-chiefs of the nasleg in which the affair took place invite the clan-chiefs of the neighboring naslegs, six men in all, whose unanimous decision ends the case;  there is no appeal.  Although this is called an intermediary trial, the name is wrong, since the plaintiffs do not take part in inviting the clan-chiefs of the neighboring naslegs.' <sup id="cite_ref-509" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-509">[509]</a></sup> Sauer describes the oaths of unconverted witnesses: 'A magician [RCH:  i.e.,  the shaman] places his tambour and dress before the fire, the embers of which are burning. The accused stands before it, facing the sun, and says: ‘May I lose during my life all that man holds dear and desirable [...]' The magician throws butter on the hot embers; the man accused must then step over the tambour and dress, advance to the fire, and swallow some of the exhaling smoke from the butter; then, looking to the sun, say, ‘If I have sworn false, deprive me‘of the light and heat.’ Some of the tribes close the ceremony by making the accused bite the head of a bear; because they allow this beast to have more than human wisdom, and suppose that some bear will kill the aggressor.”' <sup id="cite_ref-510" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-510">[510]</a></sup> Criminal cases were transferred to courts applying Russian law only after 1889: 'Nevertheless until very r ecently and even criminal cases such as beatings, personal injury, and thefts, even for a considerable amount, as long as a house was not broken into, were judged by the clan administration.  Only from the year 1889, when an order came out to proceed against the trible authorities  if they did not communicate such matters, have thefts begun to be referred to the Russian courts and judged according to Russian laws. For theft the Yakut usually punished wealthy people by a fine which was two or three times the value of the stolen article, depending on the circumstances. For beatings and personal injuries they sentenced the guilty party to support the injured party during his disablement or to pay him a lump sum.  Now the guilty are put in prison, and to the great horror of their neighbors they usually leave out and out scoundrels.  Such crimes as the violation of women, the breaking of agreements, fraud, and forgery were apparently unknown to the Yakut and went unpunished. But the violation of the wedding agreement was provided for by the kalym. At the present time most of the cases and statements of claim which come before the clan administrations concern the violation of boundary lines and various disputed lands.' <sup id="cite_ref-511" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-511">[511]</a></sup> Clerical courts occasionally prosecuted polygamy prior to that date: 'Such polygamy, which is tolerated for the above reasons, and which has existed since ancient times and does not do any harm, had not become bad in the judgement of the Yakut, and no regulations for the abolition of this custom have been set up by the Yakut.  However, since the Yakut adopted the Christian faith, and as they have become enlightened by strict surveillance and sometimes by indulgent reprimands from the eparchial priests, it has been gradually dying out, but nevertheless denunciations on this subject are made concerning people who have lawfully wedded wives but keep the others, and people who had several wives before conversion and married one of them in church without leaving the others, who were left at home with their children;  in the case of such a denunciation the local authorities, on the grounds of the repugnance of the Christian religion for this custom, pressed formal charges, and the guilty parties were handed over to the clerical court as fornicators, and the cases were decided according to general state laws, which constituted and still constitute and extreme burden for the Yakut.' <sup id="cite_ref-512" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-512">[512]</a></sup> Sieroszewski's material on punishment seems to refer to Sakha assemblies rather than Russian courts: 'In 1867, according to official data, 1870 cases were judged in the upravas in the vicinity of Yakutsk:  out of the total, 1855 concerned land disputes; in the Vilyuysk Okrug, out of 3786 cases, more than half had to do with land. Besides levying fines the Yakut also punish a guilty party by reprimanding him publicly,  before the assembly, by sending him on some job, or putting him into solitary confinement.  The latter is apparently a Russian innovation.  Punishment with birch-rods was quite unknown to the Yakut in the past. Even now they have recourse to this very rarely and with great distaste.  In the north they did not even know  what this was like, and once, in the Kolymsk Ulus, when the assembly did not known what to do with one of its disobedient members and decided, on the advice of some Yakut who had come from the south, to flog him, they turned to me with questions: where should we beat him?, and do we have to lay him down and undress him or is that not permitted? (Kolymsk Ulus, Undzha, 1883).  Usually the influence of the commune is quite sufficient to exert necessary compulsion.  In the south, where the  ties of the commune have weakened, we find disobedient people whose cattle are taken away as a punishment,  or who are forced to obey.  Many decisions of the clan assemblies astonished me by their strangeness, but once I looked closer into their life and made thorough inquiries into their motives I always found at the bottom a deep respect for the individual and a striving toward equality.  Naturally I say nothing about those decisions which are demonstrably incorrect, and not in accord with custom and the conscience of the people, but which they have been forced to make because of the economic pressure of unscrupulous rich people or because of administrative arbitrariness.' <sup id="cite_ref-513" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-513">[513]</a></sup> Accordingly, Sakha systems of dispute resolution co-existed with the institutions of the expanding Russian state.</dd></dl>

<p><b>♠ State-level administrators ♣ present ♥</b> The early invaders imposed tribute in furs on the Sakha population after successful military expeditions: 'By 1620 a report had reached Tobolsk from the Mangaseya Cossacks of the Great (Lena) River and the Lena Yakut. In 1631 they descended by the Viliui River, a tributary of the Lena, to the Lena River and imposed tribute on the adjacent Yakut. In 1632 a party of Cossacks under the command of the Boyar’s son, Shakov, took tribute in sables from a clan of Viliui horse-breeding Yakut. The Viliui River farther up from its mouth was occupied by Tungus only. The northern boundary of the distribution of the Yakut at that time was the mouth of the Viliui. The whole Lena Valley from the mouth of the Viliui River to the south, at a distance of about 500 kilometers (or 710 miles) was occupied by Yakut. In their possession were also all the Lena islands of that region, rich in  pasture lands. There is no definite information as to how far inland they penetrated at that period. We may admit, however, that the Yakut, being horse and cattle breeders, were hardly inclined to move into the dense forests far from the majority of their tribesmen, i.e., far from the Lena Valley. In the beginning of the seventeenth century the Yakut abode on the western banks of the Lena must have been the territory of the two present  uluses  of Yakutsk District, Namskij and Western Kangalassky. There, according to Yakut traditions, was the first place of refuge of their mythical forefather, the “Tatar” Elliei. From there a part of his nearest descendants could also have emigrated over the Lena islands to the eastern banks of the Lena River, where excellent pastures are as abundant as on the western banks.' <sup id="cite_ref-514" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-514">[514]</a></sup> 'We have previously noted (see p. 64) that the Yakut were subjugated by two different Cossack parties from Mangasey aand Yeniseisk. The Olekminsk fortress on the Lena River was erected in 1630 when only Tungus lived in the region. In 1637 a Cossack party, under the command of Busa, collected tribute in furs from the Yakut of the Yana River.' <sup id="cite_ref-515" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-515">[515]</a></sup> The czarist administration imposed taxes and established an administrative infrastructure: 'The system of tsarist administration was no different here from what existed in any other part of Northern Siberia. The Dolgans, Yakuts and Evenks had to pay the fur-tax as “natives” and formed “clans” headed by princelings, while the tundra peasants were forced to pay a poll tax, were formed into a “community” and headed by an elder. People living many hundreds of kilometers away from the nearest centers were economically dependent on the merchants who monopolized supplies to the region, bought up all the furs, and cruelly exploited the population.' <sup id="cite_ref-516" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-516">[516]</a></sup> 'The committee of Cherkashennikov which worked in the Yakutsk Oblast was only a branch of this All-Siberian commission.

In the seventeenth century Yakutsk was the center of a great independent country directly subordinate to Moscow, although for some specific questions it was dependent on the governors of Tobolsk. In the time of Peter the Great, Yakutsk entered into the newly organized Siberian Goubernyia (government) and with the division of the Siberian government into provinces was included in Irkutsk Province. In 1775 Irkutsk Province was organized into a government and the Yakut country formed one of the provinces of the new government. In 1783 the government was again reorganized into a vice-royalty composed of four provinces, one of which was Yakutsk Province. In 1797 the vice-royalty was abolished and the government restored. In [Page 225] 1805 under the Emperor Alexander I, the Yakut country was made a separate province dependent upon Irkutsk. In 1852 the Yakut country was given a separate governor. After the revolution in February, 1917, a commissar was appointed by the Provisional Government.' <sup id="cite_ref-519" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-519">[519]</a></sup> Sieroszewski reports corruption and exploitation of the Yakut population by administrators: 'The government undertook to regulate the distribution of Yakut land, [Page 764] partly to cease the disorders which arose as a result of this a nd partly to as sure and regulate the taking of yassak, which was being gathered with unbelievable arbitrariness and accompanied by terrible ill use, was stolen, substituted for, and hidden, and they stole from the Great Tsars by putting far too little in the treasury and by undervaluing the yassak greatly, and they impoverished the yassak-paying people and robbed the taxes and injured them.' <sup id="cite_ref-520" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-520">[520]</a></sup> In addition to Russian officials, land-holding toyons also doubled as officials in their districts: 'The population was also divided into three or four classes: the toyon households belonged to the first class, and received a first-class plot, the middle households were usually assigned to the second class and the poorer people to the third and fourth classes, each receiving the corresponding clan plot. Thus, the system itself gave the toyons plots of land which were three or four times larger than those of the poorer people. It is true that in return for this the toyons had somewhat greater obligations, but the difference in their extent was extremely small. However, this inequality was by no means the only thing. The toyons actually possessed much more land, having seized it in a variety of different ways. For example, they had several plots, rather than just one, by registering them in the names of their children, workers and so on. It was also the custom to give officials (who were more often than not themselves toyons) additional plots of land, so-called [...] (from the Russian word “ukaz” [edict]), for which, incidentally, there was no payment. The influential toyons also obtained extra plots called ugayy (or kharyy).  Furthermore, the toyons frequently enjoyed the right of possessing larger plots, sometimes through inheritance, cleared from the forest or formed at the site of a drained lake. The leasing of land was also common.' <sup id="cite_ref-521" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-521">[521]</a></sup>

In [Page 225] 1805 under the Emperor Alexander I, the Yakut country was made a separate province dependent upon Irkutsk. In 1852 the Yakut country was given a separate governor. After the revolution in February, 1917, a commissar was appointed by the Provisional Government.' <sup id="cite_ref-527" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-527">[527]</a></sup> Sieroszewski reports corruption and exploitation of the Yakut population by administrators: 'The government undertook to regulate the distribution of Yakut land, [Page 764] partly to cease the disorders which arose as a result of this a nd partly to as sure and regulate the taking of yassak, which was being gathered with unbelievable arbitrariness and accompanied by terrible ill use, was stolen, substituted for, and hidden, and they stole from the Great Tsars by putting far too little in the treasury and by undervaluing the yassak greatly, and they impoverished the yassak-paying people and robbed the taxes and injured them.' <sup id="cite_ref-528" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-528">[528]</a></sup> In addition to Russian officials, land-holding toyons also doubled as officials in their districts: 'The population was also divided into three or four classes: the toyon households belonged to the first class, and received a first-class plot, the middle households were usually assigned to the second class and the poorer people to the third and fourth classes, each receiving the corresponding clan plot. Thus, the system itself gave the toyons plots of land which were three or four times larger than those of the poorer people. It is true that in return for this the toyons had somewhat greater obligations, but the difference in their extent was extremely small. However, this inequality was by no means the only thing. The toyons actually possessed much more land, having seized it in a variety of different ways. For example, they had several plots, rather than just one, by registering them in the names of their children, workers and so on. It was also the custom to give officials (who were more often than not themselves toyons) additional plots of land, so-called [...] (from the Russian word “ukaz” [edict]), for which, incidentally, there was no payment. The influential toyons also obtained extra plots called ugayy (or kharyy).  Furthermore, the toyons frequently enjoyed the right of possessing larger plots, sometimes through inheritance, cleared from the forest or formed at the site of a drained lake. The leasing of land was also common.' <sup id="cite_ref-529" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-529">[529]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Multiple legal systems ♣ present ♥</b> During the Russian period, some Russian legal concepts were adopted by the Sakha: 'N. P. Pripuzov gathered his material among the Yakuts living in the Yakutsk district, i. e., in the midst of that part of the Yakut tribe among whom we may rightly expect to encounter some traces of the action of Russian customary and legislative norms upon the customary law of the Yakuts. All the more interest attaches to the norms of the Yakut customary law noted by the compiler, which, despite the long association of the Yakuts with the Russians, have survived as a valuable vestige of the ancient familial-clan foundations. But no less interest attaches to certain juridical customs, communicated by the compiler, which have been worked out by the Yakuts under the obvious influence of the Russians; the structure of Yakut life is changing its aspect; the new conditions of life which are coming to birth demand new norms for their satisfaction. The latter are sometimes borrowed from Russian neighbors, come into contradiction with the bases of the ancient life and undergo certain changes under the influence of the archaic views on legal relations.' <sup id="cite_ref-530" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-530">[530]</a></sup> But Sakha trials were based on prior agreements between the contending parties rather than codified law: 'Agreements and contracts, both written and oral, are taken as a basis for all trials and settlements; therefore, if there is no quarrel about the contents of an agreement, the decision is quick, but if anyone refuses to abide by an agreement, and it was oral, his opponent may prove it with witnesses, and, if there are no witnesses, the quarrel is decided by an oath.' <sup id="cite_ref-531" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-531">[531]</a></sup> '“As a nation they are unsocial, litigious, and vindictive. An injury received by one of them is very rarely forgotten, and, if he cannot revenge it himself, he will leave the feud to his son. Their passion for litigation is excessive: they will frequently undertake difficult and expensive journeys, in a cause where perhaps the matter in dispute is not of the value of a rouble. Their unsocial dispo-sition, which leads them to prefer settling by single families at a distance from each other, is strikingly contrasted with the cheerful and ready hospitality which they show to strangers. They very seldom settle in communities, and it is only along the route from Jakuzk to the Aldan, where the country is more populous, that such settlements are now and then to be met with; but beyond the Werchojansk chain, the solitary  jurti  are often hundreds of wersts apart, so that the nearest neighbours may not see each other for years. Such distances are far greater than can be required on account of pasture, and are rather to be ascribed to the disposition which leads them to seek solitude, and to avoid all social intercourse.”' <sup id="cite_ref-532" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-532">[532]</a></sup> Clan elders fulfilled judicial, but also ceremonial and other duties: 'The oldest kinsman in the clan, or the  [unknown]iye-[unknown]usa , is always heaped with honors, if he is both rich and has never been put on trial. To him pertains the jurisdiction in trifling quarrels between kinsfolk. The following ceremonies serve to recall the religious functions that he (Ysekh) formerly exercised a. At the time of the spring festival, which bears a strictly clan character, they bring to him, first of all, a large wooden vessel ( Choron ) containing kumiss; he pronounces a prayer of thanks to the gods and then pours the kumiss upon the fire. b. At the time of the arrival of the betrothed at the bridegroom’s yurt, they take from the sleigh of the betrothed, and place upon a table in front of the fire place the boiled head of a horse, whose eyes are covered with butter, to whose ears are attached intestines filled with horse’s blood, and a wooden cup filled with butter. After this the betrothed enters the yurt, and stands, having first untied her girdle, on the right side of the  komelok  [RCH: i. e., the fireplace] where she is met by the oldest kinsman, whose place is sometimes taken nowadays by the most honored guest, who, kneeling, throws into the fire  pieces of meat, blood and butter, and blesses the bride. For the completion of this ceremony, whose obvious object is to unite the bride with the bridegroom’s home, the oldest kinsman secures for his use the head, blood and butter brought into the yurt, and in addition the sum of one ruble.' <sup id="cite_ref-533" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-533">[533]</a></sup> Clans handled offences and litigation in assemblies of elders: 'I shall end this survey of Yakut clan institutions and their self-government by a note about Yakut legal  procedure. Strictly speaking the Yakut court is the assembly: the clan, nasleg, or ulus assembly, depending on the circumstances. These courts are under each other's jurisdiction as courts of appeal. The Yakut enjoy waging law suits against each other and witnessing court proceedings. More important matters are always handed over to the assembly.  At the assembly the wealthy people usually put in their comments, which  areheard attentively, and although the final judgement is pronounced by the chairman of the assembly, he usually simply transmits a condensed form of the general opinion. The ligitants stand before the presiding clansmen with their heads bare, and, frequently nodding their heads and, while making the most important points, making deep bows from the waist, each in turn expound their case. Witnesses are called forth and interrogated on the spot, while unruly witnesses are brought by policemen. The judges always have to sit.  In some localities it is customary  for the judges to wear caps on their head.' <sup id="cite_ref-534" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-534">[534]</a></sup> Sakha assemblies relied on witnesses and oaths: '4.  When a complaint is brought, the defendant is summoned and if he admits the claim against him to be just, a decision is made, and if not, witnesses are summoned by the nasleg corporals, who are paid by the petitioner for the service.  At the end of the case,  the petitioner gets this payment back, along with other losses, from the defendant if the latter is convicted.  If he is not convicted and the petition proves unjust, these losses are imposed on the petitioner as a penalty. 5.  Converted witnesses are questioned under an oath made before an image of God.  After they have kissed the image, they briefly declare that they will tell the genuine truth about what is asked them, and, if not, that they will incur the wrath of God and be deprived of His blessings, etc.  Priests are not required to make this oath. 6.  Unconverted witnesses are administered an oath in which they bow to a fire and swear that they will be deprived of God's blessings, etc., if they give false testimony. 7.  Claims and disputes to which there are no witnesses are decided by an oath administered in the manner described above.  If both the plaintiff and the defendant wish to take it, the oath is usually given to the defendant. 8.  Important and complex claims, such as those concerning big thefts, disputed places, etc., are settled on the basis of instructions given on June 30, 1728 by the ambassador plenipotentiary to China, Count Ragunzinskiy, to the frontier guards Firsov and Mikhalev,;  the clan-chiefs of the nasleg in which the affair took place invite the clan-chiefs of the neighboring naslegs, six men in all, whose unanimous decision ends the case;  there is no appeal.  Although this is called an intermediary trial, the name is wrong, since the plaintiffs do not take part in inviting the clan-chiefs of the neighboring naslegs.' <sup id="cite_ref-535" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-535">[535]</a></sup> Sauer describes the oaths of unconverted witnesses: 'A magician [RCH:  i.e.,  the shaman] places his tambour and dress before the fire, the embers of which are burning. The accused stands before it, facing the sun, and says: ‘May I lose during my life all that man holds dear and desirable [...]' The magician throws butter on the hot embers; the man accused must then step over the tambour and dress, advance to the fire, and swallow some of the exhaling smoke from the butter; then, looking to the sun, say, ‘If I have sworn false, deprive me‘of the light and heat.’ Some of the tribes close the ceremony by making the accused bite the head of a bear; because they allow this beast to have more than human wisdom, and suppose that some bear will kill the aggressor.”' <sup id="cite_ref-536" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-536">[536]</a></sup> Criminal cases were transferred to courts applying Russian law only after 1889: 'Nevertheless until very r ecently and even criminal cases such as beatings, personal injury, and thefts, even for a considerable amount, as long as a house was not broken into, were judged by the clan administration.  Only from the year 1889, when an order came out to proceed against the trible authorities  if they did not communicate such matters, have thefts begun to be referred to the Russian courts and judged according to Russian laws. For theft the Yakut usually punished wealthy people by a fine which was two or three times the value of the stolen article, depending on the circumstances. For beatings and personal injuries they sentenced the guilty party to support the injured party during his disablement or to pay him a lump sum.  Now the guilty are put in prison, and to the great horror of their neighbors they usually leave out and out scoundrels.  Such crimes as the violation of women, the breaking of agreements, fraud, and forgery were apparently unknown to the Yakut and went unpunished. But the violation of the wedding agreement was provided for by the kalym. At the present time most of the cases and statements of claim which come before the clan administrations concern the violation of boundary lines and various disputed lands.' <sup id="cite_ref-537" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-537">[537]</a></sup> Clerical courts occasionally prosecuted polygamy prior to that date: 'Such polygamy, which is tolerated for the above reasons, and which has existed since ancient times and does not do any harm, had not become bad in the judgement of the Yakut, and no regulations for the abolition of this custom have been set up by the Yakut.  However, since the Yakut adopted the Christian faith, and as they have become enlightened by strict surveillance and sometimes by indulgent reprimands from the eparchial priests, it has been gradually dying out, but nevertheless denunciations on this subject are made concerning people who have lawfully wedded wives but keep the others, and people who had several wives before conversion and married one of them in church without leaving the others, who were left at home with their children;  in the case of such a denunciation the local authorities, on the grounds of the repugnance of the Christian religion for this custom, pressed formal charges, and the guilty parties were handed over to the clerical court as fornicators, and the cases were decided according to general state laws, which constituted and still constitute and extreme burden for the Yakut.' <sup id="cite_ref-538" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-538">[538]</a></sup> Sieroszewski's material on punishment seems to refer to Yakut assemblies rather than Russian courts: 'In 1867, according to official data, 1870 cases were judged in the upravas in the vicinity of Yakutsk:  out of the total, 1855 concerned land disputes; in the Vilyuysk Okrug, out of 3786 cases, more than half had to do with land. Besides levying fines the Yakut also punish a guilty party by reprimanding him publicly,  before the assembly, by sending him on some job, or putting him into solitary confinement.  The latter is apparently a Russian innovation.  Punishment with birch-rods was quite unknown to the Yakut in the past. Even now they have recourse to this very rarely and with great distaste.  In the north they did not even know  what this was like, and once, in the Kolymsk Ulus, when the assembly did not known what to do with one of its disobedient members and decided, on the advice of some Yakut who had come from the south, to flog him, they turned to me with questions: where should we beat him?, and do we have to lay him down and undress him or is that not permitted? (Kolymsk Ulus, Undzha, 1883).  Usually the influence of the commune is quite sufficient to exert necessary compulsion.  In the south, where the  ties of the commune have weakened, we find disobedient people whose cattle are taken away as a punishment,  or who are forced to obey.  Many decisions of the clan assemblies astonished me by their strangeness, but once I looked closer into their life and made thorough inquiries into their motives I always found at the bottom a deep respect for the individual and a striving toward equality.  Naturally I say nothing about those decisions which are demonstrably incorrect, and not in accord with custom and the conscience of the people, but which they have been forced to make because of the economic pressure of unscrupulous rich people or because of administrative arbitrariness.' <sup id="cite_ref-539" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-539">[539]</a></sup> Accordingly, Sakha systems of dispute resolution co-existed with the institutions of the expanding Russian state.

Naturally I say nothing about those decisions which are demonstrably incorrect, and not in accord with custom and the conscience of the people, but which they have been forced to make because of the economic pressure of unscrupulous rich people or because of administrative arbitrariness.' <sup id="cite_ref-549" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-549">[549]</a></sup> Accordingly, Sakha systems of dispute resolution co-existed with the institutions of the expanding Russian state.

<p><b>♠ Private property (land) ♣ present ♥</b> As the Sakha were traditionally pastoralists, the below sections mostly refer to livestock rather than land per se. Sakha society was organized in patrilineages: 'Key kin relations are based on a patrilineage (AQA-USA) that traces membership back nine generations. Within this, children born to a specific mother are distinguished as a group (YE-USA), and may form the basis for different households (KORGON). Historically, more distant kin were recognized on two levels, the AIMAK (or territorial NASLEG), with one to thirty lineages, and the DZHON (or territorial ULUS), composed of several AIMAK. These larger units were united by alliances, including for common defense, alliances, and by economic relations; these links were renewed at councils and festivals.' <sup id="cite_ref-550" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-550">[550]</a></sup> 'Kin terms reflect gender and age distinctions, and distinguish senior from junior paternal lines.

Animal or land sale and inheritance was approved by elders. But by the twentieth century, smaller families were keeping resources, in part because of the decline of large horse droves. Men owned most of the wealth, and passed it to sons, especially elder sons, although the youngest son often inherited the family yurt. Mothers could pass on dowries to daughters, unless the dowry was forfeited by bad behavior. In theory, dowries included land, as well as goods, jewelry, and animals, although in practice elders rarely gave land to another lineage. Soviet law limited inheritance to goods and nonstate housing could be bequeathed at individual discretion. Most apartments and summer houses were kept in families.' <sup id="cite_ref-552" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-552">[552]</a></sup> Accordingly, women's property and inheritance rights were limited, although  their legal status improved in the Russian period: 'The property rights of women are extremely limited; however, even in this direction certain changes are taking place under the influence of the gradual recognition of woman’s capacity.

<dd><b>♠ Lease ♣ present ♥</b> Debt obligations were covered by 'interest' payments. Livestock was used as security: 'Debt obligations are protected by the security or deposit of cattle. The lender obtains in the manner of a reward either a present of two percent of the sum of the debt. A debt incurred under the influence of deceit or in an intoxicated condition is not considered valid. Even if the eldest in the family incurred it, the family can demand the nullification of the obligation. Card debts are also considered invalid, no matter whether the loser was drunk or sober at the time of playing. A defaulting debtor is condemned by the elders not only to pay the debt, but also to pay the interest on the debt which has accumulated between the term of payment and the time of judicial proceedings, as well as the expenses borne by the creditor in entering the action. In trifling cases the elders are content 64 to satisfy the debt by taking from the defaulting debtor his excess clothing.' <sup id="cite_ref-560" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-560">[560]</a></sup> Wealthy househelds used to lend livestock to poor ones for upkeep, and failure to comply with agreed upon arrangements was punished: 'Up to the present time there has existed the custom of rich men lending reindeer “gratis” to poor men, which cannot help leading to cases of open or hidden exploitation. Usually in the autumn the nearby poor men descend on a rich person and take reindeer from him for their needs for a month, for two months, or until spring, depending on the understanding; and if the borrowed reindeer is killed by a wolf or dies of a disease, the poor man does not have to make good the loss, but merely brings the hide from the reindeer’s leg to the owner. An especially favorable environment for exploitation is formed when reindeer are lent to a poor man to import government loads: in this case the rich man gives the poor man several extra reindeer in order that the poor man may import the alloted load on them, and for this labor the latter is not repaid in any way, but the money for transporting the goods goes to the owner of the reindeer. The advantage of such an arrangement becomes clear when one realizes that under this system the rich man does not have to hire draymen at his own expense.' <sup id="cite_ref-561" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-561">[561]</a></sup> '1. Among the financial obligations of the Yakut, the most important and necessary, both for the rich and poor, is the maintenance of animals, because it gives the former a chance to increase their herds, and the latter a means of subsistence and of paying taxes and duties. This the rich, including Russians of various ranks, give a certain number of animals to poor Yakut and to Yakut of moderate means: from ten to 40 head to one family for one year, from May to May of the following year, for a payment which is fixed and agreed upon [Page 26] mutually; for instance, a person who takes 20 head of cattle is paid 20 rubles in cash for feeding this number of cattle, four milch cows, figuring their milk at 10 to 15 rubles, which is not counted in the amount for maintaining the cattle, one bull for harnessing, figuring the “body” for him at three to five rubles; for this amount, and sometimes more, the keeper, called the cattleman, must pasture the animals in the summer and the winter give them hay which he has prepared on his lands, so as to return them stout and healthy in the spring. The milk from the dun-colored cows, excluding those given him to feed, he must deliver to the owner in October in the form of butter and sour milk; he must guard the animals 238 from death or loss; and, in case he does lose any, or they are stolen or die for any reason, he must pay for them in kind or in money, except in case of infection or natural disease, or in case the thief makes the payment.' <sup id="cite_ref-562" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-562">[562]</a></sup> '2.

<p><b>♠ Other property ownership ♣ present ♥</b> Brides brought dowry into the marriage: 'The deer with the exception of those received by the wife as a present from her relatives ( nyadzhyma ), or from the guests ( yallaty taba ), or those harnessed to her narta or to the nartas loaded [Page 41] with her things (plates, garments and small objects used in domestic life), were regarded as the property of the husband. Excepted were also the deer which the children received as a present from their relatives. The contents of the sleighs given in dowry, including plates, animal skins, and money were regarded as the property of the wife. This property could be used by the woman at her own discretion. Some husbands tried to hinder such independent use of her property by the wife, but such conduct was regarded as a violation of the local law. The woman had also the right to spend at her own discretion the money received by her from the sale of the property that belonged to her. The Dolgani believed that the deer included in the dowry brought in luck, and in some families no such deer would be sold in the course of three years. Various members of the family--the wife, the sons, and the daughters could own their own pasti traps. This ownership was, however, but a fiction, since all the polar foxes caught in the traps were regarded as the property of the father. The fiction of ownership is to be explained by the following belief: when for a long time no animals would be caught in the pasti, the father of the family, who was their real owner, thought that the cause of this poor hunting was the departure of his luck, but that the animals may still be caught by the luck possessed by some of the other members of the family. Acting on this belief the father would then make a nominal distribution of his pasti among the members of his family. When a daughter got married such pastis, which were only her nominal property, were retained by the father.' <sup id="cite_ref-575" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-575">[575]</a></sup> 'When the widow married a fellow clansman the property of her dead husband remained with her. On the other hand, if she married into an alien clan, she would be left with a small share, while the rest of the dead husband's property would be retained by the latter's clan. This arrangement was based on the view that a tranfer of property to an alien clan should not be permitted ( bay omukka barara tyukteri ).' <sup id="cite_ref-576" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-576">[576]</a></sup> As mentioned above, pastoralists herded and owned livestock, including cattle, horses and reindeer: 'The reindeer, which is an object of private property, is marked by each owner with a particular sign called the belie. The most reliable markings are considered to be figures made by making cuts in the ears of the animal, without making any distinction between the right and left ear; these ear cuts have different appellations depending on their form [Fig. 17]. Independently of the markings on the ears, the natives cut signs with a knife in the form of different combinations of lines in the hair on the sides of the reindeer [Fig. 18]. They do this in the month of the spring sunrise, after the polar night--the time of severe cold--has passed, in order that the reindeer may not get frostbitten in the places where the hair has been cut off. The signs of ownership are the same both for bucks and for mares. Cult signs, as among the Tavgi, are not found among the Dolgan. When the children of a family grow up and are given part of the reindeer herd for their own, the old markings are left on the grown reindeer, and the new markings are put only on the offspring. The youngest son, who is the last in line to receive the family wealth, receives his father’s markings by inheritance. The markings of the husband are put on reindeer which are received as part of a dowry. When an owner buys another reindeer he cuts his own markings into its ears, and one may often see reindeer with several markings in their ears. It must be added that when an owner has a large herd not all the reindeer are marked with the signs of ownership. The Dolgan have an amazing ability [Facing 198: Figure 16 on an unpaginated insert] 199 to recognize their own reindeer even after several years have passed, and even when the reindeer were only calves when last seen. Rich reindeer breeders often have more reindeer in their herds than they can count, but if they see one of their own reindeer in someone else’s herd they recognize it at once, even if it has no markings; at the same time they are unable to say which [Page 19] reindeer are missing in their own herds. We tried to find out how this was done, but even the Dolgan themselves could not explain it, but only said that it was so simple because the eye “gets used to” one’s own reindeer. [Fig. 17] If a strange reindeer attaches himself to a herd the owner of the herd passes the word along and supports the reindeer until its owner is found.' <sup id="cite_ref-577" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-577">[577]</a></sup> However, their treatment as private property may be of recent origin: 'It must be concluded that the custom of regarding reindeer as private property did not arise so long ago--perhaps even after the Russians came--which can be seen from the following: 1) in summer the reindeer owned by a rich man are treated as a food supply for the whole nomadic group in case of insufficiency of wild animals and birds; in such cases the reindeer are killed without any compensation for the owner; 2) the fact that it is only within the last few decades that the reindeer has become an object of merchandise. These questions are considered in greater detail in our work on the Dolgan clan, and for this reason we shall not dwell on them here.' <sup id="cite_ref-578" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-578">[578]</a></sup> Men and women also owned household goods (see above).

A part of the property is set aside for the support and subsistence of the daughters, the remainder is divided between the relations with the closer relations securing a larger part (the father gets more than the rest), while the more distant relatives get a lesser share. A married daughter, like the unmarried daughters, is excluded form sharing in the paternal inheritance: in any case, she cannot inherit her father’s cultivated land, and if there are no direct heirs, the farm passes to the closest relations.' <sup id="cite_ref-586" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-586">[586]</a></sup> 'The brothers, excluding their sisters from inheritance of the paternal property, are nevertheless obliged to support their unmarried sisters, to concern themselves with giving them in marriage, and to provide them with dowries from the general property. Mr. Priklonski, however, (Tri goda v[unknown] IAkutskoi oblasti [three years in the Yakutsk territory]. Zhiva[unknown]ia Starina, 1890, pt. 3, p. 80). notes that the share of the daughters in the division of property upon the death of the father is equal to that of the brothers; this share goes to the brothers, for the support of the sisters.' <sup id="cite_ref-587" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-587">[587]</a></sup> 'That in effect it is the economic principle, in union with the blood principle, and not the fact of the grant of a dowry to a girl entering into marriage, that lies at the basis of the exclusion of women from the paternal inheritance, is demonstrated by the fact that the dowry itself does not in any way correspond to the shares which fall to the lot of the sons upon the death of the father. Mr. Pripuzov unfortunately communicates only extremely fragmentary and incomplete information concerning the size of the dowry, concerning the objects which go to make it up, and concerning the relation of the personal property of the girl, accumulated by her own labor, to the dowry given by her parents at the time of marriage.' <sup id="cite_ref-588" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-588">[588]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Monogamy ♣ present ♥</b> Sakha society was organized in patrilineages: 'Key kin relations are based on a patrilineage (AQA-USA) that traces membership back nine generations. Within this, children born to a specific mother are distinguished as a group (YE-USA), and may form the basis for different households (KORGON). Historically, more distant kin were recognized on two levels, the AIMAK (or territorial NASLEG), with one to thirty lineages, and the DZHON (or territorial ULUS), composed of several AIMAK. These larger units were united by alliances, including for common defense, alliances, and by economic relations; these links were renewed at councils and festivals.' <sup id="cite_ref-589" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-589">[589]</a></sup> 'Kin terms reflect gender and age distinctions, and distinguish senior from junior paternal lines. Any relation, affinal or consanguineal, is called URU, which is the word for wedding.' <sup id="cite_ref-590" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-590">[590]</a></sup> eHRAF provides a general description of the marriage system. While polygyny was practiced, monogamy was more common: 'Traditionally, for wealthy Yakut, marriage could be polygamous. More common, however, was monogamy, with occasional remarriage after the death of a spouse. Arranged marriages were sometimes politically motivated. Patrilineage exogamy was reckoned strictly; those one could marry were called SYGAN. Until the 1920s many marriage arrangements were complicated and protracted, involving financial, emotional, and symbolic resources of the bride's and groom's extended families. This included the matchmaking ritual; several formal payments of animals, furs, and meat to the bride's family; informal gifts; and extensive dowries. Some families permitted poor grooms to work in their households as a replacement for the bride-price. Occasionally bride-capture occurred (it may have been more common in pre-Russian times). Wedding ceremonies and their attendant feasts, prayers, and dancing, were held first at the household of the bride's parents, then at that of the groom's. The couple usually lived or settled in a nearby yurt. Since the 1970s interest in limited aspects of ritual and gift exchange has revived, although few couples are paired through matchmakers. In the 1980s one young man was chagrined to find that a woman he had fallen in love with on a train was a distant cousin, a forbidden marriage partner according to kin rules still observed.' <sup id="cite_ref-591" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-591">[591]</a></sup> 'Polygamy has existed since ancient times among many of the Yakut; however, a man never had more than five wives at a time. The reasons for this are as follows: 1) the Yakut promise their children in marriage at an early age, and the children, by the time they are of age, have ceased to love one another, and therefore the husband takes a second wife; 2) if a man lives with his wife for several years without having any children, he takes a second and a third merely in order to have children; 3) the rich Yakut had many wives to supervise their houses and cattle, which they usually had in many places, for the wives ran their estates more diligently than outside hired men; thus the farm is improved and the estate is guarded; 4) if they leave their wives, even those whom they have married in church, because of some bad behavior or because they are permanently delirious, or rendered completely incapable of taking care of house and cattle as a result of some disease which deprived them of sight, speech, arms, and legs, since the Yakut leave the whole house and cattle-raising to the wife's care, they take other wives and leave the former one's in their houses; 5) various other circumstances induce the Yakut to practise polygamy; the principle reason is the desire to have good supervision of the households and an increase of the cattle; 6) having had several 221 wives before conversion, and having married one in church after conversion but without abandoning the others, the Yakut will keep them in his [Page 15] houses with their children, and some without children because they are sterile. Such polygamy, which is tolerated for the above reasons, and which has existed since ancient times and does not do any harm, had not become bad in the judgement of the Yakut, and no regulations for the abolition of this custom have been set up by the Yakut. However, since the Yakut adopted the Christian faith, and as they have become enlightened by strict surveillance and sometimes by indulgent reprimands from the eparchial priests, it has been gradually dying out, but nevertheless denunciations on this subject are made concerning people who have lawfully wedded wives but keep the others, and people who had several wives before conversion and married one of them in church without leaving the others, who were left at home with their children; in the case of such a denunciation the local authorities, on the grounds of the repugnance of the Christian religion for this custom, pressed formal charges, and the guilty parties were handed over to the clerical court as fornicators, and the cases were decided according to general state laws, which constituted and still constitute and extreme burden for the Yakut.' <sup id="cite_ref-592" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-592">[592]</a></sup> Exogamy was the norm, and the sources mention bride-price and dowry arrangements: 'To the end of the eighteenth century, there remained in vogue among the Yakut the custom of concession of wives. Formerly the bridegroom lived permanently in the house of his father-in-law, but in more recent times he lived there only for a definite period.' <sup id="cite_ref-593" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-593">[593]</a></sup> 'The kalym, or bride-price, replaced the system of marriage by capture. The origin of the kalym may be seen in the simulated enmity of the mother-in-law and the son-in-law.' <sup id="cite_ref-594" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-594">[594]</a></sup> 'A matriarchal system presupposes looseness of sex relations. The chastity of girls in rich families is not a question of morality but of kalym . The kalym for a widow or a girl who has had children is low. In the case of a widow, the belief in the right of the deceased husband may limit the number of wooers. A girl with a child, however, is sometimes preferred as a guaranty against barrenness which the Yakut dislike. In Yakut tales, the guest does not ask, “Where shall I sleep?”, but, “Where do you put your guests?” and then they are shown to the beds of the girls. This is a form of hospitable hetaerism.' <sup id="cite_ref-595" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-595">[595]</a></sup> 'The Yakut look for brides for their sons not only outside of their clans ( us, nasleg ), but outside of the ulus, or union of clans. A girl, say the Yakut, is really a lot of aliens. This saying is reminiscent of the old time marriage by capture. Marriage is now also exogamic, but kalym (brideprice) is given in money, cattle, and other goods. Practically, the kalym may be regarded as an exchange of presents. What the parents of the bride receive from the parents of the bridegroom is almost equivalent to what they give her when she leaves their house. Often the bride carries with her cattle and goods of a greater value than her parents received that she may not be reproached by the bridegroom’s relatives for bringing only a small dowry with her. The young bride remains under the protection of her clan and family. Many common law customs regulate disagreements and dissensions: If a young woman leaves her husband because she dislikes him, her dowry remains with him; but, if she accuses him of cruelties, relatives on both sides decide the matter. The Yakut do not like to appeal to the Russian courts.' <sup id="cite_ref-596" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-596">[596]</a></sup> 'The Yakut were warlike and blood vengeance between clans occurred very often, but reconciliation was often sought through payment of a ransom or by giving a girl in marriage, the best way to end hostilities. It was more difficult to compound assassinations within the clan. To kill the murderer would deprive the clan of another member and the punishment had to take the form of ransom, service, or public disapproval.' <sup id="cite_ref-597" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-597">[597]</a></sup> Sieroszewski describes these payments: 'If we analyse the component parts of the kalym and their names and designations we see that this expense is always the essential part of the payment for a bride. The amount of the kalym aries greatly, between several rubles and several hundred rubles. Sometimes it is even as much as one and one-half or two thousand rubles. Usually the amount is somewhere around the mean between these figures - that is, one hundred rubles. Most families would not have the means to pay so large an amount were it not for the fact that most of it is returned in the form of a dowry.' <sup id="cite_ref-598" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-598">[598]</a></sup> 'According to custom only the kurum, hat is, the part that goes for hospitality, and other minor additions for the same purpose, [Page 857] are paid by the bridegroom without return. The payment given to the bride's parents, sulu, and the presents given to the relatives and match-makers, tyunngyur-khodogoy kesite, is afterwards given back in the form of a dowry, enne, and presents, 546 torkyut. Since the bridegroom usually assumes his conjungal rights immediately after the festivities, if he dies the kurum is never given back, but only half of the sulu, if this has been paid. The amounts of various parts of the kalym are strictly 547 determined by the agreement, [Page 858 is blank] [Page 859] kil'tegan. It also varies greatly in different localities, and depends on the force of the ancient customs, and the prosperity and way of life of the inhabitants. Even in the same locality it differs for each wedded couple, depending on the affluence of their parents, their stinginess or generosity and their attachment to their children.' <sup id="cite_ref-599" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-599">[599]</a></sup> 'The Yakut maintain that in older days the kalym was bigger, and I have noticed that it is infact larger in less cultured localities, where the ancient customs are still strong. Thus the amount of cattle exchanged and killed at weddings in the Kolymsk and Verkhoyansk uluses or in remote uluses of the Yakutsk Okrug is a considerably greater part of the total property of those who are getting married that in more cultured localities, near a city or in the south, despite the fact that there is more cattle in the south. In the latter uluses we notice a tendency to convert the larger part of the kalym into money, and to replace the meat offered as hospitality with flour, butter, and vodka, for which no norms and rules have been worked out. This allows this part of the expense to be decreased unnoticably. Nowhere, however, has the kalym disappeared, and poor people will often slaughter their only cow or mare for a wedding, as the bridegroom's present, so that the parents only had to give around ten rubles in money as payment for the bride, sulu. In the meantime, it is their duty to dress the bride and give her at least a few household utensils. To be sure, there are people who give their daughter very little or nothing at all even though they have received a considerable kalym.' <sup id="cite_ref-600" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-600">[600]</a></sup> 'However, such cases are rare. They are either a result of the sudden impoverishment of a heretofore rich family or a consequence of a bridegroom's particular passion for a girl, which her parents notice and which they never miss a chance to profit by.' <sup id="cite_ref-601" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-601">[601]</a></sup> 'Popular opinion condemns such behavior. Nevertheless I have seen very respected and even loving fathers who sucked all they could get from their sons-in-law when they visited their brides, still living 548 at home. Parents never give their daughters to their husbands immediately after the wedding. This is the custom, and parents also give as an excuse either that they must prepare the dowry, or that their daughter is unaccustomed to marriage, or that she is too young, and so forth; this is true even if they have been married and the kalym has been paid, or the agreement has been made to pay it immediately. In the old days this state sometimes lasted for four or five years, and still earlier the Yakut had the custom to marry their children when they were very young. During this time the bridegroom visits his bride at his leisure and must bring her a present each time he does so - a thigh piece or two of meat, a fox, or some other present, as payment for being allowed to exercise his conjungal rights. More than once I have heard fathers order this thing or that - sometimes a great deal. The son-in-law obediently heard him out, but grumbled once out of sight and carried out only part of the promise. Often all this is a burdensome addition to the conditions agreed upon when the match was arranged.' <sup id="cite_ref-602" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-602">[602]</a></sup> 'When that time comes, and the bride brings less to the house than was expected, the bridegroom's relatives greet her very coldly. If the dowry is less than the amount agreed upon lawsuits and hostility [Page 861] begin. Often a complete break in relations takes place, if the marriage had not been sanctified in church. In the latter case the young bride is forced to remain in her bridegroom's home, but must suffer all sorts of nagging and persecution on the part of the family which absolutely poison her existence. I know of several cases when this persecution drove young women to flight or suicide. This is why Yakut who love their daughters try to give them as large a dowry as possible, so that her husband, father-in-law, and mother-in-law would respect her. (Kolymsk Ulus, 1883; Namsk Ulus, 1891). It is also easy to understand why parents try in every way possible to make their daughters' dowries appear larger than they actually are, just as the bridegroom's family tries to exaggerate the size of the kalym they have paid.' <sup id="cite_ref-603" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-603">[603]</a></sup> Samokvasov also provides a summary: 'When the Yakut marry, they give an agreed number of living and slaughtered cattle, and sometimes money, in installments, which is called kalym, for the wife. To compensate this loss, the bride's parents or her relatives who have arranged the match, give as a 222 dowry cattle, clothing, and sometimes money, for half of the whole agreed kalym. The wife cannot bring a dowry worth less than half the kalym, and to bring more, sometimes exceeding the whole kalym (which very rarely happens) is a matter for the discretion of her parents. Besides this, the bridegroom gives cattle to the bride's relatives at the wedding--or money, or animal skins. For these gifts, his wife, for a certain time, when she visits those relatives with presents for them, receives gifts herself, no less than ten head of cattle from each, or three times the value of the original gifts and the presents which she took with her. The excess of these gifts over the original gifts and presents is included in the compensation for the kalym. Therefore, in case of a rupture of the marriage, the wife or her relatives return the kalym to the husband, minus the dowry and the excess of the gifts; from which it follows that the Yakut wife possesses no property, unless she brought a dowry larger than the kalym, and unless she receives an award from her relatives or others after her marriage. Suits concerning kalyms have various causes, of which [Page 16] the main ones are the following: 1) Having lives several years with her husband, a wife suddenly leaves him on the grounds that he does not have any natural capacity for carnal relations; sometimes this is just, and, in that case, she is judged innocent; however, the kalym is returned, minus offspring and milk, but not until she marries another husband; but if her claim proves to be false, this proves her guilt and the fact that she left her husband because of lack of affectionate disposition to him; therefore, if she does not agree to stay with her husband, she herself, or her relatives pay back the kalym at the time of the divorce, with offspring and milk. 2) At the instigation of other, women marry them, and 223 in such a case, the instigators pay the kalym and all damages and are beaten with rods. 3)A husband abandons his wife: a)because of her dissolute behavior and poor running of the house; b) because of dislike for her, and as very frequently happens, dissoluteness of his own and love for another woman; in cases of this sort, the husband loses the right to demand the kalym. 4) Having taken each other during childhood by the will of the parents, and having no mutual affection, a couple divorce, and the wife's father or the relatives who married her off return half the kalym at the time of the divorce and the other half when she marries another man. 5) If a husband leaves his wife without any compelling reasons, not only does he not get the kalym back but he has to return the clothing and other objects of the dowry; the same right is enjoyed by the wife who leaves her husband because of cruel and mean treatment of her. 6) If a wife leaves her husband without any compelling reasons, her parents or the relatives who married her off must return the whole kalym, with the right of giving her in marriage for a kalym a second time. 7) If a wife's husband dies, the husband's parents do not have the right to give her in marriage again, but she herself, if she does not wish to stay in her husband's house, is free to marry without a kalym. 8) If a bride dies after being promised in marriage but still living at her father's house, and if there she had no sexual relations with the bridegroom, the whole kalym is returned immediately after her death, minus offspring and milk; but if she dies after having had sexual relations, a half-kalym is returned, without offspring or milk; when a widow marries a second time, similarly, the payment is made to the husband's relatives, if he dies after the promising of the bride but before she is taken into the house. 9) After a bride is promised to a bridegroom, after part or sometimes 224 all of the [Page 17] agreed kalym is paid, without any sins on the part of either bride or bridegroom, if the relatives are dissatisfied or if other potential mates are preferred or for various other reasons, and the bride or bridegroom refuses to marry, the bridegroom (if he is the one who refuses) is deprived of all the kalym which he has paid, and the bride (if she refuses) pays the bridegroom the whole kalym which he paid, plus offspring, milk, and other damages, even if she had sexual relations with him. 10) If the bridegroom of a promised bride proves unable to pay all or part of the kalym, then, if there were no carnal relations between the contracting parties, the bride and her relatives are free to refuse to proceed, and they return what he has paid; if there was sexual intercourse, the marriage is cancelled, but the kalym is paid, like an ordinary debt, through earnings, etc. 11) If the husband, after having the bride promised to him and having sexual intercourse with her, leaves her for three years without lawful reasons and does not take her, such a woman is free to marry another without giving back the kalym to the first one. 12) At the time of the wedding both the bride and the groom eat cattle, which is taken into account in case of a divorce, and this loss is paid by the one who is guilty in the divorce case.' <sup id="cite_ref-604" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-604">[604]</a></sup> Endogamy was more common among rich families in the North: 'We have previously mentioned the exogamic character of the Yakut marriages, but some other tendencies have been observed in the northern districts of Yakut Province. The few rich families endeavor to keep their horses, cattle, and grazing places within a certain group of families through marriage of close relatives, insofar as this is permitted by the Russian church. By special permission of a bishop, even cousins are permitted to marry. In one case, known to the author, a man lived with his niece, a marital relation forbidden by the Church, though his neighbors avoided mentioning this irregularity to strangers.' <sup id="cite_ref-605" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-605">[605]</a></sup> Wives/widows generally held fewer rights than men, but their legal status was improved during the Russian period: 'The absence of any rights on the part of woman, among the Yakuts of the district studied by M. Pripuzov, is most marked. . . in the field of property relations. Her personal position is at the present time considerably better protected than in earlier times. In this respect one notes in the life of the Yakuts a definite, although naturally a very relative progress. In effect, even at present, the husband considers himself within his rights to beat up his wife if she neglects her household duties, if she is a spendthrift, or if she is unfaithful to him. The Yakut further has the right to put his wife out to hire as a workwoman, and to use the money earned by her. But he does not have the right to kill her; he cannot sell her, or lend her to someone else.' <sup id="cite_ref-606" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-606">[606]</a></sup> 'The right of the widow in the event of a childless marriage to return to her own family, the right of the husband to arrange before his death for the return of the dowry to his widow--all these rules, it appears, rose under the influence of the progressive softening of views on the personal and property incapacity of women. At an earlier time she was completely the property of her husband’s group. Actually, we have no definite information concerning the existence of the levirate among the Yakuts at a former time; but the rules forbidding women to show themselves before the father-in-law and brothers-in-law, and vice versa, obviously bearing the character of so-called “sexual precaution” are traces of a one-time polyandry; finally, the absence among the Yakuts of any proper term for “widow,” etc. (Sieroszewski, 569), compel us to assume that at a more remote time 48 the widow was considered the personal property of the family of the husband and probably passed to them as a piece of property. ' <sup id="cite_ref-607" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-607">[607]</a></sup> 'Despite the fact that with respect to marriage the sons still are in a position of dependence upon the parents, their situation is considerably freer than that of the girls. A widowed daughter, returning to the parental home, again falls under the authority of the father; she is as devoid of rights as her young unmarried sister. The more independent position of the son is explained chiefly by the fact that the family and the clan prize children of the male sex more highly than those of the female sex: the birth of a boy is greeted by the Yakut with greater joy than the birth of a girl. Yakuts who do not have sons are scorned by their neighbors: they call them khatirik-uoma, i.e. “fire from bark (?).” The small esteem in which girl children are held by the Yakuts is indicated by the rule, whereby 54 a widow who marries for a second time must leave her sons by the first marriage with the family of her husband; but the daughters, as an unnecessary element in the family group, she can take with her to her new family. This rule is obviously of comparativelyrecent origin: it could arise only after the widow became free in general to marry outside of the confines of her husband’s group, and after the kalym had begun to lose its significance of a purchase price for the bride, and had begun to return to the family of the bridegroom in the form of a dowry. Gaining nothing by giving a daughter in marriage, the Yakut familial-household group naturally regards daughters as a completely superfluous element in the family, and sets no value on them.' <sup id="cite_ref-608" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-608">[608]</a></sup> Divorce was practiced in the form of 'ceding' the wife to a lover: 'Instances of the cession of wives to other men, as is known, were encountered among the Yakuts up to the end of the 18th century, while the existence of the custom of lending one’s wife to a guest is substantiated by traditions (Vseso[unknown]iuzone Geograficheskoe ob[unknown]shchestvo, Vostochno-Sibirskii Otdel, Izviest[unknown]iia, XXVI, No. 4-5, pp. 218-19). As concerns instances of putting our wives to work, Prince Kostrov (Ocherk iuridicheskoe byta IAkutov [Juridical Customs of the Yakut]. p. 283) communicates the rather interesting fact that this practice has as its object to effect a separation from the wife: after a church wedding the Yakut rarely leaves his wife, but since such marriages are often consummated against the will of the parties involved, the husband sometimes abandons his wife, who customarily finds herself a lover, to whom she goes to live. In order to avoid prosecution by the authorities, writes Prince Kostrov, the husband and the lover make an oral and sometimes even written agreement to the effect that the former is hiring his wife out to the latter in the capacity of a servant with her consent and for the upkeep of the household.' <sup id="cite_ref-609" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-609">[609]</a></sup></dd>

All participated in hay making, cattle herding, and milking, but, in general, horses were more a male preserve and cattle a female responsibility. Women tended children and fires, prepared food, carried water, and made clothing and pottery. Men handled more strenuous firewood preparation, house building, sled making, hunting, fishing, and mowing. Ivory carving and wood- and metalworking were male tasks.' <sup id="cite_ref-610" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-610">[610]</a></sup> Generally, women were less valued than men: 'Despite the fact that with respect to marriage the sons still are in a position of dependence upon the parents, their situation is considerably freer than that of the girls. A widowed daughter, returning to the parental home, again falls under the authority of the father; she is as devoid of rights as her young unmarried sister.

The unmarried son cannot even ask for a share of the family goods without a particularly valid reason, even if he does not live with his father, for instance, when there is an older son in the family. Only after marriage does the grown-up Yakut step forth as an independent personality. In the question of marriage the authority of the father over the person of his son finds graphic expression. It is true that, in the words of Mr. Pripuzov, in the selection of a bride for the son, or of a bridegroom for the daughter, the consent of the mother carries more weight than that of the father. In this privilege of the women before the man, which, incidentally, is guaranteed by nothing more than moral principles, is contained the only advantage of the wife and mother. But the authority of the father expresses itself above all in the right to give in marriage his under-age son or daughter. The information communicated, for example, by Mr. Shchukin (Zh. M. V. D. [RCH: I have been unable to determine what these initials stand for] 1854, VII, p. 26), that the Yakut himself selects his bride and announces his choice to his parents, is confirmed neither by Mr. Pripuzov nor by other investigators. On the contrary, marriages, or at least betrothals, of under-age children, appear to be very widespread, even at the present time among the Yakuts. “As formerly, so now,” writes Mr. Pripuzov, “the Yakuts marry off young children, for which purpose the parents come to an agreement, determining the bride price, and the children have a church marriage upon coming of age.” 52 On the basis of other sources there is even reason to consider the betrothal of young children almost general among the Yakuts: this is done with the object of easing the payment of the bride price, payment of which, in installments, is begun by the parents of the bridegroom immediately after the conclusion of the agreement. “With the payment of the first installments of the bride price, the child-bridegroom acquires, so to speak conjugal rights with respect to his bride, who herself is still but a child. He is often a guest at the home of his future wife, sleeps with her and, having grown up, becomes her factual husband.” (Vsesoiuznoe Geograficheskoe Obshchestvo, Vostochno-Sibirskii Otdel, Izv[unknown]iesti[unknown]ia, XXVI, No. 4-5, p. 214).' <sup id="cite_ref-612" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-612">[612]</a></sup> Wives/daughters generally held fewer rights than men, but their legal status improved during the Russian period: 'The absence of any rights on the part of woman, among the Yakuts of the district studied by M. Pripuzov, is most marked. . . in the field of property relations. Her personal position is at the present time considerably better protected than in earlier times. In this respect one notes in the life of the Yakuts a definite, although naturally a very relative progress. In effect, even at present, the husband considers himself within his rights to beat up his wife if she neglects her household duties, if she is a spendthrift, or if she is unfaithful to him. The Yakut further has the right to put his wife out to hire as a workwoman, and to use the money earned by her. But he does not have the right to kill her; he cannot sell her, or lend her to someone else.' <sup id="cite_ref-613" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-613">[613]</a></sup> 'Instances of the cession of wives to other men, as is known, were encountered among the Yakuts up to the end of the 18th century, while the existence of the custom of lending one’s wife to a guest is substantiated by traditions (Vseso[unknown]iuzone Geograficheskoe ob[unknown]shchestvo, Vostochno-Sibirskii Otdel, Izviest[unknown]iia, XXVI, No. 4-5, pp. 218-19). As concerns instances of putting our wives to work, Prince Kostrov (Ocherk iuridicheskoe byta IAkutov [Juridical Customs of the Yakut]. p. 283) communicates the rather interesting fact that this practice has as its object to effect a separation from the wife: after a church wedding the Yakut rarely leaves his wife, but since such marriages are often consummated against the will of the parties involved, the husband sometimes abandons his wife, who customarily finds herself a lover, to whom she goes to live. In order to avoid prosecution by the authorities, writes Prince Kostrov, the husband and the lover make an oral and sometimes even written agreement to the effect that the former is hiring his wife out to the latter in the capacity of a servant with her consent and for the upkeep of the household.' <sup id="cite_ref-614" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-614">[614]</a></sup> 'If the husband beat his wife without good reason, from the point of view of the Yakuts, she has the right to complain to the clan government or to apply for protection to the Natives’ Court. The husband is not oblidged to maintain fidelity; he can abandon his wife, live in another place, cohabit with another woman. The wife, on the contrary; must preserve fidelity, although occasional relations with other men, if they take place with the consent of the husband, are regarded by the Yakuts with complete indifference. 43 Although at the present time the personal position of the wife in relation to her husband has changed for the better, in comparison with the past, to her lot, nevertheless, continues to fall the most arduous domestic labor. Except where the family is rich, or the wife is richer than the husband, the duties of the woman include more than the care of the household: the care of the cattle, the making of cheese and butter, the painting of the yurt, and often even the mowing of hay, cutting of wood, etc., if the husband cannot manage the other jobs by himself.' <sup id="cite_ref-615" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-615">[615]</a></sup> But property rights of women remained limited and their support systems were generally weaker: 'The property rights of women are extremely limited; however, even in this direction certain changes are taking place under the influence of the gradual recognition of woman’s capacity. These innovations, however, are apparently only beginning to penetrate the consciousness of the Yakuts, and have not yet succeeded in conclusively changing the archaic views, denying property rights to women.' <sup id="cite_ref-616" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-616">[616]</a></sup> 'In relations to her own family group the woman is completely without rights: she must marry into a strange clan, and it is understandable that her kinsmen look upon her as a severed member.' <sup id="cite_ref-617" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-617">[617]</a></sup> This was largely due to the practice of patrilineal transmission: 'Each clan or familial unit, under the influence of the impulse of self-preservation in the struggle for existence, strives insofar as possible to insure its economic existence through the accumulation of wealth. Naturally, it jealously guards its property against transfer into the hands of members of a strange clan; it is here that we must seek the reason for the fact that women have no rights in relation to the property belonging to their kin group. Among the Yakuts, the latter, as is the case everywhere with peoples on a low level of economic development, permits a girl to accumulate property by her personal labor: the product of her personal exertions, whether sewing or other handicraft, becomes part of her possessions, but among the Yakuts, as is the case everywhere, the girl secures the right of ownership of the products of her labor only in the degree that she performs this labor during her hours of leisure and rest, after having performed the household duties which fall to her share. The same rule, it appears, applies 44 to married women. Woman, as a member of her kin group prior to marriage, and subsequently in the capacity of a worker for her husband and his group, has only a portion of the time for her own use, and the group concedes to her as personal property only what she can produce after satisfying the needs of her father’s or her husband’s family.' <sup id="cite_ref-618" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-618">[618]</a></sup> 'The absence of property rights on the part of women in relation to their kin group in graphically expressed in the exclusion of women from inheritance. If the economic and administrative principle lying at the foundation of the family constructed on a blood basis makes quite natural the rule of Yakut customary law, that sisters cannot inherit from brothers, that upon the death of a brother his cultivated land passes to another brother, although the latter might already have a farmstead, then in the exclusion of women from inheritance from the parents, where only daughters survived, we must see a direct consequence of the clan structure, in which the kinsmen vigilantly watch to see that the clan property does not pass to a strange clan, which inevitably happens in the case of the marriage of a girl-legatee.' <sup id="cite_ref-619" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-619">[619]</a></sup> 'M. Pripuzov informs us that upon the death of a person survived only by daughters, the legatees are in the first place his brothers, i. e., the uncles on the paternal side. Further, if the father of the deceased is alive, then by the general rule of Yakut customary law in the district investigated, which makes the parents the legatees of their children deceased without issue, he secures a larger share of the inheritance than the other relations. Where death takes place without male issue, the situation is the same as if there were no issue at all. Finally, the remaining relations come in for their share of the inheritance. A part of the property is set aside for the support and subsistence of the daughters, the remainder is divided between the relations with the closer relations securing a larger part (the father gets more than the rest), while the more distant relatives get a lesser share. A married daughter, like the unmarried daughters, is excluded form sharing in the paternal inheritance: in any case, she cannot inherit her father’s cultivated land, and if there are no direct heirs, the farm passes to the closest relations.' <sup id="cite_ref-620" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-620">[620]</a></sup> 'The brothers, excluding their sisters from inheritance of the paternal property, are nevertheless obliged to support their unmarried sisters, to concern themselves with giving them in marriage, and to provide them with dowries from the general property. Mr. Priklonski, however, (Tri goda v[unknown] IAkutskoi oblasti [three years in the Yakutsk territory]. Zhiva[unknown]ia Starina, 1890, pt. 3, p. 80). notes that the share of the daughters in the division of property upon the death of the father is equal to that of the brothers; this share goes to the brothers, for the support of the sisters.' <sup id="cite_ref-621" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-621">[621]</a></sup> 'That in effect it is the economic principle, in union with the blood principle, and not the fact of the grant of a dowry to a girl entering into marriage, that lies at the basis of the exclusion of women from the paternal inheritance, is demonstrated by the fact that the dowry itself does not in any way correspond to the shares which fall to the lot of the sons upon the death of the father. Mr. Pripuzov unfortunately communicates only extremely fragmentary and incomplete information concerning the size of the dowry, concerning the objects which go to make it up, and concerning the relation of the personal property of the girl, accumulated by her own labor, to the dowry given by her parents at the time of marriage.' <sup id="cite_ref-622" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-622">[622]</a></sup> 'Neither Mr. Pripuzov, nor, as far as we know, any other investigators of the customary law of the Yakuts, have given us a clear answer to the question as to the relationship in which the personally earned property of the girl stands to her dowry. Is this personal property.. 47 ..combined with the dowry given by the parents, or does it form a separate type of female personal ownership among the Yakuts? We do not know. As concerns the dowry given by the parents at the time of the daughter’s marriage, the absence of rights on the part of the woman in the agnatic group of her husband, as well as the very origin of the dowry in the returned part of the kalym, render completely natural the rule of Yakut customary law, whereby the woman is not the owner of her dowry. The latter, writes Mr. Pripuzov, “is completely at the disposal of the husband.” The husband is the owner of his wife’s dowry; he answers to no one for his squandering of it. A logical consequence of this order of things are the following rules, noted by Mr. Pripuzov, in the Yakutsk district: 1. In the case of the death of the wife the dowry is not returned, but passes to the husband and his children. 2. In the case of the death of the husband, if the couple had no children of the male sex, the wife can take her dowry and return to her parents. But she can only have the dowry back under the condtition that her husband made a disposition in that sense before his death: in its absence, the dowry, as a part of the familial-clan property, passes to the closest relatives of the deceased, and the wife has no right to claim it back from the heirs.' <sup id="cite_ref-623" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-623">[623]</a></sup> Some rights of women, especially widows, were introduced during the Russian period: 'The right of the widow in the event of a childless marriage to return to her own family, the right of the husband to arrange before his death for the return of the dowry to his widow--all these rules, it appears, rose under the influence of the progressive softening of views on the personal and property incapacity of women. At an earlier time she was completely the property of her husband’s group. Actually, we have no definite information concerning the existence of the levirate among the Yakuts at a former time; but the rules forbidding women to show themselves before the father-in-law and brothers-in-law, and vice versa, obviously bearing the character of so-called “sexual precaution” are traces of a one-time polyandry; finally, the absence among the Yakuts of any proper term for “widow,” etc. (Sieroszewski, 569), compel us to assume that at a more remote time 48 the widow was considered the personal property of the family of the husband and probably passed to them as a piece of property. ' <sup id="cite_ref-624" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-624">[624]</a></sup> 'At the present time a widow can remain with her children after the death of her husband. The liberating tendency in favor of women in the development of customary law in the Yakutsk district is reflected in the fact that if a widow has young children of the male sex, she becomes the complete mistress of her husband’s property; she freely disposes of it until the children reach their majority. More archaic views on woman’s rights, however, are reflected in the fact that when the children reach their majority they have the right to proceed to the division of their grandfather’s and father’s property without seeking the consent of their mother. To her is assigned some indefinite part of the property, but always smaller than the share of each of the sons. The right of wives to one-fourth part of their husband’s property, which is attested to in the Sbornik obychnago prava Sibiriskikh inord[unknown]tsev [Compilation of the Customary Law of the Siberian Natives] p. 234. probably was the result of the influence of the Russians, and apparantly found very little reflection in life. The Yakuts of the Yakutsk district, at least, do not know this rule, if we are to judge by the information imparted to us by Mr. Pripuzov. The Yakut clan, permitting a certain economic independence to a widow with young children of the male sex, who are independent members of the clan unit, completely sets aside the widow, if her late husband left only children of the female sex. In such an eventuality, the situation, as we noted above, is held to be the same as if the man had died without issue: a certain part of the property is assigned to the widow with daughters, all the rest goes to the relatives of the deceased. Incidentally, a more humane attitude toward women sometimes induces these relatives to permit the widow and her daughters to live on the farmstead of her deceased husband, depriving her, however, of the right to dispose of the farm. In the event of the death of the widow, 49 (or if she should marry a second time) the farm passes to the relatives of the deceased husband.' <sup id="cite_ref-625" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-625">[625]</a></sup> 'The following rules, conceding certain rights to women, must be considered the result of the new views: 1. The wife has the right to complain against her husband if the latter, by his improvidence, is ruining the household; 2. The wife is conceded the right to contract debts; the wife is not responsible for the debts contracted by her husband for his own personal needs, and conversely the husband is not responsible for the personal debts of his wife. An exception is made when the couple offer surety for each other. These rules stand in such contradiciton to the personal and property incapacity of women that there can be no doubt of their later origin.' <sup id="cite_ref-626" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-626">[626]</a></sup> But women remained in an inferior legal position: 'The facts adduced here testify that despite certain improvements in the attitude toward the personal and property rights of women, the position of the latter is still far from enviable: clan and household bases principally regulate the structure of Yakut life.' <sup id="cite_ref-627" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-627">[627]</a></sup> 'One cannot yet speak of the independence or equal rights of women among the Yakuts: even the rule making the parents the legatees of their children who died without issue, changes its aspect, if the deceased is survived only by a mother; while the father inherits all or the greater part of the property, the rights of the mother or widow to the property of children dead without issue are only equal to the rights of the other heirs.' <sup id="cite_ref-628" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-628">[628]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Social class ♣ ♥</b> Sakha society was organized in patrilineal clans, not social classes: 'Key kin relations are based on a patrilineage (AQA-USA) that traces membership back nine generations. Within this, children born to a specific mother are distinguished as a group (YE-USA), and may form the basis for different households (KORGON). Historically, more distant kin were recognized on two levels, the AIMAK (or territorial NASLEG), with one to thirty lineages, and the DZHON (or territorial ULUS), composed of several AIMAK. These larger units were united by alliances, including for common defense, alliances, and by economic relations; these links were renewed at councils and festivals.' <sup id="cite_ref-629" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-629">[629]</a></sup> 'Kin terms reflect gender and age distinctions, and distinguish senior from junior paternal lines. Any relation, affinal or consanguineal, is called URU, which is the word for wedding.' <sup id="cite_ref-630" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-630">[630]</a></sup> 'By customary law, land, cattle, and horses, although used by households, were controlled by the patriline. Animal or land sale and inheritance was approved by elders. But by the twentieth century, smaller families were keeping resources, in part because of the decline of large horse droves. Men owned most of the wealth, and passed it to sons, especially elder sons, although the youngest son often inherited the family yurt. Mothers could pass on dowries to daughters, unless the dowry was forfeited by bad behavior. In theory, dowries included land, as well as goods, jewelry, and animals, although in practice elders rarely gave land to another lineage. Soviet law limited inheritance to goods and nonstate housing could be bequeathed at individual discretion. Most apartments and summer houses were kept in families.' <sup id="cite_ref-631" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-631">[631]</a></sup> However, wealth stratification was present and Russian imperial authorities co-opted native toyons: 'Precise historical accounts of the Yakuts only date from the time of their first contact with the Russians, that is to say, 1620, and annexation to the Russian State. At that time the Yakuts were not a single political unit, but were divided into a number of independent tribes. Tribal relations were already decomposing, however, and there was a fairly clearly marked class stratification. The tsarist voyevods and soldiery took advantage of the intertribal strife to break the resistance of some of the Yakut population; they also took advantage of the class differences within it by pursuing a policy of systematic support of the ruling aristocratic clique, the princelings (toyons), whom they turned into their own agents for purposes of governing the Yakut district. From that moment on, the class differences among the Yakuts began to become more clearly marked.' <sup id="cite_ref-632" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-632">[632]</a></sup> 'Such, in general terms, was the social structure of the Yakuts by the time the Russians arrived. Tsarist policy between the 17th and 19th centuries speeded up the development of social relations, so that Yakut society just before the October Revolution had already changed very much from what it had been three centuries ago. Nevertheless, many phenomena proved extremely stable and retained their archaic nature until recent times. Just before the Revolution the division of the Yakuts into strata according to the property they possessed was extremely marked. Most of the population did not even have enough cattle for the hunger norm (this norm, when the grade of the livestock was low, was considered to be two head of livestock per person), whereas in the few toyon households there were several dozen head of livestock per person. However, the unequal distribution of the livestock was by no means anything new for the Yakuts. But the question of land was different. The system which had grown up in the domain of land tenure was of comparatively recent origin. Since the arrival of the Russians in Yakutiya, the process of decomposition of the ancient communal-clan system of using the meadowland had been stepped up. The toyons were vigorously seeking to acquire the common lands. The development of private land ownership by the toyons continued to the 1760’s, when certain measures introduced by the Russian administration gave it a new direction. In 1765, Yakuts were forbidden to buy or sell land, and in the next few years, through the activity of the Yakut Tribute Commission, the distribution of land in accordance with the so-called “sable” and “fox” taxes or parts of them was introduced among the Yakuts. Later on, in about 1820, this distribution of land assumed the form of the so-called “class system” of land usage, which legalized the extremely unequal distribution of the land, though, on the surface, it seemed to be something like common land usage. This “class system,” which was later modified, had assumed the following form by the beginning of the 20th century.' <sup id="cite_ref-633" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-633">[633]</a></sup> 'The unit of measurement of land among the Yakuts was the “rick” ([unknown]γ[unknown]γ[unknown]), a plot of land from which one hayrick could be mown (the size of the rick ranged from 10 to 30 cartloads, sometimes as many as 40 or 60). These allotments made up plots ([unknown][unknown][unknown]γ[unknown][unknown]) which were extremely varied in size, depending on the “class,” and there were three or four “classes.” One first-class plot ([unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown] or [unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown] ) was equal to two secondclass plots ([unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown] [unknown][unknown][unknown]γ[unknown][unknown]) and three or four third-class plots (kenniki or [unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown] ). The population was also divided into three or four classes: the toyon households belonged to the first class, and received a first-class plot, the middle households were usually assigned to the second class and the poorer people to the third and fourth classes, each receiving the corresponding clan plot. Thus, the system itself gave the toyons plots of land which were three or four times larger than those of the poorer people. It is true that in return for this the toyons had somewhat greater obligations, but the difference in their extent was extremely small. However, this inequality was by no means the only thing. The toyons actually possessed much more land, having seized it in a variety of different ways. For example, they had several plots, rather than just one, by registering them in the names of their children, workers and so on. It was also the custom to give officials (who were more often than not themselves toyons) additional plots of land, so-called[unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown] -[unknown]γ[unknown]γ[unknown] (from the Russian word “ukaz” [edict]), for which, incidentally, there was no payment. The influential toyons also obtained extra plots called ugayy (or kharyy). [Page 272] Furthermore, the toyons frequently enjoyed the right of possessing larger plots, sometimes through inheritance, cleared from the forest or formed at the site of a drained lake. The leasing of land was also common.' <sup id="cite_ref-634" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-634">[634]</a></sup> 'In the second half of the 19th century the custom of equalizing of the land each year in accordance with the yield of grass came into use. The harvest was evaluated by elected “deputies,” and those whose harvest was poorer than it should have been in view of the plot had the right to an extra quota of hay, and vice versa. This was called bebierke (from the Russian word poverka [adjustment]). But in actual fact this custom did not reduce inequality, for the “deputies” always acted in favor of the more influential (toyon) section of the population, to which they themselves very often belonged.' <sup id="cite_ref-635" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-635">[635]</a></sup> Tokarev describes the system of labour and cattle hire as a form of institutionalized exploitation: 'Generally speaking, the toyons possessed a large proportion of the available land, and the best part, to boot. For example, in 1908 two-thirds of all the land in the First Ospetskiy Nasleg in the Dyupsyunskiy Ulus belonged to five toyon households. In the Suntarskiy Ulus the toyons, who made up only 7% of the total population, possessed approximately half the land. By 1917, 55% of all the usable land was possessed by the rich people. By owning land and livestock the toyons were in a position to exploit the needy masses of the population. The forms that the exploitation took were greatly varied; they included elements characteristic of capitalist relations and the older patriarchal-feudal forms, as well as hidden survivals of slavery. For example, it was the practice to hire laborers—khamnachyts—usually for a definite period, particularly for haymaking; they were hired to carry firewood, build yurts and so on. They were paid either in money or in kind; and the method used was usually the typical Yakut system of payment (remuneration in advance), which was called “to take a contract” from the toyon for this or that work. This system of contracting was very advantageous to the richer people, since they then had complete power over the laborers. In return for a paltry sum received in advance, the poor person was sometimes in the toyon’s clutches for a long time to come.' <sup id="cite_ref-636" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-636">[636]</a></sup> 'The system of contracting was also applied in other cases; advances were paid by the toyons for the supply of a whole variety of products, ranging from butter and hay right down to wild duck eggs. This system was a form of extremely cruel exploitation. One observer (V. F. Troshchanskiy, an exiled member of Narodnaya Volya wrote outright that the “welfare of the population will not be improved as long as this system exists in its present form.”' <sup id="cite_ref-637" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-637">[637]</a></sup> 'Another very common form of exploitation was the handing over of the milch cattle to the poor people by the toyons for their use and for feeding, the so-called system of khahaas. At an earlier stage (at the beginning of the 19th century) the livestock was taken over, usually for a year, from spring to spring, but at the end of the 19th century it was more common to take over the cattle for only the summer (the distribution of livestock for feeding during the winter—uostur—was a separate process). In return for use of the cow, the poor peasant had to pay the toyon, as was the custom, 30 pounds of melted butter and 12-15 poods of tar (frozen sour milk) in the autumn; sometimes this was replaced or supplemented by compulsory service for the benefit [Page 273] of the toyon. This custom was a very typical and often extremely cruel form of exploitation. The winter upkeep of the livestock was a still more burdensome, enslaving agreement; in return for a head of cattle, the toyon usually paid 1 ruble, 50 kopeks or 2 rubles for the whole winter, whereas in actual fact the upkeep cost at least 5 rubles, and so it was only the poor peasants driven by need who entered into such agreements.' <sup id="cite_ref-638" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-638">[638]</a></sup> 'A still more typical custom, the origin of which in ancient times was connected with mutual assistance between clan members, but which later became in fact one of the forms of exploitation, was kumalaanism. A kumalaan was a poor peasant, a disabled person, an orphan or sometimes all the members of an impoverished family, who were assigned by the whole community to live for a certain time with a rich man or wealthy kinsman who would maintain them. Officially, the adoption of a kumalaan was regarded as an act of charity, and a way of helping a kinsman in need. But in actual fact the custom concealed the cruelest exploitation of unpaid labor. In many cases it was a disguised form of slavery and lasted a long time.' <sup id="cite_ref-639" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-639">[639]</a></sup> Toyons legitimated their superior position by presenting themselves as patriarchal benefactors: 'Apart from these individual customs, the Yakut society admittedly retained the characteristic, half-conscious patriarchal ideology, which was clearly not a reflection of their true relationships, although it served the interests of the toyons, who knew how to make use of it. The toyons liked to style themselves the forefathers, heads and sponsors of their clans; they skillfully fomented various interclan quarrels (usually [Page 276] over land), thereby sustaining the fiction of community of clan interests. A poor kinsman used to call a toyon who had robbed him of his possessions aga (father), and was expected to look upon him as his “benefactor.”' <sup id="cite_ref-640" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-640">[640]</a></sup> Toyons also derived their names from deities: 'In the cult of both the benevolent and malevolent deities, a part was played at one stage by the military aristocracy—the toyons; they were usually the organizers. In their legendary genealogies the toyons often derived their names from the great and powerful deities.' <sup id="cite_ref-641" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-641">[641]</a></sup> Most people were poor and of lower status: 'In pre-Revolutionary Yakutiya the poor and middle peasant families totaled more than 80 percent of all households. One-seventh of all the households were entirely without sowings, and many were only able to sow a few hundredths of a hectare each. Most of the households (97 percent) had to do without factory-made agricultural implements. Stockbreeding produced extremely poor results. The owners of large areas of land and abundant livestock i.e.,—the kulaks and toyons, grew rich, but not so much by raising the level of land cultivation and animal husbandry as by exploiting the poor and middle peasants.' <sup id="cite_ref-642" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-642">[642]</a></sup> Coercion and exploitation exercisted by toyons continued into the early Soviet period: 'During the first two years of the Soviet regime the situation hardly changed for the better. There was redistribution of the land in 1923-24, but the reform only partly cut down the amount of land used by the toyons and virtually made no difference to the burdensome state of the poor people. For example, the nonrepartitional land expropriated by the toyons on the basis of their “clearing right” was left in their possession. It was only the second land reform of 1929 that put an end to toyon coercion and created a situation in which the agriculture of Yakutiya could be improved. About 150,000 hectares of the best land, formerly owned by the toyons and kulaks, then passed into the hands of the working peasantry.' <sup id="cite_ref-643" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-643">[643]</a></sup> We are unsure whether this form of wealth stratification also implied different legal rights.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Ethnicity or race ♣ absent ♥</b> The sources report a high degree of cross-cultural and cross-'ethnic' hybridization: 'In the north, beyond the inner mountain range, closer to the sea, where the Yakut population penetrates along the valleys of rivers and brooks far into the mountain country, the influence of Tungus and Yukaghir (Mongol-Manchurian) blood is less strongly felt. The Dolgan, whose way of live is similar to that of the Tungus and who dress in the same way, are taken for Tungus by many, although they speak the Yakut language and their traditions clearly point to a mixed half-Yakut origin. The Yukaghir who at one time inhabited thickly the lower reaches 240 [Page 449] of the Yana, Indigirka, and Kolyma Rivers have disappeared, swallowed up by the Yakut. The same thing has happened to many Tungus clans. In the Kolymsk Ulus I came across many households, known to be Tungus, who lived in the Yakut manner and who had intermarried and become related to the Yakut. In the northern parts of the Dyupsyunsk and Bayagantaysk uluses adjoining the southern spurs of the Verkhoyansk Mountains, where Tungus still lead nomadic lives, numerous Tungus families appear in years of famine; they hire themselves out to the Yakut as workmen, or live at the expense of the ulus. Such families often remain permanently among the Yakut. In cases of their parent's death, orphaned children are willingly adopted by well-to-do Yakut. The same thing happens in other places where Tungus and Yakut live side by side. Many Tungus in the Vilyuysk Okrug have become Yakutized, and some of them even have numerous herds of horned cattle... Most of them speak the Yakut language, and few of them know their native tongue..., Maak remarks on this subject. Each year, in winter, in the Olekminsk Okrug, Tungus come into the Yakut settlements and live there side by side with the Yakut, in the same yurts, during the coldest months.' <sup id="cite_ref-644" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-644">[644]</a></sup> 'They come at the beginning of Advent and leave at the end of maslyanka (the week before Lent). They bring their hosts presents: furs, nuts, and squirrel and bear meat. They buy horse meat, khayak and flour from the Yakut: they like these things very much. Then life is gay. Every day there is singing and dancing. The Tungus like [Page 450] merriment, the grown-ups as well as the little children; they talk to the Yakut with songs. After the dancing various things happen..., a Yakut woman who had lived in the Olekminsk Okrug for a long time told me (Namsk Ulus, 1887).' <sup id="cite_ref-645" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-645">[645]</a></sup> 'The Tungus of the Maya River (a tributary of the Aldan), as can be seen from the travel notes of General Svetlitskii, have also become partly Yakutized and even engage in cattle raising and agriculture.

<dd><b>♠ Property can be owned by both males and females ♣ present ♥</b> Labour was divided along gender lines, but cooperation within the household was common: 'Although occupations within a household were divided by gender and status, the atmosphere was usually one of productive group activity. All participated in hay making, cattle herding, and milking, but, in general, horses were more a male preserve and cattle a female responsibility. Women tended children and fires, prepared food, carried water, and made clothing and pottery. Men handled more strenuous firewood preparation, house building, sled making, hunting, fishing, and mowing. Ivory carving and wood- and metalworking were male tasks.' <sup id="cite_ref-647" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-647">[647]</a></sup> Wives/daughters generally held fewer rights than men, but their legal status improved during the Russian period: 'The absence of any rights on the part of woman, among the Yakuts of the district studied by M. Pripuzov, is most marked. . . in the field of property relations. Her personal position is at the present time considerably better protected than in earlier times. In this respect one notes in the life of the Yakuts a definite, although naturally a very relative progress. In effect, even at present, the husband considers himself within his rights to beat up his wife if she neglects her household duties, if she is a spendthrift, or if she is unfaithful to him. The Yakut further has the right to put his wife out to hire as a workwoman, and to use the money earned by her. But he does not have the right to kill her; he cannot sell her, or lend her to someone else.' <sup id="cite_ref-648" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-648">[648]</a></sup> 'Instances of the cession of wives to other men, as is known, were encountered among the Yakuts up to the end of the 18th century, while the existence of the custom of lending one’s wife to a guest is substantiated by traditions (Vseso[unknown]iuzone Geograficheskoe ob[unknown]shchestvo, Vostochno-Sibirskii Otdel, Izviest[unknown]iia, XXVI, No. 4-5, pp. 218-19). As concerns instances of putting our wives to work, Prince Kostrov (Ocherk iuridicheskoe byta IAkutov [Juridical Customs of the Yakut]. p. 283) communicates the rather interesting fact that this practice has as its object to effect a separation from the wife: after a church wedding the Yakut rarely leaves his wife, but since such marriages are often consummated against the will of the parties involved, the husband sometimes abandons his wife, who customarily finds herself a lover, to whom she goes to live. In order to avoid prosecution by the authorities, writes Prince Kostrov, the husband and the lover make an oral and sometimes even written agreement to the effect that the former is hiring his wife out to the latter in the capacity of a servant with her consent and for the upkeep of the household.' <sup id="cite_ref-649" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-649">[649]</a></sup> 'If the husband beat his wife without good reason, from the point of view of the Yakuts, she has the right to complain to the clan government or to apply for protection to the Natives’ Court. The husband is not oblidged to maintain fidelity; he can abandon his wife, live in another place, cohabit with another woman. The wife, on the contrary; must preserve fidelity, although occasional relations with other men, if they take place with the consent of the husband, are regarded by the Yakuts with complete indifference. 43 Although at the present time the personal position of the wife in relation to her husband has changed for the better, in comparison with the past, to her lot, nevertheless, continues to fall the most arduous domestic labor. Except where the family is rich, or the wife is richer than the husband, the duties of the woman include more than the care of the household: the care of the cattle, the making of cheese and butter, the painting of the yurt, and often even the mowing of hay, cutting of wood, etc., if the husband cannot manage the other jobs by himself.' <sup id="cite_ref-650" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-650">[650]</a></sup> But property rights of women remained limited and their support systems were generally weaker: 'The property rights of women are extremely limited; however, even in this direction certain changes are taking place under the influence of the gradual recognition of woman’s capacity. These innovations, however, are apparently only beginning to penetrate the consciousness of the Yakuts, and have not yet succeeded in conclusively changing the archaic views, denying property rights to women.' <sup id="cite_ref-651" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-651">[651]</a></sup> 'In relations to her own family group the woman is completely without rights: she must marry into a strange clan, and it is understandable that her kinsmen look upon her as a severed member.' <sup id="cite_ref-652" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-652">[652]</a></sup> This was largely due to the practice of patrilineal transmission: 'Each clan or familial unit, under the influence of the impulse of self-preservation in the struggle for existence, strives insofar as possible to insure its economic existence through the accumulation of wealth. Naturally, it jealously guards its property against transfer into the hands of members of a strange clan; it is here that we must seek the reason for the fact that women have no rights in relation to the property belonging to their kin group. Among the Yakuts, the latter, as is the case everywhere with peoples on a low level of economic development, permits a girl to accumulate property by her personal labor: the product of her personal exertions, whether sewing or other handicraft, becomes part of her possessions, but among the Yakuts, as is the case everywhere, the girl secures the right of ownership of the products of her labor only in the degree that she performs this labor during her hours of leisure and rest, after having performed the household duties which fall to her share. The same rule, it appears, applies 44 to married women. Woman, as a member of her kin group prior to marriage, and subsequently in the capacity of a worker for her husband and his group, has only a portion of the time for her own use, and the group concedes to her as personal property only what she can produce after satisfying the needs of her father’s or her husband’s family.' <sup id="cite_ref-653" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-653">[653]</a></sup> 'The absence of property rights on the part of women in relation to their kin group in graphically expressed in the exclusion of women from inheritance. If the economic and administrative principle lying at the foundation of the family constructed on a blood basis makes quite natural the rule of Yakut customary law, that sisters cannot inherit from brothers, that upon the death of a brother his cultivated land passes to another brother, although the latter might already have a farmstead, then in the exclusion of women from inheritance from the parents, where only daughters survived, we must see a direct consequence of the clan structure, in which the kinsmen vigilantly watch to see that the clan property does not pass to a strange clan, which inevitably happens in the case of the marriage of a girl-legatee.' <sup id="cite_ref-654" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-654">[654]</a></sup> 'M. Pripuzov informs us that upon the death of a person survived only by daughters, the legatees are in the first place his brothers, i. e., the uncles on the paternal side. Further, if the father of the deceased is alive, then by the general rule of Yakut customary law in the district investigated, which makes the parents the legatees of their children deceased without issue, he secures a larger share of the inheritance than the other relations. Where death takes place without male issue, the situation is the same as if there were no issue at all. Finally, the remaining relations come in for their share of the inheritance. A part of the property is set aside for the support and subsistence of the daughters, the remainder is divided between the relations with the closer relations securing a larger part (the father gets more than the rest), while the more distant relatives get a lesser share. A married daughter, like the unmarried daughters, is excluded form sharing in the paternal inheritance: in any case, she cannot inherit her father’s cultivated land, and if there are no direct heirs, the farm passes to the closest relations.' <sup id="cite_ref-655" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-655">[655]</a></sup> 'The brothers, excluding their sisters from inheritance of the paternal property, are nevertheless obliged to support their unmarried sisters, to concern themselves with giving them in marriage, and to provide them with dowries from the general property. Mr. Priklonski, however, (Tri goda v[unknown] IAkutskoi oblasti [three years in the Yakutsk territory]. Zhiva[unknown]ia Starina, 1890, pt. 3, p. 80). notes that the share of the daughters in the division of property upon the death of the father is equal to that of the brothers; this share goes to the brothers, for the support of the sisters.' <sup id="cite_ref-656" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-656">[656]</a></sup> 'That in effect it is the economic principle, in union with the blood principle, and not the fact of the grant of a dowry to a girl entering into marriage, that lies at the basis of the exclusion of women from the paternal inheritance, is demonstrated by the fact that the dowry itself does not in any way correspond to the shares which fall to the lot of the sons upon the death of the father. Mr. Pripuzov unfortunately communicates only extremely fragmentary and incomplete information concerning the size of the dowry, concerning the objects which go to make it up, and concerning the relation of the personal property of the girl, accumulated by her own labor, to the dowry given by her parents at the time of marriage.' <sup id="cite_ref-657" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-657">[657]</a></sup> 'Neither Mr. Pripuzov, nor, as far as we know, any other investigators of the customary law of the Yakuts, have given us a clear answer to the question as to the relationship in which the personally earned property of the girl stands to her dowry. Is this personal property.. 47 ..combined with the dowry given by the parents, or does it form a separate type of female personal ownership among the Yakuts? We do not know. As concerns the dowry given by the parents at the time of the daughter’s marriage, the absence of rights on the part of the woman in the agnatic group of her husband, as well as the very origin of the dowry in the returned part of the kalym, render completely natural the rule of Yakut customary law, whereby the woman is not the owner of her dowry. The latter, writes Mr. Pripuzov, “is completely at the disposal of the husband.” The husband is the owner of his wife’s dowry; he answers to no one for his squandering of it. A logical consequence of this order of things are the following rules, noted by Mr. Pripuzov, in the Yakutsk district: 1. In the case of the death of the wife the dowry is not returned, but passes to the husband and his children. 2. In the case of the death of the husband, if the couple had no children of the male sex, the wife can take her dowry and return to her parents. But she can only have the dowry back under the condition that her husband made a disposition in that sense before his death: in its absence, the dowry, as a part of the familial-clan property, passes to the closest relatives of the deceased, and the wife has no right to claim it back from the heirs.' <sup id="cite_ref-658" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-658">[658]</a></sup> Some rights of women, especially widows, were introduced during the Russian period: 'The right of the widow in the event of a childless marriage to return to her own family, the right of the husband to arrange before his death for the return of the dowry to his widow--all these rules, it appears, rose under the influence of the progressive softening of views on the personal and property incapacity of women. At an earlier time she was completely the property of her husband’s group. Actually, we have no definite information concerning the existence of the levirate among the Yakuts at a former time; but the rules forbidding women to show themselves before the father-in-law and brothers-in-law, and vice versa, obviously bearing the character of so-called “sexual precaution” are traces of a one-time polyandry; finally, the absence among the Yakuts of any proper term for “widow,” etc. (Sieroszewski, 569), compel us to assume that at a more remote time 48 the widow was considered the personal property of the family of the husband and probably passed to them as a piece of property. ' <sup id="cite_ref-659" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-659">[659]</a></sup> 'At the present time a widow can remain with her children after the death of her husband. The liberating tendency in favor of women in the development of customary law in the Yakutsk district is reflected in the fact that if a widow has young children of the male sex, she becomes the complete mistress of her husband’s property; she freely disposes of it until the children reach their majority. More archaic views on woman’s rights, however, are reflected in the fact that when the children reach their majority they have the right to proceed to the division of their grandfather’s and father’s property without seeking the consent of their mother. To her is assigned some indefinite part of the property, but always smaller than the share of each of the sons. The right of wives to one-fourth part of their husband’s property, which is attested to in the Sbornik obychnago prava Sibiriskikh inord[unknown]tsev [Compilation of the Customary Law of the Siberian Natives] p. 234. probably was the result of the influence of the Russians, and apparantly found very little reflection in life. The Yakuts of the Yakutsk district, at least, do not know this rule, if we are to judge by the information imparted to us by Mr. Pripuzov. The Yakut clan, permitting a certain economic independence to a widow with young children of the male sex, who are independent members of the clan unit, completely sets aside the widow, if her late husband left only children of the female sex. In such an eventuality, the situation, as we noted above, is held to be the same as if the man had died without issue: a certain part of the property is assigned to the widow with daughters, all the rest goes to the relatives of the deceased. Incidentally, a more humane attitude toward women sometimes induces these relatives to permit the widow and her daughters to live on the farmstead of her deceased husband, depriving her, however, of the right to dispose of the farm. In the event of the death of the widow, 49 (or if she should marry a second time) the farm passes to the relatives of the deceased husband.' <sup id="cite_ref-660" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-660">[660]</a></sup> 'The following rules, conceding certain rights to women, must be considered the result of the new views: 1. The wife has the right to complain against her husband if the latter, by his improvidence, is ruining the household; 2. The wife is conceded the right to contract debts; the wife is not responsible for the debts contracted by her husband for his own personal needs, and conversely the husband is not responsible for the personal debts of his wife. An exception is made when the couple offer surety for each other. These rules stand in such contradiciton to the personal and property incapacity of women that there can be no doubt of their later origin.' <sup id="cite_ref-661" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-661">[661]</a></sup> But women remained in an inferior legal position: 'The facts adduced here testify that despite certain improvements in the attitude toward the personal and property rights of women, the position of the latter is still far from enviable: clan and household bases principally regulate the structure of Yakut life.' <sup id="cite_ref-662" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-662">[662]</a></sup> 'One cannot yet speak of the independence or equal rights of women among the Yakuts: even the rule making the parents the legatees of their children who died without issue, changes its aspect, if the deceased is survived only by a mother; while the father inherits all or the greater part of the property, the rights of the mother or widow to the property of children dead without issue are only equal to the rights of the other heirs.' <sup id="cite_ref-663" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-663">[663]</a></sup> It appears that while the property rights of women were limited and they were largely excluded from inheritance, they could own household goods they produced for themselves. However, this coding decision is debatable and open to review.</dd></dl>

<dd><b>♠ Property can be owned by people from all social classes ♣ present ♥</b> Sakha society was organized in patrilineal clans, not social classes: 'Key kin relations are based on a patrilineage (AQA-USA) that traces membership back nine generations. Within this, children born to a specific mother are distinguished as a group (YE-USA), and may form the basis for different households (KORGON). Historically, more distant kin were recognized on two levels, the AIMAK (or territorial NASLEG), with one to thirty lineages, and the DZHON (or territorial ULUS), composed of several AIMAK. These larger units were united by alliances, including for common defense, alliances, and by economic relations; these links were renewed at councils and festivals.' <sup id="cite_ref-664" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-664">[664]</a></sup> 'Kin terms reflect gender and age distinctions, and distinguish senior from junior paternal lines. Any relation, affinal or consanguineal, is called URU, which is the word for wedding.' <sup id="cite_ref-665" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-665">[665]</a></sup> 'By customary law, land, cattle, and horses, although used by households, were controlled by the patriline. Animal or land sale and inheritance was approved by elders. But by the twentieth century, smaller families were keeping resources, in part because of the decline of large horse droves. Men owned most of the wealth, and passed it to sons, especially elder sons, although the youngest son often inherited the family yurt. Mothers could pass on dowries to daughters, unless the dowry was forfeited by bad behavior. In theory, dowries included land, as well as goods, jewelry, and animals, although in practice elders rarely gave land to another lineage. Soviet law limited inheritance to goods and nonstate housing could be bequeathed at individual discretion. Most apartments and summer houses were kept in families.' <sup id="cite_ref-666" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-666">[666]</a></sup> However, wealth stratification was present and Russian imperial authorities co-opted native toyons: 'Precise historical accounts of the Yakuts only date from the time of their first contact with the Russians, that is to say, 1620, and annexation to the Russian State. At that time the Yakuts were not a single political unit, but were divided into a number of independent tribes. Tribal relations were already decomposing, however, and there was a fairly clearly marked class stratification. The tsarist voyevods and soldiery took advantage of the intertribal strife to break the resistance of some of the Yakut population; they also took advantage of the class differences within it by pursuing a policy of systematic support of the ruling aristocratic clique, the princelings (toyons), whom they turned into their own agents for purposes of governing the Yakut district. From that moment on, the class differences among the Yakuts began to become more clearly marked.' <sup id="cite_ref-667" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-667">[667]</a></sup> 'Such, in general terms, was the social structure of the Yakuts by the time the Russians arrived. Tsarist policy between the 17th and 19th centuries speeded up the development of social relations, so that Yakut society just before the October Revolution had already changed very much from what it had been three centuries ago. Nevertheless, many phenomena proved extremely stable and retained their archaic nature until recent times. Just before the Revolution the division of the Yakuts into strata according to the property they possessed was extremely marked. Most of the population did not even have enough cattle for the hunger norm (this norm, when the grade of the livestock was low, was considered to be two head of livestock per person), whereas in the few toyon households there were several dozen head of livestock per person. However, the unequal distribution of the livestock was by no means anything new for the Yakuts. But the question of land was different. The system which had grown up in the domain of land tenure was of comparatively recent origin. Since the arrival of the Russians in Yakutiya, the process of decomposition of the ancient communal-clan system of using the meadowland had been stepped up. The toyons were vigorously seeking to acquire the common lands. The development of private land ownership by the toyons continued to the 1760’s, when certain measures introduced by the Russian administration gave it a new direction. In 1765, Yakuts were forbidden to buy or sell land, and in the next few years, through the activity of the Yakut Tribute Commission, the distribution of land in accordance with the so-called “sable” and “fox” taxes or parts of them was introduced among the Yakuts. Later on, in about 1820, this distribution of land assumed the form of the so-called “class system” of land usage, which legalized the extremely unequal distribution of the land, though, on the surface, it seemed to be something like common land usage. This “class system,” which was later modified, had assumed the following form by the beginning of the 20th century.' <sup id="cite_ref-668" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-668">[668]</a></sup> 'The unit of measurement of land among the Yakuts was the “rick” ([unknown]γ[unknown]γ[unknown]), a plot of land from which one hayrick could be mown (the size of the rick ranged from 10 to 30 cartloads, sometimes as many as 40 or 60). These allotments made up plots ([unknown][unknown][unknown]γ[unknown][unknown]) which were extremely varied in size, depending on the “class,” and there were three or four “classes.” One first-class plot ([unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown] or [unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown] ) was equal to two secondclass plots ([unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown] [unknown][unknown][unknown]γ[unknown][unknown]) and three or four third-class plots (kenniki or [unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown] ). The population was also divided into three or four classes: the toyon households belonged to the first class, and received a first-class plot, the middle households were usually assigned to the second class and the poorer people to the third and fourth classes, each receiving the corresponding clan plot. Thus, the system itself gave the toyons plots of land which were three or four times larger than those of the poorer people. It is true that in return for this the toyons had somewhat greater obligations, but the difference in their extent was extremely small. However, this inequality was by no means the only thing. The toyons actually possessed much more land, having seized it in a variety of different ways. For example, they had several plots, rather than just one, by registering them in the names of their children, workers and so on. It was also the custom to give officials (who were more often than not themselves toyons) additional plots of land, so-called[unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown] -[unknown]γ[unknown]γ[unknown] (from the Russian word “ukaz” [edict]), for which, incidentally, there was no payment. The influential toyons also obtained extra plots called ugayy (or kharyy). [Page 272] Furthermore, the toyons frequently enjoyed the right of possessing larger plots, sometimes through inheritance, cleared from the forest or formed at the site of a drained lake. The leasing of land was also common.' <sup id="cite_ref-669" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-669">[669]</a></sup> 'In the second half of the 19th century the custom of equalizing of the land each year in accordance with the yield of grass came into use. The harvest was evaluated by elected “deputies,” and those whose harvest was poorer than it should have been in view of the plot had the right to an extra quota of hay, and vice versa. This was called bebierke (from the Russian word poverka [adjustment]). But in actual fact this custom did not reduce inequality, for the “deputies” always acted in favor of the more influential (toyon) section of the population, to which they themselves very often belonged.' <sup id="cite_ref-670" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-670">[670]</a></sup> Tokarev describes the system of labour and cattle hire as a form of institutionalized exploitation: 'Generally speaking, the toyons possessed a large proportion of the available land, and the best part, to boot. For example, in 1908 two-thirds of all the land in the First Ospetskiy Nasleg in the Dyupsyunskiy Ulus belonged to five toyon households. In the Suntarskiy Ulus the toyons, who made up only 7% of the total population, possessed approximately half the land. By 1917, 55% of all the usable land was possessed by the rich people. By owning land and livestock the toyons were in a position to exploit the needy masses of the population. The forms that the exploitation took were greatly varied; they included elements characteristic of capitalist relations and the older patriarchal-feudal forms, as well as hidden survivals of slavery. For example, it was the practice to hire laborers—khamnachyts—usually for a definite period, particularly for haymaking; they were hired to carry firewood, build yurts and so on. They were paid either in money or in kind; and the method used was usually the typical Yakut system of payment (remuneration in advance), which was called “to take a contract” from the toyon for this or that work. This system of contracting was very advantageous to the richer people, since they then had complete power over the laborers. In return for a paltry sum received in advance, the poor person was sometimes in the toyon’s clutches for a long time to come.' <sup id="cite_ref-671" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-671">[671]</a></sup> 'The system of contracting was also applied in other cases; advances were paid by the toyons for the supply of a whole variety of products, ranging from butter and hay right down to wild duck eggs. This system was a form of extremely cruel exploitation. One observer (V. F. Troshchanskiy, an exiled member of Narodnaya Volya wrote outright that the “welfare of the population will not be improved as long as this system exists in its present form.”' <sup id="cite_ref-672" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-672">[672]</a></sup> 'Another very common form of exploitation was the handing over of the milch cattle to the poor people by the toyons for their use and for feeding, the so-called system of khahaas. At an earlier stage (at the beginning of the 19th century) the livestock was taken over, usually for a year, from spring to spring, but at the end of the 19th century it was more common to take over the cattle for only the summer (the distribution of livestock for feeding during the winter—uostur—was a separate process). In return for use of the cow, the poor peasant had to pay the toyon, as was the custom, 30 pounds of melted butter and 12-15 poods of tar (frozen sour milk) in the autumn; sometimes this was replaced or supplemented by compulsory service for the benefit [Page 273] of the toyon. This custom was a very typical and often extremely cruel form of exploitation. The winter upkeep of the livestock was a still more burdensome, enslaving agreement; in return for a head of cattle, the toyon usually paid 1 ruble, 50 kopeks or 2 rubles for the whole winter, whereas in actual fact the upkeep cost at least 5 rubles, and so it was only the poor peasants driven by need who entered into such agreements.' <sup id="cite_ref-673" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-673">[673]</a></sup> 'A still more typical custom, the origin of which in ancient times was connected with mutual assistance between clan members, but which later became in fact one of the forms of exploitation, was kumalaanism. A kumalaan was a poor peasant, a disabled person, an orphan or sometimes all the members of an impoverished family, who were assigned by the whole community to live for a certain time with a rich man or wealthy kinsman who would maintain them. Officially, the adoption of a kumalaan was regarded as an act of charity, and a way of helping a kinsman in need. But in actual fact the custom concealed the cruelest exploitation of unpaid labor. In many cases it was a disguised form of slavery and lasted a long time.' <sup id="cite_ref-674" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-674">[674]</a></sup> Toyons legitimated their superior position by presenting themselves as patriarchal benefactors: 'Apart from these individual customs, the Yakut society admittedly retained the characteristic, half-conscious patriarchal ideology, which was clearly not a reflection of their true relationships, although it served the interests of the toyons, who knew how to make use of it. The toyons liked to style themselves the forefathers, heads and sponsors of their clans; they skillfully fomented various interclan quarrels (usually [Page 276] over land), thereby sustaining the fiction of community of clan interests. A poor kinsman used to call a toyon who had robbed him of his possessions aga (father), and was expected to look upon him as his “benefactor.”' <sup id="cite_ref-675" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-675">[675]</a></sup> Toyons also derived their names from deities: 'In the cult of both the benevolent and malevolent deities, a part was played at one stage by the military aristocracy—the toyons; they were usually the organizers. In their legendary genealogies the toyons often derived their names from the great and powerful deities.' <sup id="cite_ref-676" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-676">[676]</a></sup> Most people were poor and of lower status: 'In pre-Revolutionary Yakutiya the poor and middle peasant families totaled more than 80 percent of all households. One-seventh of all the households were entirely without sowings, and many were only able to sow a few hundredths of a hectare each. Most of the households (97 percent) had to do without factory-made agricultural implements. Stockbreeding produced extremely poor results. The owners of large areas of land and abundant livestock i.e.,—the kulaks and toyons, grew rich, but not so much by raising the level of land cultivation and animal husbandry as by exploiting the poor and middle peasants.' <sup id="cite_ref-677" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-677">[677]</a></sup> Coercion and exploitation exercisted by toyons continued into the early Soviet period: 'During the first two years of the Soviet regime the situation hardly changed for the better. There was redistribution of the land in 1923-24, but the reform only partly cut down the amount of land used by the toyons and virtually made no difference to the burdensome state of the poor people. For example, the nonrepartitional land expropriated by the toyons on the basis of their “clearing right” was left in their possession. It was only the second land reform of 1929 that put an end to toyon coercion and created a situation in which the agriculture of Yakutiya could be improved. About 150,000 hectares of the best land, formerly owned by the toyons and kulaks, then passed into the hands of the working peasantry.' <sup id="cite_ref-678" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-678">[678]</a></sup> While property was unevenly distributed and exploitation was present, all social groups could hold and transmit property in principle.</dd></dl>

The Dolgan, whose way of live is similar to that of the Tungus and who dress in the same way, are taken for Tungus by many, although they speak the Yakut language and their traditions clearly point to a mixed half-Yakut origin. The Yukaghir who at one time inhabited thickly the lower reaches 240 [Page 449] of the Yana, Indigirka, and Kolyma Rivers have disappeared, swallowed up by the Yakut. The same thing has happened to many Tungus clans. In the Kolymsk Ulus I came across many households, known to be Tungus, who lived in the Yakut manner and who had intermarried and become related to the Yakut. In the northern parts of the Dyupsyunsk and Bayagantaysk uluses adjoining the southern spurs of the Verkhoyansk Mountains, where Tungus still lead nomadic lives, numerous Tungus families appear in years of famine; they hire themselves out to the Yakut as workmen, or live at the expense of the ulus. Such families often remain permanently among the Yakut. In cases of their parent's death, orphaned children are willingly adopted by well-to-do Yakut. The same thing happens in other places where Tungus and Yakut live side by side. Many Tungus in the Vilyuysk Okrug have become Yakutized, and some of them even have numerous herds of horned cattle... Most of them speak the Yakut language, and few of them know their native tongue..., Maak remarks on this subject.

Every day there is singing and dancing. The Tungus like [Page 450] merriment, the grown-ups as well as the little children; they talk to the Yakut with songs. After the dancing various things happen..., a Yakut woman who had lived in the Olekminsk Okrug for a long time told me (Namsk Ulus, 1887).' <sup id="cite_ref-680" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-680">[680]</a></sup> 'The Tungus of the Maya River (a tributary of the Aldan), as can be seen from the travel notes of General Svetlitskii, have also become partly Yakutized and even engage in cattle raising and agriculture.

<p>General Description of Social Status: Sakha society was organized in patrilineal clans, not social classes: 'Key kin relations are based on a patrilineage (AQA-USA) that traces membership back nine generations. Within this, children born to a specific mother are distinguished as a group (YE-USA), and may form the basis for different households (KORGON). Historically, more distant kin were recognized on two levels, the AIMAK (or territorial NASLEG), with one to thirty lineages, and the DZHON (or territorial ULUS), composed of several AIMAK. These larger units were united by alliances, including for common defense, alliances, and by economic relations; these links were renewed at councils and festivals.' <sup id="cite_ref-682" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-682">[682]</a></sup> 'Kin terms reflect gender and age distinctions, and distinguish senior from junior paternal lines. Any relation, affinal or consanguineal, is called URU, which is the word for wedding.' <sup id="cite_ref-683" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-683">[683]</a></sup> 'By customary law, land, cattle, and horses, although used by households, were controlled by the patriline. Animal or land sale and inheritance was approved by elders. But by the twentieth century, smaller families were keeping resources, in part because of the decline of large horse droves. Men owned most of the wealth, and passed it to sons, especially elder sons, although the youngest son often inherited the family yurt. Mothers could pass on dowries to daughters, unless the dowry was forfeited by bad behavior. In theory, dowries included land, as well as goods, jewelry, and animals, although in practice elders rarely gave land to another lineage. Soviet law limited inheritance to goods and nonstate housing could be bequeathed at individual discretion. Most apartments and summer houses were kept in families.' <sup id="cite_ref-684" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-684">[684]</a></sup> However, wealth stratification was present and Russian imperial authorities co-opted native toyons: 'Precise historical accounts of the Yakuts only date from the time of their first contact with the Russians, that is to say, 1620, and annexation to the Russian State. At that time the Yakuts were not a single political unit, but were divided into a number of independent tribes. Tribal relations were already decomposing, however, and there was a fairly clearly marked class stratification. The tsarist voyevods and soldiery took advantage of the intertribal strife to break the resistance of some of the Yakut population; they also took advantage of the class differences within it by pursuing a policy of systematic support of the ruling aristocratic clique, the princelings (toyons), whom they turned into their own agents for purposes of governing the Yakut district. From that moment on, the class differences among the Yakuts began to become more clearly marked.' <sup id="cite_ref-685" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-685">[685]</a></sup> 'Such, in general terms, was the social structure of the Yakuts by the time the Russians arrived. Tsarist policy between the 17th and 19th centuries speeded up the development of social relations, so that Yakut society just before the October Revolution had already changed very much from what it had been three centuries ago. Nevertheless, many phenomena proved extremely stable and retained their archaic nature until recent times. Just before the Revolution the division of the Yakuts into strata according to the property they possessed was extremely marked. Most of the population did not even have enough cattle for the hunger norm (this norm, when the grade of the livestock was low, was considered to be two head of livestock per person), whereas in the few toyon households there were several dozen head of livestock per person. However, the unequal distribution of the livestock was by no means anything new for the Yakuts. But the question of land was different. The system which had grown up in the domain of land tenure was of comparatively recent origin. Since the arrival of the Russians in Yakutiya, the process of decomposition of the ancient communal-clan system of using the meadowland had been stepped up. The toyons were vigorously seeking to acquire the common lands. The development of private land ownership by the toyons continued to the 1760’s, when certain measures introduced by the Russian administration gave it a new direction. In 1765, Yakuts were forbidden to buy or sell land, and in the next few years, through the activity of the Yakut Tribute Commission, the distribution of land in accordance with the so-called “sable” and “fox” taxes or parts of them was introduced among the Yakuts. Later on, in about 1820, this distribution of land assumed the form of the so-called “class system” of land usage, which legalized the extremely unequal distribution of the land, though, on the surface, it seemed to be something like common land usage. This “class system,” which was later modified, had assumed the following form by the beginning of the 20th century.' <sup id="cite_ref-686" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-686">[686]</a></sup> 'The unit of measurement of land among the Yakuts was the “rick” ([unknown]γ[unknown]γ[unknown]), a plot of land from which one hayrick could be mown (the size of the rick ranged from 10 to 30 cartloads, sometimes as many as 40 or 60). These allotments made up plots ([unknown][unknown][unknown]γ[unknown][unknown]) which were extremely varied in size, depending on the “class,” and there were three or four “classes.” One first-class plot ([unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown] or [unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown] ) was equal to two secondclass plots ([unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown] [unknown][unknown][unknown]γ[unknown][unknown]) and three or four third-class plots (kenniki or [unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown] ). The population was also divided into three or four classes: the toyon households belonged to the first class, and received a first-class plot, the middle households were usually assigned to the second class and the poorer people to the third and fourth classes, each receiving the corresponding clan plot. Thus, the system itself gave the toyons plots of land which were three or four times larger than those of the poorer people. It is true that in return for this the toyons had somewhat greater obligations, but the difference in their extent was extremely small. However, this inequality was by no means the only thing. The toyons actually possessed much more land, having seized it in a variety of different ways. For example, they had several plots, rather than just one, by registering them in the names of their children, workers and so on. It was also the custom to give officials (who were more often than not themselves toyons) additional plots of land, so-called[unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown] -[unknown]γ[unknown]γ[unknown] (from the Russian word “ukaz” [edict]), for which, incidentally, there was no payment. The influential toyons also obtained extra plots called ugayy (or kharyy). [Page 272] Furthermore, the toyons frequently enjoyed the right of possessing larger plots, sometimes through inheritance, cleared from the forest or formed at the site of a drained lake. The leasing of land was also common.' <sup id="cite_ref-687" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-687">[687]</a></sup> 'In the second half of the 19th century the custom of equalizing of the land each year in accordance with the yield of grass came into use. The harvest was evaluated by elected “deputies,” and those whose harvest was poorer than it should have been in view of the plot had the right to an extra quota of hay, and vice versa. This was called bebierke (from the Russian word poverka [adjustment]). But in actual fact this custom did not reduce inequality, for the “deputies” always acted in favor of the more influential (toyon) section of the population, to which they themselves very often belonged.' <sup id="cite_ref-688" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-688">[688]</a></sup> Tokarev describes the system of labour and cattle hire as a form of institutionalized exploitation: 'Generally speaking, the toyons possessed a large proportion of the available land, and the best part, to boot. For example, in 1908 two-thirds of all the land in the First Ospetskiy Nasleg in the Dyupsyunskiy Ulus belonged to five toyon households. In the Suntarskiy Ulus the toyons, who made up only 7% of the total population, possessed approximately half the land. By 1917, 55% of all the usable land was possessed by the rich people. By owning land and livestock the toyons were in a position to exploit the needy masses of the population. The forms that the exploitation took were greatly varied; they included elements characteristic of capitalist relations and the older patriarchal-feudal forms, as well as hidden survivals of slavery. For example, it was the practice to hire laborers—khamnachyts—usually for a definite period, particularly for haymaking; they were hired to carry firewood, build yurts and so on. They were paid either in money or in kind; and the method used was usually the typical Yakut system of payment (remuneration in advance), which was called “to take a contract” from the toyon for this or that work. This system of contracting was very advantageous to the richer people, since they then had complete power over the laborers. In return for a paltry sum received in advance, the poor person was sometimes in the toyon’s clutches for a long time to come.' <sup id="cite_ref-689" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-689">[689]</a></sup> 'The system of contracting was also applied in other cases; advances were paid by the toyons for the supply of a whole variety of products, ranging from butter and hay right down to wild duck eggs. This system was a form of extremely cruel exploitation. One observer (V. F. Troshchanskiy, an exiled member of Narodnaya Volya wrote outright that the “welfare of the population will not be improved as long as this system exists in its present form.”' <sup id="cite_ref-690" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-690">[690]</a></sup> 'Another very common form of exploitation was the handing over of the milch cattle to the poor people by the toyons for their use and for feeding, the so-called system of khahaas. At an earlier stage (at the beginning of the 19th century) the livestock was taken over, usually for a year, from spring to spring, but at the end of the 19th century it was more common to take over the cattle for only the summer (the distribution of livestock for feeding during the winter—uostur—was a separate process). In return for use of the cow, the poor peasant had to pay the toyon, as was the custom, 30 pounds of melted butter and 12-15 poods of tar (frozen sour milk) in the autumn; sometimes this was replaced or supplemented by compulsory service for the benefit [Page 273] of the toyon. This custom was a very typical and often extremely cruel form of exploitation. The winter upkeep of the livestock was a still more burdensome, enslaving agreement; in return for a head of cattle, the toyon usually paid 1 ruble, 50 kopeks or 2 rubles for the whole winter, whereas in actual fact the upkeep cost at least 5 rubles, and so it was only the poor peasants driven by need who entered into such agreements.' <sup id="cite_ref-691" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-691">[691]</a></sup> 'A still more typical custom, the origin of which in ancient times was connected with mutual assistance between clan members, but which later became in fact one of the forms of exploitation, was kumalaanism. A kumalaan was a poor peasant, a disabled person, an orphan or sometimes all the members of an impoverished family, who were assigned by the whole community to live for a certain time with a rich man or wealthy kinsman who would maintain them. Officially, the adoption of a kumalaan was regarded as an act of charity, and a way of helping a kinsman in need. But in actual fact the custom concealed the cruelest exploitation of unpaid labor. In many cases it was a disguised form of slavery and lasted a long time.' <sup id="cite_ref-692" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-692">[692]</a></sup> Toyons legitimated their superior position by presenting themselves as patriarchal benefactors: 'Apart from these individual customs, the Yakut society admittedly retained the characteristic, half-conscious patriarchal ideology, which was clearly not a reflection of their true relationships, although it served the interests of the toyons, who knew how to make use of it.

Troshchanskiy, an exiled member of Narodnaya Volya wrote outright that the “welfare of the population will not be improved as long as this system exists in its present form.”' <sup id="cite_ref-705" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-705">[705]</a></sup> 'Another very common form of exploitation was the handing over of the milch cattle to the poor people by the toyons for their use and for feeding, the so-called system of khahaas. At an earlier stage (at the beginning of the 19th century) the livestock was taken over, usually for a year, from spring to spring, but at the end of the 19th century it was more common to take over the cattle for only the summer (the distribution of livestock for feeding during the winter—uostur—was a separate process). In return for use of the cow, the poor peasant had to pay the toyon, as was the custom, 30 pounds of melted butter and 12-15 poods of tar (frozen sour milk) in the autumn; sometimes this was replaced or supplemented by compulsory service for the benefit [Page 273] of the toyon. This custom was a very typical and often extremely cruel form of exploitation. The winter upkeep of the livestock was a still more burdensome, enslaving agreement; in return for a head of cattle, the toyon usually paid 1 ruble, 50 kopeks or 2 rubles for the whole winter, whereas in actual fact the upkeep cost at least 5 rubles, and so it was only the poor peasants driven by need who entered into such agreements.' <sup id="cite_ref-706" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-706">[706]</a></sup> 'A still more typical custom, the origin of which in ancient times was connected with mutual assistance between clan members, but which later became in fact one of the forms of exploitation, was kumalaanism. A kumalaan was a poor peasant, a disabled person, an orphan or sometimes all the members of an impoverished family, who were assigned by the whole community to live for a certain time with a rich man or wealthy kinsman who would maintain them. Officially, the adoption of a kumalaan was regarded as an act of charity, and a way of helping a kinsman in need. But in actual fact the custom concealed the cruelest exploitation of unpaid labor. In many cases it was a disguised form of slavery and lasted a long time.' <sup id="cite_ref-707" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-707">[707]</a></sup> Toyons legitimated their superior position by presenting themselves as patriarchal benefactors: 'Apart from these individual customs, the Yakut society admittedly retained the characteristic, half-conscious patriarchal ideology, which was clearly not a reflection of their true relationships, although it served the interests of the toyons, who knew how to make use of it. The toyons liked to style themselves the forefathers, heads and sponsors of their clans; they skillfully fomented various interclan quarrels (usually [Page 276] over land), thereby sustaining the fiction of community of clan interests. A poor kinsman used to call a toyon who had robbed him of his possessions aga (father), and was expected to look upon him as his “benefactor.”' <sup id="cite_ref-708" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-708">[708]</a></sup> Toyons also derived their names from deities: 'In the cult of both the benevolent and malevolent deities, a part was played at one stage by the military aristocracy—the toyons; they were usually the organizers. In their legendary genealogies the toyons often derived their names from the great and powerful deities.' <sup id="cite_ref-709" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-709">[709]</a></sup> Most people were poor and of lower status: 'In pre-Revolutionary Yakutiya the poor and middle peasant families totaled more than 80 percent of all households. One-seventh of all the households were entirely without sowings, and many were only able to sow a few hundredths of a hectare each. Most of the households (97 percent) had to do without factory-made agricultural implements. Stockbreeding produced extremely poor results. The owners of large areas of land and abundant livestock i.e.,—the kulaks and toyons, grew rich, but not so much by raising the level of land cultivation and animal husbandry as by exploiting the poor and middle peasants.' <sup id="cite_ref-710" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-710">[710]</a></sup> Coercion and exploitation exercisted by toyons continued into the early Soviet period: 'During the first two years of the Soviet regime the situation hardly changed for the better. There was redistribution of the land in 1923-24, but the reform only partly cut down the amount of land used by the toyons and virtually made no difference to the burdensome state of the poor people. For example, the nonrepartitional land expropriated by the toyons on the basis of their “clearing right” was left in their possession. It was only the second land reform of 1929 that put an end to toyon coercion and created a situation in which the agriculture of Yakutiya could be improved. About 150,000 hectares of the best land, formerly owned by the toyons and kulaks, then passed into the hands of the working peasantry.' <sup id="cite_ref-711" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-711">[711]</a></sup> It appears that social mobility was absent.

<dl><dd> <b>♠ recruitment of chief executive ♣ equal ♥</b> eHRAF provides a summary of the political history in the region: 'Yakut oral histories begin well before first contact with Russians in the seventeenth century. For example, OLONKHO (epics) date at least to the tenth century, a period of interethnic mixing, tensions, and upheaval that may have been a formative period in defining Yakut tribal affiliations. Ethnographic and archaeological data suggest that the ancestors of the Yakut, identified in some theories with the Kuriakon people, lived in an area near Lake Baikal and may have been part of the Uighur state bordering China. By the fourteenth century, Yakut ancestors migrated north, perhaps in small refugee groups, with herds of horses and cattle. After arrival in the Lena valley, they fought and intermarried with the native Evenk and Yukagir nomads. Thus, both peaceful and belligerent relations with northern Siberians, Chinese, Mongols, and Turkic peoples preceded Russian hegemony. When the first parties of Cossacks arrived at the Lena River in the 1620s, Yakut received them with hospitality and wariness.' <sup id="cite_ref-712" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-712">[712]</a></sup> Sakha society was organized in patrilineages: 'Key kin relations are based on a patrilineage (AQA-USA) that traces membership back nine generations. Within this, children born to a specific mother are distinguished as a group (YE-USA), and may form the basis for different households (KORGON). Historically, more distant kin were recognized on two levels, the AIMAK (or territorial NASLEG), with one to thirty lineages, and the DZHON (or territorial ULUS), composed of several AIMAK. These larger units were united by alliances, including for common defense, alliances, and by economic relations; these links were renewed at councils and festivals.' <sup id="cite_ref-713" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-713">[713]</a></sup> 'Kin terms reflect gender and age distinctions, and distinguish senior from junior paternal lines. Any relation, affinal or consanguineal, is called URU, which is the word for wedding.' <sup id="cite_ref-714" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-714">[714]</a></sup> 'Kinship and politics were mixed in the hierarchical council system that guided AQA-USA, AIMAK, and DZHON. Yakut explanations of DZHON in the nineteenth century included concepts like "people," "community," or "tribe," territorially defined. Councils were composed of ranked circles of elders, usually men, whose leaders, TOYONS, were called nobles by Russians. A lineage head was BIS-USA-TOYON; respected warriors and hunters were BATYR. Lineage councils decided major economic issues, interfamily disputes, and questions of blood revenge for violence committed against the group. AIMAK and DZHON councils were infrequent, dealing with issues of security, revenge, alliance, and, before Russian control, war. Through war, slaves were captured for service in the wealthiest TOYON households. Kin-based councils were rare by the nineteenth century and had little influence on twentieth-century politics. Yet in the Soviet period Yakut remain aware of regional and kin ties and help kin obtain jobs and political positions. In this period the Yakut elite, some of whom are Communist party members, revived certain traditions, participating in wedding ceremonies and annual festivals once associated with council meetings. To avoid doing so would be impolitic. Yakut have demanded greater economic and political autonomy from Moscow and some Yakut politicians, including the elected president, are reformers implementing the new republic constitution. A major ecological movement and democratically elected councils are trying to redress local grievances.' <sup id="cite_ref-715" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-715">[715]</a></sup> It appears there was little mobility between toyons and other strata of Sakha society (see above).

<p><b>♠ occupational mobility ♣ absent ♥</b> Pastoralism has a long history in the region: 'In prehistoric times, beginning with the northern retreat of the glaciers, many southern peoples who had to adjust themselves to the severe conditions of life in the northern forests or the polar tundra, occupied Siberia. Some of the newcomers, like the Tungus, lost many of their former culture traits, and became reindeer breeders or hunters, while others, like the Yakut, were able in the far north to retain their cattle-breeding culture of the Central Asiatic steppes. But this northward [Page 61] migration was involuntary; the southerners were forced out from their former habitat by the competition of alien tribes. Naturally, in the course of their wandering, they left some traces which have been disclosed by the work of archaeologists. Skeletal finds also have shown that northern Siberia was primarily inhabited by a long-headed people of the Nordic type who had come from the west, and who were assimilated or else annihilated by Mongoloid newcomers from the south. Many of these questions still await solution through the work of archaeologists.' <sup id="cite_ref-716" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-716">[716]</a></sup> 'We have some knowledge of prehistoric Yakut monuments through the recent work of Russian archaeologists, chiefly Petri, whose excavations in the region of Lake Baikal revealed many remains of a horse and cattle breeding tribe, in all probability, the prehistoric Yakut.' <sup id="cite_ref-717" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-717">[717]</a></sup> 'The identifications by the chief zoologist of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Bialanitski-Birula, of animal bones found at the Murino sites and the caves of Orkhon show that these are chiefly the remains of domesticated animals-of oxen, rams, goats, and horses. Remains of wild animals, the products of hunting, are very scarce, proving that the people were cattle breeders. Besides, no traces of agriculture were found to the north of Lake Baikal, presenting negative evidence that the prehistoric inhabitants were herders. Further, Bialanitski-Birula pointed out that the ox of these people, like that of the Yakut, was a cross-breed of the yak. Among the iron arrows were found many with bifurcated heads, a characteristic of Yakut arrows. The iron knives and scissors found have the same distinguishing marks as Yakut knives, as will be shown in the discussion of their iron industry. The horseshoe found in the excavations is exactly like the Yakut horseshoe; it is narrow, with holes for nails and one calk in the middle. The Siberian natives, even in stony mountainous places, seldom shoe their horses. The iron bits of an ancient bridle consisted of two unequal parts, without appendages in the corners. This may be explained by the manner in which the rider held the reins on the left side of the horse as do the present Yakut. Modern Yakut bits consist of two equal parts, a form which may be regarded as having been adopted from the Russians, from whom the Yakut learned to harness horses to sledges and carts, for which long reins are necessary. Formerly, the Yakut used the horse only as a riding and pack animal. Appurtenances of horse harness show that the people bred horses. An iron sickle for hay making was found by Petri. It is quite different from the Russian form and resembles the present Yakut sickle. [Page 62] An iron hook for digging edible roots and plants and iron fish hooks were also found.' <sup id="cite_ref-718" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-718">[718]</a></sup> 'It is indubitable that the training of the deer was at one time the occupation of the natives throughout the country. Even in those areas of the Yakut region where there are no deer at present, deer bones are found in the ground intermingled with human ones and with metallic items of deer harness. Many localities have preserved legends about the one-time existence of the domestic deer among the inhabitants. I can point, as an example, to the valley of the Borgonski settlement, which until the coming of the Yakuts was the scene of nomadic travels of the Tungus Miore with his numerous herds; also--to the valley of the Suntarski lake, which supposedly derived its name from the Tungus Suntar. The Tungus did not know any other cattle, except the deer...The deer are the Tungus cattle! unanimously assert the legends. They also assert, that the Yakuts imitated the Tungus in their use of the deer.' <sup id="cite_ref-719" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-719">[719]</a></sup> 'The capacity to bear bad weather, cold, and hunger, to eat little and literally everything and anything that grows, to be satisfied with little in time of need, and afterwards to fatten up on the good feed and to live on the reserves of the fat and the meat stored up--this capacity is remarkably developed in the [Page 313] Yakut cattle. A great deal of energy is thus spent to survive. From the point of view of productivity this capacity for survival has no significance except, perhaps, a negative one. On the other hand this quality of survival makes the Yakut cattle invaluable in pioneering. Only because of it were the Yakuts able to penetrate with their cattle so far to the north. At present the Yakuts are the northernmost cattle breeders not only in Asia, but on the whole globe. Their northernmost cattle breeding sett lements known to me are on the Amoloi river at 70° N.L. and the northernmost one visited by me (in 1882) was on The Yana River at 69° where the Kungyas River enters it. On the Kolyma, the Alazei, and the Indigirka, the breeding of horned cattle does not, at present, reach such proportions, and stops about two degrees 152 south of the above mentioned point. In ancient times, cattle breeding reached the Arctic but was practised--of course--only in the river valleys. Fossils of horned cattle are found in Ustyansk, and legends about it are preserved in Nizhne-Kolymsk and on the Allaikha (the lower course of the Indigir-' <sup id="cite_ref-720" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-720">[720]</a></sup> 'All those who have tried to connect the horses of the Yakut with those of southern or western Siberia in external appearance have most often pointed to the breed of horses of the Kirghiz. So far there have been no scientific investigations based on any numerous and exact measurements. The only data worthy of attention on this subject are those found in Cherskii. On the basis of a study of the skull of a contemporary Yakut horse, brought by Doctor Bunge from the Adycha River (Berkhoyansk Okrug), Cherskii was able to establish a distinct type of Yakut horse, differing from other Siberian horses and coming closest to the tarpans of southern Russia and the western Siberian subfossilis horse. I. Cherskii classifies the Yakut horse in the eastern group, with the breed of dwarfs (the length of the skull at the base is 472 millimeters) and with medium browed horses (the width of the forehead is 235.2 millimeters). The post-tertiary fossil horse  whose remains are found in great number at the Yakutsk Oblast, bears a certain relation, in the shape of the skull and of the bones, to present Siberian breeds and, by the way, to the Yakut horse. This is the opinion of the same Doctor Cherskii. This relationship expresses itself in the moderate width of the forehead, the inclined position of the bones above the eyebrows, the narrow width of the offshoots of the bones in the forehead to the skull, the concavity of the profile, and the singular dental systemThe size of the fossil [Page 343] Yakut horses makes one class them with the tall breeds (around Lake Lyakhov) and the very tall breeks (Yana River).' <sup id="cite_ref-721" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-721">[721]</a></sup> 'The finding of the fully preserved corpse of a white horse in the frozen soil of the lower Yana, as reported by Bunge , strengthens this interest, as it seems to indicate the possibility of coming to a definitive solution of this problem. The answer to both these questions is directly bound with the time of the northern migration of the Yakut and with the location of their original homeland. Here I will only note that white is still the predominant color among Yakut horses, and that [Page 344] the interbreeding of domestic with wild animals is considered by them to be advantageous for the improvement of the breed. Such interbreeding in the case of domesticated deer, as I mentioned above, is practiced even now by the Yakut and Tungus of the far north.' <sup id="cite_ref-722" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-722">[722]</a></sup> 'We must analyze some discrepancies in the account of the finds representing supposedly old Yakut culture. The excavations were made in old earth huts and caves. Thus this horse and cattle-breeding tribe must have been nomadic, yet, at the same time, must have had permanent dwellings. This may be explained by their double occupation. Iron [Page 63] mining, smelting, forging, and smithing required a sedentary life. While some families of a clan, or even some members of a family, were engaged in the iron industry, their relatives nomadized with their herds. Caves may have served as temporary shelters during the winter when the wet walls became frozen and a fire was used as protection from the cold.' <sup id="cite_ref-723" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-723">[723]</a></sup> The Sakha were initially nomadic pastoralists: 'Traditional pastoralism in central Yakutia required homestead self-reliance, with intense dependence on calves and foals in a harsh climate. Stables, corrals, and haying developed in conjunction with hardy breeds of cattle and short, fat, furry horses. Richer families owned hundreds of horses and cattle; poorer ones raised a few cattle or herded for others. A huge variety of dairy products, including fermented mare's milk, (Russian: KUMYS), was the staple food, with meat for special occasions. The diet was augmented by hunting (bears, elk, squirrels, hare, ferrets, fowl), fishing (salmon, carp, MUSKSUN, MUNDU), and, under Russian influence, agriculture (cereals). Wealthy Yakut hunted on horseback using dogs. The poorest Yakut, those without cattle, relied on fishing with horsehair nets and, in the north, herded reindeer like their Evenk and Yukagir neighbors.' <sup id="cite_ref-724" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-724">[724]</a></sup> Most implements were made in the home: 'Before iron was imported, ironworkers used ore from local marshes. Similarly, ceramics from local clay preceded Russian pottery. Most homemade crafts were for household use: decorated birch-bark containers, leather bags, dairy-processing equipment, horsehair blankets, fur clothing, benches, hitching posts, and elaborately carved wooden containers (including CHORONS for KUMYS).' <sup id="cite_ref-725" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-725">[725]</a></sup> 'Although occupations within a household were divided by gender and status, the atmosphere was usually one of productive group activity. All participated in hay making, cattle herding, and milking, but, in general, horses were more a male preserve and cattle a female responsibility. Women tended children and fires, prepared food, carried water, and made clothing and pottery. Men handled more strenuous firewood preparation, house building, sled making, hunting, fishing, and mowing. Ivory carving and wood- and metalworking were male tasks.' <sup id="cite_ref-726" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-726">[726]</a></sup> Sieroszewski reports some trades, such as carpentry and blacksmithing, for the south: 'In the north, where most of the household utensils are mad at home, all are prepared with the aid of only these clumsy implements.  In the south, where trades are kept separate to a greater degree, a carpenter owns, besides these, a wide and a narrow saw, planes, a brace and bit, chisels, and sometimes even a rasp. But everywhere the axe is most important. The Yakut handle the axe in a masterly fashion and are excellent carpenters. The majority of the churches in the Yakutsk Okrug and almost all the house s in the town of Yakutsk have been built by Yakut carpenters. In their carpentry work they use the same methods, the same compass for cutting, the same pitch rope, plumb, triangle, and ruler as do the Russians. The head of the carpenters artel, the elder carpenter, is called the regulator, after the Russian fashion. But their chief instruments, the axes and knives, have retained their ancient shape.They weigh from two to no more  than four pounds, and cost from fifty kopecks to one ruble. The Yakut cut with them smoothly, cleanly, and quickly; they are ready to fashion even small pieces with an axe.' <sup id="cite_ref-727" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-727">[727]</a></sup> 'As with other Siberian peoples, Yakut shamans (OIUN if male, UDAGAN if female) combine medical and spiritual practice. [...] In the nineteenth century a few Yakut leaders financed the building of Russian Orthodox churches, and many Yakut declared themselves Christian, but this did not mean that they saw Christianity and shamanism as mutually exclusive. The Yakut also believed in the spiritual power of blacksmiths.' <sup id="cite_ref-728" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-728">[728]</a></sup>  But most Sakha continued to rely on household-level subsistence production after the introduction of cereal agriculture: 'In pre-Revolutionary Yakutiya the poor and middle peasant families totaled more than 80 percent of all households. One-seventh of all the households were entirely without sowings, and many were only able to sow a few hundredths of a hectare each. Most of the households (97 percent) had to do without factory-made agricultural implements. Stockbreeding produced extremely poor results. The owners of large areas of land and abundant livestock i.e.,-the kulaks and toyons, grew rich, but not so much by raising the level of land cultivation and animal husbandry as by exploiting the poor and middle peasants.' <sup id="cite_ref-729" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-729">[729]</a></sup> Temporary wage labour was slightly more common in areas close to Russian settlements: 'The Yakut are unwilling to hire themselves out on a daily basis, although the daily rate of pay is always higher than the monthly or yearly rates.  Among themselves they hardly ever do this. This has begun to come into custom only in the vicinity of cities, and only very lately. The Skoptsy were particularly responsible for spreading this custom.  The Skopsty usually pay their workers in flours, baked bread, potatoes, brick tea, and sugar; only rarely in money and  in cotton goods.' <sup id="cite_ref-730" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-730">[730]</a></sup> As most people were engaged in subsistence pastoralism or small-scale cultivation, we have decided against coding for the presence of 'occupational mobility' and complexity. This is debatable and open to review.

The aga continued to rule as long as he preserved his physical and mental abilities.

They named them princelings [Page 782] and wealthy people of the ulus and made them responsible for arrears and disorders, took hostages, and translators from them, and forced them to pay contributions. Afterwards, when the government became convinced that the Cossack carnival was threatening the interest of the government, was impoverishing the population to the bone, and by its unbearable taxation and cruelties was forcing the population to scatter, inciting it into rebellion and disobedience, it tried to give those same princelings and wealthy people of the ulus control over their rapacious servants. They were entrused to be present as witnesses at the gathering of yassak, at inquiries, and all other matters arising between the soldiers and officials who had come and the local population. Later they were charge to stamp with their own stamps the furs given as yassak, so that the soldiers would not exchange them on the way. of the whole clan. They were not slow to take advantage of this.All this raised them to an unparalleled height in 495 the eyes of the population; when afterwards it was acknowledged that it would be better to divide the yassak by clans and uluses and, without inquiring into the distribution and means of exaction, to [Page 783] demand it in full from the clan leaders, the princelings, turned completely into land officials. They began to be encouraged and rewarded for their service by signs of excellence: medals, cutlasses, and caftans, and by a decree of the Senate, on February 1, 1740 and May 17, 1764, they were even assigned a constant recompense, depending on the amount of yassak brought in. A salary to the yassak princelings and those elected as yassak officials: for every 1000 rubles of yassak brought into the treasury, a salary of 20 rubles to each as a gift, and if the amount is smaller or greater than 1000 rubles, to take this into calculation. Encouraged and supported from outside, the princelings little by little freed themselves from the clan traditions and began to oppress the people no less than the Cossacks. Being perfectly acquanited with the conditions of life they were able to enter into agreements with the voivodes and clerks, keeping the whole matter concealed, and under protection conduct themselves in their lands in their lands as if they owned them: they seized land, levy taxes without any control, introduce serfdom, and even buy and sell people. It is a dark memory and bad habits that the princes of that time have left behind them. There was only one way in which the people benefited by the fact that they replaced the Russian officials: they became accustomed to battle for their own interest under new conditions. The princes were their own people, the aura of a conqueror did not surround them, they had nowhere to go with their plundered riches, and even formerly the people had been forced to keep them in check, in their capacity as heads of the clan.' <sup id="cite_ref-735" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-735">[735]</a></sup> It is unclear how many people were enslaved or enserfed.

</p><p><b>♠ Description of the Normative Ideology ♣ ♥</b> eHRAF provides the following summary: 'Yakut religion derives from Turkic, Mongolic, Tungusic, and Russian ideas. Labels like "animist," "shamanist," or "Russian Orthodox" do not suffice. Ideas of sin are syncretised with concepts of contamination and taboo. Saints and bears are seen as shamanic spirit helpers. Christ is identified with the Yakut Bright Creator Elder God, Aiyy-toyon. A pantheon of gods, believed to live in nine hierarchical eastern heavens, was only one aspect of a complex traditional cosmology that still has meaning for some Yakut. Another crucial dimension was the spirit-soul (ICHCHI) of living beings, rocks, trees, natural forces, and objects crafted by humans. Most honored was the hearth spirit (YOT ICHCHITE), still fed morsels of food and drink by pious Yakut. Giant trees (AL LUKH MAS), deep in the forest, were especially sacred: their ICHCHI are still given small offerings of coins, scarves, and ribbons. Belief in ICHCHI is related to ancient ideas of harmony and equilibrium with nature, and to shamanism. Yakut shamanism is a Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic blend of belief in the supernatural, with emphasis on the ability of "white," or benign, shamans to intercede, through prayers and séances, with eastern spirits for the sake of humans. "Black" shamans, communing with evil spirits, could both benefit and harm humans.' <sup id="cite_ref-736" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-736">[736]</a></sup> 'As with other Siberian peoples, Yakut shamans (OIUN if male, UDAGAN if female) combine medical and spiritual practice. Despite centuries of Russian Orthodox and Soviet discrediting of shamans as greedy charlatans, some Yakut maintain belief in shamans and supernatural powers. Others, struggling to recover spirituality after rejecting Marxist-Leninist materialism, accept aspects of shamanic philosophy. Still others, influenced by Soviet education and science, reject all religion as superstition. In the nineteenth century a few Yakut leaders financed the building of Russian Orthodox churches, and many Yakut declared themselves Christian, but this did not mean that they saw Christianity and shamanism as mutually exclusive. The Yakut also believed in the spiritual power of blacksmiths. By the 1980s shamans in Yakutia were rare and more likely to be Evenk than Yakut. Yet rituals once associated with spirit belief were being revived by urban as well as rural Yakut.' <sup id="cite_ref-737" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-737">[737]</a></sup> 'The most important ceremony, associated with a founding Yakut ancestor named Ellei, is the annual summer YHYAK festival, a celebration of seasonal change, of KUMYS (fermented mare's milk), and of kin solidarity. Once a religious celebration led by a shaman, the ceremony has been adapted since World War I into a secular commemoration of Yakut traditions. Practiced in villages and towns, it features opening prayers (ALGYS) and libations of KUMYS to the earth. Although some Yakut debate its "authenticity," the festival still includes feasting, horse racing, wrestling, and all-night line dancing to improvised chants. It lasts three joyous days in Suntar, where it is especially famed. Wedding rituals, pared down from previous eras, center around memorial hitching posts (SERQE), carved for the occasion, with couples honored by prayers, special food, and dancing. New rituals marking wedding anniversaries and graduations at all educational levels include the placement of SERQE, on which names of those honored are carved. But traditional rituals of birth, supplicating the goddess of fertility, Aiyycyt, have become less popular, with some Yakut women even mocking the restrictions that were once associated with beliefs about female impurity. Russian Orthodox holidays are rarely celebrated.' <sup id="cite_ref-738" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-738">[738]</a></sup> Gogolev describes Sakha shamanism: 'Pre-Christian beliefs comprise the dominant component of the traditional worldview of the Yakuts. “Traditional” because the foundation for such a worldview by these people was developed during an era when mythological-epic thinking dominated among a people of a preclass society (L’vova et al., p. 6). “World-view” is interpreted here to mean “the spiritual assimilation of the universe . . . from the pint of view of the interrelation of such fundamental elements of the universe as nature and humanity” (Chanyshev, p. 38).' <sup id="cite_ref-739" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-739">[739]</a></sup> 'Yakut traditional beliefs and shamanism have been studied in considerable detail.’ Despite this, the genesis of black and white shamanism has not received an appropriate explanation, although the history of research into this matter has begun.' <sup id="cite_ref-740" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-740">[740]</a></sup> 'The first information concerning the existence of black and white shamans among Yakuts was reported by participants of the Second Kamchatka Expedition. I. Gmelin and G. Miller described the “summer” shaman, who directed the performance of the ritual holidayyhyakh. Ia. I. Lindenau gave another name for the Yakut white shaman-tnnnrrr oiiiunn, the “heavenly shaman” or the “shaman of the sky” (Lindenau, p. 39). But a more thorough description of the white shaman was given by one of the first Yakut ethnographers, N. S. Gorokhov. “For the dealings of earthly humans with Iuriung Aiyy foion there exist ‘ai oiuna,’ ” he wrote, “-the ai shamans, who can never do any evil to anyone. . . . The ai oiuna do not have any shamanic costume. . . , not even a shamanic drum; they only give benedictions and beg for the mercy of Iuriung Aiyy toion. The ai oiuna always pray only to Iuriung Aiyy toion, and only in one case, when attempting to cure infertility, do they pray to Magan Sylgylakh or to some other dweller of the heavens, in order to petition for a son. The ai oiuna do not perform sacrifices-that is, they do not slaughter livestock as sacrifices, and may only consecrate one animal or another to a heavenly dweller, and then they do not do any work with this animal and, if possible, safeguard it and care for it” (Gorokhov, p. 56).' <sup id="cite_ref-741" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-741">[741]</a></sup> 'N. S. Gorokhov was born and lived in the north of Yakutia, in Verkhoiansk, where white shamans, the “aiyy shamans,” could still be found until the 1870s. “These were,” as he notes, “truly wonderful people, gentle to the point of delicacy, unconditionally honest, and genuinely kind. Looking at them, it would be difficult to doubt the sincerity of their faith in their vocation.  . . .” ' <sup id="cite_ref-742" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-742">[742]</a></sup> 'Gorokhov explained the division of shamanism into black and white by the Yakuts’ division of the visible and invisible world into two parts: into aiyy-the divine, light, clean, and good-and abahy-the diabolical, evil, and unclean. Humanity, livestock, and useful animals and plants comprised aijy. Everything harmful and foul-that is, everything that causes harm to humanity-was the invention of abahy.' <sup id="cite_ref-743" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-743">[743]</a></sup> 'Certain prerevolutionary researchers, uncovering features of dualism in Yakut beliefs, explained them by pointing out that numerous ethnic groups had participated in the ethnogenesis of the Yakuts, and that a unification of the various mythological and religious systems had taken place during their merging into one people (Kharuzina, pp. 171-72).' <sup id="cite_ref-744" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-744">[744]</a></sup> 'In the opinion of V. F. Troshchanskii, the division of shamanism is the result of the evolutionary development of primal [pervobytnaia] religion. One evolutionary direction is associated with the continued development of black shamanism. This finds its highest expression in the formalization of the “religion of the devotees of Shiva.” Yakut beliefs were correlated to a “black faith” derived from the beliefs of the “Turkic and Mongol peoples” (Troshchanskii, pp. 156-58). In contrast, W. I. Jochelson (pp. 197-205) found themes of dualism in the custom of celebrating two holidays during the year-in early summer, an yhyakh was organized as a holiday of fertility, while in the autumn, an yhyakh took place in honor of destructive forces and evil spirits and deities-“the dwellers of the west.” Therefore, “the dualistic ideas and poetic folklore of Western Asia are characteristic. . . ” of Yakut spiritual culture.' <sup id="cite_ref-745" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-745">[745]</a></sup> 'In Soviet times, a number of researchers have regarded the pre-Christian religion of the Yakuts as consisting of two components. P. A. Oiunskii separated shamanism from the ancient religious cults of Yakut ancestors. A similar opinion was expressed by the well-known expert on Yakut ethnography, M. M. No~ov.~ G. V. Ksenofontov associated the airy cult with a “higher,” predominant component of the religion, which was publicly recognized and openly practiced. Demonology, alternatively, comprised the “lower” tier-the unofficial popular religion of the masses. He explained the disappearance of white shamans, who served the higher tier of Yakut religion: “with the acceptance of Christianity, Yakut leaders [toions] were obliged to liquidate their ancient official cult.” Yet black shamans, as the practitioners of the popular demonology, did not yield easily to public control, and therefore were able to remain alongside Christianity.' <sup id="cite_ref-746" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-746">[746]</a></sup> 'S. A. Tokarev described white shamanism in different waysfor instance, as involving the priests of particular deities of light. “The very concept of benevolent, luminous deities,” he wrote, “as distinct from evil spirits, arises relatively late, as the result of more complex conditions of social life” (Tokarev, pp. 171-72).' <sup id="cite_ref-747" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-747">[747]</a></sup> 'In the opinion of N. A. Alekseev, white shamans were the priests of tribal uiyy deities. In his work, he gave a fuller description of this cult in its entirety. In contrast to black shamans, white shamans prayed to their deities during their rituals, similarly to the priests of any polytheistic religions; they did not “voyage” or “fly” to them, they did not fall into ecstasy, nor did they have helper-spirits. They had to observe ritual purity (including avoiding the dead, not associating with black shamans, and so on) (Alekseev, 1975, pp. 77-102).' <sup id="cite_ref-748" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-748">[748]</a></sup> 'Research in the area of the historical lexicon of the Yakut language has led to the conclusion that the terminology of black shamanism is of Mongol-Buryat origin (including the names of the parts of the shamanic drum, the cloak, and shamanic rituals), while terminology associated with the uiyy cult and its priests has a Turkic origin as its basis (Antonov, p. 145). According to Ksenofontov, the attitude of the livestock-herding peoples of the Lena toward shamans was hostile; shamans were considered to be servants of a foul profession alien to their own age-old traditions.' <sup id="cite_ref-749" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-749">[749]</a></sup> 'According to modern evolutionary thought on the subject, shamanism is understood to be a particular form of religion widespread among peoples of classless societies-particularly at the stage of their decline-and is then retained as a vestige at higher stages of social development. In a narrower sense, shamanism usually refers to the religion of the peoples of Northern Asia. The typical course of action in shamanism is the seance [kumlunie], the purpose of which, more often than not, is to heal the sick. As perceived in folk conceptions, shamans make inquiries of spirits with the assistance of their personal helper-spirits. A good shaman would need to possess many extraordinary qualities. “He is not conceited,” notes V. L. Seroshevskii, “ . . . not greedy, not overly demanding. Neither excessive arrogance nor pride are discernible in his dealings with people; more likely, a tangible feeling of internal strength is revealed, before which those surrounding him involuntarily bow, and which generates trust in and obedience to him” (Seroshevskii, p. 631).' <sup id="cite_ref-750" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-750">[750]</a></sup> 'The ethnographic record of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries has provided a wealth of material on shamanism among the peoples of Siberia, Kazakhstan, and Central Asia, the American Indians and Eskimos, and many of the peoples of Southeast Asia. The majority of these peoples lived under the conditions of an appropriative [pr-isvnivni~tshchee] economy, nomadic livestock-breeding, and slash-and-burn agriculture. All of this seems to demonstrate that shamanism indeed represents a specific early stage in the development of religion. Figuratively speaking, shamanism is the focused nucleus of the religious beliefs of an early society during the era of its decline, being fundamentally the ideology of an appropriative economy. In those regions of the world where a transition took place from Stone-Age society directly to a producer economy, religious conceptions changed accordingly, and the foundations of the agricultural polytheistic religions were laid. But in societies that never made a transition to developed agriculture (among advanced fishing, hunting, gathering, and, to some extent, livestock-breeding societies), shamanism remains the principal form of religious belief, attaining more refined forms of development. Therefore, in the forest-and-steppe regions, the dense taiga of the north, and the tropical jungles-that is, in those places where gathering and fishing, hunting, and undevcloped forms of producer economy dominate-there have remained the conditions for the existence of shamanism.' <sup id="cite_ref-751" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-751">[751]</a></sup> 'The Eurasian steppes, due to their geographic situation, have occupied a “buffer zone” position. In the east, the steppes divided the relevant portion of the continent into a northern part, where primarily the appropriative economy developed, and a southern one, which had producer forms of economy. The steppes themselves occupied the central area. It is possible that on the strength of the mediating position of the steppe nomads, their religious formulations were characterized by syncretic features-the intertwining of shamanic and priesthood concepts, with a clear dominance of the former. Not only that, but in the early state formations that were situated in the semisteppe regions of the Far East and Central Asia during the tenth through thirteenth centuries-those of the Jurchens, Kidans, and Tanguts-shamanism was elevated to the status of a state religion (Vorob’ev, pp. 48-49). Shamanism existed right up until the twentieth century in such an expressly agricultural East Asian country as Korea (Ionova). This is connected with the idea that Altaic-speaking elements, such as the ManchuroTungus, played an active part in the origin of the Koreans.' <sup id="cite_ref-752" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-752">[752]</a></sup> 'The perpetuation of shamanism among the peoples of Kazakhstan and Central Asia was closely connected with the ancient beliefs and rituals of local Iranian-speaking peoples. This view held by researchers is confirmed in part by the phenomenon that vestiges of the ancient Prashaman complex of Iranian-speaking ethnoses are distinctly manifested in the fervor of the Central Asian and Iranian dervishes, which consists of the recitation of verses, the attainment of a trance state, the utilization of zoomorphic helper-spirits, and the use of a shamanic drum and beater (Kuz’mina, p. 171).' <sup id="cite_ref-753" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-753">[753]</a></sup> 'The origin of the shamanism of the Turkic-speaking Yakuts from outside of the ethnic group seems to be confirmed not only linguistically, but also by folkloric data. According to legends, the Yakuts are descended from two progenitorsOmogoi and Ellei. From Omogoi came the residents of the Namsk and Baiagantai regions [ulus], who in ancient times did not have the right to organize an yhyakh festival. The origins of the principal central-Yakut ulus are associated with Ellei, the cultural hero, the first organizer and priest of the yhyclkh, and the founder of the niyy cult. These people, the “Tribe of Ellei,” most likely belonged to the Turkic-speaking ancestors of the Yakuts. The etymology of the word “Ellei”-which in the opinion of 0. Botling, is derived from the Uighur 3115 meaning “to give birth to a clan”-likewise supports this. Horse-breeding dominanted their economy, which is also corroborated by linguistic materials: all Yakut words for equine livestock, for their stages of growth, and for meat and milk products obtained from equine livestock, as well as all terms associated with the exploitation of the horse, are Turkic (Antonov, pp. 25-34). In their beliefs, a prominent place was occupied by theyhyakh, the cult holiday of equine livestock fertility. The principal themes of Yakut mythology, in which worldviews derived from the ancient nomadic Iranian-speaking tribes of Middle and Central Asia are evident alongside those of Turkic peoples, are associated with this complex.' <sup id="cite_ref-754" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-754">[754]</a></sup> 'The bulk of Yakut livestock-breeding terms are of Mongol derivation, associated with the “People of Omogoi” in their origin. The terminology of a “hunter-artisan cult” likewise belongs among the words of Mongol derivation (Antonov, pp. 36-37, 145). This complex consists of shamanism and the entire demonological aspect of the Yakut religious system. The “livestock-breeding accoutrements” of these two outlooks have found reflection in proverbs and sayings.' <sup id="cite_ref-755" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-755">[755]</a></sup> 'On the cliff drawings on the Middle Lena, dated as being prior to the arrival of Yakut ancestors, figures of shamans with drums and rattles have been uncovered, as well as a depiction of a person with arms raised upward as if in prayer, above whom were carved three circles-symbols of three suns or of a three-dimensional conception of the Universe. A. P. Okladnikov considered this priest figure to be a depiction of a Yakut white shaman (Okladnikov, pp. 375-76).' <sup id="cite_ref-756" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-756">[756]</a></sup> 'It is not enough to explain the nature of the dualism in Yakut traditional beliefs merely through ethnic considerations, given the fact that dualism to one extent or another actually appears in many religions. The division of shamanism was likewise inherent in the beliefs of the Mongol-speaking peoples, with which we have attempted to associate the origin of Yakut black shamanism. The Mongol white shamans dressed all in white, rode on white horses, and participated in running the country. But starting at the end of the thirteenth century, they began to be supplanted by the clergy of the “yellow religion.”e The black shamans, on the other hand, continued to exist alongside the yellow-robed lamas, M. N. Khangalov (p. 89) associates the appearance of white shamanism among the Buryats with the time their ancestors underwent a transition from hunting to mass livestock-breeding and the noyon class first appeared.' <sup id="cite_ref-757" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-757">[757]</a></sup> 'Until the middle of the nineteenth century, the Yakuts continued to conduct two large yhyakhs during the year-in spring and in autumn. The first, directed by white shamans, was dedicated to the aiyy deities, which represented the eastern, “benevolent” direction of light, whence the sun rises. Originally, Tangara-the sky god, the father of the gods, typologically comparable to the Rigvedic D’iaus, and to the Latin concept of “god” (D’iaus-Deos-Theo)-was supposed to occupy the dominant position among the aiyy deities. Later, this image was embodied in the central figure of the Yakut pantheon, Iuriung Aiyy toion, the “White Creator God,” the god of light, the personified image of the Sun, with the functions of sovereign of the Universe. Then came the other aiyy deities. A particularly important place was occupied by Aal Uot ichchite, the spirit of sacred fire-both of the sacrificial flame and of the domestic hearth. Like the Arian Agni, Aal Uot ichchite was considered to be the protector of the family and the giver of good fortune and healthy offspring. If the goddess Ieiiekhsit was regarded as the messenger of Iuriung Aiyy toion, then the spirit of fire fulfilled the function of intermediary between earth and heaven, between humanity and the gods.' <sup id="cite_ref-758" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-758">[758]</a></sup> 'The second, autumnal yhyakh was dedicated to the terrible, destructive forces of nature, the deities and demonic spirits of the cult of abahy-“the dwellers of the west.” It took place at night and was led by nine black male and female shamans. Blood sacrifices of livestock and horses took place in honor of the chief deities of Yakut demonology Uluu toion and Arsan Duolai. This entire complex with its multitude of shamanic rituals, in the center of which stood a shamanic seance, may be called the cult of abahy. At the same time, it should be explained that the word abahy refers to all manner of evil origins, everything malevolent, hostile, and contrary to the interests of humanity or customs. In the epics [olonkho], abnhy was a nonspecific word for evil beings and monsters, including members of alien tribes, speakers of foreign tongues, and persons with different moral values and customs or completely foreign religions (Ksenofontov, 1977, p. 236). The etymology of abahy is not completely clear. E. K. Pekarskii derived it from aba, ap, meaning “sorcery.” In the dictionary of M. Kashgarskii, which was compiled at the beginning of the twentieth century, this word is found in the form abachi, meaning “scarecrow” (Kashgarskii, p. 10). It can speculatively be connected with the term albasti, which refers to an evil demon associated with waterrelated disasters among Turkic peoples. According to the most widespread version, the image of albasty is associated with Iranian mythology.' <sup id="cite_ref-759" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-759">[759]</a></sup> 'In this manner, the juxtaposition of two groups of mythological symbols-those of good and of evil, typologically common to many religions-became the foundation of the dualism in Yakut religious beliefs. An analogy is found in the Altaic dualistic myth, according to which Ul’gen proclaims that the people created by his brother Erlik are black and go to the west, while the white people created by him personally must go to the east.' <sup id="cite_ref-760" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-760">[760]</a></sup> 'It is possible that at one time the Yakut white shaman, the a&amp;y oiuuna, had a special name, which the word toion-used in historical times with the meaning “master, sovereign, ruler, prince, military leader, tsar, lord, owner”-migh t have turned into. Pekarskii derived it from the ancient Turkic toiyn- “a monk, a Buddhist priest” (Pekarskii, col. 2706). Indeed, in the Kashgarskii dictionary, this word is given with the meaning “an ecclesiastical order of a non-muslim religion.” Khan Dzhubeini, who lived in the thirteenth century, uses the term tuin in the meaning “Manichaean priest.” The editors of an ancient Turkic dictionary derive tojun = tojoin from the ancient Chinese daozhen, literally “a person on the path” (Drevnetiitrkskii sfovar’, 1977, p. 572).' <sup id="cite_ref-761" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-761">[761]</a></sup> 'Evidently Prof. N. K. Antonov is correct in regarding this term as an ancient Turkic word, comparable to the Mongol toin-“a monk of noble [origin]” (Antonov, p. 110). As a hypothetical exercise, it can be supposed that the word toion, etymologically speaking, once represented a compound word, consisting of two words-foiuk and oiiun, where toiuk is “a shamanic hymn, song, or incantation” (Pekarskii, col. 2710), and tuoi is “to sing, to praise.” The ancient Turkic (Uighur) oiiun-“a game” and Uighur oina-“to play, to engage in a seance”-are like the Yakut onn’oo-“play” [imperative]. Thus, toi + oiiun is “one who sings = one who plays” in the sense of “entering into play with god.” Toion may have originally referred to a tribal priest or to a nobleman leader who had been charged with priestly functions. It should also be noted that the names of all of the Yakut gods contain the obligatory appendage “toion.” And it is not for nothing that L. G. Levental’, one of the leading researchers of the Yakut foionate, gave it the following definition: “A military aristocracy, cruel and proud, which traces its origins to the members of the Yakut Olympus, and to illustrious shamans and shamanesses” (Levental’ et al., p. 241).' <sup id="cite_ref-762" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-762">[762]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Rulers are legitimated by gods ♣ absent ♥</b> Toyons legitimated their superior position by presenting themselves as patriarchal benefactors: 'Apart from these individual customs, the Yakut society admittedly retained the characteristic, half-conscious patriarchal ideology, which was clearly not a reflection of their true relationships, although it served the interests of the toyons, who knew how to make use of it. The toyons liked to style themselves the forefathers, heads and sponsors of their clans; they skillfully fomented various interclan quarrels (usually [Page 276] over land), thereby sustaining the fiction of community of clan interests. A poor kinsman used to call a toyon who had robbed him of his possessions aga (father), and was expected to look upon him as his “benefactor.”' <sup id="cite_ref-763" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-763">[763]</a></sup> Toyons also derived their names from deities: 'In the cult of both the benevolent and malevolent deities, a part was played at one stage by the military aristocracy—the toyons; they were usually the organizers.

<p><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of equality ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> The sources report a high degree of cross-cultural and cross-'ethnic' hybridization: 'In the north, beyond the inner mountain range, closer to the sea, where the Yakut population penetrates along the valleys of rivers and brooks far into the mountain country, the influence of Tungus and Yukaghir (Mongol-Manchurian) blood is less strongly felt. The Dolgan, whose way of live is similar to that of the Tungus and who dress in the same way, are taken for Tungus by many, although they speak the Yakut language and their traditions clearly point to a mixed half-Yakut origin. The Yukaghir who at one time inhabited thickly the lower reaches 240 [Page 449] of the Yana, Indigirka, and Kolyma Rivers have disappeared, swallowed up by the Yakut. The same thing has happened to many Tungus clans. In the Kolymsk Ulus I came across many households, known to be Tungus, who lived in the Yakut manner and who had intermarried and become related to the Yakut. In the northern parts of the Dyupsyunsk and Bayagantaysk uluses adjoining the southern spurs of the Verkhoyansk Mountains, where Tungus still lead nomadic lives, numerous Tungus families appear in years of famine; they hire themselves out to the Yakut as workmen, or live at the expense of the ulus. Such families often remain permanently among the Yakut. In cases of their parent's death, orphaned children are willingly adopted by well-to-do Yakut. The same thing happens in other places where Tungus and Yakut live side by side. Many Tungus in the Vilyuysk Okrug have become Yakutized, and some of them even have numerous herds of horned cattle... Most of them speak the Yakut language, and few of them know their nat ive tongue..., Maak remarks on this subject. Each year, in winter, in the Olekminsk Okrug, Tungus come into the Yakut settlements and live there side by side with the Yakut, in the same yurts, during the coldest months.' <sup id="cite_ref-765" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-765">[765]</a></sup> 'They come at the beginning of Advent and leave at the end of maslyanka (the week before Lent).

Every day there is singing and dancing. The Tungus like [Page 450] merriment, the grown-ups as well as the little children; they talk to the Yakut with songs. After the dancing various things happen..., a Yakut woman who had lived in the Olekminsk Okrug for a long time told me (Namsk Ulus, 1887).' <sup id="cite_ref-766" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-766">[766]</a></sup> 'The Tungus of the Maya River (a tributary of the Aldan), as can be seen from the travel notes of General Svetlitskii, have also become partly Yakutized and even engage in cattle raising and agriculture.

Within this, children born to a specific mother are distinguished as a group (YE-USA), and may form the basis for different households (KORGON). Historically, more distant kin were recognized on two levels, the AIMAK (or territorial NASLEG), with one to thirty lineages, and the DZHON (or territorial ULUS), composed of several AIMAK.

Men owned most of the wealth, and passed it to sons, especially elder sons, although the youngest son often inherited the family yurt. Mothers could pass on dowries to daughters, unless the dowry was forfeited by bad behavior. In theory, dowries included land, as well as goods, jewelry, and animals, although in practice elders rarely gave land to another lineage.

Most apartments and summer houses were kept in families.' <sup id="cite_ref-770" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-770">[770]</a></sup> However, wealth stratification was present and Russian imperial authorities co-opted native toyons: 'Precise historical accounts of the Yakuts only date from the time of their first contact with the Russians, that is to say, 1620, and annexation to the Russian State. At that time the Yakuts were not a single political unit, but were divided into a number of independent tribes. Tribal relations were already decomposing, however, and there was a fairly clearly marked class stratification. The tsarist voyevods and soldiery took advantage of the intertribal strife to break the resistance of some of the Yakut population; they also took advantage of the class differences within it by pursuing a policy of systematic support of the ruling aristocratic clique, the princelings (toyons), whom they turned into their own agents for purposes of governing the Yakut district. From that moment on, the class differences among the Yakuts began to become more clearly marked.' <sup id="cite_ref-771" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-771">[771]</a></sup> 'Such, in general terms, was the social structure of the Yakuts by the time the Russians arrived. Tsarist policy between the 17th and 19th centuries speeded up the development of social relations, so that Yakut society just before the October Revolution had already changed very much from what it had been three centuries ago. Nevertheless, many phenomena proved extremely stable and retained their archaic nature until recent times. Just before the Revolution the division of the Yakuts into strata according to the property they possessed was extremely marked. Most of the population did not even have enough cattle for the hunger norm (this norm, when the grade of the livestock was low, was considered to be two head of livestock per person), whereas in the few toyon households there were several dozen head of livestock per person. However, the unequal distribution of the livestock was by no means anything new for the Yakuts. But the question of land was different. The system which had grown up in the domain of land tenure was of comparatively recent origin. Since the arrival of the Russians in Yakutiya, the process of decomposition of the ancient communal-clan system of using the meadowland had been stepped up. The toyons were vigorously seeking to acquire the common lands. The development of private land ownership by the toyons continued to the 1760’s, when certain measures introduced by the Russian administration gave it a new direction. In 1765, Yakuts were forbidden to buy or sell land, and in the next few years, through the activity of the Yakut Tribute Commission, the distribution of land in accordance with the so-called “sable” and “fox” taxes or parts of them was introduced among the Yakuts. Later on, in about 1820, this distribution of land assumed the form of the so-called “class system” of land usage, which legalized the extremely unequal distribution of the land, though, on the surface, it seemed to be something like common land usage. This “class system,” which was later modified, had assumed the following form by the beginning of the 20th century.' <sup id="cite_ref-772" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-772">[772]</a></sup> 'The unit of measurement of land among the Yakuts was the “rick” ([unknown]γ[unknown]γ[unknown]), a plot of land from which one hayrick could be mown (the size of the rick ranged from 10 to 30 cartloads, sometimes as many as 40 or 60). These allotments made up plots ([unknown][unknown][unknown]γ[unknown][unknown]) which were extremely varied in size, depending on the “class,” and there were three or four “classes.” One first-class plot ([unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown] or [unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown] ) was equal to two secondclass plots ([unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown] [unknown][unknown][unknown]γ[unknown][unknown]) and three or four third-class plots (kenniki or [unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown] ). The population was also divided into three or four classes: the toyon households belonged to the first class, and received a first-class plot, the middle households were usually assigned to the second class and the poorer people to the third and fourth classes, each receiving the corresponding clan plot. Thus, the system itself gave the toyons plots of land which were three or four times larger than those of the poorer people. It is true that in return for this the toyons had somewhat greater obligations, but the difference in their extent was extremely small. However, this inequality was by no means the only thing. The toyons actually possessed much more land, having seized it in a variety of different ways. For example, they had several plots, rather than just one, by registering them in the names of their children, workers and so on. It was also the custom to give officials (who were more often than not themselves toyons) additional plots of land, so-called[unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown][unknown] -[unknown]γ[unknown]γ[unknown] (from the Russian word “ukaz” [edict]), for which, incidentally, there was no payment. The influential toyons also obtained extra plots called ugayy (or kharyy). [Page 272] Furthermore, the toyons frequently enjoyed the right of possessing larger plots, sometimes through inheritance, cleared from the forest or formed at the site of a drained lake. The leasing of land was also common.' <sup id="cite_ref-773" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-773">[773]</a></sup> 'In the second half of the 19th century the custom of equalizing of the land each year in accordance with the yield of grass came into use. The harvest was evaluated by elected “deputies,” and those whose harvest was poorer than it should have been in view of the plot had the right to an extra quota of hay, and vice versa. This was called bebierke (from the Russian word poverka [adjustment]). But in actual fact this custom did not reduce inequality, for the “deputies” always acted in favor of the more influential (toyon) section of the population, to which they themselves very often belonged.' <sup id="cite_ref-774" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-774">[774]</a></sup> Tokarev describes the system of labour and cattle hire as a form of institutionalized exploitation: 'Generally speaking, the toyons possessed a large proportion of the available land, and the best part, to boot. For example, in 1908 two-thirds of all the land in the First Ospetskiy Nasleg in the Dyupsyunskiy Ulus belonged to five toyon households. In the Suntarskiy Ulus the toyons, who made up only 7% of the total population, possessed approximately half the land. By 1917, 55% of all the usable land was possessed by the rich people. By owning land and livestock the toyons were in a position to exploit the needy masses of the population. The forms that the exploitation took were greatly varied; they included elements characteristic of capitalist relations and the older patriarchal-feudal forms, as well as hidden survivals of slavery. For example, it was the practice to hire laborers—khamnachyts—usually for a definite period, particularly for haymaking; they were hired to carry firewood, build yurts and so on. They were paid either in money or in kind; and the method used was usually the typical Yakut system of payment (remuneration in advance), which was called “to take a contract” from the toyon for this or that work. This system of contracting was very advantageous to the richer people, since they then had complete power over the laborers. In return for a paltry sum received in advance, the poor person was sometimes in the toyon’s clutches for a long time to come.' <sup id="cite_ref-775" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-775">[775]</a></sup> 'The system of contracting was also applied in other cases; advances were paid by the toyons for the supply of a whole variety of products, ranging from butter and hay right down to wild duck eggs. This system was a form of extremely cruel exploitation. One observer (V. F. Troshchanskiy, an exiled member of Narodnaya Volya wrote outright that the “welfare of the population will not be improved as long as this system exists in its present form.”' <sup id="cite_ref-776" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-776">[776]</a></sup> 'Another very common form of exploitation was the handing over of the milch cattle to the poor people by the toyons for their use and for feeding, the so-called system of khahaas. At an earlier stage (at the beginning of the 19th century) the livestock was taken over, usually for a year, from spring to spring, but at the end of the 19th century it was more common to take over the cattle for only the summer (the distribution of livestock for feeding during the winter—uostur—was a separate process). In return for use of the cow, the poor peasant had to pay the toyon, as was the custom, 30 pounds of melted butter and 12-15 poods of tar (frozen sour milk) in the autumn; sometimes this was replaced or supplemented by compulsory service for the benefit [Page 273] of the toyon. This custom was a very typical and often extremely cruel form of exploitation. The winter upkeep of the livestock was a still more burdensome, enslaving agreement; in return for a head of cattle, the toyon usually paid 1 ruble, 50 kopeks or 2 rubles for the whole winter, whereas in actual fact the upkeep cost at least 5 rubles, and so it was only the poor peasants driven by need who entered into such agreements.' <sup id="cite_ref-777" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-777">[777]</a></sup> 'A still more typical custom, the origin of which in ancient times was connected with mutual assistance between clan members, but which later became in fact one of the forms of exploitation, was kumalaanism. A kumalaan was a poor peasant, a disabled person, an orphan or sometimes all the members of an impoverished family, who were assigned by the whole community to live for a certain time with a rich man or wealthy kinsman who would maintain them. Officially, the adoption of a kumalaan was regarded as an act of charity, and a way of helping a kinsman in need. But in actual fact the custom concealed the cruelest exploitation of unpaid labor. In many cases it was a disguised form of slavery and lasted a long time.' <sup id="cite_ref-778" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-778">[778]</a></sup> Toyons legitimated their superior position by presenting themselves as patriarchal benefactors: 'Apart from these individual customs, the Yakut society admittedly retained the characteristic, half-conscious patriarchal ideology, which was clearly not a reflection of their true relationships, although it served the interests of the toyons, who knew how to make use of it. The toyons liked to style themselves the forefathers, heads and sponsors of their clans; they skillfully fomented various interclan quarrels (usually [Page 276] over land), thereby sustaining the fiction of community of clan interests. A poor kinsman used to call a toyon who had robbed him of his possessions aga (father), and was expected to look upon him as his “benefactor.”' <sup id="cite_ref-779" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-779">[779]</a></sup> Toyons also derived their names from deities: 'In the cult of both the benevolent and malevolent deities, a part was played at one stage by the military aristocracy—the toyons; they were usually the organizers.

One-seventh of all the households were entirely without sowings, and many were only able to sow a few hundredths of a hectare each. Most of the households (97 percent) had to do without factory-made agricultural implements. Stockbreeding produced extremely poor results.

For example, the nonrepartitional land expropriated by the toyons on the basis of their “clearing right” was left in their possession. It was only the second land reform of 1929 that put an end to toyon coercion and created a situation in which the agriculture of Yakutiya could be improved.

<dd> <b>♠ Ideological thought distinguishes all ethnicities ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> The sources report a high degree of cross-cultural and cross-'ethnic' hybridization: 'In the north, beyond the inner mountain range, closer to the sea, where the Yakut population penetrates along the valleys of rivers and brooks far into the mountain country, the influence of Tungus and Yukaghir (Mongol-Manchurian) blood is less strongly felt. The Dolgan, whose way of live is similar to that of the Tungus and who dress in the same way, are taken for Tungus by many, although they speak the Yakut language and their traditions clearly point to a mixed half-Yakut origin. The Yukaghir who at one time inhabited thickly the lower reaches 240 [Page 449] of the Yana, Indigirka, and Kolyma Rivers have disappeared, swallowed up by the Yakut. The same thing has happened to many Tungus clans. In the Kolymsk Ulus I came across many households, known to be Tungus, who lived in the Yakut manner and who had intermarried and become related to the Yakut. In the northern parts of the Dyupsyunsk and Bayagantaysk uluses adjoining the southern spurs of the Verkhoyansk Mountains, where Tungus still lead nomadic lives, numerous Tungus families appear in years of famine; they hire themselves out to the Yakut as workmen, or live at the expense of the ulus. Such families often remain permanently among the Yakut. In cases of their parent's death, orphaned children are willingly adopted by well-to-do Yakut. The same thing happens in other places where Tungus and Yakut live side by side. Many Tungus in the Vilyuysk Okrug have become Yakutized, and some of them even have numerous herds of horned cattle... Most of them speak the Yakut language, and few of them know their nat ive tongue..., Maak remarks on this subject. Each year, in winter, in the Olekminsk Okrug, Tungus come into the Yakut settlements and live there side by side with the Yakut, in the same yurts, during the coldest months.' <sup id="cite_ref-798" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-798">[798]</a></sup> 'They come at the beginning of Advent and leave at the end of maslyanka (the week before Lent).

Every day there is singing and dancing. The Tungus like [Page 450] merriment, the grown-ups as well as the little children; they talk to the Yakut with songs. After the dancing various things happen..., a Yakut woman who had lived in the Olekminsk Okrug for a long time told me (Namsk Ulus, 1887).' <sup id="cite_ref-799" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-799">[799]</a></sup> 'The Tungus of the Maya River (a tributary of the Aldan), as can be seen from the travel notes of General Svetlitskii, have also become partly Yakutized and even engage in cattle raising and agriculture.

<dd> <b>♠ Ideological thought distinguishes men and women ♣ present ♥</b> Labour was divided along gender lines, but cooperation within the household was common: 'Although occupations within a household were divided by gender and status, the atmosphere was usually one of productive group activity. All participated in hay making, cattle herding, and milking, but, in general, horses were more a male preserve and cattle a female responsibility. Women tended children and fires, prepared food, carried water, and made clothing and pottery. Men handled more strenuous firewood preparation, house building, sled making, hunting, fishing, and mowing. Ivory carving and wood- and metalworking were male tasks.' <sup id="cite_ref-801" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-801">[801]</a></sup> Generally, women were less valued than men: 'Despite the fact that with respect to marriage the sons still are in a position of dependence upon the parents, their situation is considerably freer than that of the girls. A widowed daughter, returning to the parental home, again falls under the authority of the father; she is as devoid of rights as her young unmarried sister. The more independent position of the son is explained chiefly by the fact that the family and the clan prize children of the male sex more highly than those of the female sex: the birth of a boy is greeted by the Yakut with greater joy than the birth of a girl. Yakuts who do not have sons are scorned by their neighbors: they call them khatirik-uoma, i.e. “fire from bark (?).” The small esteem in which girl children are held by the Yakuts is indicated by the rule, whereby 54 a widow who marries for a second time must leave her sons by the first marriage with the family of her husband; but the daughters, as an unnecessary element in the family group, she can take with her to her new family. This rule is obviously of comparativelyrecent origin: it could arise only after the widow became free in general to marry outside of the confines of her husband’s group, and after the kalym had begun to lose its significance of a purchase price for the bride, and had begun to return to the family of the bridegroom in the form of a dowry. Gaining nothing by giving a daughter in marriage, the Yakut familial-household group naturally regards daughters as a completely superfluous element in the family, and sets no value on them.' <sup id="cite_ref-802" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-802">[802]</a></sup> Mothers influenced marriage arrangements of their children, but fathers retained superior authority over sons and especially daughters: 'The Yakut is not in the full possession of his rights until he is married. The unmarried son cannot even ask for a share of the family goods without a particularly valid reason, even if he does not live with his father, for instance, when there is an older son in the family. Only after marriage does the grown-up Yakut step forth as an independent personality. In the question of marriage the authority of the father over the person of his son finds graphic expression. It is true that, in the words of Mr. Pripuzov, in the selection of a bride for the son, or of a bridegroom for the daughter, the consent of the mother carries more weight than that of the father. In this privilege of the women before the man, which, incidentally, is guaranteed by nothing more than moral principles, is contained the only advantage of the wife and mother. But the authority of the father expresses itself above all in the right to give in marriage his under-age son or daughter. The information communicated, for example, by Mr. Shchukin (Zh. M. V. D. [RCH: I have been unable to determine what these initials stand for] 1854, VII, p. 26), that the Yakut himself selects his bride and announces his choice to his parents, is confirmed neither by Mr. Pripuzov nor by other investigators. On the contrary, marriages, or at least betrothals, of under-age children, appear to be very widespread, even at the present time among the Yakuts. “As formerly, so now,” writes Mr. Pripuzov, “the Yakuts marry off young children, for which purpose the parents come to an agreement, determining the bride price, and the children have a church marriage upon coming of age.” 52 On the basis of other sources there is even reason to consider the betrothal of young children almost general among the Yakuts: this is done with the object of easing the payment of the bride price, payment of which, in installments, is begun by the parents of the bridegroom immediately after the conclusion of the agreement. “With the payment of the first installments of the bride price, the child-bridegroom acquires, so to speak conjugal rights with respect to his bride, who herself is still but a child. He is often a guest at the home of his future wife, sleeps with her and, having grown up, becomes her factual husband.” (Vsesoiuznoe Geograficheskoe Obshchestvo, Vostochno-Sibirskii Otdel, Izv[unknown]iesti[unknown]ia, XXVI, No. 4-5, p. 214).' <sup id="cite_ref-803" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-803">[803]</a></sup> Wives/husbands generally held fewer rights than men, but their legal status improved during the Russian period: 'The absence of any rights on the part of woman, among the Yakuts of the district studied by M. Pripuzov, is most marked. . . in the field of property relations. Her personal position is at the present time considerably better protected than in earlier times. In this respect one notes in the life of the Yakuts a definite, although naturally a very relative progress. In effect, even at present, the husband considers himself within his rights to beat up his wife if she neglects her household duties, if she is a spendthrift, or if she is unfaithful to him. The Yakut further has the right to put his wife out to hire as a workwoman, and to use the money earned by her. But he does not have the right to kill her; he cannot sell her, or lend her to someone else.' <sup id="cite_ref-804" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-804">[804]</a></sup> 'Instances of the cession of wives to other men, as is known, were encountered among the Yakuts up to the end of the 18th century, while the existence of the custom of lending one’s wife to a guest is substantiated by traditions (Vseso[unknown]iuzone Geograficheskoe ob[unknown]shchestvo, Vostochno-Sibirskii Otdel, Izviest[unknown]iia, XXVI, No. 4-5, pp. 218-19). As concerns instances of putting our wives to work, Prince Kostrov (Ocherk iuridicheskoe byta IAkutov [Juridical Customs of the Yakut]. p. 283) communicates the rather interesting fact that this practice has as its object to effect a separation from the wife: after a church wedding the Yakut rarely leaves his wife, but since such marriages are often consummated against the will of the parties involved, the husband sometimes abandons his wife, who customarily finds herself a lover, to whom she goes to live. In order to avoid prosecution by the authorities, writes Prince Kostrov, the husband and the lover make an oral and sometimes even written agreement to the effect that the former is hiring his wife out to the latter in the capacity of a servant with her consent and for the upkeep of the household.' <sup id="cite_ref-805" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-805">[805]</a></sup> 'If the husband beat his wife without good reason, from the point of view of the Yakuts, she has the right to complain to the clan government or to apply for protection to the Natives’ Court. The husband is not oblidged to maintain fidelity; he can abandon his wife, live in another place, cohabit with another woman. The wife, on the contrary; must preserve fidelity, although occasional relations with other men, if they take place with the consent of the husband, are regarded by the Yakuts with complete indifference. 43 Although at the present time the personal position of the wife in relation to her husband has changed for the better, in comparison with the past, to her lot, nevertheless, continues to fall the most arduous domestic labor. Except where the family is rich, or the wife is richer than the husband, the duties of the woman include more than the care of the household: the care of the cattle, the making of cheese and butter, the painting of the yurt, and often even the mowing of hay, cutting of wood, etc., if the husband cannot manage the other jobs by himself.' <sup id="cite_ref-806" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-806">[806]</a></sup> But property rights of women remained limited and their support systems were generally weaker: 'The property rights of women are extremely limited; however, even in this direction certain changes are taking place under the influence of the gradual recognition of woman’s capacity. These innovations, however, are apparently only beginning to penetrate the consciousness of the Yakuts, and have not yet succeeded in conclusively changing the archaic views, denying property rights to women.' <sup id="cite_ref-807" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-807">[807]</a></sup> 'In relations to her own family group the woman is completely without rights: she must marry into a strange clan, and it is understandable that her kinsmen look upon her as a severed member.' <sup id="cite_ref-808" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-808">[808]</a></sup> This was largely due to the practice of patrilineal transmission: 'Each clan or familial unit, under the influence of the impulse of self-preservation in the struggle for existence, strives insofar as possible to insure its economic existence through the accumulation of wealth. Naturally, it jealously guards its property against transfer into the hands of members of a strange clan; it is here that we must seek the reason for the fact that women have no rights in relation to the property belonging to their kin group. Among the Yakuts, the latter, as is the case everywhere with peoples on a low level of economic development, permits a girl to accumulate property by her personal labor: the product of her personal exertions, whether sewing or other handicraft, becomes part of her possessions, but among the Yakuts, as is the case everywhere, the girl secures the right of ownership of the products of her labor only in the degree that she performs this labor during her hours of leisure and rest, after having performed the household duties which fall to her share. The same rule, it appears, applies 44 to married women. Woman, as a member of her kin group prior to marriage, and subsequently in the capacity of a worker for her husband and his group, has only a portion of the time for her own use, and the group concedes to her as personal property only what she can produce after satisfying the needs of her father’s or her husband’s family.' <sup id="cite_ref-809" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-809">[809]</a></sup> 'The absence of property rights on the part of women in relation to their kin group in graphically expressed in the exclusion of women from inheritance. If the economic and administrative principle lying at the foundation of the family constructed on a blood basis makes quite natural the rule of Yakut customary law, that sisters cannot inherit from brothers, that upon the death of a brother his cultivated land passes to another brother, although the latter might already have a farmstead, then in the exclusion of women from inheritance from the parents, where only daughters survived, we must see a direct consequence of the clan structure, in which the kinsmen vigilantly watch to see that the clan property does not pass to a strange clan, which inevitably happens in the case of the marriage of a girl-legatee.' <sup id="cite_ref-810" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-810">[810]</a></sup> 'M. Pripuzov informs us that upon the death of a person survived only by daughters, the legatees are in the first place his brothers, i. e., the uncles on the paternal side. Further, if the father of the deceased is alive, then by the general rule of Yakut customary law in the district investigated, which makes the parents the legatees of their children deceased without issue, he secures a larger share of the inheritance than the other relations. Where death takes place without male issue, the situation is the same as if there were no issue at all. Finally, the remaining relations come in for their share of the inheritance. A part of the property is set aside for the support and subsistence of the daughters, the remainder is divided between the relations with the closer relations securing a larger part (the father gets more than the rest), while the more distant relatives get a lesser share. A married daughter, like the unmarried daughters, is excluded form sharing in the paternal inheritance: in any case, she cannot inherit her father’s cultivated land, and if there are no direct heirs, the farm passes to the closest relations.' <sup id="cite_ref-811" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-811">[811]</a></sup> 'The brothers, excluding their sisters from inheritance of the paternal property, are nevertheless obliged to support their unmarried sisters, to concern themselves with giving them in marriage, and to provide them with dowries from the general property. Mr. Priklonski, however, (Tri goda v[unknown] IAkutskoi oblasti [three years in the Yakutsk territory]. Zhiva[unknown]ia Starina, 1890, pt. 3, p. 80). notes that the share of the daughters in the division of property upon the death of the father is equal to that of the brothers; this share goes to the brothers, for the support of the sisters.' <sup id="cite_ref-812" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-812">[812]</a></sup> 'That in effect it is the economic principle, in union with the blood principle, and not the fact of the grant of a dowry to a girl entering into marriage, that lies at the basis of the exclusion of women from the paternal inheritance, is demonstrated by the fact that the dowry itself does not in any way correspond to the shares which fall to the lot of the sons upon the death of the father. Mr. Pripuzov unfortunately communicates only extremely fragmentary and incomplete information concerning the size of the dowry, concerning the objects which go to make it up, and concerning the relation of the personal property of the girl, accumulated by her own labor, to the dowry given by her parents at the time of marriage.' <sup id="cite_ref-813" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-813">[813]</a></sup> 'Neither Mr. Pripuzov, nor, as far as we know, any other investigators of the customary law of the Yakuts, have given us a clear answer to the question as to the relationship in which the personally earned property of the girl stands to her dowry. Is this personal property.. 47 ..combined with the dowry given by the parents, or does it form a separate type of female personal ownership among the Yakuts? We do not know. As concerns the dowry given by the parents at the time of the daughter’s marriage, the absence of rights on the part of the woman in the agnatic group of her husband, as well as the very origin of the dowry in the returned part of the kalym, render completely natural the rule of Yakut customary law, whereby the woman is not the owner of her dowry. The latter, writes Mr. Pripuzov, “is completely at the disposal of the husband.” The husband is the owner of his wife’s dowry; he answers to no one for his squandering of it. A logical consequence of this order of things are the following rules, noted by Mr. Pripuzov, in the Yakutsk district: 1. In the case of the death of the wife the dowry is not returned, but passes to the husband and his children. 2. In the case of the death of the husband, if the couple had no children of the male sex, the wife can take her dowry and return to her parents. But she can only have the dowry back under the condtition that her husband made a disposition in that sense before his death: in its absence, the dowry, as a part of the familial-clan property, passes to the closest relatives of the deceased, and the wife has no right to claim it back from the heirs.' <sup id="cite_ref-814" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-814">[814]</a></sup> Some rights of women, especially widows, were introduced during the Russian period: 'The right of the widow in the event of a childless marriage to return to her own family, the right of the husband to arrange before his death for the return of the dowry to his widow--all these rules, it appears, rose under the influence of the progressive softening of views on the personal and property incapacity of women. At an earlier time she was completely the property of her husband’s group. Actually, we have no definite information concerning the existence of the levirate among the Yakuts at a former time; but the rules forbidding women to show themselves before the father-in-law and brothers-in-law, and vice versa, obviously bearing the character of so-called “sexual precaution” are traces of a one-time polyandry; finally, the absence among the Yakuts of any proper term for “widow,” etc. (Sieroszewski, 569), compel us to assume that at a more remote time 48 the widow was considered the personal property of the family of the husband and probably passed to them as a piece of property. ' <sup id="cite_ref-815" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-815">[815]</a></sup> 'At the present time a widow can remain with her children after the death of her husband. The liberating tendency in favor of women in the development of customary law in the Yakutsk district is reflected in the fact that if a widow has young children of the male sex, she becomes the complete mistress of her husband’s property; she freely disposes of it until the children reach their majority. More archaic views on woman’s rights, however, are reflected in the fact that when the children reach their majority they have the right to proceed to the division of their grandfather’s and father’s property without seeking the consent of their mother. To her is assigned some indefinite part of the property, but always smaller than the share of each of the sons. The right of wives to one-fourth part of their husband’s property, which is attested to in the Sbornik obychnago prava Sibiriskikh inord[unknown]tsev [Compilation of the Customary Law of the Siberian Natives] p. 234. probably was the result of the influence of the Russians, and apparantly found very little reflection in life. The Yakuts of the Yakutsk district, at least, do not know this rule, if we are to judge by the information imparted to us by Mr. Pripuzov. The Yakut clan, permitting a certain economic independence to a widow with young children of the male sex, who are independent members of the clan unit, completely sets aside the widow, if her late husband left only children of the female sex. In such an eventuality, the situation, as we noted above, is held to be the same as if the man had died without issue: a certain part of the property is assigned to the widow with daughters, all the rest goes to the relatives of the deceased. Incidentally, a more humane attitude toward women sometimes induces these relatives to permit the widow and her daughters to live on the farmstead of her deceased husband, depriving her, however, of the right to dispose of the farm. In the event of the death of the widow, 49 (or if she should marry a second time) the farm passes to the relatives of the deceased husband.' <sup id="cite_ref-816" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-816">[816]</a></sup> 'The following rules, conceding certain rights to women, must be considered the result of the new views: 1. The wife has the right to complain against her husband if the latter, by his improvidence, is ruining the household; 2. The wife is conceded the right to contract debts; the wife is not responsible for the debts contracted by her husband for his own personal needs, and conversely the husband is not responsible for the personal debts of his wife. An exception is made when the couple offer surety for each other. These rules stand in such contradiciton to the personal and property incapacity of women that there can be no doubt of their later origin.' <sup id="cite_ref-817" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-817">[817]</a></sup> But women remained in an inferior legal position: 'The facts adduced here testify that despite certain improvements in the attitude toward the personal and property rights of women, the position of the latter is still far from enviable: clan and household bases principally regulate the structure of Yakut life.' <sup id="cite_ref-818" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-818">[818]</a></sup> 'One cannot yet speak of the independence or equal rights of women among the Yakuts: even the rule making the parents the legatees of their children who died without issue, changes its aspect, if the deceased is survived only by a mother; while the father inherits all or the greater part of the property, the rights of the mother or widow to the property of children dead without issue are only equal to the rights of the other heirs.' <sup id="cite_ref-819" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-819">[819]</a></sup></dd>

Within this, children born to a specific mother are distinguished as a group (YE-USA), and may form the basis for different households (KORGON). Historically, more distant kin were recognized on two levels, the AIMAK (or territorial NASLEG), with one to thirty lineages, and the DZHON (or territorial ULUS), composed of several AIMAK.

Any relation, affinal or consanguineal, is called URU, which is the word for wedding.' <sup id="cite_ref-821" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-821">[821]</a></sup> eHRAF provides a general description of the marriage system. While polygyny was practiced, monogamy was more common: 'Traditionally, for wealthy Yakut, marriage could be polygamous. More common, however, was monogamy, with occasional remarriage after the death of a spouse. Arranged marriages were sometimes politically motivated. Patrilineage exogamy was reckoned strictly; those one could marry were called SYGAN. Until the 1920s many marriage arrangements were complicated and protracted, involving financial, emotional, and symbolic resources of the bride's and groom's extended families. This included the matchmaking ritual; several formal payments of animals, furs, and meat to the bride's family; informal gifts; and extensive dowries. Some families permitted poor grooms to work in their households as a replacement for the bride-price. Occasionally bride-capture occurred (it may have been more common in pre-Russian times). Wedding ceremonies and their attendant feasts, prayers, and dancing, were held first at the household of the bride's parents, then at that of the groom's. The couple usually lived or settled in a nearby yurt. Since the 1970s interest in limited aspects of ritual and gift exchange has revived, although few couples are paired through matchmakers. In the 1980s one young man was chagrined to find that a woman he had fallen in love with on a train was a distant cousin, a forbidden marriage partner according to kin rules still observed.' <sup id="cite_ref-822" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-822">[822]</a></sup> 'Polygamy has existed since ancient times among many of the Yakut; however, a man never had more than five wives at a time. The reasons for this are as follows: 1) the Yakut promise their children in marriage at an early age, and the children, by the time they are of age, have ceased to love one another, and therefore the husband takes a second wife; 2) if a man lives with his wife for several years without having any children, he takes a second and a third merely in order to have children; 3) the rich Yakut had many wives to supervise their houses and cattle, which they usually had in many places, for the wives ran their estates more diligently than outside hired men; thus the farm is improved and the estate is guarded; 4) if they leave their wives, even those whom they have married in church, because of some bad behavior or because they are permanently delirious, or rendered completely incapable of taking care of house and cattle as a result of some disease which deprived them of sight, speech, arms, and legs, since the Yakut leave the whole house and cattle-raising to the wife's care, they take other wives and leave the former one's in their houses; 5) various other circumstances induce the Yakut to practise polygamy; the principle reason is the desire to have good supervision of the households and an increase of the cattle; 6) having had several 221 wives before conversion, and having married one in church after conversion but without abandoning the others, the Yakut will keep them in his [Page 15] houses with their children, and some without children because they are sterile. Such polygamy, which is tolerated for the above reasons, and which has existed since ancient times and does not do any harm, had not become bad in the judgement of the Yakut, and no regulations for the abolition of this custom have been set up by the Yakut. However, since the Yakut adopted the Christian faith, and as they have become enlightened by strict surveillance and sometimes by indulgent reprimands from the eparchial priests, it has been gradually dying out, but nevertheless denunciations on this subject are made concerning people who have lawfully wedded wives but keep the others, and people who had several wives before conversion and married one of them in church without leaving the others, who were left at home with their children; in the case of such a denunciation the local authorities, on the grounds of the repugnance of the Christian religion for this custom, pressed formal charges, and the guilty parties were handed over to the clerical court as fornicators, and the cases were decided according to general state laws, which constituted and still constitute and extreme burden for the Yakut.' <sup id="cite_ref-823" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-823">[823]</a></sup> Exogamy was the norm, and the sources mention bride-price and dowry arrangements: 'To the end of the eighteenth century, there remained in vogue among the Yakut the custom of concession of wives. Formerly the bridegroom lived permanently in the house of his father-in-law, but in more recent times he lived there only for a definite period.' <sup id="cite_ref-824" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-824">[824]</a></sup> 'The kalym, or bride-price, replaced the system of marriage by capture.

The chastity of girls in rich families is not a question of morality but of kalym . The kalym for a widow or a girl who has had children is low. In the case of a widow, the belief in the right of the deceased husband may limit the number of wooers. A girl with a child, however, is sometimes preferred as a guaranty against barrenness which the Yakut dislike. In Yakut tales, the guest does not ask, “Where shall I sleep?”, but, “Where do you put your guests?” and then they are shown to the beds of the girls. This is a form of hospitable hetaerism.' <sup id="cite_ref-826" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-826">[826]</a></sup> 'The Yakut look for brides for their sons not only outside of their clans ( us, nasleg ), but outside of the ulus, or union of clans. A girl, say the Yakut, is really a lot of aliens. This saying is reminiscent of the old time marriage by capture. Marriage is now also exogamic, but kalym (brideprice) is given in money, cattle, and other goods. Practically, the kalym may be regarded as an exchange of presents. What the parents of the bride receive from the parents of the bridegroom is almost equivalent to what they give her when she leaves their house. Often the bride carries with her cattle and goods of a greater value than her parents received that she may not be reproached by the bridegroom’s relatives for bringing only a small dowry with her. The young bride remains under the protection of her clan and family. Many common law customs regulate disagreements and dissensions: If a young woman leaves her husband because she dislikes him, her dowry remains with him; but, if she accuses him of cruelties, relatives on both sides decide the matter. The Yakut do not like to appeal to the Russian courts.' <sup id="cite_ref-827" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-827">[827]</a></sup> 'The Yakut were warlike and blood vengeance between clans occurred very often, but reconciliation was often sought through payment of a ransom or by giving a girl in marriage, the best way to end hostilities.

The amount of the kalym aries greatly, between several rubles and several hundred rubles. Sometimes it is even as much as one and one-half or two thousand rubles. Usually the amount is somewhere around the mean between these figures - that is, one hundred rubles. Most families would not have the means to pay so large an amount were it not for the fact that most of it is returned in the form of a dowry.' <sup id="cite_ref-829" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-829">[829]</a></sup> 'According to custom only the kurum, hat is, the part that goes for hospitality, and other minor additions for the same purpose, [Page 857] are paid by the bridegroom without return. The payment given to the bride's parents, sulu, and the presents given to the relatives and match-makers, tyunngyur-khodogoy kesite, is afterwards given back in the form of a dowry, enne, and presents, 546 torkyut. Since the bridegroom usually assumes his conjungal rights immediately after the festivities, if he dies the kurum is never given back, but only half of the sulu, if this has been paid. The amounts of various parts of the kalym are strictly 547 determined by the agreement, [Page 858 is blank] [Page 859] kil'tegan. It also varies greatly in different localities, and depends on the force of the ancient customs, and the prosperity and way of life of the inhabitants. Even in the same locality it differs for each wedded couple, depending on the affluence of their parents, their stinginess or generosity and their attachment to their children.' <sup id="cite_ref-830" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-830">[830]</a></sup> 'The Yakut maintain that in older days the kalym was bigger, and I have noticed that it is infact larger in less cultured localities, where the ancient customs are still strong. Thus the amount of cattle exchanged and killed at weddings in the Kolymsk and Verkhoyansk uluses or in remote uluses of the Yakutsk Okrug is a considerably greater part of the total property of those who are getting married that in more cultured localities, near a city or in the south, despite the fact that there is more cattle in the south. In the latter uluses we notice a tendency to convert the larger part of the kalym into money, and to replace the meat offered as hospitality with flour, butter, and vodka, for which no norms and rules have been worked out. This allows this part of the expense to be decreased unnoticably. Nowhere, however, has the kalym disappeared, and poor people will often slaughter their only cow or mare for a wedding, as the bridegroom's present, so that the parents only had to give around ten rubles in money as payment for the bride, sulu. In the meantime, it is their duty to dress the bride and give her at least a few household utensils.

They are either a result of the sudden impoverishment of a heretofore rich family or a consequence of a bridegroom's particular passion for a girl, which her parents notice and which they never miss a chance to profit by.' <sup id="cite_ref-832" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-832">[832]</a></sup> 'Popular opinion condemns such behavior. Nevertheless I have seen very respected and even loving fathers who sucked all they could get from their sons-in-law when they visited their brides, still living 548 at home. Parents never give their daughters to their husbands immediately after the wedding. This is the custom, and parents also give as an excuse either that they must prepare the dowry, or that their daughter is unaccustomed to marriage, or that she is too young, and so forth; this is true even if they have been married and the kalym has been paid, or the agreement has been made to pay it immediately. In the old days this state sometimes lasted for four or five years, and still earlier the Yakut had the custom to marry their children when they were very young. During this time the bridegroom visits his bride at his leisure and must bring her a present each time he does so - a thigh piece or two of meat, a fox, or some other present, as payment for being allowed to exercise his conjungal rights. More than once I have heard fathers order this thing or that - sometimes a great deal. The son-in-law obediently heard him out, but grumbled once out of sight and carried out only part of the promise. Often all this is a burdensome addition to the conditions agreed upon when the match was arranged.' <sup id="cite_ref-833" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-833">[833]</a></sup> 'When that time comes, and the bride brings less to the house than was expected, the bridegroom's relatives greet her very coldly. If the dowry is less than the amount agreed upon lawsuits and hostility [Page 861] begin. Often a complete break in relations takes place, if the marriage had not been sanctified in church. In the latter case the young bride is forced to remain in her bridegroom's home, but must suffer all sorts of nagging and persecution on the part of the family which absolutely poison her existence. I know of several cases when this persecution drove young women to flight or suicide. This is why Yakut who love their daughters try to give them as large a dowry as possible, so that her husband, father-in-law, and mother-in-law would respect her. (Kolymsk Ulus, 1883; Namsk Ulus, 1891). It is also easy to understand why parents try in every way possible to make their daughters' dowries appear larger than they actually are, just as the bridegroom's family tries to exaggerate the size of the kalym they have paid.' <sup id="cite_ref-834" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-834">[834]</a></sup> Samokvasov also provides a summary: 'When the Yakut marry, they give an agreed number of living and slaughtered cattle, and sometimes money, in installments, which is called kalym, for the wife. To compensate this loss, the bride's parents or her relatives who have arranged the match, give as a 222 dowry cattle, clothing, and sometimes money, for half of the whole agreed kalym. The wife cannot bring a dowry worth less than half the kalym, and to bring more, sometimes exceeding the whole kalym (which very rarely happens) is a matter for the discretion of her parents. Besides this, the bridegroom gives cattle to the bride's relatives at the wedding--or money, or animal skins. For these gifts, his wife, for a certain time, when she visits those relatives with presents for them, receives gifts herself, no less than ten head of cattle from each, or three times the value of the original gifts and the presents which she took with her. The excess of these gifts over the original gifts and presents is included in the compensation for the kalym. Therefore, in case of a rupture of the marriage, the wife or her relatives return the kalym to the husband, minus the dowry and the excess of the gifts; from which it follows that the Yakut wife possesses no property, unless she brought a dowry larger than the kalym, and unless she receives an award from her relatives or others after her marriage. Suits concerning kalyms have various causes, of which [Page 16] the main ones are the following: 1) Having lives several years with her husband, a wife suddenly leaves him on the grounds that he does not have any natural capacity for carnal relations; sometimes this is just, and, in that case, she is judged innocent; however, the kalym is returned, minus offspring and milk, but not until she marries another husband; but if her claim proves to be false, this proves her guilt and the fact that she left her husband because of lack of affectionate disposition to him; therefore, if she does not agree to stay with her husband, she herself, or her relatives pay back the kalym at the time of the divorce, with offspring and milk. 2) At the instigation of other, women marry them, and 223 in such a case, the instigators pay the kalym and all damages and are beaten with rods. 3)A husband abandons his wife: a)because of her dissolute behavior and poor running of the house; b) because of dislike for her, and as very frequently happens, dissoluteness of his own and love for another woman; in cases of this sort, the husband loses the right to demand the kalym. 4) Having taken each other during childhood by the will of the parents, and having no mutual affection, a couple divorce, and the wife's father or the relatives who married her off return half the kalym at the time of the divorce and the other half when she marries another man. 5) If a husband leaves his wife without any compelling reasons, not only does he not get the kalym back but he has to return the clothing and other objects of the dowry; the same right is enjoyed by the wife who leaves her husband because of cruel and mean treatment of her. 6) If a wife leaves her husband without any compelling reasons, her parents or the relatives who married her off must return the whole kalym, with the right of giving her in marriage for a kalym a second time. 7) If a wife's husband dies, the husband's parents do not have the right to give her in marriage again, but she herself, if she does not wish to stay in her husband's house, is free to marry without a kalym. 8) If a bride dies after being promised in marriage but still living at her father's house, and if there she had no sexual relations with the bridegroom, the whole kalym is returned immediately after her death, minus offspring and milk; but if she dies after having had sexual relations, a half-kalym is returned, without offspring or milk; when a widow marries a second time, similarly, the payment is made to the husband's relatives, if he dies after the promising of the bride but before she is taken into the house. 9) After a bride is promised to a bridegroom, after part or sometimes 224 all of the [Page 17] agreed kalym is paid, without any sins on the part of either bride or bridegroom, if the relatives are dissatisfied or if other potential mates are preferred or for various other reasons, and the bride or bridegroom refuses to marry, the bridegroom (if he is the one who refuses) is deprived of all the kalym which he has paid, and the bride (if she refuses) pays the bridegroom the whole kalym which he paid, plus offspring, milk, and other damages, even if she had sexual relations with him. 10) If the bridegroom of a promised bride proves unable to pay all or part of the kalym, then, if there were no carnal relations between the contracting parties, the bride and her relatives are free to refuse to proceed, and they return what he has paid; if there was sexual intercourse, the marriage is cancelled, but the kalym is paid, like an ordinary debt, through earnings, etc. 11) If the husband, after having the bride promised to him and having sexual intercourse with her, leaves her for three years without lawful reasons and does not take her, such a woman is free to marry another without giving back the kalym to the first one. 12) At the time of the wedding both the bride and the groom eat cattle, which is taken into account in case of a divorce, and this loss is paid by the one who is guilty in the divorce case.' <sup id="cite_ref-835" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-835">[835]</a></sup> Endogamy was more common among rich families in the North: 'We have previously mentioned the exogamic character of the Yakut marriages, but some other tendencies have been observed in the northern districts of Yakut Province. The few rich families endeavor to keep their horses, cattle, and grazing places within a certain group of families through marriage of close relatives, insofar as this is permitted by the Russian church. By special permission of a bishop, even cousins are permitted to marry. In one case, known to the author, a man lived with his niece, a marital relation forbidden by the Church, though his neighbors avoided mentioning this irregularity to strangers.' <sup id="cite_ref-836" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-836">[836]</a></sup> Wives/widows generally held fewer rights than men, but their legal status was improved during the Russian period: 'The absence of any rights on the part of woman, among the Yakuts of the district studied by M. Pripuzov, is most marked. . . in the field of property relations. Her personal position is at the present time considerably better protected than in earlier times. In this respect one notes in the life of the Yakuts a definite, although naturally a very relative progress. In effect, even at present, the husband considers himself within his rights to beat up his wife if she neglects her household duties, if she is a spendthrift, or if she is unfaithful to him. The Yakut further has the right to put his wife out to hire as a workwoman, and to use the money earned by her. But he does not have the right to kill her; he cannot sell her, or lend her to someone else.' <sup id="cite_ref-837" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-837">[837]</a></sup> 'The right of the widow in the event of a childless marriage to return to her own family, the right of the husband to arrange before his death for the return of the dowry to his widow--all these rules, it appears, rose under the influence of the progressive softening of views on the personal and property incapacity of women. At an earlier time she was completely the property of her husband’s group. Actually, we have no definite information concerning the existence of the levirate among the Yakuts at a former time; but the rules forbidding women to show themselves before the father-in-law and brothers-in-law, and vice versa, obviously bearing the character of so-called “sexual precaution” are traces of a one-time polyandry; finally, the absence among the Yakuts of any proper term for “widow,” etc. (Sieroszewski, 569), compel us to assume that at a more remote time 48 the widow was considered the personal property of the family of the husband and probably passed to them as a piece of property. ' <sup id="cite_ref-838" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-838">[838]</a></sup> 'Despite the fact that with respect to marriage the sons still are in a position of dependence upon the parents, their situation is considerably freer than that of the girls. A widowed daughter, returning to the parental home, again falls under the authority of the father; she is as devoid of rights as her young unmarried sister. The more independent position of the son is explained chiefly by the fact that the family and the clan prize children of the male sex more highly than those of the female sex: the birth of a boy is greeted by the Yakut with greater joy than the birth of a girl. Yakuts who do not have sons are scorned by their neighbors: they call them khatirik-uoma, i.e. “fire from bark (?).” The small esteem in which girl children are held by the Yakuts is indicated by the rule, whereby 54 a widow who marries for a second time must leave her sons by the first marriage with the family of her husband; but the daughters, as an unnecessary element in the family group, she can take with her to her new family. This rule is obviously of comparativelyrecent origin: it could arise only after the widow became free in general to marry outside of the confines of her husband’s group, and after the kalym had begun to lose its significance of a purchase price for the bride, and had begun to return to the family of the bridegroom in the form of a dowry. Gaining nothing by giving a daughter in marriage, the Yakut familial-household group naturally regards daughters as a completely superfluous element in the family, and sets no value on them.' <sup id="cite_ref-839" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-839">[839]</a></sup> Divorce was practiced in the form of 'ceding' the wife to a lover: 'Instances of the cession of wives to other men, as is known, were encountered among the Yakuts up to the end of the 18th century, while the existence of the custom of lending one’s wife to a guest is substantiated by traditions (Vseso[unknown]iuzone Geograficheskoe ob[unknown]shchestvo, Vostochno-Sibirskii Otdel, Izviest[unknown]iia, XXVI, No. 4-5, pp. 218-19). As concerns instances of putting our wives to work, Prince Kostrov (Ocherk iuridicheskoe byta IAkutov [Juridical Customs of the Yakut]. p. 283) communicates the rather interesting fact that this practice has as its object to effect a separation from the wife: after a church wedding the Yakut rarely leaves his wife, but since such marriages are often consummated against the will of the parties involved, the husband sometimes abandons his wife, who customarily finds herself a lover, to whom she goes to live. In order to avoid prosecution by the authorities, writes Prince Kostrov, the husband and the lover make an oral and sometimes even written agreement to the effect that the former is hiring his wife out to the latter in the capacity of a servant with her consent and for the upkeep of the household.' <sup id="cite_ref-840" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-840">[840]</a></sup> ***UPDATE: maybe change to absent as one paragraph states tat polygyny continued to be practiced in the colonial period.
</p><p><b>♠ Ideology reinforces prosociality ♣ present ♥</b>

<dl><dd><b>♠ charity ♣ absent ♥</b> Cooperative herding was practiced in the summer: 'In summer the herds of several owners unite to form one big herd which is often quite large in size. In the first place, such large herds formed from smaller ones result in economizing of the working forces, since a considerably smaller number of people is required to look after these large herds 185 [Figure 1] than is needed for the separate smaller herds which united to form the larger one; in the second place, when dark clouds, gnats, and gadflies pass over the tundra, the large herd does not disperse like the small herds do; the reindeer bunch up and keep revolving constantly, since each one of the circling group tries to squeeze into the center in order to protect his sides from the bites of the gnats. When they drive the reindeer to the camp, the latter do this “circle dance” of theirs around the chooms, which threatens to knock them down. In the case of animals with such habits very few persons are required to pasture a large herd, since the only work they have to do amounts to driving the strays back into the herd.' <sup id="cite_ref-841" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-841">[841]</a></sup> 'Another advantage of having the large herds in summer is the fact that there is a sufficiently large number of workers for the times when it is necessary to guard the herd day and night--at the time when the grass grows in spring, and during the mushroom period in the summer; the sufficiently large number of people makes it possible for them to take regular shifts at the pasture, which almost never has the effect of withdrawing the working forces in the economy.' <sup id="cite_ref-842" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-842">[842]</a></sup> Mutual aid between families was practiced in pitching hay: 'Ordinarily they try to place grass which has been mowed early into large ricks, for this reason also, that these ricks will have to stand the whole summer, since the Yakut throw the hay into haystacks only after they have finished all the mowing, in the last days of August or even the early part of September. It sometimes happens that downpours, which come down for whole weeks at a time in the end of July and in August, penetrate right through the small ricks, and the hay in them rots, burns, and blackens. Even in large ricks a thick crust of rotten hay always forms, and the bottom of the rick, if it has been lying on the ground, and not on a peg, rots a great deal. Only the middle of the rick remains green. This admixture of black, rotten hay is quite considerable, in view of the small size of the ricks, and given even the finest Yakut hay, which has been gathered at the proper time and has been carefully dried, a greyish color. [Page 499] Such greyish-green hay is preferred by the Yakut and is called Yakut, to distinguish it from bright green hay gathered by Russian methods, i.e. first dried out in the open air right where it has been mowed for twenty-four hours, then tedded and turned over, and heaped together on the third day, in good weather, then placed in large ricks weighing four or five poods, and finally raked into haystacks as soon as possible, as soon as the weather and the assignment of labor permits. This method of work is recommended by government ukases, whose printed blanks I saw in native upravas; it is well known to the non-Russians, particularly those who live near Russian villages and cities. The introduction of these improvements is hindered by the parallelism of household arrangements throughout the whole region which is to a considerable degree necessary, for example, the custom of opening or closing the meadows to the cattle at certain definite times, the certain sequence in which arable land is mowed, and also the necessity of pitching hay everywhere at the same time. Far from all Yakut families have the strength to pitch all the hay from their spacious farmsteads in one or two days all by themselves and quickly. On the other hand it is dangerous to continue this work very long, in view of the changeability of the weather in the second half of the local summer. They are forced to pitch hay in company with 280 other families. This makes each individual homestead owner dependent on the general progress of the labor. In families which can get along without outside help, they always try to pitch part of the hay as early as possible, in the middle of the summer. The Yakut yearning to mow as much hay as possible forces them just as naturally to treasure every day of good weather in the first half of the summer, when the grasses have not yet hardened and dried up. When the grass is already moved and put into ricks, then it is another matter. It is then that all kinds of mutual help - keme and gulyay Begin, and families join together in small [Page 500] cartels for pitching the hay. They bring the hay to the [unknown] in sleds on wh ich they pla ce not more than four or five ricks which are tightened by belts placed slantwise. At the [unknown]they overturn the sleds. In this way, enormous heaps of hay arise around the from here they systematically pile the hay into haystacks with pitchforks. Among the various kinds of pitchforks, atyrdzhakh, there is one enormous one, reaching a length of two sagenes. The Yakut are not familiar with the application of beams and with lifting up the hay in whole cart-loads. Their haystacks are small; year after year they place them in the same places, on the very highest points of the meadows where they will not be swamped with floods and the water from snows in spring. They always put the worst grasses as a foundation for the [unknown]&nbsp;: they will dampen and blacken in any case. They put the best grass in the middle of the stacks, and the more moist grass at the edges. Workers, usually women or youths, trample hard on the edges and kill the grass. Every man who raises and piles the hay with a pitchfork needs one youth on the haystack and one or two youths with the bulls in the sled, and two rakers. Such a number of Yakut workers are able to pitch from twenty-five to thirty loads of hay (cubic sagenes) in one day, i.e. to transfer from one place to another, carry away, and lift to a certain height from five to six hundred Yakut ricks each weighing one pood. The haystacks are round or rectangular in shape; the latte r shape is preferred, particularly for damp hay which has been wettened by rain.' <sup id="cite_ref-843" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-843">[843]</a></sup> Social life was characterized by a lot of ad hoc mutualism: 'Among the Yakut there are only temporary co-operative unions [Page 680] in use. These are very popular. Two fisherman who come together a t the same fishing place will immediately organize a company. They will fish together and divide the catch equally. Several wood-choppers who chop wood in the same vicinity will also enter into a company, because this is more fun. Mowers often join together into small brigades consisting of five or six men and will mow the meadows of each member in turn (Namsk Ulus, 1889). A peasant woman will help her neighbor rake, in return for the same service, and it has practically become a custom to pitch hay by combining the joint strength of two or three households and doing each household's work in turn. Besides this, neighbors constantly exchange a great number of small services which demand a special skill; the number of these is beyond calculation. Cutting and sewing a dress, gluing together a broken dish, catching and restraining a raging stallion, squaring a door, finding a lost piece of livestock, and so forth -- a whole mass of services, whose total far exceeds those which are paid for by agreement, are exchanged without causing any particular misunderstanding. It is also remarkable that all these unions have clearly expressed within them the foundations of artels: equal distribution of labor and equal partnership is called kompaniya, as in Russian, although the Yakut have their own word: kytyk - kytykas, 428 which expresses this conception quite well. They also use the Russian word gulyay for the support of beggars; in the Yakut language this word is komo. The word is used by prosperous people who can afford to extend certain hospitality, or by the needy paupers themselves. The latter bow from the waist to their neighbors, give them some [Page 681] small present: a brick of tea, one ruble in money, and if the reasons presented by the petitioner were sufficiently valid, then the one supplicated will carry out the work without repayment, at his own expense: he will build a house, mow the meadow, chop and deliver kindling wood. For rich Yakut, princes, and all personages who are influential in their neighborhood, this custom of aid is exceedingly profitable. It is impossible to refuse them, while the hospitality they extent is always calculated so that it costs them less than it would to hire a laborer. The day for gulyay begins at sunrise and ends at sunset. During the working day the laborers are only fed once and given tea once; the main hospitality is extended after the work is done. Sometimes the owner brings his helpers a glass of vodka apiece; this is considered a great honor. The food given consists of kumiss or tea, milk, butter, flour, and meat. Usually they slaughter a piece of livestock and cook part of it, while the rest is given out raw as a present. Besides mowing hay, aid is given in the form of building houses, harrowing, carrying hay, and in general all kinds of work where collected efforts are useful and applicable. Only paupers and homeowners of average means are invited for aid; rich people consider it shameful for them to take part in this.' <sup id="cite_ref-844" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-844">[844]</a></sup> But this does not seem to constitute charity.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ production of public goods ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> We are unsure which norms or institutions would qualify was public goods in a pastoralist society.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ communal dining ♣ present ♥</b> Feasting was practiced at festivals and weddings. Jochelson describes Kumiss festivals: "Spring festival is called Ayy ysyaxa (“kumiss festival in honor of the ‘creators’ ”). During the summer, in olden times, every rich man arranged a kumiss festival, at which all members of the clan assembled and were entertained. Other people, and frequently whole clans, were invited; and during the festival, defensive and offensive leagues were concluded. Every such festival commenced with sacrifices, and was accompanied with songs, dances, games, horse and foot races, and other contests. The spring kumiss festival takes place in the open air. In the midst of a large smooth grass meadow a kind of altar is erected. This consists of two posts with a crossbeam, and three young birch-trees with young shoots on them. The altar is hung round with sacrificial horsehair, and on the ground in front of it are placed ornamented birch-bark and ox-hide barrels filled with kumiss. The skin barrels are tied to the altar-frame by long ornamented straps of soft elk-leather. The ceremony commences by sacrifices to Lord Bright-Creator and to other “creators.” Their names are uttered by the steward of the festival, who may be a shaman or an elder member of the clan. The sacrifices consist of libations of kumiss, in the direction of the dawn. The steward addresses a prayer to the “creators,” begging for blessings,-increase of horses and cattle, a good harvest of hay, good health for the people and animals, and an abundance of food. Then he takes the kumiss-festival ladle , and makes a libation, in the direction of the dawn, to the benevolent deities . Then, while making a libation to the ground, he addresses the local deity, “the owner of the place” (än doidu iccitä), asking him not to harm the inhabitants of the spot and the members of the clan. After that, the steward, with the help of the sacrificial ladle, proceeds to divine. He throws the ladle towards the sky: and if it falls with the front part upwards, it portends the granting by the deities of future abundance; and all the people utter the joyful cry Uru!   Then the boys and girls give the goblets with the sacrificial kumiss, according to the directions of the steward, to the elder and honored members of the clan, both male and female. These, after placing themselves,-the men on the right and the women on the left of the altar,-drink off the kumiss from the goblets, and pass them on to the less important and the younger people." <sup id="cite_ref-845" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-845">[845]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-846" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-846">[846]</a></sup> Weddings were subject to a high degree of ritualization, resembling peacemaking procedures between two families: 'Traditionally, for wealthy Yakut, marriage could be polygamous. More common, however, was monogamy, with occasional remarriage after the death of a spouse. Arranged marriages were sometimes politically motivated. Patrilineage exogamy was reckoned strictly; those one could marry were called SYGAN. Until the 1920s many marriage arrangements were complicated and protracted, involving financial, emotional, and symbolic resources of the bride's and groom's extended families. This included the matchmaking ritual; several formal payments of animals, furs, and meat to the bride's family; informal gifts; and extensive dowries. Some families permitted poor grooms to work in their households as a replacement for the bride-price. Occasionally bride-capture occurred (it may have been more common in pre-Russian times). Wedding ceremonies and their attendant feasts, prayers, and dancing, were held first at the household of the bride's parents, then at that of the groom's. The couple usually lived or settled in a nearby yurt.' <sup id="cite_ref-847" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-847">[847]</a></sup>//Kharuzin also describes the wedding proceedings: 'On the day of the wedding the choom of the father of the bride and that of the father of the bridegroom were set up side by side. Depending on the degree of their prosperity the owner of each of the chooms slaughtered between one and five deer and treated the assembled guests. In addition, the bridegroom slaughtered one more deer and sent its meat to the father of the bride. Aided by his friends the bridegroom would next catch the deer for the black kalym. At the same time, near the choom of the bride, other young men caught deer that were to be handed over as dowry. Out on the street, in the meanwhile, the bride would dance in the company of her girl friends and of other young men. Having caught the deer for the black kalym, the young men tied them up to the back of the narta of the match-maker who, with the deer behind him, rode in front of the bridegroom.//'Upon approaching the choom of the bride the matchmaker and the bridegroom rode around her choom in the direction of the movement of the sun. The matchmaker would then enter the choom alone and announce: The son-in-law has arrived. At the same time the people present would let the deer in a special enclosure built by stretching lassoes between trees and by setting up of overturned nartas . A great number of guests would arrive together with the bridegroom. Out on the street the matchmaker would lead the bridegroom to the father of the bride. The bridegroom would pull behind him a vazhenka ( nyal'dzhin ) tied to a leather strap. Upon approaching his future father-in-law he would hand the animal over to him. The bridegroom together with the guests would then remain outside while in the choom preparations were made for a feast and a wedding bed was set up for the newlyweds. The making of the bed was entrusted to one of the relatives of the bride.//'While the guests stood outside and waited for the beginning of the feast, the matchmaker would make numerous sorties from the choom of the bride and in a light-hearted way inform them of what was going on inside the choom. At the same time the father of the bride would received the deer of the black kalym. In the east tundra all the brought deer were accepted without any argument; in the Noril'-skiy rayon, however, the father of the bride would frequently pronounce some animals unacceptable and would send them back expecting other animals in their stead. In the case of a demanding father the business of receiving the deer would occasionally extend into the late evening.//'If the father of the bride was a snob he wold make the guests freeze outside for a long time. When, at long last, the feast and the bed were ready and the deer of the black kalym all checked, the match-maker would lead the bridegroom into the choom and would make him pray in front of the ikons. The bride stationed herself by the side of the bridegroom and prayed together with him. After the prayers were ended the matchmaker would say to the bridegroom: Bow to the big father-in-law and ask for his blessing. The bride and the bridegroom would then make a low bow before the parents and came up to receive their blessing as well as the blessing of the relatives older than the bride. All of them blessed the young people, gave them their hands to kiss, and proffered their best wishes. The matchmaker would at this point, give ten rubles to the father of the bride, and to all her relatives pieces of cloth and kerchiefs. In Noril'sk in the place of money the matchmaker gave the bride's father a fox skin, and to her mother a polar fox skin or a fur coat. These presents were called yungyu --prayer or request. After these presents had been made all the relatives of the bride got up and shook the bridegroom's hand. There were no handshakes between these relatives and the members of the bridegroom's entourage.//'After the blessing ceremony was over the bride and the bridegroom were placed behind the bed curtain. Only then would the guests be let in in a strictly observed order. The guests would be brought in from outside by the relatives, who would lead them by the hand--the adult relatives accompanying the adult guests, and children-relatives--other children. The guests would be taken to places that were asssigned to them. The closest relatives and the most honored guests as well as foreigners (Yakut, Russians, Tungus) would be let in first. To avoid mistakes the relatives of the bride asked their friends as to who should come in and in what order. Before the guests were let in two people would be selected from among those who were known for their talents as improvisers. The two chosen men were to play the role of people who predict the future ( yr kerderer dzhon ). One of these men was selected by the relatives of the bridegroom, the other----by the relatives of the bride. The presence of these men was not an essential part of the wedding ceremony.//'When all the honored guests were seated the bride's father would ask them: Guests! What do you have to say? The matchmaker would answer: We have a word to say. Then a representative of the bridegroom would get us and colorfully and ornately would describe the future life of the young people and the peace and harmony of their household. He would also describe the number of the children they were going to have, how rich they were going to be, etc. He would end his speech by saying: My words ended, now is your turn. Thereupon a similar speech would be make by a representative of the bride. The guests predicted a happier life for the bridegroom or the bride, depending on which side gave the better speech. After this a woman relative of the bride poured out tea and took charge of the serving of the food. After the first meal, i.e. after drinking the tea, and before the opening of the table ( ostuolu asyar inniger ), i.e. the serving of the meal, all the guests would go out on the street and dance until the second meal was served. The ceremony of distributing the kalym ( sulu tuttarar ) would be taking place at the same time.//'The wedding bed was transported to the choom of the bridegroom before the arrival of the bride herself. In front of the procession rode the matchmaker; he was followed by the bridegroom, behind whom was the bride, and behind the latter the deer loaded with the bride's dowry. The bride put on two coats made out of cloth ( sontap ) and a Siberian fur-coat ( dokha ), embroidered with patterns ( ardaydakh sangyyakh ). In the Noril'skiy rayon the size of the dowry was decided upon in the course of the negotiations conducted by the matchmaker; in other places the custom was different and the size of the dowry depended on that of the kalym. If the kalym consisted of sixty deer, the number of deer given with the dowry would be forty-five. A rich dowry consisted of sixty or seventy selected deer of various ages, among them no harness or old deer. Nor more than two or three deer could be included in a rich dowry. In addition to the deer a rich dowry would consist of seven and the poor one of five nartas, harnessed to the best deer (a pair of deer harnessed to each narta of the rich dowry, and a single deer harnessed to each narta of the poor one). In addition to the nartas a dowry included a narta choom, to which were harnessed four deer.//'When the bride's train approached the choom of the bridegroom, the matchmaker would go to the parents of the bridegroom and announced to them the arrival of the bride. The newlyweds would then travel three times around the choom in the direction of the movement of the sun. In the Noril'skiy rayon the bride rode around the choom by herself; after she had entered the choom the deer were led around the choom by some one else. This ceremony was called the entrance of the hearth ( sarany bullarar ). The bride was led into the choom of the bridegroom by a respected old woman who could not be her relative. The bride and the bridegroom prayed together before the ikon, and then, with a deep bow to the bridegroom's father and mother, asked for their blessing and came up to kiss their hands. The parents of the bridegroom then blessed the newlyweds and wished them a happy life. At this point the bride would give the bridegroom's parents presents of money or of valuable skins; these presents had to be much more valuable that those given by the bridegroom to the parents of the bride, for the father of the bride would want to put up a front before the bridegroom's father. In the bridegroom's choom the guests were again treated to a feast, which was served to them in two shifts. In the ancient times a shaman would always be invited to a wedding. Before the beginning of the feast he would stand dressed not in his ceremonial but in his ordinary garments, and leaning upon a deer staff of the bride called upon beneficent gods and spirits to be kind to the newlywed, and for himself wished them a happy and prosperous life. After this address by the shaman the first group of honored guests sat down to the feast.'//'The bridegroom's father would next come out to glance at the deer that were brought as a dowry, and offered the people who helped him in the equipping of the kalym to chose the animals they wanted.//'After the end of the festivities the father would inspect the dowry in the light of the day (this custom was not practised by the Noril'skiye Dolgani): he would go out of the choom, open up the trunks and examine their contents. If it turned out that the amount of the dowry was not equivalent to the amount of the kalym, the stinginess of the bride's parents would be disapprovingly commented on by all those present. As a rule, the father of the bride tried to include in the dowry as many valuable things as he could, for fear that otherwise he might disgrace himself. The inspection described above ended the ceremonies of the Dolgani wedding. The assembled guests would spend the day in eating, in games and in dancing, and would depart in the late evening. The father and the mother of the bride stayed with the bridegroom for a period of three days. Before their departure the father of the bridegroom would present the parents of the bride with one deer (ogo kereryu) which was to be looked upon by them as their daughter. The animal thus given as a present was highly valued. On the morning of the third day the young wife poured out tea. During the tea drinking her father would publicly instruct her as follows: From this time on you must obey your husband. Your mother-in-law now stands in the place of your own mother. Your father-in-law in the place of your father. Respect and obey them and do not quarrel with them.' <sup id="cite_ref-848" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-848">[848]</a></sup>//Elders played a prominent role alongside parents and shamans: 'The oldest kinsman in the clan, or the [unknown]iye-[unknown]usa , is always heaped with honors, if he is both rich and has never been put on trial. To him pertains the jurisdiction in trifling quarrels between kinsfolk. The following ceremonies serve to recall the religious functions that he (Ysekh) formerly exercised a. At the time of the spring festival, which bears a strictly clan character, they bring to him, first of all, a large wooden vessel ( Choron ) containing kumiss; he pronounces a prayer of thanks to the gods and then pours the kumiss upon the fire. b. At the time of the arrival of the betrothed at the bridegroom’s yurt, they take from the sleigh of the betrothed, and place upon a table in front of the fire place the boiled head of a horse, whose eyes are covered with butter, to whose ears are attached intestines filled with horse’s blood, and a wooden cup filled with butter. After this the betrothed enters the yurt, and stands, having first untied her girdle, on the right side of the komelok [RCH: i. e., the fireplace] where she is met by the oldest kinsman, whose place is sometimes taken nowadays by the most honored guest, who, kneeling, throws into the fire 41 pieces of meat, blood and butter, and blesses the bride. For the completion of this ceremony, whose obvious object is to unite the bride with the bridegroom’s home, the oldest kinsman secures for his use the head, blood and butter brought into the yurt, and in addition the sum of one ruble.' <sup id="cite_ref-849" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-849">[849]</a></sup>//</dd>

<dd><b>♠ Ideology forbids slavery universally ♣ absent ♥</b> Prisoners of war were traditionally kept as slaves by toyons: 'Kinship and politics were mixed in the hierarchical council system that guided AQA-USA, AIMAK, and DZHON. Yakut explanations of DZHON in the nineteenth century included concepts like "people," "community," or "tribe," territorially defined. Councils were composed of ranked circles of elders, usually men, whose leaders, TOYONS, were called nobles by Russians. A lineage head was BIS-USA-TOYON; respected warriors and hunters were BATYR. Lineage councils decided major economic issues, interfamily disputes, and questions of blood revenge for violence committed against the group. AIMAK and DZHON councils were infrequent, dealing with issues of security, revenge, alliance, and, before Russian control, war. Through war, slaves were captured for service in the wealthiest TOYON households. Kin-based councils were rare by the nineteenth century and had little influence on twentieth-century politics. Yet in the Soviet period Yakut remain aware of regional and kin ties and help kin obtain jobs and political positions. In this period the Yakut elite, some of whom are Communist party members, revived certain traditions, participating in wedding ceremonies and annual festivals once associated with council meetings. To avoid doing so would be impolitic. Yakut have demanded greater economic and political autonomy from Moscow and some Yakut politicians, including the elected president, are reformers implementing the new republic constitution. A major ecological movement and democratically elected councils are trying to redress local grievances.' <sup id="cite_ref-850" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-850">[850]</a></sup> Dependents were considered part of the patriarchal household: 'At the head of the family was the aga, meaning primarily “elder in age” and then “father.” All the people of the household were regarded as and called by him “my children,” “my sons or my daughters.” Among these were included not only his own children, but also all relatives by blood and marriage, by adoption, by purchase (slaves), and any other dependents, as war captives. The aga continued to rule as long as he preserved his physical and mental abilities. According to a Yakut tradition, aged parents and also sick and crippled people, unable to work, were doomed to die and were even buried alive after three days of abundant entertainment.' <sup id="cite_ref-851" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-851">[851]</a></sup> Slaves were occasionally included in dowry payments: 'Afterwards enne kulut were slaves included in a bride's dowry. If they were women they became the concubines of the master. (Namsk Ulus, 1891).' <sup id="cite_ref-852" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-852">[852]</a></sup> 'One way or another, among the Yakut hexogamy was accompanied by war 560 and slavery. It is a very usual thing for Yakut legends to mention slaves given to a conqueror together with a daughter.' <sup id="cite_ref-853" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-853">[853]</a></sup> Slavery and serfdom continued into the Russian period and it is unclear when precisely the practice was abandoned: 'It is understandable that here as everywhere else the conquerors first of all tried to make use of the clan leaders to facilitate the gathering of yassak and pacification. They named them princelings [Page 782] and wealthy people of the ulus and made them responsible for arrears and disorders, took hostages, and translators from them, and forced them to pay contributions. Afterwards, when the government became convinced that the Cossack carnival was threatening the interest of the government, was impoverishing the population to the bone, and by its unbearable taxation and cruelties was forcing the population to scatter, inciting it into rebellion and disobedience, it tried to give those same princelings and wealthy people of the ulus control over their rapacious servants. They were entrused to be present as witnesses at the gathering of yassak, at inquiries, and all other matters arising between the soldiers and officials who had come and the local population. Later they were charge to stamp with their own stamps the furs given as yassak, so that the soldiers would not exchange them on the way. of the whole clan. They were not slow to take advantage of this. All this raised them to an unparalleled height in 495 the eyes of the population; when afterwards it was acknowledged that it would be better to divide the yassak by clans and uluses and, without inquiring into the distribution and means of exaction, to [Page 783] demand it in full from the clan leaders, the princelings, turned completely into land officials. They began to be encouraged and rewarded for their service by signs of excellence: medals, cutlasses, and caftans, and by a decree of the Senate, on February 1, 1740 and May 17, 1764, they were even assigned a constant recompense, depending on the amount of yassak brought in. A salary to the yassak princelings and those elected as yassak officials: for every 1000 rubles of yassak brought into the treasury, a salary of 20 rubles to each as a gift, and if the amount is smaller or greater than 1000 rubles, to take this into calculation. Encouraged and supported from outside, the princelings little by little freed themselves from the clan traditions and began to oppress the people no less than the Cossacks. Being perfectly acquanited with the conditions of life they were able to enter into agreements with the voivodes and clerks, keeping the whole matter concealed, and under protection conduct themselves in their lands in their lands as if they owned them: they seized land, levy taxes without any control, introduce serfdom, and even buy and sell people. It is a dark memory and bad habits that the princes of that time have left behind them. There was only one way in which the people benefited by the fact that they replaced the Russian officials: they became accustomed to battle for their own interest under new conditions. The princes were their own people, the aura of a conqueror did not surround them, they had nowhere to go with their plundered riches, and even formerly the people had been forced to keep them in check, in their capacity as heads of the clan.' <sup id="cite_ref-854" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-854">[854]</a></sup> It is unclear how many people were enslaved or enserfed.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Number of officially sanctioned supernatural beings ♣ polytheistic ♥</b> 'Saints and bears are seen as shamanic spirit helpers. Christ is identified with the Yakut Bright Creator Elder God, Aiyy-toyon. A pantheon of gods, believed to live in nine hierarchical eastern heavens, was only one aspect of a complex traditional cosmology that still has meaning for some Yakut. Another crucial dimension was the spirit-soul (ICHCHI) of living beings, rocks, trees, natural forces, and objects crafted by humans. Most honored was the hearth spirit (YOT ICHCHITE), still fed morsels of food and drink by pious Yakut. Giant trees (AL LUKH MAS), deep in the forest, were especially sacred: their ICHCHI are still given small offerings of coins, scarves, and ribbons. Belief in ICHCHI is related to ancient ideas of harmony and equilibrium with nature, and to shamanism. Yakut shamanism is a Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic blend of belief in the supernatural, with emphasis on the ability of "white," or benign, shamans to intercede, through prayers and séances, with eastern spirits for the sake of humans. "Black" shamans, communing with evil spirits, could both benefit and harm humans.'<sup id="cite_ref-938" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-938">[938]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b>♠ High Gods (creator gods) ♣ active ♥</b> Sakha spirits and deities appear qualify as high gods, in that they have created and rule over reality. 'Originally, Tangara-the sky god, the father of the gods, typologically comparable to the Rigvedic D’iaus, and to the Latin concept of “god” (D’iaus-Deos-Theo)-was supposed to occupy the dominant position among the aiyy deities. Later, this image was embodied in the central figure of the Yakut pantheon, Iuriung Aiyy toion, the “White Creator God,” the god of light, the personified image of the Sun, with the functions of sovereign of the Universe. Then came the other aiyy deities. A particularly important place was occupied by Aal Uot ichchite, the spirit of sacred fire-both of the sacrificial flame and of the domestic hearth. Like the Arian Agni, Aal Uot ichchite was considered to be the protector of the family and the giver of good fortune and healthy offspring. If the goddess Ieiiekhsit was regarded as the messenger of Iuriung Aiyy toion, then the spirit of fire fulfilled the function of intermediary between earth and heaven, between humanity and the gods.' <sup id="cite_ref-940" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-940">[940]</a></sup> However, it appears they were not moralizing. 'Very characteristic of the Yakut beliefs is the absence of conceptions of paradise and hell and the lack of any idea of retaliation as we understand it. The Yakut word aj[unknown]y usually translated, sin, means more properly, harm, damage; for instance, aj[unknown]y is used when milk is spoiled by a mouse falling into it, or, when a man’s bed is contaminated by a frog.'<sup id="cite_ref-941" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-941">[941]</a></sup> 'The Yakut love life and hold the present in very high esteem, but the future, particularly that which will come after death, does not concern them particularly. Any conception of the aims of existence and of the future fate of all living things, of the end of the world, or of what will happen to a man after his death is relatively weakly developed among them. Those few ideas on the subject which they borrowed from the Russians together with Christianity have somehow dried up in their minds, become dim, and have been delegated to the background. If we except the pale and corrupted Biblical paraphrases of the end of the world, paradise, and hell, they have hardly any beliefs on the bond between life on earth and life after death in the sense of punishment or reward.'<sup id="cite_ref-942" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-942">[942]</a></sup> 'The Yakut Satan, that allara abasy ogonior (the old man-spirit of the underworld) who is sometimes also called Satan, is a quite different conception, although recently he took has begun to take on some of the attributes of his Biblical equivalent. For example, he is called the king of the evil spirits, abasy yrakhta, although he is by no means considered to be the most powerful among the fetishes and spirits embodying the evil and harmful forces of nature. It is noteworthy that the Yakut world conception does not bear any mystical facets; they are aware of harmful, helpful, and indifferent phenomena, but no sinful phenomena. The concept of grace, as a result of the victory by the spirit over the body, mortification of the flesh, chastity, humility, and other ascetic ideals, is completely foreign to them. They have the word aji - sin, but the meaning of this word is quite different. I myself have not been able to establish completely just what concepts this word includes, but most probably it is the idea of suffering. In the past they said arakh; this is the same as aji. (Namsk Ulus, 1889). The concepts of faith as virtue and doubt as sin are both equally incomprehensible to them.'<sup id="cite_ref-943" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-943">[943]</a></sup> 'I shall close this brief sketch of Yakut beliefs with a description of a cult which differs from all the gloomy beliefs I have heretofore described by its light and joyous character. The basis of this cult consists in the worship of fertility, abundance, wealth, and in general everything which aids in the maintenance and rebirth of life. All the gods, guardians, and bestowers of these blessings live in the east. Their priests are called the white or light shamans (yuryung ai oyuna) they were once called summer shamans (saingy), because the feasts (ysyakh) in honor of these divinities are usually held in the summer.' <sup id="cite_ref-944" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-944">[944]</a></sup></dd></dl>

After their death the souls of these people were to become heretics (sic) (dzheretinnik), who would frighten the living, for they would remain by their graves and would not depart for the land of the dead. However, if without getting married a girl gave birth to children, her soul was not turned into a heretic. At the same time it was considered a sin for a widower to marry again. A married couple would rarely break up, for fear of committing a sin thereby. In selecting his first wife a man was believed to be following a course predetermined for him by a beneficent god: the particular woman he selected was believed to have been born specially for him and had been fated to be his wife. If upon the death of his wife the widower remarried it was believed that the ayy (a beneficent god) would stop treating him with good will (aytytyn eyetya aragar). It was thought that the ayy did not select ten wives for a man, but only one. As a result, the second marriage was believed to be entered into without the approval of the ayy, but of the man's own free will. When a man who had been married to two women died, it was believed that he would unite with his first wife, while his second wife would reside separately with her maternal relatives. If upon the death of his second wife a man would marry for the third time, it was believed that such conduct was inspired by the evil spirit--abasy, and was very sinful. After his [Page 23] death such man, as well as his wives, would to into the region inhabited by the abasy.'<sup id="cite_ref-965" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-965">[965]</a></sup></dd>

When the house, stall, and shelter for cattle are ready, each of these buildings, as well as the new fireplace, has its own “owners” with whom it is important to enter into good relations. To procure food and clothing for the family it is necessary to hunt in the woods and to fish in the lakes, but forests and waters have their own owners, without whose permission one cannot use the utilities they supervise. That the family may have adequate provision, the cattle must propagate, and for this, corresponding spirits must be propitiated. For the cattle, one needs to store hay, but grass grows in places belonging to particular owners.

<dl><dd><b>♠ care/harm ♣ absent ♥</b> According to Sieroszewski, strength was valued above care-giving obligations: 'I received such answers to my plainly put questions as to the leadership of the family from everyone, in all the corners of the Yakutsk Oblast, but at the present time they express no more than a certain ideal to long for, a morality like the Christian love thy neighbor as thyself. In actual practice the Yakut family is quite a different thing, and only the subordination of women is strictly drawn. The subordination of the younger to the elder is in its turn subject to a still more general rule: the subordination of the weaker to the stronger, and of the poor to the rich. It is true that I have heard of many cases where the father, eldest brother, or uncle forced younger members of the household to marry, gave them to outsiders to work under very harsh conditions and kept all they pay themselves. I know of a case where the father took possession of the son's belongings, took away his axe and boat, sold the hay which his son had mowed all by himself, and the son only bewailed his fate and could not do anyt hing. (Kolymsk Ulus, 1883). I know of a case where the parents sold their eight year old daughter to an official who was passing through. (Borogon Ulus, 1884). Many times I have heard and seen the older members of a family cruelly beat their relatives, [Page 806] particularly wives and children, but I know of an equal number of cases where the opposite has taken place. I know of cases where the younger brothers played a more important role in the family than the elder brothers; where sons beat their aged parents until they went into tears; where a wife, unconstrained by the presence of outsiders, treated her sick, feeble husband very rudely, and even beat him and openly kept a lover in the house. (Kolymsk Ulus, 1883), Namsk Ulus 511 1888). I have also heard of a daughter, realizing that she was the only worker in the house, paid absolutely no attention to her parents, did what she wished, refused a profitable marriage, and went around with boys in front of everyone's eyes.

Despite the fact that the type of the individual, i. e., “small” family, thus appears characteristic for the contemporary familial-household structure of the Yakuts of the Yakutsk district, the clan structure must by no means be counted in the number of completely vanished phenomena. In addition to the known division of the Yakuts into [unknown]ul[unknown]usi and naslegi , a division which one of the best investigators of Yakut life, M. Sieroszewski, does not recognize as indigenous to the Yakuts, the native population of the Yakutsk district, as in other localities of the region, continues to retain the ancient division into clans-- aga-usa (the paternal clan), resolving itself into 4-8 [unknown]iya-[unknown]usa . This latter term M. Pripuzov translates by the word “tribe”; M. Sieroszewski, who, as far as we know, was the first to turn his attention to the [unknown]iya-[unknown]usa , has observed that [unknown]iya-[unknown]usa ( [unknown]iye-[unknown]usa ) has the exact meaning of “maternal clan,” has described the significance that the latter has in the contemporary clan division of the Yakuts, and has set forth a hypothesis concerning the origin of the “maternal clan” among the Yakuts. [Page 38-39] At the present time, relationship within the limits of the iye-usa is traced through the male line, and M. Sieroszewski makes the extremely likely guess that the division of the paternal clan into several maternal clans is a natural consequence of the polygamy that was once practiced among the Yakuts. Monogamous marriage took a firm hold among the Yakuts only at the beginning of the 19th century. The aga-[unknown]usa included all the descendants taking their descent from one father, while each [unknown]iye-[unknown]usa included only the issue of one of his wives. The supposition of M. Sieroszewski has a great deal of verisimilitude. 39 In reality, however, where polygamy leads to the above-mentioned division of the paternal clan into several maternal clans, it only plays the role of a factor supporting in life the reckoning of relationship through the female line, and not the reason which gave rise to it: only upon the basis of an already existing custom of reckoning relationship through the wife’s line can the maternal clan arise, either as an independent organization, or as a sub-grouping of the paternal clan. Consequently, how ever the [unknown]iye-[unknown]usa may have arisen among the Yakuts, its existence must be in fact regarded as a proof that there once existed among the Yakuts the custom of determining relationship through the wife’s line, the recollection of an epoch when the bonds uniting child and father were not yet taken into account. The fact cited by M. Sieroszewski, that according to tradition many paternal clans ( aga-[unknown]usa ) and even entire naslegi , took their designation from women, strengthens this supposition. The chief significance in the contemporary structure of the Yakuts, however, attaches to the aga-[unknown]usa , the paternal clan.' <sup id="cite_ref-999" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-999">[999]</a></sup> The father's clan was structurally more important than the mother's clan: 'Following this presentation of the complete list of Yakut terms of relationship, two points remain to be cleared up: first, the function of the Yakut Je-usa (mother’s clan) as opposed to the Aga-usa (father’s clan or gens); and second, the inference to be drawn from Yakut classificatory and descriptive terms of relationship.' <sup id="cite_ref-1000" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1000">[1,000]</a></sup> 'The Yakut mother’s clan is not connected with a family organization in which the women have the chief place in the government, or with the mythical race of women of Asia Minor called Amazons. The Yakut man is the real ruler and head of certain social groups. The origin of the term, Je-usa, may be explained, as Sieroszevski assumed, by the former existence of polygamy among the Yakut. The children of each wife—and there is no question that the children knew their own mothers—formed a Je-usa, but all these groups of mothers with their children were considered to be divisions of the Aga-usa, or the father’s gens.' <sup id="cite_ref-1001" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1001">[1,001]</a></sup> 'In connection with the statement that the Yakut mother’s clan is an integral part of the father’s clan, we should like to present some data bearing on earlier matriarchal relations. The Yakut regard themselves [Page 132] as the offspring of the mythical Omogoi-bai, in spite of the fact that they originate from his daughter, who married a Tatar or a Buryat.' <sup id="cite_ref-1002" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1002">[1,002]</a></sup> Exogamy was the norm: '. . . In general, kinship ties play a very important role among the Yakuts in the question of wedlock. Up to the present the clan constitutes an exogamic group. While paying little attention to relationship [RCH: i. e., geneological relationship] as an obstacle to marriage, the Yakuts 40 , according to M. Pripuzov, not only consider kinship [RCH: i. e., patrilineal kinship] up to five removes an obstacle to marriage, but in general do not take wives from their own clan. Formerly, rich Yakuts even sought, insofar as possible, to secure wives for their sons from other naslegi . Inasmuch, on the other hand, as kinship through the female line is not taken into account in the making of marriages, data communicated by Prince Kostrov demonstrate that not only father and son or two brothers can marry their own sisters-german [RCH: presumably cousins who are not members of the patrilineal kin group] but an uncle can take to wife his own niece (the daughter of his sister). Inasmuch as such marriages are not permitted by the local priesthood, the Yakuts have resort to the following friction: the betrothed hires his fiancée, in the capacity of a servant, and lives with her sometimes throughout his whole life as if she were his wife. The recollection that all kinsfolk bear the same clan surname has led to the prohibition of marriages between individuals of the same name, if they live in the same locality.' <sup id="cite_ref-1003" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1003">[1,003]</a></sup> 'The Yakut look for brides for their sons not only outside of their clans ( us, nasleg ), but outside of the ulus, or union of clans. A girl, say the Yakut, is really a lot of aliens. This saying is reminiscent of the old time marriage by capture. Marriage is now also exogamic, but kalym (brideprice) is given in money, cattle, and other goods. Practically, the kalym may be regarded as an exchange of presents. What the parents of the bride receive from the parents of the bridegroom is almost equivalent to what they give her when she leaves their house. Often the bride carries with her cattle and goods of a greater value than her parents received that she may not be reproached by the bridegroom’s relatives for bringing only a small dowry with her. The young bride remains under the protection of her clan and family. Many common law customs regulate disagreements and dissensions: If a young woman leaves her husband because she dislikes him, her dowry remains with him; but, if she accuses him of cruelties, relatives on both sides decide the matter. The Yakut do not like to appeal to the Russian courts.' <sup id="cite_ref-1004" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1004">[1,004]</a></sup> 'We have previously mentioned the exogamic character of the Yakut marriages, but some other tendencies have been observed in the northern districts of Yakut Province. The few rich families endeavor to keep their horses, cattle, and grazing places within a certain group of families through marriage of close relatives, insofar as this is permitted by the Russian church. By special permission of a bishop, even cousins are permitted to marry. In one case, known to the author, a man lived with his niece, a marital relation forbidden by the Church, though his neighbors avoided mentioning this irregularity to strangers.' <sup id="cite_ref-1005" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1005">[1,005]</a></sup></dd>

When he has reached maturity, marries, and establishes his own household, he selects a place to build a house, but it has its owner-spirit from whom it is necessary to obtain permission to proceed. When the house, stall, and shelter for cattle are ready, each of these buildings, as well as the new fireplace, has its own “owners” with whom it is important to enter into good relations. To procure food and clothing for the family it is necessary to hunt in the woods and to fish in the lakes, but forests and waters have their own owners, without whose permission one cannot use the utilities they supervise. That the family may have adequate provision, the cattle must propagate, and for this, corresponding spirits must be propitiated. For the cattle, one needs to store hay, but grass grows in places belonging to particular owners. While traveling, a man passes the possessions of different owners, who must be conciliated with gifts or appropriate prayers. Thus, we see a well organized system in the relations of man to the circle of spirits.' <sup id="cite_ref-1008" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1008">[1,008]</a></sup> Pregnancy and birth were considered impure: 'The choom of the woman who gave birth to a child was regarded as impure.

Women who brought foodstuffs, or came to ask about the health of the mother, were not allowed to enter the choom and conversed and handed over what they brought through the open door.' <sup id="cite_ref-1009" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1009">[1,009]</a></sup> 'We Yakut were fastidious towards women (byrdyr) in the past; we considered them to be unclean (byrdakhta).

They are considered to be unclean. They may spoil a hunter's rifle for him or bring bad fortune to a fisherman. (Verkhoyansk Ulus, 1882). All this, constantly repeated, forces the women themselves from youngest years to become accustomed to the consciousness of their inconsequence and lack of rights, and makes them meek and modest.

After their death the souls of these people were to become heretics (sic) (dzheretinnik), who would frighten the living, for they would remain by their graves and would not depart for the land of the dead. However, if without getting married a girl gave birth to children, her soul was not turned into a heretic. At the same time it was considered a sin for a widower to marry again. A married couple would rarely break up, for fear of committing a sin thereby. In selecting his first wife a man was believed to be following a course predetermined for him by a beneficent god: the particular woman he selected was believed to have been born specially for him and had been fated to be his wife. If upon the death of his wife the widower remarried it was believed that the ayy (a beneficent god) would stop treating him with good will (aytytyn eyetya aragar). It was thought that the ayy did not select ten wives for a man, but only one. As a result, the second marriage was believed to be entered into without the approval of the ayy, but of the man's own free will. When a man who had been married to two women died, it was believed that he would unite with his first wife, while his second wife would reside separately with her maternal relatives. If upon the death of his second wife a man would marry for the third time, it was believed that such conduct was inspired by the evil spirit--abasy, and was very sinful. After his [Page 23] death such man, as well as his wives, would to into the region inhabited by the abasy.' <sup id="cite_ref-1012" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1012">[1,012]</a></sup></dd>

In actual practice the Yakut family is quite a different thing, and only the subordination of women is strictly drawn. The subordination of the younger to the elder is in its turn subject to a still more general rule: the subordination of the weaker to the stronger, and of the poor to the rich. It is true that I have heard of many cases where the father, eldest brother, or uncle forced younger members of the household to marry, gave them to outsiders to work under very harsh conditions and kept all they pay themselves.

Many times I have heard and seen the older members of a family cruelly beat their relatives, [Page 806] particularly wives and children, but I know of an equal number of cases where the opposite has taken place. I know of cases where the younger brothers played a more important role in the family than the elder brothers; where sons beat their aged parents until they went into tears; where a wife, unconstrained by the presence of outsiders, treated her sick, feeble husband very rudely, and even beat him and openly kept a lover in the house. (Kolymsk Ulus, 1883), Namsk Ulus 511 1888). I have also heard of a daughter, realizing that she was the only worker in the house, paid absolutely no attention to her parents, did what she wished, refused a profitable marriage, and went around with boys in front of everyone's eyes.

Despite the fact that the type of the individual, i. e., “small” family, thus appears characteristic for the comtemporary familial-household structure of the Yakuts of the Yakutsk district, the clan structure must by no means be counted in the number of completely vanished phenomena. In addition to the known division of the Yakuts into [unknown]ul[unknown]usi and naslegi , a division which one of the best investigators of Yakut life, M. Sieroszewski, does not recognize as indigenous to the Yakuts, the native population of the Yakutsk district, as in other localities of the region, continues to retain the ancient division into clans-- aga-usa (the paternal clan), resolving itself into 4-8 [unknown]iya-[unknown]usa . This latter term M. Pripuzov translates by the word “tribe”; M. Sieroszewski, who, as far as we know, was the first to turn his attention to the [unknown]iya-[unknown]usa , has observed that [unknown]iya-[unknown]usa ( [unknown]iye-[unknown]usa ) has the exact meaning of “maternal clan,” has described the significance that the latter has in the contemporary clan division of the Yakuts, and has set forth a hypothesis concerning the origin of the “maternal clan” among the Yakuts. [Page 38-39] At the present time, relationship within the limits of the iye-usa is traced through the male line, and M. Sieroszewski makes the extremely likely guess that the division of the paternal clan into several maternal clans is a natural consequence of the polygamy that was once practiced among the Yakuts. Monogamous marriage took a firm hold among the Yakuts only at the beginning of the 19th century. The aga-[unknown]usa included all the descendants taking their descent from one father, while each [unknown]iye-[unknown]usa included only the issue of one of his wives. The supposition of M. Sieroszewski has a great deal of verisimilitude. 39 In reality, however, where polygamy leads to the above-mentioned division of the paternal clan into several maternal clans, it only plays the role of a factor supporting in life the reckoning of relationship through the female line, and not the reason which gave rise to it: only upon the basis of an already existing custom of reckoning relationship through the wife’s line can the maternal clan arise, either as an independent organization, or as a sub-grouping of the paternal clan. Consequently, how ever the [unknown]iye-[unknown]usa may have arisen among the Yakuts, its existence must be in fact regarded as a proof that there once existed among the Yakuts the custom of determining relationship through the wife’s line, the recollection of an epoch when the bonds uniting child and father were not yet taken into account. The fact cited by M. Sieroszewski, that according to tradition many paternal clans ( aga-[unknown]usa ) and even entire naslegi , took their designation from women, strengthens this supposition. The chief significance in the contemporary structure of the Yakuts, however, attaches to the aga-[unknown]usa , the paternal clan.' <sup id="cite_ref-1025" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1025">[1,025]</a></sup> The father's clan was structurally more important than the mother's clan: 'Following this presentation of the complete list of Yakut terms of relationship, two points remain to be cleared up: first, the function of the Yakut Je-usa (mother’s clan) as opposed to the Aga-usa (father’s clan or gens); and second, the inference to be drawn from Yakut classificatory and descriptive terms of relationship.' <sup id="cite_ref-1026" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1026">[1,026]</a></sup> 'The Yakut mother’s clan is not connected with a family organization in which the women have the chief place in the government, or with the mythical race of women of Asia Minor called Amazons. The Yakut man is the real ruler and head of certain social groups. The origin of the term, Je-usa, may be explained, as Sieroszevski assumed, by the former existence of polygamy among the Yakut. The children of each wife—and there is no question that the children knew their own mothers—formed a Je-usa, but all these groups of mothers with their children were considered to be divisions of the Aga-usa, or the father’s gens.' <sup id="cite_ref-1027" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1027">[1,027]</a></sup> 'In connection with the statement that the Yakut mother’s clan is an integral part of the father’s clan, we should like to present some data bearing on earlier matriarchal relations. The Yakut regard themselves [Page 132] as the offspring of the mythical Omogoi-bai, in spite of the fact that they originate from his daughter, who married a Tatar or a Buryat.' <sup id="cite_ref-1028" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1028">[1,028]</a></sup> Exogamy was the norm: '. . . In general, kinship ties play a very important role among the Yakuts in the question of wedlock. Up to the present the clan constitutes an exogamic group. While paying little attention to relationship [RCH: i. e., geneological relationship] as an obstacle to marriage, the Yakuts 40 , according to M. Pripuzov, not only consider kinship [RCH: i. e., patrilineal kinship] up to five removes an obstacle to marriage, but in general do not take wives from their own clan. Formerly, rich Yakuts even sought, insofar as possible, to secure wives for their sons from other naslegi . Inasmuch, on the other hand, as kinship through the female line is not taken into account in the making of marriages, data communicated by Prince Kostrov demonstrate that not only father and son or two brothers can marry their own sisters-german [RCH: presumably cousins who are not members of the patrilineal kin group] but an uncle can take to wife his own niece (the daughter of his sister). Inasmuch as such marriages are not permitted by the local priesthood, the Yakuts have resort to the following friction: the betrothed hires his fiancée, in the capacity of a servant, and lives with her sometimes throughout his whole life as if she were his wife. The recollection that all kinsfolk bear the same clan surname has led to the prohibition of marriages between individuals of the same name, if they live in the same locality.' <sup id="cite_ref-1029" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1029">[1,029]</a></sup> 'The Yakut look for brides for their sons not only outside of their clans ( us, nasleg ), but outside of the ulus, or union of clans. A girl, say the Yakut, is really a lot of aliens. This saying is reminiscent of the old time marriage by capture. Marriage is now also exogamic, but kalym (brideprice) is given in money, cattle, and other goods. Practically, the kalym may be regarded as an exchange of presents. What the parents of the bride receive from the parents of the bridegroom is almost equivalent to what they give her when she leaves their house. Often the bride carries with her cattle and goods of a greater value than her parents received that she may not be reproached by the bridegroom’s relatives for bringing only a small dowry with her. The young bride remains under the protection of her clan and family. Many common law customs regulate disagreements and dissensions: If a young woman leaves her husband because she dislikes him, her dowry remains with him; but, if she accuses him of cruelties, relatives on both sides decide the matter. The Yakut do not like to appeal to the Russian courts.' <sup id="cite_ref-1030" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1030">[1,030]</a></sup> 'We have previously mentioned the exogamic character of the Yakut marriages, but some other tendencies have been observed in the northern districts of Yakut Province. The few rich families endeavor to keep their horses, cattle, and grazing places within a certain group of families through marriage of close relatives, insofar as this is permitted by the Russian church. By special permission of a bishop, even cousins are permitted to marry. In one case, known to the author, a man lived with his niece, a marital relation forbidden by the Church, though his neighbors avoided mentioning this irregularity to strangers.' <sup id="cite_ref-1031" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1031">[1,031]</a></sup></dd>

Historically, more distant kin were recognized on two levels, the AIMAK (or territorial NASLEG), with one to thirty lineages, and the DZHON (or territorial ULUS), composed of several AIMAK.

Men owned most of the wealth, and passed it to sons, especially elder sons, although the youngest son often inherited the family yurt. Mothers could pass on dowries to daughters, unless the dowry was forfeited by bad behavior. In theory, dowries included land, as well as goods, jewelry, and animals, although in practice elders rarely gave land to another lineage.

Among the Yakuts, the latter, as is the case everywhere with peoples on a low level of economic development, permits a girl to accumulate property by her personal labor: the product of her personal exertions, whether sewing or other handicraft, becomes part of her possessions, but among the Yakuts, as is the case everywhere, the girl secures the right of ownership of the products of her labor only in the degree that she performs this labor during her hours of leisure and rest, after having performed the household duties which fall to her share. The same rule, it appears, applies 44 to married women. Woman, as a member of her kin group prior to marriage, and subsequently in the capacity of a worker for her husband and his group, has only a portion of the time for her own use, and the group concedes to her as personal property only what she can produce after satisfying the needs of her father’s or her husband’s family.' <sup id="cite_ref-1038" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1038">[1,038]</a></sup> 'The absence of property rights on the part of women in relation to their kin group in graphically expressed in the exclusion of women from inheritance.

Where death takes place without male issue, the situation is the same as if there were no issue at all. Finally, the remaining relations come in for their share of the inheritance. A part of the property is set aside for the support and subsistence of the daughters, the remainder is divided between the relations with the closer relations securing a larger part (the father gets more than the rest), while the more distant relatives get a lesser share.

<p><b>♠ Moralistic punishment by human religious agents ♣ absent ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. eHRAF provides the following summary: 'Yakut religion derives from Turkic, Mongolic, Tungusic, and Russian ideas. Labels like "animist," "shamanist," or "Russian Orthodox" do not suffice. Ideas of sin are syncretised with concepts of contamination and taboo. Saints and bears are seen as shamanic spirit helpers. Christ is identified with the Yakut Bright Creator Elder God, Aiyy-toyon. A pantheon of gods, believed to live in nine hierarchical eastern heavens, was only one aspect of a complex traditional cosmology that still has meaning for some Yakut. Another crucial dimension was the spirit-soul (ICHCHI) of living beings, rocks, trees, natural forces, and objects crafted by humans. Most honored was the hearth spirit (YOT ICHCHITE), still fed morsels of food and drink by pious Yakut. Giant trees (AL LUKH MAS), deep in the forest, were especially sacred: their ICHCHI are still given small offerings of coins, scarves, and ribbons. Belief in ICHCHI is related to ancient ideas of harmony and equilibrium with nature, and to shamanism. Yakut shamanism is a Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic blend of belief in the supernatural, with emphasis on the ability of "white," or benign, shamans to intercede, through prayers and séances, with eastern spirits for the sake of humans. "Black" shamans, communing with evil spirits, could both benefit and harm humans.' <sup id="cite_ref-1047" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1047">[1,047]</a></sup> 'As with other Siberian peoples, Yakut shamans (OIUN if male, UDAGAN if female) combine medical and spiritual practice. Despite centuries of Russian Orthodox and Soviet discrediting of shamans as greedy charlatans, some Yakut maintain belief in shamans and supernatural powers. Others, struggling to recover spirituality after rejecting Marxist-Leninist materialism, accept aspects of shamanic philosophy. Still others, influenced by Soviet education and science, reject all religion as superstition. In the nineteenth century a few Yakut leaders financed the building of Russian Orthodox churches, and many Yakut declared themselves Christian, but this did not mean that they saw Christianity and shamanism as mutually exclusive. The Yakut also believed in the spiritual power of blacksmiths. By the 1980s shamans in Yakutia were rare and more likely to be Evenk than Yakut.

Once a religious celebration led by a shaman, the ceremony has been adapted since World War I into a secular commemoration of Yakut traditions. Practiced in villages and towns, it features opening prayers (ALGYS) and libations of KUMYS to the earth. Although some Yakut debate its "authenticity," the festival still includes feasting, horse racing, wrestling, and all-night line dancing to improvised chants. It lasts three joyous days in Suntar, where it is especially famed. Wedding rituals, pared down from previous eras, center around memorial hitching posts (SERQE), carved for the occasion, with couples honored by prayers, special food, and dancing. New rituals marking wedding anniversaries and graduations at all educational levels include the placement of SERQE, on which names of those honored are carved. But traditional rituals of birth, supplicating the goddess of fertility, Aiyycyt, have become less popular, with some Yakut women even mocking the restrictions that were once associated with beliefs about female impurity.

The ai oiuna do not have any shamanic costume. . . , not even a shamanic drum; they only give benedictions and beg for the mercy of Iuriung Aiyy toion. The ai oiuna always pray only to Iuriung Aiyy toion, and only in one case, when attempting to cure infertility, do they pray to Magan Sylgylakh or to some other dweller of the heavens, in order to petition for a son. The ai oiuna do not perform sacrifices-that is, they do not slaughter livestock as sacrifices, and may only consecrate one animal or another to a heavenly dweller, and then they do not do any work with this animal and, if possible, safeguard it and care for it” (Gorokhov, p. 56).' <sup id="cite_ref-1052" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1052">[1,052]</a></sup> 'N.

In contrast, W. I. Jochelson (pp. 197-205) found themes of dualism in the custom of celebrating two holidays during the year-in early summer, an yhyakh was organized as a holiday of fertility, while in the autumn, an yhyakh took place in honor of destructive forces and evil spirits and deities-“the dwellers of the west.” Therefore, “the dualistic ideas and poetic folklore of Western Asia are characteristic. . . ” of Yakut spiritual culture.' <sup id="cite_ref-1056" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1056">[1,056]</a></sup> 'In Soviet times, a number of researchers have regarded the pre-Christian religion of the Yakuts as consisting of two components.

All of this seems to demonstrate that shamanism indeed represents a specific early stage in the development of religion. Figuratively speaking, shamanism is the focused nucleus of the religious beliefs of an early society during the era of its decline, being fundamentally the ideology of an appropriative economy. In those regions of the world where a transition took place from Stone-Age society directly to a producer economy, religious conceptions changed accordingly, and the foundations of the agricultural polytheistic religions were laid. But in societies that never made a transition to developed agriculture (among advanced fishing, hunting, gathering, and, to some extent, livestock-breeding societies), shamanism remains the principal form of religious belief, attaining more refined forms of development. Therefore, in the forest-and-steppe regions, the dense taiga of the north, and the tropical jungles-that is, in those places where gathering and fishing, hunting, and undevcloped forms of producer economy dominate-there have remained the conditions for the existence of shamanism.' <sup id="cite_ref-1062" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1062">[1,062]</a></sup> 'The Eurasian steppes, due to their geographic situation, have occupied a “buffer zone” position. In the east, the steppes divided the relevant portion of the continent into a northern part, where primarily the appropriative economy developed, and a southern one, which had producer forms of economy. The steppes themselves occupied the central area. It is possible that on the strength of the mediating position of the steppe nomads, their religious formulations were characterized by syncretic features-the intertwining of shamanic and priesthood concepts, with a clear dominance of the former. Not only that, but in the early state formations that were situated in the semisteppe regions of the Far East and Central Asia during the tenth through thirteenth centuries-those of the Jurchens, Kidans, and Tanguts-shamanism was elevated to the status of a state religion (Vorob’ev, pp. 48-49). Shamanism existed right up until the twentieth century in such an expressly agricultural East Asian country as Korea (Ionova). This is connected with the idea that Altaic-speaking elements, such as the ManchuroTungus, played an active part in the origin of the Koreans.' <sup id="cite_ref-1063" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1063">[1,063]</a></sup> 'The perpetuation of shamanism among the peoples of Kazakhstan and Central Asia was closely connected with the ancient beliefs and rituals of local Iranian-speaking peoples. This view held by researchers is confirmed in part by the phenomenon that vestiges of the ancient Prashaman complex of Iranian-speaking ethnoses are distinctly manifested in the fervor of the Central Asian and Iranian dervishes, which consists of the recitation of verses, the attainment of a trance state, the utilization of zoomorphic helper-spirits, and the use of a shamanic drum and beater (Kuz’mina, p. 171).' <sup id="cite_ref-1064" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1064">[1,064]</a></sup> 'The origin of the shamanism of the Turkic-speaking Yakuts from outside of the ethnic group seems to be confirmed not only linguistically, but also by folkloric data. According to legends, the Yakuts are descended from two progenitorsOmogoi and Ellei. From Omogoi came the residents of the Namsk and Baiagantai regions [ulus], who in ancient times did not have the right to organize an yhyakh festival. The origins of the principal central-Yakut ulus are associated with Ellei, the cultural hero, the first organizer and priest of the yhyclkh, and the founder of the niyy cult. These people, the “Tribe of Ellei,” most likely belonged to the Turkic-speaking ancestors of the Yakuts. The etymology of the word “Ellei”-which in the opinion of 0. Botling, is derived from the Uighur 3115 meaning “to give birth to a clan”-likewise supports this. Horse-breeding dominanted their economy, which is also corroborated by linguistic materials: all Yakut words for equine livestock, for their stages of growth, and for meat and milk products obtained from equine livestock, as well as all terms associated with the exploitation of the horse, are Turkic (Antonov, pp. 25-34). In their beliefs, a prominent place was occupied by theyhyakh, the cult holiday of equine livestock fertility. The principal themes of Yakut mythology, in which worldviews derived from the ancient nomadic Iranian-speaking tribes of Middle and Central Asia are evident alongside those of Turkic peoples, are associated with this complex.' <sup id="cite_ref-1065" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1065">[1,065]</a></sup> 'The bulk of Yakut livestock-breeding terms are of Mongol derivation, associated with the “People of Omogoi” in their origin. The terminology of a “hunter-artisan cult” likewise belongs among the words of Mongol derivation (Antonov, pp. 36-37, 145). This complex consists of shamanism and the entire demonological aspect of the Yakut religious system. The “livestock-breeding accoutrements” of these two outlooks have found reflection in proverbs and sayings.' <sup id="cite_ref-1066" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1066">[1,066]</a></sup> 'On the cliff drawings on the Middle Lena, dated as being prior to the arrival of Yakut ancestors, figures of shamans with drums and rattles have been uncovered, as well as a depiction of a person with arms raised upward as if in prayer, above whom were carved three circles-symbols of three suns or of a three-dimensional conception of the Universe. A. P. Okladnikov considered this priest figure to be a depiction of a Yakut white shaman (Okladnikov, pp. 375-76).' <sup id="cite_ref-1067" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1067">[1,067]</a></sup> 'It is not enough to explain the nature of the dualism in Yakut traditional beliefs merely through ethnic considerations, given the fact that dualism to one extent or another actually appears in many religions. The division of shamanism was likewise inherent in the beliefs of the Mongol-speaking peoples, with which we have attempted to associate the origin of Yakut black shamanism. The Mongol white shamans dressed all in white, rode on white horses, and participated in running the country. But starting at the end of the thirteenth century, they began to be supplanted by the clergy of the “yellow religion.”e The black shamans, on the other hand, continued to exist alongside the yellow-robed lamas, M. N. Khangalov (p. 89) associates the appearance of white shamanism among the Buryats with the time their ancestors underwent a transition from hunting to mass livestock-breeding and the noyon class first appeared.' <sup id="cite_ref-1068" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1068">[1,068]</a></sup> 'Until the middle of the nineteenth century, the Yakuts continued to conduct two large yhyakhs during the year-in spring and in autumn. The first, directed by white shamans, was dedicated to the aiyy deities, which represented the eastern, “benevolent” direction of light, whence the sun rises. Originally, Tangara-the sky god, the father of the gods, typologically comparable to the Rigvedic D’iaus, and to the Latin concept of “god” (D’iaus-Deos-Theo)-was supposed to occupy the dominant position among the aiyy deities. Later, this image was embodied in the central figure of the Yakut pantheon, Iuriung Aiyy toion, the “White Creator God,” the god of light, the personified image of the Sun, with the functions of sovereign of the Universe. Then came the other aiyy deities. A particularly important place was occupied by Aal Uot ichchite, the spirit of sacred fire-both of the sacrificial flame and of the domestic hearth. Like the Arian Agni, Aal Uot ichchite was considered to be the protector of the family and the giver of good fortune and healthy offspring. If the goddess Ieiiekhsit was regarded as the messenger of Iuriung Aiyy toion, then the spirit of fire fulfilled the function of intermediary between earth and heaven, between humanity and the gods.' <sup id="cite_ref-1069" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1069">[1,069]</a></sup> 'The second, autumnal yhyakh was dedicated to the terrible, destructive forces of nature, the deities and demonic spirits of the cult of abahy-“the dwellers of the west.” It took place at night and was led by nine black male and female shamans. Blood sacrifices of livestock and horses took place in honor of the chief deities of Yakut demonology Uluu toion and Arsan Duolai. This entire complex with its multitude of shamanic rituals, in the center of which stood a shamanic seance, may be called the cult of abahy. At the same time, it should be explained that the word abahy refers to all manner of evil origins, everything malevolent, hostile, and contrary to the interests of humanity or customs. In the epics [olonkho], abnhy was a nonspecific word for evil beings and monsters, including members of alien tribes, speakers of foreign tongues, and persons with different moral values and customs or completely foreign religions (Ksenofontov, 1977, p. 236). The etymology of abahy is not completely clear. E. K. Pekarskii derived it from aba, ap, meaning “sorcery.” In the dictionary of M. Kashgarskii, which was compiled at the beginning of the twentieth century, this word is found in the form abachi, meaning “scarecrow” (Kashgarskii, p. 10). It can speculatively be connected with the term albasti, which refers to an evil demon associated with waterrelated disasters among Turkic peoples. According to the most widespread version, the image of albasty is associated with Iranian mythology.' <sup id="cite_ref-1070" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1070">[1,070]</a></sup> 'In this manner, the juxtaposition of two groups of mythological symbols-those of good and of evil, typologically common to many religions-became the foundation of the dualism in Yakut religious beliefs. An analogy is found in the Altaic dualistic myth, according to which Ul’gen proclaims that the people created by his brother Erlik are black and go to the west, while the white people created by him personally must go to the east.' <sup id="cite_ref-1071" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1071">[1,071]</a></sup> 'It is possible that at one time the Yakut white shaman, the a&amp;y oiuuna, had a special name, which the word toion-used in historical times with the meaning “master, sovereign, ruler, prince, military leader, tsar, lord, owner”-migh t have turned into. Pekarskii derived it from the ancient Turkic toiyn- “a monk, a Buddhist priest” (Pekarskii, col. 2706). Indeed, in the Kashgarskii dictionary, this word is given with the meaning “an ecclesiastical order of a non-muslim religion.” Khan Dzhubeini, who lived in the thirteenth century, uses the term tuin in the meaning “Manichaean priest.” The editors of an ancient Turkic dictionary derive tojun = tojoin from the ancient Chinese daozhen, literally “a person on the path” (Drevnetiitrkskii sfovar’, 1977, p. 572).' <sup id="cite_ref-1072" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1072">[1,072]</a></sup> 'Evidently Prof. N. K. Antonov is correct in regarding this term as an ancient Turkic word, comparable to the Mongol toin-“a monk of noble [origin]” (Antonov, p. 110). As a hypothetical exercise, it can be supposed that the word toion, etymologically speaking, once represented a compound word, consisting of two words-foiuk and oiiun, where toiuk is “a shamanic hymn, song, or incantation” (Pekarskii, col. 2710), and tuoi is “to sing, to praise.” The ancient Turkic (Uighur) oiiun-“a game” and Uighur oina-“to play, to engage in a seance”-are like the Yakut onn’oo-“play” [imperative]. Thus, toi + oiiun is “one who sings = one who plays” in the sense of “entering into play with god.” Toion may have originally referred to a tribal priest or to a nobleman leader who had been charged with priestly functions. It should also be noted that the names of all of the Yakut gods contain the obligatory appendage “toion.” And it is not for nothing that L. G. Levental’, one of the leading researchers of the Yakut foionate, gave it the following definition: “A military aristocracy, cruel and proud, which traces its origins to the members of the Yakut Olympus, and to illustrious shamans and shamanesses” (Levental’ et al., p. 241).' <sup id="cite_ref-1073" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1073">[1,073]</a></sup> We have found no evidence that shamans acted as moralistic enforcers: 'A man-shaman is called oy[unknown]un and a woman-shaman, udahan . Both play an important rôle in Yakut beliefs. While oy[unknown]un is a Turkic word, udahan is adopted from the Mongolian language. Why? Why also is a woman-shaman regarded as more powerful than a man shaman? Why may oy[unknown]un enter into the formation of compound words (for instance, mas oy[unknown]un, a wooden shaman, is called the humming top) while udahan may not be so used? Why may oy[unknown]un and not udahan be part of words designating inanimate objects?' <sup id="cite_ref-1074" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1074">[1,074]</a></sup> 'We have previously seen that udahan is a Mongol word and that us (smith) is Turkic. The Yakut, when comparing the power of black shamans and smiths, regard the latter as more powerful. They make no comparisons with reference to the udahan’s power, but say that udahans are more powerful than men-shamans. The Yakut preserved the names of their former white shamans, but not those of white women-shamans. From this we might infer that white shamanism was not an aboriginal institution, and that black shamanism is a transformation of female shamans after their functions were transferred to men. No tales of white smiths (smiths working with copper and silver) are extant, but accounts of black smiths (iron smiths) relate that they are more powerful than black shamans. This leads us to the belief that the concept of black smiths and women-shamans appeared as ready-made institutions among the Yakut.' <sup id="cite_ref-1075" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1075">[1,075]</a></sup> 'Shamans ( saxa ababyta, Yakut priest, and säbäki in the Viliuisk District) are divided into two classes, white or creative shamans ( Aj[unknown]y a[unknown]yuna ) and black or malevolent beings’ shamans ( Abasy oyuna ). The white shaman serves as an intermediary between benevolent creative beings and mankind, whom he does not and cannot harm. He has no special shamanistic dress and does not even possess a drum. He bestows only blessings and asks the White-Lord-Creator to make beneficent gifts. He seldom addresses any other sky-dweller but the White-Lord-Creator: for instance, to cure barrenness he appeals to Mohan Sylgylax or some other deity. He does not kill cattle as a sacrifice; he only dedicates them to some sky dweller, after which the animal is not required to perform any work and is cared for and well fed.' <sup id="cite_ref-1076" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1076">[1,076]</a></sup> 'The black shaman serves as an intermediary between evil spirits and men.

At ysyakh, before the games and contests began, the sesen of each clan or clan union would look over their own wrestlers; and they would remove those who were not good enough, who had recently sinned with a woman, who did not restrain themselves sufficiently in eating and drinking, so that they would not bring shame to their own people. They found all this out by feeling the body of the wrestlers, and by looking into their eyes and face. (Namsk Ulus, 1891).

<dl><dd> <b>♠ The state regulates banking ♣ ♥</b> Note: Pastoralism has a long history in the region: 'In prehistoric times, beginning with the northern retreat of the glaciers, many southern peoples who had to adjust themselves to the severe conditions of life in the northern forests or the polar tundra, occupied Siberia. Some of the newcomers, like the Tungus, lost many of their former culture traits, and became reindeer breeders or hunters, while others, like the Yakut, were able in the far north to retain their cattle-breeding culture of the Central Asiatic steppes. But this northward [Page 61] migration was involuntary; the southerners were forced out from their former habitat by the competition of alien tribes. Naturally, in the course of their wandering, they left some traces which have been disclosed by the work of archaeologists. Skeletal finds also have shown that northern Siberia was primarily inhabited by a long-headed people of the Nordic type who had come from the west, and who were assimilated or else annihilated by Mongoloid newcomers from the south. Many of these questions still await solution through the work of archaeologists.' <sup id="cite_ref-1094" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1094">[1,094]</a></sup> 'We have some knowledge of prehistoric Yakut monuments through the recent work of Russian archaeologists, chiefly Petri, whose excavations in the region of Lake Baikal revealed many remains of a horse and cattle breeding tribe, in all probability, the prehistoric Yakut.' <sup id="cite_ref-1095" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1095">[1,095]</a></sup> 'The identifications by the chief zoologist of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Bialanitski-Birula, of animal bones found at the Murino sites and the caves of Orkhon show that these are chiefly the remains of domesticated animals-of oxen, rams, goats, and horses. Remains of wild animals, the products of hunting, are very scarce, proving that the people were cattle breeders. Besides, no traces of agriculture were found to the north of Lake Baikal, presenting negative evidence that the prehistoric inhabitants were herders. Further, Bialanitski-Birula pointed out that the ox of these people, like that of the Yakut, was a cross-breed of the yak. Among the iron arrows were found many with bifurcated heads, a characteristic of Yakut arrows. The iron knives and scissors found have the same distinguishing marks as Yakut knives, as will be shown in the discussion of their iron industry. The horseshoe found in the excavations is exactly like the Yakut horseshoe; it is narrow, with holes for nails and one calk in the middle. The Siberian natives, even in stony mountainous places, seldom shoe their horses. The iron bits of an ancient bridle consisted of two unequal parts, without appendages in the corners. This may be explained by the manner in which the rider held the reins on the left side of the horse as do the present Yakut. Modern Yakut bits consist of two equal parts, a form which may be regarded as having been adopted from the Russians, from whom the Yakut learned to harness horses to sledges and carts, for which long reins are necessary. Formerly, the Yakut used the horse only as a riding and pack animal. Appurtenances of horse harness show that the people bred horses. An iron sickle for hay making was found by Petri. It is quite different from the Russian form and resembles the present Yakut sickle.

I can point, as an example, to the valley of the Borgonski settlement, which until the coming of the Yakuts was the scene of nomadic travels of the Tungus Miore with his numerous herds; also--to the valley of the Suntarski lake, which supposedly derived its name from the Tungus Suntar. The Tungus did not know any other cattle, except the deer...The deer are the Tungus cattle! unanimously assert the legends. They also assert, that the Yakuts imitated the Tungus in their use of the deer.' <sup id="cite_ref-1097" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1097">[1,097]</a></sup> 'The capacity to bear bad weather, cold, and hunger, to eat little and literally everything and anything that grows, to be satisfied with little in time of need, and afterwards to fatten up on the good feed and to live on the reserves of the fat and the meat stored up--this capacity is remarkably developed in the [Page 313] Yakut cattle. A great deal of energy is thus spent to survive. From the point of view of productivity this capacity for survival has no significance except, perhaps, a negative one. On the other hand this quality of survival makes the Yakut cattle invaluable in pioneering. Only because of it were the Yakuts able to penetrate with their cattle so far to the north. At present the Yakuts are the northernmost cattle breeders not only in Asia, but on the whole globe. Their northernmost cattle breeding sett lements known to me are on the Amoloi river at 70° N.L. and the northernmost one visited by me (in 1882) was on The Yana River at 69° where the Kungyas River enters it. On the Kolyma, the Alazei, and the Indigirka, the breeding of horned cattle does not, at present, reach such proportions, and stops about two degrees 152 south of the above mentioned point. In ancient times, cattle breeding reached the Arctic but was practised--of course--only in the river valleys. Fossils of horned cattle are found in Ustyansk, and legends about it are preserved in Nizhne-Kolymsk and on the Allaikha (the lower course of the Indigir-' <sup id="cite_ref-1098" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1098">[1,098]</a></sup> 'All those who have tried to connect the horses of the Yakut with those of southern or western Siberia in external appearance have most often pointed to the breed of horses of the Kirghiz. So far there have been no scientific investigations based on any numerous and exact measurements. The only data worthy of attention on this subject are those found in Cherskii. On the basis of a study of the skull of a contemporary Yakut horse, brought by Doctor Bunge from the Adycha River (Berkhoyansk Okrug), Cherskii was able to establish a distinct type of Yakut horse, differing from other Siberian horses and coming closest to the tarpans of southern Russia and the western Siberian subfossilis horse. I. Cherskii classifies the Yakut horse in the eastern group, with the breed of dwarfs (the length of the skull at the base is 472 millimeters) and with medium browed horses (the width of the forehead is 235.2 millimeters). The post-tertiary fossil horse  whose remains are found in great number at the Yakutsk Oblast, bears a certain relation, in the shape of the skull and of the bones, to present Siberian breeds and, by the way, to the Yakut horse. This is the opinion of the same Doctor Cherskii. This relationship expresses itself in the moderate width of the forehead, the inclined position of the bones above the eyebrows, the narrow width of the offshoots of the bones in the forehead to the skull, the concavity of the profile, and the singular dental systemThe size of the fossil [Page 343] Yakut horses makes one class them with the tall breeds (around Lake Lyakhov) and the very tall breeks (Yana River).' <sup id="cite_ref-1099" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1099">[1,099]</a></sup> 'The finding of the fully preserved corpse of a white horse in the frozen soil of the lower Yana, as reported by Bunge , strengthens this interest, as it seems to indicate the possibility of coming to a definitive solution of this problem. The answer to both these questions is directly bound with the time of the northern migration of the Yakut and with the location of their original homeland. Here I will only note that white is still the predominant color among Yakut horses, and that [Page 344] the interbreeding of domestic with wild animals is considered by them to be advantageous for the improvement of the breed. Such interbreeding in the case of domesticated deer, as I mentioned above, is practiced even now by the Yakut and Tungus of the far north.' <sup id="cite_ref-1100" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1100">[1,100]</a></sup> 'We must analyze some discrepancies in the account of the finds representing supposedly old Yakut culture. The excavations were made in old earth huts and caves. Thus this horse and cattle-breeding tribe must have been nomadic, yet, at the same time, must have had permanent dwellings. This may be explained by their double occupation. Iron [Page 63] mining, smelting, forging, and smithing required a sedentary life. While some families of a clan, or even some members of a family, were engaged in the iron industry, their relatives nomadized with their herds. Caves may have served as temporary shelters during the winter when the wet walls became frozen and a fire was used as protection from the cold.' <sup id="cite_ref-1101" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1101">[1,101]</a></sup> The Sakha were initially nomadic pastoralists: 'Traditional pastoralism in central Yakutia required homestead self-reliance, with intense dependence on calves and foals in a harsh climate. Stables, corrals, and haying developed in conjunction with hardy breeds of cattle and short, fat, furry horses. Richer families owned hundreds of horses and cattle; poorer ones raised a few cattle or herded for others. A huge variety of dairy products, including fermented mare's milk, (Russian: KUMYS), was the staple food, with meat for special occasions. The diet was augmented by hunting (bears, elk, squirrels, hare, ferrets, fowl), fishing (salmon, carp, MUSKSUN, MUNDU), and, under Russian influence, agriculture (cereals). Wealthy Yakut hunted on horseback using dogs. The poorest Yakut, those without cattle, relied on fishing with horsehair nets and, in the north, herded reindeer like their Evenk and Yukagir neighbors.' <sup id="cite_ref-1102" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1102">[1,102]</a></sup> Most implements were made in the home: 'Before iron was imported, ironworkers used ore from local marshes. Similarly, ceramics from local clay preceded Russian pottery. Most homemade crafts were for household use: decorated birch-bark containers, leather bags, dairy-processing equipment, horsehair blankets, fur clothing, benches, hitching posts, and elaborately carved wooden containers (including CHORONS for KUMYS).' <sup id="cite_ref-1103" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1103">[1,103]</a></sup> 'Although occupations within a household were divided by gender and status, the atmosphere was usually one of productive group activity. All participated in hay making, cattle herding, and milking, but, in general, horses were more a male preserve and cattle a female responsibility. Women tended children and fires, prepared food, carried water, and made clothing and pottery. Men handled more strenuous firewood preparation, house building, sled making, hunting, fishing, and mowing. Ivory carving and wood- and metalworking were male tasks.' <sup id="cite_ref-1104" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1104">[1,104]</a></sup> Sieroszewski reports some trades, such as carpentry and blacksmithing, for the south: 'In the north, where most of the household utensils are mad at home, all are prepared with the aid of only these clumsy implements.  In the south, where trades are kept separate to a greater degree, a carpenter owns, besides these, a wide and a narrow saw, planes, a brace and bit, chisels, and sometimes even a rasp. But everywhere the axe is most important. The Yakut handle the axe in a masterly fashion and are excellent carpenters. The majority of the churches in the Yakutsk Okrug and almost all the house s in the town of Yakutsk have been built by Yakut carpenters. In their carpentry work they use the same methods, the same compass for cutting, the same pitch rope, plumb, triangle, and ruler as do the Russians. The head of the carpenters artel, the elder carpenter, is called the regulator, after the Russian fashion. But their chief instruments, the axes and knives, have retained their ancient shape.They weigh from two to no more  than four pounds, and cost from fifty kopecks to one ruble. The Yakut cut with them smoothly, cleanly, and quickly; they are ready to fashion even small pieces with an axe.' <sup id="cite_ref-1105" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1105">[1,105]</a></sup> 'As with other Siberian peoples, Yakut shamans (OIUN if male, UDAGAN if female) combine medical and spiritual practice. [...] In the nineteenth century a few Yakut leaders financed the building of Russian Orthodox churches, and many Yakut declared themselves Christian, but this did not mean that they saw Christianity and shamanism as mutually exclusive. The Yakut also believed in the spiritual power of blacksmiths.' <sup id="cite_ref-1106" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1106">[1,106]</a></sup>  But most Sakha continued to rely on household-level subsistence production after the introduction of cereal agriculture: 'In pre-Revolutionary Yakutiya the poor and middle peasant families totaled more than 80 percent of all households. One-seventh of all the households were entirely without sowings, and many were only able to sow a few hundredths of a hectare each. Most of the households (97 percent) had to do without factory-made agricultural implements. Stockbreeding produced extremely poor results. The owners of large areas of land and abundant livestock i.e.,-the kulaks and toyons, grew rich, but not so much by raising the level of land cultivation and animal husbandry as by exploiting the poor and middle peasants.' <sup id="cite_ref-1107" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1107">[1,107]</a></sup> Temporary wage labour was slightly more common in areas close to Russian settlements: 'The Yakut are unwilling to hire themselves out on a daily basis, although the daily rate of pay is always higher than the monthly or yearly rates.  Among themselves they hardly ever do this. This has begun to come into custom only in the vicinity of cities, and only very lately. The Skoptsy were particularly responsible for spreading this custom.  The Skopsty usually pay their workers in flours, baked bread, potatoes, brick tea, and sugar; only rarely in money and  in cotton goods.' <sup id="cite_ref-1108" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1108">[1,108]</a></sup> Some of the below variables may not be applicable to the Sakha.****Russian settlers, such as members of the skoptzy religious sect, held deposits in Siberian banks: 'The enterprising spirit of the  skoptzy  was not limited by their agricultural pursuits, for they successfully occupied themselves with commerce and trades. They built mills, tanneries, smithies, harness shops, and kept provision shops. Some of their leaders were prosperous and were able to assist the community in building new houses and roads. The skoptzy   had no children to provide for and were able to accumulate money and many had large deposits in Siberian banks.' <sup id="cite_ref-1109" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1109">[1,109]</a></sup> We have assumed this not be true for the Sakha. Sakha families transmitted wealth in the form of family heirlooms, such as ceremonial dress: 'Such festive sangyyakh sometimes cost up to two hundred, or even to one thousand rubles, are handed down from generation to generation, and are worn exclusively on ceremonial occasions. For everyday use the son is more widely used than the sangyyakh everywhere. I only came across sangyyakh used for everyday wear once or twice, in very remote regions.  These were good-looking, light caftans, reaching a little below the knees and sewn out of striped calfskin.  They were cut to the shape of the body, were worn without any undergarments, and outlined the figure perfectly; the absence of a collar and the small opening in front which bared the neck made them looklike the coquettish costumes of the south.  There are indications that the sangyyakh, which is also called sanynyakh was much mo ed to be buried in sangyyakh, and a couple would be dressed in sangyyakh for their wedding; this practice is still followed in the north.  A sangyyakh is given as the wedding present of the mother-in-law.  Finally, in the north shamans perform their mysteries dressed in a  woman's sangyyakh, in the absence of their regular costume (Kolymsk Ulus, 1883).  But in the south the sangynyakh is becoming rarer and rarer; there the son has become the national costume of the Yakut. It has followed them into their new colonies everywhere. Its use, together with the Yakut language, has spread to the local Russians and to the Yakutized Tungus and Yukaghir. It is worn, with only small changes, by Yakut of both sexes, and of the most widely varied circumstances and ages. Even if the assumption that it was brought here by the Cossaks no earlier than in the seventeenth century is true, such a firmly established and universal use of this garment shows that there were corresponding beginnings in the national taste and that in practice its forms turned out to be utilitarian as well. And thus: the puffs on the shoulders offer splendid protection from cold and keep the shoulder muscles protected from dampness;it is, after all, these muscles which when riding are most susceptible to the effects of bad weather.  Again, the wing-like inserts protect the thighs, stomach, and seat of the rider, and do not allow the flaps of the coat to come apart very much.' <sup id="cite_ref-1110" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1110">[1,110]</a></sup> We are unsure whether these banks were state-controlled.

A clay pot is called  küös;  a metal kettle is called salyr  . Even in places where, as in the northern districts of Yakut Province, no pottery is made at present, the word  küös  is well known and used as a linear measure. In terms of linear measure one may say, “one pot,” “two pots,” “pot of a walker, horse, or ox rider.” For küös   (pot) the Yakut understand a distance of from seven to twelve versts (from 6.6 to 8 miles). Translating küös   in terms of time, it means a period during which a pot with meat for an average family is cooked. In Afghanistan küös   is used as a linear measure of about eighteen miles. Böhtlingk distinguishes the word  küös  as a unit of time from  kös  as a linear measure as does Pekarsky in his Yakut-Russian dictionary, where he interprets  kös  as a term for a day’s journey from one camping place to another.' <sup id="cite_ref-1112" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1112">[1,112]</a></sup> Area was measured by the amount of produce associated with a given plot of land: 'The unit of measurement of land among the Yakuts was the “rick” ([unknown]γ[unknown]γ[unknown]), a plot of land from which one hayrick could be mown (the size of the rick ranged from 10 to 30 cartloads, sometimes as many as 40 or 60). These allotments made up plots [...] which were extremely varied in size, depending on the “class,” and there were three or four “classes.” One first-class plot [...] was equal to two secondclass plots [...] and three or four third-class plots (kenniki or [...]). The population was also divided into three or four classes: the toyon households belonged to the first class, and received a first-class plot, the middle households were usually assigned to the second class and the poorer people to the third and fourth classes, each receiving the corresponding clan plot. Thus, the system itself gave the toyons plots of land which were three or four times larger than those of the poorer people. It is true that in return for this the toyons had somewhat greater obligations, but the difference in their extent was extremely small. However, this inequality was by no means the only thing. The toyons actually possessed much more land, having seized it in a variety of different ways. For example, they had several plots, rather than just one, by registering them in the names of their children, workers and so on. It was also the custom to give officials (who were more often than not themselves toyons) additional plots of land, so-called [...] (from the Russian word “ukaz” [edict]), for which, incidentally, there was no payment. The influential toyons also obtained extra plots called ugayy (or kharyy).  Furthermore, the toyons frequently enjoyed the right of possessing larger plots, sometimes through inheritance, cleared from the forest or formed at the site of a drained lake. The leasing of land was also common.' <sup id="cite_ref-1113" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1113">[1,113]</a></sup> Haystacks were measures in multiple ways: 'When the haystacks are sold or evaluated their size is determined in different ways, depending on the locality: by ricks, loads, and bulas.  A load of one true sagene of hay is considered equal to a cubic sagene of unpressed hay; it weighs approximately twenty poods and, converting this figure to ricks, counts as twenty ricks.  The bulas is a different measure and is used primarily in the north.  A pulas or bulas is strictly speaking the distance between the ends of the fingers of one's outstretched hands.    A haystack that is the height of a man is measured by these spans, and it takes its name according to the size of the circumference: six, seven, or nine bulas. The height is assumed to be a minimum of one and one-quarter sagenes not counting the top. The method of counting by bulas is rather confused.  In the south it is customary to assume that a haystack of ten bulas is equal to twenty loads, i.e. four hundred Yakut ricks of one pood each.  This reckoning and the names of the measures shows once again, I think, the influence of the Russians in the teaching of methods of haying to the Yakut.' <sup id="cite_ref-1114" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1114">[1,114]</a></sup> However, it appears that none of these measures were imposed and regulated by the Russian authorities.</dd>

Yakut merchants and transporters spread throughout the entire northeast, easing communications and trade for natives and Russians. They sold luxuries like silver and gold jewelry and carved bone, ivory, and wood crafts in addition to staples such as butter, meat, and hay. Barter, Russian money, and furs formed the media of exchange. Guns were imported, as was iron for local blacksmiths.' <sup id="cite_ref-1115" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1115">[1,115]</a></sup> Fox and ermine skins doubled as units of exchange: 'The Yakuts hunt foxes only in autumn and winter by setting up traps and self-released bows. Sometimes foxes get caught in the nooses set up to hares, but rarely perish in the noose trap, since the beam is not sufficiently quick to lift their weight.  The fox eats everything: fish, meat, berries, roots, even the carrions of other foxes that got caught in the trap. The fox is far from  being a rare animal in the north of the region: I saw one on several occasions near people's houses and once witnessed a fox running across the yard of the yurta.  A fox, especially the darker varieties which are larger, can be easily mistaken for a Yakut dog.  The skin of the red fox serves in the north as a unit of exchange. It is priced between 2 and 5 rubles; sivodushka-between 6 &amp; 15 rubles; and the black-brown variety between 25 and 50 rubles. I was shown very beautiful, perfectly black skins with a  slight grizzle, for which 120 rubles was paid on the spot.' <sup id="cite_ref-1116" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1116">[1,116]</a></sup> 'ERMINE (mustela erminea), kyrnas, belelyakh, is the animal most hunted for the purposes of trade.  It is found in all parts of the country, on the tableland and in the tundra. Increase and decrease in the numbers of this animal depend probably on the amount of available food. In winter it comes near human dwellings, gets into the granaries, and eats and carriesaway meat and fish.  It is caught by special traps called hlopushi (chirkan - a mouse trap).  The ermine is a predatory, bold, and curious animal. When irritated it will attack even  human beings.  Cases are known of the ermine inflicting serious wounds on people, for it attempts to cut through the blood vessels on the neck, where it ascends with exceptional speed and agility.  The ermine skin is priced between 2 and 5 cents and is used as the smallest exchange unit.' <sup id="cite_ref-1117" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1117">[1,117]</a></sup> The same was true for butter: 'Butter naturally acquired particular value with the coming of the Russians.  Butter began to go into circulation only when the Russians came and built a city, and particularly when they began to buy it for the mines, maintained the Namsk Yakut (1891).  The Yakut monetary unitary, which means one bezem of heated butter of two and one-half funts testifies to the trading significance of butter.  In remote corners the Yakut often convert the price of goods from a monetary basis to a butter basis, and express hiring prices and selling prices of objects offered in terms of butter.  The majority of women are only familiar with this system, and get confused in trying to count with money.  Butter comprises one of the most important food products of the Yakut. The poorest Yakut tries to have it on his table  on feast days, and even the stingiest master must feed his workers butter at least once a week.  The Yakut consume butter in various ways: they eat it in hard pieces, they drink it crumbled with kumiss, they drink it in tea, and they drink warm heated butter in its pure form.  In their climate this beverage is far from distasteful, and when coming back chilled from hunting, or frozen through during a long winter journey I would willingly drink a full dish of it myself.  It warms one quickly, and restore's one's strength and vigor, just like grape wine.  A Yakut is able to drink not more than one-half a funt at a gulp, but can drink up to two and one-half funts over a ceratin period of time, stopping to rest. Sturdy fellows who are able to drink five to ten funts at one time are known in every section , but I do not think that there are more than two or three in the oblast capable of drink one-half a pood; I do not know a their ability to drink a large quantity of melted butter just as Russians boast of their ability to drink large quantities of vodka.' <sup id="cite_ref-1118" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1118">[1,118]</a></sup> Russian money also became an important medium of exchange: 'Yakut also engaged in the fur trade; by the twentieth century hunters for luxury furs had depleted the ermines, sables, and foxes, and they were relying on squirrels.

And how little is this sum worth north of Yakutsk! Some Yakuts refused to accept a twenty kopeks coin for a hazel-hen I wanted to buy, saying that they could not manage to use the money; if it had an eye, they would have used it as a button; but as there was no such, I was to take it back.

Winter settlements comprised as few as twenty people, involving several closely related families who shared pasture land and lived in nearby yurts (BALAGAN) with surrounding storehouses and corrals. The yurts were oblong huts with slanted earth walls, low ceilings, sod roofs and dirt floors. Most had an adjoining room for cattle. They had substantial hearths, and fur-covered benches lining the walls demarcated sleeping arrangements according to social protocol. Yurts faced east, toward benevolent deities. In summer families moved to larger encampments with their animals. The most ancient summer homes, URASY, were elegant birch-bark conical tents. Some could hold one hundred people. Their ceilings soared at the center point, above a circular hearth. Around the sides were wide benches placed in compartments that served as ranked seating and sleeping areas. Every pole or eave was carved with symbolic designs of animals, fertility, and lineage identities.' <sup id="cite_ref-1124" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1124">[1,124]</a></sup> Russian and Sakha farmers constructed grain warehouses, but the Sakha were generally unfamiliar with effective methods of grain preservation: 'The seeds always cost more than three rubles.  Even in harvest years, when in winter one can buy four for one ruble eighty kopecks a pood, a pood of seeds costs two rubles.  This i s due to the fact that in the first place, they use selected grain for seeds, so that not every homeowner is willing to sow with his own seeds, and secondly, because most Yakut  sow less grain than they use. Rich Yakut naturally take advantage of this, and encouraged by the spring season of bad roads and the constant pecuniary embarrassment of the Yakut they loan seeds and make profits of one hundred percent on them.  I must remark that in general the Yakut still have not learned how to store grain.  Their grain warehouses and , even the public warehouses, are in almost all cases so poorly constructed that grain which has lain there for two or three years is no longer good f or seeds.  Sometimes it becomes so moldy that it is hard to eat flour prepared from it.  This inability to keep grain in storage supports the custom of handing out public seeds as a loan, pood for pood, to well-to-do clan heads, even in harvest years. Because of this many warehouses are found to be empty in poor crop years, and this factor is just about the strongest hindrance to the success of agriculture.  At such times there are exceedingly few seeds in the okrug.  A poor crop of grain usually concides with a small harvest of grass, and therefore a lack of milk.  The grain is consumed.  It is remarkable that the raising of grain has been strengthened even in the more northern regions, but only where there are large permanent stores of seeds, either in the form of Russian agricultural settlements or Yakut homesteads operating on a large scale.  There are very few Yakut carrying on the raising of grain on a large scale for commercial purposes. Even such rich Yakut as, for example, Syrom yatnikov, of the Bayagantaysk Ulus sowed only for themselves, something like one desiatin per household; there were four household in all.  [...]  In the Olekminsk Okrug I saw splendid farmsteads, well cultivated, with large areas sowed with the same kind of grain, with judicious household arrangeme nts, warehouses, threshing barns, and flour mills.  I was told that these farmsteads belong to rich Yakut.' <sup id="cite_ref-1125" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1125">[1,125]</a></sup> Sieroszewski's material suggests that Sakha food storage was household-level only in most cases. Accordingly, we have assumed that most Sakha had little to no access to 'public goods' type storehouses.

<p><b>♠ Health infrastructure ♣ absent ♥</b>  Shamans cured sickness and cast out malevolent spirits: 'As with other Siberian peoples, Yakut shamans (OIUN if male, UDAGAN if female) combine medical and spiritual practice.' <sup id="cite_ref-1130" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1130">[1,130]</a></sup> 'Vitashevsky gives a vivid description of a performance at which he was present. 1 He came too late to see its initiation, called oloxxo oloror (on the seat he is seated) and, he understood, at this point the shaman’s voice and the drum beats should be weak and almost listless. When he entered the earth hut the shaman was sitting on a small bank in its eastern corner, so that he had to pass between him and the fireplace. The shaman wore his shamanistic coat and his assistant dried the hut master’s drum by the fire. The shaman asked for a tobacco pipe. He inhaled the smoke several times and asked for the drum and stick which were given to him. He rose, walked a few steps, and jerking his shoulders and head up and down, he tried to beat the drum, but rejected it because it was wet. He asked that his own drum be dried. This was done very quickly. Evidently his drum was already dry. Now began the second or preliminary stage, called mäñniyär and sürgüyar 2 when the shaman searched for the direction in which to locate [Page 121] the evil spirit that captured the sick man’s soul. And, indeed, at times he stopped beating and gazed into the distance. In the beginning of the act the shaman beat the drum slightly and sang in a low voice, but gradually his voice and the drum beatings rose to a climax and the shaman turned his face to the southern window of the hut. The act lasted from fifteen to twenty minutes. During the performance the shaman imitated the neighing of a horse and the cry of some bird.//'The third act consisted in inhaling from the sick man the evil spirits causing the illness, and in dispatching them to the south. The shaman had to dispatch four evil spirits. First the shaman sat on the floor behind the fireplace, not far from the entrance, holding in his left hand a jalbyr (see above) which he stretched out in the direction of the patient. Gradually, still in a sitting position, he moved toward the sick man, singing louder and shaking his head more and more. At a distance of about a meter from the sick man he rose from the floor and sat on a bank prepared for him. He continued to cry out his incantations, touching the sick man with his jalbyr . This movement is called jalbiyal . Slowly the shaman rose from the bank and, dropping the jalbyr, bent over the sick man. In a powerful voice he commanded his spirits to fulfil his order and to pass from the patient. He pretended to swallow them in order to dispatch them to their dwelling places. To this end, he ran out to the yard and after dispatching the spirits to the “south” he fainted. He was taken up and carried into the hut, quite exhausted. Then the shaman started for the “upper” world and brought back one of the souls, the kut, of the sick man which had deserted him, having been frightened off by the evil spirits. The shaman looked around to see whether any evil spirit was left near the patient. Once more he pretended to start for the “upper” world and he fainted when he returned to this world. He was revived by his assistant and the shaman sang his last incantation. This was the final act of the performance. Vitashevsky was unable to record the text of the performance for the following reasons: it was almost dark in the hut; in spite of his perfect knowledge of the Yakut language many expressions in the performance were incomprehensible to him; the use of a phonograph to record the text would be prohibited by the shaman or otherwise influence the performance. When Vitashevsky invited the shaman to his hut for an interview the latter declined the invitation, saying that a shamanistic performance was too serious a subject for futile curiosity. The shaman, learning of Vitashevsky’s presence during his performance, said that it would fail to benefit the sick man. Sieroszevski refers in his [Page 122] book on the Yakut 1 to a shamanistic incantation, but other students of the Yakut criticized the authenticity of his text. I was more successful with Yukaghir and Tungus shamans. For a remuneration they recited their incantations in my phonograph and also dictated to me in order that I might be able to compare the two versions. In my work on the Yukaghir 2 I gave the Yukaghir text of a shamanistic performance on the Yassachnaya River. But the shaman himself, whose mother was a Yakut woman, originally recited the text in Yakut, which appeared in the Russian edition of my Yukaghir texts published by the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1900 (p. 118).' <sup id="cite_ref-1131" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1131">[1,131]</a></sup>//Sauer also provides a description of a shamanistic healing performance: '“When a sick Socha sends for a shaman to appease the wrath of the evil spirits that torment him, the sorcerer takes a switch, ties a few hairs from the mane of a horse to the end of it, walks and jumps about the sick person, waves his switch, and conjures the demons to appear and relate the cause of their tormenting him, and how they are to be appeased. After some time has passed in this invocation, he starts, pretends to see the spirits, and, listening to their admonition for some time, turns to the patient, and tells him whence the spirits came; that it was with a view of destroying him, but that they might be induced to accept as a sacrifice, instead of him, a fat mare or a cow, mentioning the particular colour. This is immediately procured; for whoever has one answering the description readily gives it. The offering being procured, the shaman dresses himself in full form, walks with his switch to the possessed, embrances him, and commands the demons to leave him; then, rising in great agitation, he suddenly springs upon the offering, raving and shouting as much as he possibly can: the beast now starting, and being restless, is a proof of the pain that it endures from the demon. The following morning the sacrifice is led to the place appointed, which is always on a rising ground at the entrance into a wood. Four poles are driven into the ground, on which they erect a stage covered with twigs, wheron the offering is slain and skinned. The flesh is dressed and eaten on the spot; the bones collected, wrapped up in the twigs that were on the scaffold, put inside the skin of the animal, and stuck at the top of some tree on the spot: if the sacrifice was to the aërial spirits, the head is directed upwards; if to the spirits of the pit, the head is looking downwards. The sorcerer then, arrayed in his magic robes, takes his tambour, and begins his formal spells; beating his tambour, raving, jumping, and using an unintelligible jargon in the most extravagant manner; his long hair hanging over his face, he conjures the spirit of the sacrifice to its demons, and the demons to their proper place of retirement; seems, several times during his incantations, to faint, during which paroxysms he receives the inspired power of prognosticating the fate of the diseased, and the day either of his restoration to health, or of his death. If 121 he prove mistaken, it is not regarded as arising from want of skill, but the unacceptableness of the sacrifice, which is occasionally renewed till he dies or recovers. If a shaman acquaints any family that some demon is intent on inflicting a punishment, offerings are made to avert the evil; not of live beasts, but the rich skins of animals, which are hung up in a conspicuous part of the hut, and buried with the owner when he dies.”' <sup id="cite_ref-1132" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1132">[1,132]</a></sup> Hospitals and clinics became common in the Soviet period and after: 'With the decline of shamanism, most Yakut rely on Western medicine administered in hospitals and clinics. Yet rumors persist of faith healing, described as spiritual or hypnotic. A few Yakut with shamanic family backgrounds attend medical school, supporting beliefs that healing talent can be inherited. Traditional healers (who had long periods of apprenticeship) were specialized, with herbal experts, bonesetters, shaman's assistants, and various grades of shamanic power. Sources vary as to whether male or female shamans were more powerful. Drumming and the music of the of the KHOMUS enhanced a shaman's trance during séances to ascertain the cause of illness. Each person was believed to have three souls, which were necessary to maintain health.' <sup id="cite_ref-1133" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1133">[1,133]</a></sup> We have assumed that most Sakha had no access to Western medicine in the early Russian period.

In 1631 they descended by the Viliui River, a tributary of the Lena, to the Lena River and imposed tribute on the adjacent Yakut. In 1632 a party of Cossacks under the command of the Boyar’s son, Shakov, took tribute in sables from a clan of Viliui horse-breeding Yakut. The Viliui River farther up from its mouth was occupied by Tungus only. The northern boundary of the distribution of the Yakut at that time was the mouth of the Viliui. The whole Lena Valley from the mouth of the Viliui River to the south, at a distance of about 500 kilometers (or 710 miles) was occupied by Yakut. In their possession were also all the Lena islands of that region, rich in  pasture lands. There is no definite information as to how far inland they penetrated at that period. We may admit, however, that the Yakut, being horse and cattle breeders, were hardly inclined to move into the dense forests far from the majority of their tribesmen, i.e., far from the Lena Valley. In the beginning of the seventeenth century the Yakut abode on the western banks of the Lena must have been the territory of the two present  uluses  of Yakutsk District, Namskij and Western Kangalassky. There, according to Yakut traditions, was the first place of refuge of their mythical forefather, the “Tatar” Elliei. From there a part of his nearest descendants could also have emigrated over the Lena islands to the eastern banks of the Lena River, where excellent pastures are as abundant as on the western banks.' <sup id="cite_ref-1134" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1134">[1,134]</a></sup> 'We have previously noted (see p. 64) that the Yakut were subjugated by two different Cossack parties from Mangasey aand Yeniseisk. The Olekminsk fortress on the Lena River was erected in 1630 when only Tungus lived in the region. In 1637 a Cossack party, under the command of Busa, collected tribute in furs from the Yakut of the Yana River.' <sup id="cite_ref-1135" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1135">[1,135]</a></sup> The czarist administration imposed taxes and established an administrative infrastructure: 'The system of tsarist administration was no different here from what existed in any other part of Northern Siberia. The Dolgans, Yakuts and Evenks had to pay the fur-tax as “natives” and formed “clans” headed by princelings, while the tundra peasants were forced to pay a poll tax, were formed into a “community” and headed by an elder. People living many hundreds of kilometers away from the nearest centers were economically dependent on the merchants who monopolized supplies to the region, bought up all the furs, and cruelly exploited the population.' <sup id="cite_ref-1136" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1136">[1,136]</a></sup> 'The committee of Cherkashennikov which worked in the Yakutsk Oblast was only a branch of this All-Siberian commission. On December 14, 1766, an ukaz was issued which called for deputies from all of Russia to form a committee for establishing a better administration, discussing various problems of internal policy, and, incidentally, to establish a new code for the natives of Siberia. The Yakut, who were listed as nomads, were excluded from the list of electors, but they sent their deputy anyway and he was allowed to join the committee by a special order of the Empress.' <sup id="cite_ref-1137" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1137">[1,137]</a></sup> 'The overall development of commodity relationships helped to speed up the development of agriculture and here and there ploughing was enforced by the administration.' <sup id="cite_ref-1138" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1138">[1,138]</a></sup> 'No less significant changes occurred in the administrative organization of the Yakut country. In the seventeenth century Yakutsk was the center of a great independent country directly subordinate to Moscow, although for some specific questions it was dependent on the governors of Tobolsk. In the time of Peter the Great, Yakutsk entered into the newly organized Siberian Goubernyia (government) and with the division of the Siberian government into provinces was included in Irkutsk Province. In 1775 Irkutsk Province was organized into a government and the Yakut country formed one of the provinces of the new government. In 1783 the government was again reorganized into a vice-royalty composed of four provinces, one of which was Yakutsk Province. In 1797 the vice-royalty was abolished and the government restored. In [Page 225] 1805 under the Emperor Alexander I, the Yakut country was made a separate province dependent upon Irkutsk. In 1852 the Yakut country was given a separate governor. After the revolution in February, 1917, a commissar was appointed by the Provisional Government.' <sup id="cite_ref-1139" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1139">[1,139]</a></sup> Sieroszewski reports corruption and exploitation of the Sakha population by administrators: 'The government undertook to regulate the distribution of Yakut land, [Page 764] partly to cease the disorders which arose as a result of this a nd partly to as sure and regulate the taking of yassak, which was being gathered with unbelievable arbitrariness and accompanied by terrible ill use, was stolen, substituted for, and hidden, and they stole from the Great Tsars by putting far too little in the treasury and by undervaluing the yassak greatly, and they impoverished the yassak-paying people and robbed the taxes and injured them.' <sup id="cite_ref-1140" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1140">[1,140]</a></sup> In addition to Russian officials, land-holding toyons also doubled as officials in their districts: 'The population was also divided into three or four classes: the toyon households belonged to the first class, and received a first-class plot, the middle households were usually assigned to the second class and the poorer people to the third and fourth classes, each receiving the corresponding clan plot. Thus, the system itself gave the toyons plots of land which were three or four times larger than those of the poorer people. It is true that in return for this the toyons had somewhat greater obligations, but the difference in their extent was extremely small. However, this inequality was by no means the only thing. The toyons actually possessed much more land, having seized it in a variety of different ways. For example, they had several plots, rather than just one, by registering them in the names of their children, workers and so on. It was also the custom to give officials (who were more often than not themselves toyons) additional plots of land, so-called [...] (from the Russian word “ukaz” [edict]), for which, incidentally, there was no payment. The influential toyons also obtained extra plots called ugayy (or kharyy).  Furthermore, the toyons frequently enjoyed the right of possessing larger plots, sometimes through inheritance, cleared from the forest or formed at the site of a drained lake. The leasing of land was also common.' <sup id="cite_ref-1141" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1141">[1,141]</a></sup> However, we have found no evidence of pensions being paid to 'natives', including toyons.

<p><b>♠ Funding for festivals ♣ absent ♥</b> Jochelson describes Kumiss festivals: "Spring festival is called Ayy ysyaxa (“kumiss festival in honor of the ‘creators’ ”). During the summer, in olden times, every rich man arranged a kumiss festival, at which all members of the clan assembled and were entertained. Other people, and frequently whole clans, were invited; and during the festival, defensive and offensive leagues were concluded. Every such festival commenced with sacrifices, and was accompanied with songs, dances, games, horse and foot races, and other contests. The spring kumiss festival takes place in the open air. In the midst of a large smooth grass meadow a kind of altar is erected. This consists of two posts with a crossbeam, and three young birch-trees with young shoots on them. The altar is hung round with sacrificial horsehair, and on the ground in front of it are placed ornamented birch-bark and ox-hide barrels filled with kumiss. The skin barrels are tied to the altar-frame by long ornamented straps of soft elk-leather. The ceremony commences by sacrifices to Lord Bright-Creator and to other “creators.” Their names are uttered by the steward of the festival, who may be a shaman or an elder member of the clan. The sacrifices consist of libations of kumiss, in the direction of the dawn. The steward addresses a prayer to the “creators,” begging for blessings,-increase of horses and cattle, a good harvest of hay, good health for the people and animals, and an abundance of food. Then he takes the kumiss-festival ladle , and makes a libation, in the direction of the dawn, to the benevolent deities . Then, while making a libation to the ground, he addresses the local deity, “the owner of the place” (än doidu iccitä), asking him not to harm the inhabitants of the spot and the members of the clan. After that, the steward, with the help of the sacrificial ladle, proceeds to divine. He throws the ladle towards the sky: and if it falls with the front part upwards, it portends the granting by the deities of future abundance; and all the people utter the joyful cry Uru!   Then the boys and girls give the goblets with the sacrificial kumiss, according to the directions of the steward, to the elder and honored members of the clan, both male and female. These, after placing themselves,-the men on the right and the women on the left of the altar,-drink off the kumiss from the goblets, and pass them on to the less important and the younger people." <sup id="cite_ref-1142" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1142">[1,142]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-1143" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1143">[1,143]</a></sup> Weddings were subject to a high degree of ritualization, resembling peacemaking procedures between two families: 'Traditionally, for wealthy Yakut, marriage could be polygamous. More common, however, was monogamy, with occasional remarriage after the death of a spouse. Arranged marriages were sometimes politically motivated. Patrilineage exogamy was reckoned strictly; those one could marry were called SYGAN. Until the 1920s many marriage arrangements were complicated and protracted, involving financial, emotional, and symbolic resources of the bride's and groom's extended families. This included the matchmaking ritual; several formal payments of animals, furs, and meat to the bride's family; informal gifts; and extensive dowries. Some families permitted poor grooms to work in their households as a replacement for the bride-price. Occasionally bride-capture occurred (it may have been more common in pre-Russian times). Wedding ceremonies and their attendant feasts, prayers, and dancing, were held first at the household of the bride's parents, then at that of the groom's. The couple usually lived or settled in a nearby yurt.' <sup id="cite_ref-1144" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1144">[1,144]</a></sup>//Kharuzin also describes the wedding proceedings: 'On the day of the wedding the choom of the father of the bride and that of the father of the bridegroom were set up side by side. Depending on the degree of their prosperity the owner of each of the chooms slaughtered between one and five deer and treated the assembled guests. In addition, the bridegroom slaughtered one more deer and sent its meat to the father of the bride. Aided by his friends the bridegroom would next catch the deer for the black kalym. At the same time, near the choom of the bride, other young men caught deer that were to be handed over as dowry. Out on the street, in the meanwhile, the bride would dance in the company of her girl friends and of other young men. Having caught the deer for the black kalym, the young men tied them up to the back of the narta of the match-maker who, with the deer behind him, rode in front of the bridegroom.//'Upon approaching the choom of the bride the matchmaker and the bridegroom rode around her choom in the direction of the movement of the sun. The matchmaker would then enter the choom alone and announce: The son-in-law has arrived. At the same time the people present would let the deer in a special enclosure built by stretching lassoes between trees and by setting up of overturned nartas . A great number of guests would arrive together with the bridegroom. Out on the street the matchmaker would lead the bridegroom to the father of the bride. The bridegroom would pull behind him a vazhenka ( nyal'dzhin ) tied to a leather strap. Upon approaching his future father-in-law he would hand the animal over to him. The bridegroom together with the guests would then remain outside while in the choom preparations were made for a feast and a wedding bed was set up for the newlyweds. The making of the bed was entrusted to one of the relatives of the bride.//'While the guests stood outside and waited for the beginning of the feast, the matchmaker would make numerous sorties from the choom of the bride and in a light-hearted way inform them of what was going on inside the choom. At the same time the father of the bride would received the deer of the black kalym. In the east tundra all the brought deer were accepted without any argument; in the Noril'-skiy rayon, however, the father of the bride would frequently pronounce some animals unacceptable and would send them back expecting other animals in their stead. In the case of a demanding father the business of receiving the deer would occasionally extend into the late evening.//'If the father of the bride was a snob he wold make the guests freeze outside for a long time. When, at long last, the feast and the bed were ready and the deer of the black kalym all checked, the match-maker would lead the bridegroom into the choom and would make him pray in front of the ikons. The bride stationed herself by the side of the bridegroom and prayed together with him. After the prayers were ended the matchmaker would say to the bridegroom: Bow to the big father-in-law and ask for his blessing. The bride and the bridegroom would then make a low bow before the parents and came up to receive their blessing as well as the blessing of the relatives older than the bride. All of them blessed the young people, gave them their hands to kiss, and proffered their best wishes. The matchmaker would at this point, give ten rubles to the father of the bride, and to all her relatives pieces of cloth and kerchiefs. In Noril'sk in the place of money the matchmaker gave the bride's father a fox skin, and to her mother a polar fox skin or a fur coat. These presents were called yungyu --prayer or request. After these presents had been made all the relatives of the bride got up and shook the bridegroom's hand. There were no handshakes between these relatives and the members of the bridegroom's entourage.//'After the blessing ceremony was over the bride and the bridegroom were placed behind the bed curtain. Only then would the guests be let in in a strictly observed order. The guests would be brought in from outside by the relatives, who would lead them by the hand--the adult relatives accompanying the adult guests, and children-relatives--other children. The guests would be taken to places that were asssigned to them. The closest relatives and the most honored guests as well as foreigners (Yakut, Russians, Tungus) would be let in first. To avoid mistakes the relatives of the bride asked their friends as to who should come in and in what order. Before the guests were let in two people would be selected from among those who were known for their talents as improvisers. The two chosen men were to play the role of people who predict the future ( yr kerderer dzhon ). One of these men was selected by the relatives of the bridegroom, the other----by the relatives of the bride. The presence of these men was not an essential part of the wedding ceremony.//'When all the honored guests were seated the bride's father would ask them: Guests! What do you have to say? The matchmaker would answer: We have a word to say. Then a representative of the bridegroom would get us and colorfully and ornately would describe the future life of the young people and the peace and harmony of their household. He would also describe the number of the children they were going to have, how rich they were going to be, etc. He would end his speech by saying: My words ended, now is your turn. Thereupon a similar speech would be make by a representative of the bride. The guests predicted a happier life for the bridegroom or the bride, depending on which side gave the better speech. After this a woman relative of the bride poured out tea and took charge of the serving of the food. After the first meal, i.e. after drinking the tea, and before the opening of the table ( ostuolu asyar inniger ), i.e. the serving of the meal, all the guests would go out on the street and dance until the second meal was served. The ceremony of distributing the kalym ( sulu tuttarar ) would be taking place at the same time.//'The wedding bed was transported to the choom of the bridegroom before the arrival of the bride herself. In front of the procession rode the matchmaker; he was followed by the bridegroom, behind whom was the bride, and behind the latter the deer loaded with the bride's dowry. The bride put on two coats made out of cloth ( sontap ) and a Siberian fur-coat ( dokha ), embroidered with patterns ( ardaydakh sangyyakh ). In the Noril'skiy rayon the size of the dowry was decided upon in the course of the negotiations conducted by the matchmaker; in other places the custom was different and the size of the dowry depended on that of the kalym. If the kalym consisted of sixty deer, the number of deer given with the dowry would be forty-five. A rich dowry consisted of sixty or seventy selected deer of various ages, among them no harness or old deer. Nor more than two or three deer could be included in a rich dowry. In addition to the deer a rich dowry would consist of seven and the poor one of five nartas, harnessed to the best deer (a pair of deer harnessed to each narta of the rich dowry, and a single deer harnessed to each narta of the poor one). In addition to the nartas a dowry included a narta choom, to which were harnessed four deer.//'When the bride's train approached the choom of the bridegroom, the matchmaker would go to the parents of the bridegroom and announced to them the arrival of the bride. The newlyweds would then travel three times around the choom in the direction of the movement of the sun. In the Noril'skiy rayon the bride rode around the choom by herself; after she had entered the choom the deer were led around the choom by some one else. This ceremony was called the entrance of the hearth ( sarany bullarar ). The bride was led into the choom of the bridegroom by a respected old woman who could not be her relative. The bride and the bridegroom prayed together before the ikon, and then, with a deep bow to the bridegroom's father and mother, asked for their blessing and came up to kiss their hands. The parents of the bridegroom then blessed the newlyweds and wished them a happy life. At this point the bride would give the bridegroom's parents presents of money or of valuable skins; these presents had to be much more valuable that those given by the bridegroom to the parents of the bride, for the father of the bride would want to put up a front before the bridegroom's father. In the bridegroom's choom the guests were again treated to a feast, which was served to them in two shifts. In the ancient times a shaman would always be invited to a wedding. Before the beginning of the feast he would stand dressed not in his ceremonial but in his ordinary garments, and leaning upon a deer staff of the bride called upon beneficent gods and spirits to be kind to the newlywed, and for himself wished them a happy and prosperous life. After this address by the shaman the first group of honored guests sat down to the feast.'//'The bridegroom's father would next come out to glance at the deer that were brought as a dowry, and offered the people who helped him in the equipping of the kalym to chose the animals they wanted.//'After the end of the festivities the father would inspect the dowry in the light of the day (this custom was not practised by the Noril'skiye Dolgani): he would go out of the choom, open up the trunks and examine their contents. If it turned out that the amount of the dowry was not equivalent to the amount of the kalym, the stinginess of the bride's parents would be disapprovingly commented on by all those present. As a rule, the father of the bride tried to include in the dowry as many valuable things as he could, for fear that otherwise he might disgrace himself. The inspection described above ended the ceremonies of the Dolgani wedding. The assembled guests would spend the day in eating, in games and in dancing, and would depart in the late evening. The father and the mother of the bride stayed with the bridegroom for a period of three days. Before their departure the father of the bridegroom would present the parents of the bride with one deer (ogo kereryu) which was to be looked upon by them as their daughter. The animal thus given as a present was highly valued. On the morning of the third day the young wife poured out tea. During the tea drinking her father would publicly instruct her as follows: From this time on you must obey your husband. Your mother-in-law now stands in the place of your own mother. Your father-in-law in the place of your father. Respect and obey them and do not quarrel with them.' <sup id="cite_ref-1145" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1145">[1,145]</a></sup>//Elders played a prominent role alongside parents and shamans: 'The oldest kinsman in the clan, or the [unknown]iye-[unknown]usa , is always heaped with honors, if he is both rich and has never been put on trial. To him pertains the jurisdiction in trifling quarrels between kinsfolk. The following ceremonies serve to recall the religious functions that he (Ysekh) formerly exercised a. At the time of the spring festival, which bears a strictly clan character, they bring to him, first of all, a large wooden vessel ( Choron ) containing kumiss; he pronounces a prayer of thanks to the gods and then pours the kumiss upon the fire. b. At the time of the arrival of the betrothed at the bridegroom’s yurt, they take from the sleigh of the betrothed, and place upon a table in front of the fire place the boiled head of a horse, whose eyes are covered with butter, to whose ears are attached intestines filled with horse’s blood, and a wooden cup filled with butter. After this the betrothed enters the yurt, and stands, having first untied her girdle, on the right side of the komelok [RCH: i. e., the fireplace] where she is met by the oldest kinsman, whose place is sometimes taken nowadays by the most honored guest, who, kneeling, throws into the fire 41 pieces of meat, blood and butter, and blesses the bride. For the completion of this ceremony, whose obvious object is to unite the bride with the bridegroom’s home, the oldest kinsman secures for his use the head, blood and butter brought into the yurt, and in addition the sum of one ruble.' <sup id="cite_ref-1146" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1146">[1,146]</a></sup>// It appears that festivals were a clan or community effort rather than being 'publicly funded' by a third-party authority.

Nevertheless, in personal relations the patriarchal parental authority finds a many-sided application. In addition to the right of giving sons out for adoption, a right which is limited with respect to the sons by the condition that the adoption take place within the confines of the clan, the parents can put their sons out to hire or to apprenticeship. Parents further have the right to use the earnings of their children; their labor goes to the profit of the family; they are obliged to support their parents, and in the event of non-fulfillment of this obligation, the parents can make complaint before the elders of the clan, who, in accordance with the earnings of the son, or his competence order him to support his father. But all these rules have significance only as long as  the son has not left the household or married. In general, if the parents feed, clothe their children, “seek their good,” and the children feed and support their parents in their old age, bury them decently after death, hold a wake on the 40th day [RCH: on the 40th day the soul of the deceased departs from the earth] and finally place a stone monument over the grave, they are considered to have mutually fulfilled their obligations.' <sup id="cite_ref-1147" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1147">[1,147]</a></sup> But we have found no evidence of post-mortuary ritual being conducted at these sites. For the celebration of seasonal festivals, the Sakha built non-permanent altars rather than temples or the like: 'The spring kumiss festival takes place in the open air. In the midst of a large smooth grass meadow a kind of altar is erected. This consists of two posts with a crossbeam, and three young birch-trees with young shoots on them (see Plate XVII). The altar is hung round with sacrificial horsehair, and on the ground in front of it are placed ornamented birch-bark and ox-hide barrels filled with kumiss. The skin barrels are tied to the altar-frame by long ornamented straps of soft elk-leather. This is done so that the vessels, when softened by the liquid in them, shall not collapse. The ceremony commences by sacrifices to Lord Bright-Creator and to other “creators.” Their names are uttered by the steward of the festival, who may be a shaman or an elder member of the clan. The sacrifices consist of libations of kumiss, in the direction of the dawn, to every deity; and formerly horses were often consecrated by being driven to the east.' <sup id="cite_ref-1148" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1148">[1,148]</a></sup> Russian Orthodox settlers and missionaries introduced churches: 'In the north, where most of the household utensils are mad at home, all are prepared with the aid of only these clumsy implements.  In the south, where trades are kept separate to a greater degree, a carpenter owns, besides these, a wide and a narrow saw, planes, a brace and bit, chisels, and sometimes even a rasp. But everywhere the axe is most important. The Yakut handle the axe in a masterly fashion and are excellent carpenters. The majority of the churches in the Yakutsk Okrug and almost all the house s in the town of Yakutsk have been built by Yakut carpenters. In their carpentry work they use the same methods, the same compass for cutting, the same pitch rope, plumb, triangle, and ruler as do the Russians. The head of the carpenters artel, the elder carpenter, is called the regulator, after the Russian fashion. But their chief instruments, the axes and knives, have retained their ancient shape.They weigh from two to no more  than four pounds, and cost from fifty kopecks to one ruble.

Of particular interest was one spindle, found in Kurumchinakh, which was covered with writing (letters). In comparing these characters with those of various alphabets, it may readily be observed that many of them are similar, as far as they can be deciphered, to the characters of the Orkhon alphabet. There were thirty-seven symbols of which twenty-one are letters and sixteen indistinct, effaced signs, including perhaps mere scratches. The twenty-one letters appear to be an exact reproduction of the Yenisei-Orkhon characters. There are eighteen consonants and three vowels. Some of the characters are repeated and in all there are ten different symbols. The discovery of these writings so far to the north is of great interest. The ancestors of the Yakut, who, in remote times, emigrated from northern Mongolia, undoubtedly knew the Orkhon alphabet and this may explain the Yakut traditions as to the loss of their writings on the way to Yakutsk Province.' <sup id="cite_ref-1155" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1155">[1,155]</a></sup> The first recent script for the Yakut language was developed by 19th century Russian missionaries: 'The Yakut speak Yakut, a Northeast Turkic language of the Altaic Language Family. It is one of the most divergent of the Turkic languages, closely related to Dolgan (a mixture of Evenk and Yakut sometimes described as a Yakut dialect). The Yakut, over 90 percent of whom speak Yakut as their mother tongue, call their language "Sakha-tyla." Their current written language, developed in the 1930s, is a modified Cyrillic script. Before this, they had several written forms, including a Latin script developed in the 1920s and a Cyrillic script introduced by missionaries in the nineteenth century.

This same document orders him to make a census of the people, and their goods and cattle: collect the taxes for the current year, 193 (1685) in full, and collect the arrears for the past years, from each as much as possible. Similar censuses were taken earlier also, and their character may be judged by the census of Grishka Krivogornitsyn in 170 (1671) “for the Meginsk volosts” There we find mentioned not only the taxes and the amounts in arrears, but also the houses, wives, number of workers in the family. There is information about those who have died and those who have run away. Moreover the name and clan of every person is given. The personal and clan nicknames, of course are very much corrupted in these notes, and changed to conform with the Russian style, but it is not hard to determine what they actually are.

The birth rate was very high among the Yakuts and most families produced from 5 to 10 children, sometimes as many as 20 or even more. However, the bad living conditions, poor food and inattention resulted in very high child mortality.

The Yakut are very willing to adopt children or enter into agreements with their parents for ever or for a time. In the first case the adopters usually pay the parents or the clan; in the second case - they demand repayment themselves. To be sure, this repayment is small: several rubles a year or a present. But when rich people give a child to feed to poor people, because of superstition, the latter usually receive a cow to milk and constant hand-outs of food and money as payment. The Yakut are usually very attentive to their children, where they are their own or have been taken for upbringing or adopted. Nevertheless children die in their early years at a fearful rate. Our children are dying without number. A Yakut woman is only torturing herself in vain when she gives birth to a child.

In damp and marshy places, among lakes, where the population feeds primarily on the poorest kinds of fish, leprosy is found, although by no means to such an extent as has been proclaimed. The point is that the inhabitants confuse this disea se with some forms of chronic syphilis, which manifests itself in this severe climate with fearsome severity: the body and the bones rot away, and the sick man decomposes while he is still alive, just as he does from leprosy.

In the north the tapeworm 117 is found rarer inside the fish. The tapeworm makes its abode in the insides of horned cattle and in the horses from which it is transferred to men who use the raw or half-boiled cattle meat. Tapeworm infection is a widespread disease among the Yakut and both varieties of that disease are frequently encountered among them. Often the disease reaches serious proportions, weakens the victim, and causes pain and spasms. I have known several cases of death from tapeworm. The Yakut use no medicine to get rid of the worm and do not believe that it gets into their insides together with raw meat.

I did not notice many among them who were hunchbacked, mis-shapen, or lame; neither were there many who were tongue-tied or who lisped. Cross- eyed Yakut are more frequent; diseases of the eye are in general very widespread, and most of the old men lose their sight toward the end of their life. I did not come across any cases of goiter among non-Russians, although this is a fairly common occurence among the Russians of that region, particularly among those who live in the valley of the Lena.' <sup id="cite_ref-1168" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1168">[1,168]</a></sup> Sieroszewski provides a general summary: 'Almost nothing is known about the prevalence of other diseases; they are all treated with homemade remedies, incantations, and shamanism, and since they are accompanied by delirium and moaning, they ascribe them to the influence of hostile spirits. From the reports of medical acquaintances and my own observations, the following diseases are known to me: catarrhal, gastric, and rheumatic fevers, pneumonia, diseases o the heart, liver, and gall bladder, consumption, cancer of the throat, uterus, and stomach, and diseases of the eye... Slight inflammations of the eye are cured very successfully by licking the pus from under the eyelid with the tip of the tongue. Sometimes this is done by particular specialists who have a particularly soft and thin tongue. People come purposely to the houses of such people and pay as much as thirty kopecks for an operation. Despite the abundance of water, swamp fever is comparatively rare; sufferers are cured by frightening them, or pouring cold water over them; even oftener they are not treated at all. Fever belongs to that class of diseases against which shamanism acknowledges itself to be powerless. Rheumatism is extremely widespread; finally, the terrible disease, contraction of the throat, is not a rarity; its victims die a death from hunger. This malady is apparently found most often in those places where cattle raising is the exclusive occupation, where the supply of wild animals has been exhausted and they do not raise grain; I think it appears as a result of eating liquid foods exclusively. Besides this, it is a rare Yakut who does not suffer from tape-worm or round worm - a result of eating meat that is raw or not sufficiently cooked; the local cattle suffer equally severely from these parasites. From the observations of doctors, diseases and medicines alike act more quickly on the organisms of Yakut, than on Russians.

In the north the tapeworm 117 is found rarer inside the fish. The tapeworm makes its abode in the insides of horned cattle and in the horses from which it is transferred to men who use the raw or half-boiled cattle meat. Tapeworm infection is a widespread disease among the Yakut and both varieties of that disease are frequently encountered among them. Often the diseae reaches serious proportions, weakens the victim, and causes pain and spasms. I have known several cases of death from tapeworm. The Yakut use no medicine to get rid of the worm and do not believe that it gets into their insides together with raw meat. The swear word -- wormy (cherebnyy) is considered offensive and the sick people are unwilling to confess of having the disease.' <sup id="cite_ref-1174" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1174">[1,174]</a></sup> Goiter was common among Russian settlers: 'I have yet to mention those deformities and diseases which are widespread among the Yakut. I did not notice many among them who were hunchbacked, mis-shapen, or lame; neither were there many who were tongue-tied or who lisped. Cross- eyed Yakut are more frequent; diseases of the eye are in general very widespread, and most of the old men lose their sight toward the end of their life. I did not come across any cases of goiter among non-Russians, although this is a fairly common occurence among the Russians of that region, particularly among those who live in the valley of the Lena.' <sup id="cite_ref-1175" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1175">[1,175]</a></sup> Sieroszewski provides a general summary: 'Almost nothing is known about the prevalence of other diseases; they are all treated with homemade remedies, incantations, and shamanism, and since they are accompanied by delirium and moaning, they ascribe them to the influence of hostile spirits. From the reports of medical acquaintances and my own observations, the following diseases are known to me: catarrhal, gastric, and rheumatic fevers, pneumonia, diseases o the heart, liver, and gall bladder, consumption, cancer of the throat, uterus, and stomach, and diseases of the eye... Slight inflammations of the eye are cured very successfully by licking the pus from under the eyelid with the tip of the tongue. Sometimes this is done by particular specialists who have a particularly soft and thin tongue. People come purposely to the houses of such people and pay as much as thirty kopecks for an operation. Despite the abundance of water, swamp fever is comparatively rare; sufferers are cured by frightening them, or pouring cold water over them; even oftener they are not treated at all. Fever belongs to that class of diseases against which shamanism acknowledges itself to be powerless. Rheumatism is extremely widespread; finally, the terrible disease, contraction of the throat, is not a rarity; its victims die a death from hunger. This malady is apparently found most often in those places where cattle raising is the exclusive occupation, where the supply of wild animals has been exhausted and they do not raise grain; I think it appears as a result of eating liquid foods exclusively. Besides this, it is a rare Yakut who does not suffer from tape-worm or round worm - a result of eating meat that is raw or not sufficiently cooked; the local cattle suffer equally severely from these parasites. From the observations of doctors, diseases and medicines alike act more quickly on the organisms of Yakut, than on Russians. Yakut live to a [Page 473] ripe old age: old men of seventy or eighty are far from rare among them.' <sup id="cite_ref-1176" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1176">[1,176]</a></sup></dd>

<p><b>♠ Volunteering ♣ absent ♥</b>
</p><p><b>♠ Charity ♣ absent ♥</b> Cooperative herding was practiced in the summer: 'In summer the herds of several owners unite to form one big herd which is often quite large in size. In the first place, such large herds formed from smaller ones result in economizing of the working forces, since a considerably smaller number of people is required to look after these large herds 185 [Figure 1] than is needed for the separate smaller herds which united to form the larger one; in the second place, when dark clouds, gnats, and gadflies pass over the tundra, the large herd does not disperse like the small herds do; the reindeer bunch up and keep revolving constantly, since each one of the circling group tries to squeeze into the center in order to protect his sides from the bites of the gnats. When they drive the reindeer to the camp, the latter do this “circle dance” of theirs around the chooms, which threatens to knock them down. In the case of animals with such habits very few persons are required to pasture a large herd, since the only work they have to do amounts to driving the strays back into the herd.' <sup id="cite_ref-1187" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1187">[1,187]</a></sup> 'Another advantage of having the large herds in summer is the fact that there is a sufficiently large number of workers for the times when it is necessary to guard the herd day and night--at the time when the grass grows in spring, and during the mushroom period in the summer; the sufficiently large number of people makes it possible for them to take regular shifts at the pasture, which almost never has the effect of withdrawing the working forces in the economy.' <sup id="cite_ref-1188" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1188">[1,188]</a></sup> Mutual aid between families was practiced in pitching hay: 'Ordinarily they try to place grass which has been mowed early into large ricks, for this reason also, that these ricks will have to stand the whole summer, since the Yakut throw the hay into haystacks only after they have finished all the mowing, in the last days of August or even the early part of September. It sometimes happens that downpours, which come down for whole weeks at a time in the end of July and in August, penetrate right through the small ricks, and the hay in them rots, burns, and blackens. Even in large ricks a thick crust of rotten hay always forms, and the bottom of the rick, if it has been lying on the ground, and not on a peg, rots a great deal. Only the middle of the rick remains green. This admixture of black, rotten hay is quite considerable, in view of the small size of the ricks, and given even the finest Yakut hay, which has been gathered at the proper time and has been carefully dried, a greyish color. [Page 499] Such greyish-green hay is preferred by the Yakut and is called Yakut, to distinguish it from bright green hay gathered by Russian methods, i.e. first dried out in the open air right where it has been mowed for twenty-four hours, then tedded and turned over, and heaped together on the third day, in good weather, then placed in large ricks weighing four or five poods, and finally raked into haystacks as soon as possible, as soon as the weather and the assignment of labor permits. This method of work is recommended by government ukases, whose printed blanks I saw in native upravas; it is well known to the non-Russians, particularly those who live near Russian villages and cities. The introduction of these improvements is hindered by the parallelism of household arrangements throughout the whole region which is to a considerable degree necessary, for example, the custom of opening or closing the meadows to the cattle at certain definite times, the certain sequence in which arable land is mowed, and also the necessity of pitching hay everywhere at the same time. Far from all Yakut families have the strength to pitch all the hay from their spacious farmsteads in one or two days all by themselves and quickly. On the other hand it is dangerous to continue this work very long, in view of the changeability of the weather in the second half of the local summer. They are forced to pitch hay in company with 280 other families. This makes each individual homestead owner dependent on the general progress of the labor. In families which can get along without outside help, they always try to pitch part of the hay as early as possible, in the middle of the summer. The Yakut yearning to mow as much hay as possible forces them just as naturally to treasure every day of good weather in the first half of the summer, when the grasses have not yet hardened and dried up. When the grass is already moved and put into ricks, then it is another matter. It is then that all kinds of mutual help - keme and gulyay Begin, and families join together in small [Page 500] cartels for pitching the hay. They bring the hay to the [unknown] in sleds on wh ich they pla ce not more than four or five ricks which are tightened by belts placed slantwise. At the [unknown]they overturn the sleds. In this way, enormous heaps of hay arise around the from here they systematically pile the hay into haystacks with pitchforks. Among the various kinds of pitchforks, atyrdzhakh, there is one enormous one, reaching a length of two sagenes. The Yakut are not familiar with the application of beams and with lifting up the hay in whole cart-loads. Their haystacks are small; year after year they place them in the same places, on the very highest points of the meadows where they will not be swamped with floods and the water from snows in spring. They always put the worst grasses as a foundation for the [unknown]&nbsp;: they will dampen and blacken in any case. They put the best grass in the middle of the stacks, and the more moist grass at the edges. Workers, usually women or youths, trample hard on the edges and kill the grass. Every man who raises and piles the hay with a pitchfork needs one youth on the haystack and one or two youths with the bulls in the sled, and two rakers. Such a number of Yakut workers are able to pitch from twenty-five to thirty loads of hay (cubic sagenes) in one day, i.e. to transfer from one place to another, carry away, and lift to a certain height from five to six hundred Yakut ricks each weighing one pood. The haystacks are round or rectangular in shape; the latte r shape is preferred, particularly for damp hay which has been wettened by rain.' <sup id="cite_ref-1189" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1189">[1,189]</a></sup> Social life was characterized by a lot of ad hoc mutualism: 'Among the Yakut there are only temporary co-operative unions [Page 680] in use. These are very popular. Two fisherman who come together a t the same fishing place will immediately organize a company. They will fish together and divide the catch equally. Several wood-choppers who chop wood in the same vicinity will also enter into a company, because this is more fun. Mowers often join together into small brigades consisting of five or six men and will mow the meadows of each member in turn (Namsk Ulus, 1889). A peasant woman will help her neighbor rake, in return for the same service, and it has practically become a custom to pitch hay by combining the joint strength of two or three households and doing each household's work in turn. Besides this, neighbors constantly exchange a great number of small services which demand a special skill; the number of these is beyond calculation. Cutting and sewing a dress, gluing together a broken dish, catching and restraining a raging stallion, squaring a door, finding a lost piece of livestock, and so forth -- a whole mass of services, whose total far exceeds those which are paid for by agreement, are exchanged without causing any particular misunderstanding. It is also remarkable that all these unions have clearly expressed within them the foundations of artels: equal distribution of labor and equal partnership is called kompaniya, as in Russian, although the Yakut have their own word: kytyk - kytykas, 428 which expresses this conception quite well. They also use the Russian word gulyay for the support of beggars; in the Yakut language this word is komo. The word is used by prosperous people who can afford to extend certain hospitality, or by the needy paupers themselves. The latter bow from the waist to their neighbors, give them some [Page 681] small present: a brick of tea, one ruble in money, and if the reasons presented by the petitioner were sufficiently valid, then the one supplicated will carry out the work without repayment, at his own expense: he will build a house, mow the meadow, chop and deliver kindling wood. For rich Yakut, princes, and all personages who are influential in their neighborhood, this custom of aid is exceedingly profitable. It is impossible to refuse them, while the hospitality they extent is always calculated so that it costs them less than it would to hire a laborer. The day for gulyay begins at sunrise and ends at sunset. During the working day the laborers are only fed once and given tea once; the main hospitality is extended after the work is done. Sometimes the owner brings his helpers a glass of vodka apiece; this is considered a great honor. The food given consists of kumiss or tea, milk, butter, flour, and meat. Usually they slaughter a piece of livestock and cook part of it, while the rest is given out raw as a present. Besides mowing hay, aid is given in the form of building houses, harrowing, carrying hay, and in general all kinds of work where collected efforts are useful and applicable. Only paupers and homeowners of average means are invited for aid; rich people consider it shameful for them to take part in this.' <sup id="cite_ref-1190" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1190">[1,190]</a></sup> But this does not seem to constitute charity.

In 1631 they descended by the Viliui River, a tributary of the Lena, to the Lena River and imposed tribute on the adjacent Yakut. In 1632 a party of Cossacks under the command of the Boyar’s son, Shakov, took tribute in sables from a clan of Viliui horse-breeding Yakut. The Viliui River farther up from its mouth was occupied by Tungus only. The northern boundary of the distribution of the Yakut at that time was the mouth of the Viliui. The whole Lena Valley from the mouth of the Viliui River to the south, at a distance of about 500 kilometers (or 710 miles) was occupied by Yakut. In their possession were also all the Lena islands of that region, rich in  pasture lands. There is no definite information as to how far inland they penetrated at that period. We may admit, however, that the Yakut, being horse and cattle breeders, were hardly inclined to move into the dense forests far from the majority of their tribesmen, i.e., far from the Lena Valley. In the beginning of the seventeenth century the Yakut abode on the western banks of the Lena must have been the territory of the two present  uluses  of Yakutsk District, Namskij and Western Kangalassky. There, according to Yakut traditions, was the first place of refuge of their mythical forefather, the “Tatar” Elliei. From there a part of his nearest descendants could also have emigrated over the Lena islands to the eastern banks of the Lena River, where excellent pastures are as abundant as on the western banks.' <sup id="cite_ref-1191" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1191">[1,191]</a></sup> 'We have previously noted (see p. 64) that the Yakut were subjugated by two different Cossack parties from Mangasey aand Yeniseisk. The Olekminsk fortress on the Lena River was erected in 1630 when only Tungus lived in the region. In 1637 a Cossack party, under the command of Busa, collected tribute in furs from the Yakut of the Yana River.' <sup id="cite_ref-1192" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1192">[1,192]</a></sup> The czarist administration imposed taxes and established an administrative infrastructure: 'The system of tsarist administration was no different here from what existed in any other part of Northern Siberia. The Dolgans, Yakuts and Evenks had to pay the fur-tax as “natives” and formed “clans” headed by princelings, while the tundra peasants were forced to pay a poll tax, were formed into a “community” and headed by an elder. People living many hundreds of kilometers away from the nearest centers were economically dependent on the merchants who monopolized supplies to the region, bought up all the furs, and cruelly exploited the population.' <sup id="cite_ref-1193" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1193">[1,193]</a></sup> 'The committee of Cherkashennikov which worked in the Yakutsk Oblast was only a branch of this All-Siberian commission.

The Yakut, who were listed as nomads, were excluded from the list of electors, but they sent their deputy anyway and he was allowed to join the committee by a special order of the Empress.' <sup id="cite_ref-1194" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1194">[1,194]</a></sup> 'The overall development of commodity relationships helped to speed up the development of agriculture and here and there ploughing was enforced by the administration.' <sup id="cite_ref-1195" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1195">[1,195]</a></sup> 'No less significant changes occurred in the administrative organization of the Yakut country. In the seventeenth century Yakutsk was the center of a great independent country directly subordinate to Moscow, although for some specific questions it was dependent on the governors of Tobolsk. In the time of Peter the Great, Yakutsk entered into the newly organized Siberian Goubernyia (government) and with the division of the Siberian government into provinces was included in Irkutsk Province. In 1775 Irkutsk Province was organized into a government and the Yakut country formed one of the provinces of the new government. In 1783 the government was again reorganized into a vice-royalty composed of four provinces, one of which was Yakutsk Province. In 1797 the vice-royalty was abolished and the government restored. In [Page 225] 1805 under the Emperor Alexander I, the Yakut country was made a separate province dependent upon Irkutsk. In 1852 the Yakut country was given a separate governor. After the revolution in February, 1917, a commissar was appointed by the Provisional Government.' <sup id="cite_ref-1196" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1196">[1,196]</a></sup> Sieroszewski reports corruption and exploitation of the Yakut population by administrators: 'The government undertook to regulate the distribution of Yakut land, [Page 764] partly to cease the disorders which arose as a result of this a nd partly to as sure and regulate the taking of yassak, which was being gathered with unbelievable arbitrariness and accompanied by terrible ill use, was stolen, substituted for, and hidden, and they stole from the Great Tsars by putting far too little in the treasury and by undervaluing the yassak greatly, and they impoverished the yassak-paying people and robbed the taxes and injured them.' <sup id="cite_ref-1197" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1197">[1,197]</a></sup> In addition to Russian officials, land-holding toyons also doubled as officials in their districts: 'The population was also divided into three or four classes: the toyon households belonged to the first class, and received a first-class plot, the middle households were usually assigned to the second class and the poorer people to the third and fourth classes, each receiving the corresponding clan plot. Thus, the system itself gave the toyons plots of land which were three or four times larger than those of the poorer people. It is true that in return for this the toyons had somewhat greater obligations, but the difference in their extent was extremely small. However, this inequality was by no means the only thing. The toyons actually possessed much more land, having seized it in a variety of different ways. For example, they had several plots, rather than just one, by registering them in the names of their children, workers and so on.

<p><b>♠ Degree of taxation ♣ present ♥</b> The early invaders imposed tribute in furs on the Sakha population after successful military expeditions: 'By 1620 a report had reached Tobolsk from the Mangaseya Cossacks of the Great (Lena) River and the Lena Yakut. In 1631 they descended by the Viliui River, a tributary of the Lena, to the Lena River and imposed tribute on the adjacent Yakut. In 1632 a party of Cossacks under the command of the Boyar’s son, Shakov, took tribute in sables from a clan of Viliui horse-breeding Yakut. The Viliui River farther up from its mouth was occupied by Tungus only. The northern boundary of the distribution of the Yakut at that time was the mouth of the Viliui. The whole Lena Valley from the mouth of the Viliui River to the south, at a distance of about 500 kilometers (or 710 miles) was occupied by Yakut. In their possession were also all the Lena islands of that region, rich in  pasture lands. There is no definite information as to how far inland they penetrated at that period. We may admit, however, that the Yakut, being horse and cattle breeders, were hardly inclined to move into the dense forests far from the majority of their tribesmen, i.e., far from the Lena Valley. In the beginning of the seventeenth century the Yakut abode on the western banks of the Lena must have been the territory of the two present  uluses  of Yakutsk District, Namskij and Western Kangalassky. There, according to Yakut traditions, was the first place of refuge of their mythical forefather, the “Tatar” Elliei. From there a part of his nearest descendants could also have emigrated over the Lena islands to the eastern banks of the Lena River, where excellent pastures are as abundant as on the western banks.' <sup id="cite_ref-1199" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1199">[1,199]</a></sup> 'We have previously noted (see p. 64) that the Yakut were subjugated by two different Cossack parties from Mangasey aand Yeniseisk. The Olekminsk fortress on the Lena River was erected in 1630 when only Tungus lived in the region. In 1637 a Cossack party, under the command of Busa, collected tribute in furs from the Yakut of the Yana River.' <sup id="cite_ref-1200" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1200">[1,200]</a></sup> The czarist administration imposed taxes and established an administrative infrastructure: 'The system of tsarist administration was no different here from what existed in any other part of Northern Siberia. The Dolgans, Yakuts and Evenks had to pay the fur-tax as “natives” and formed “clans” headed by princelings, while the tundra peasants were forced to pay a poll tax, were formed into a “community” and headed by an elder. People living many hundreds of kilometers away from the nearest centers were economically dependent on the merchants who monopolized supplies to the region, bought up all the furs, and cruelly exploited the population.' <sup id="cite_ref-1201" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1201">[1,201]</a></sup> 'The committee of Cherkashennikov which worked in the Yakutsk Oblast was only a branch of this All-Siberian commission. On December 14, 1766, an ukaz was issued which called for deputies from all of Russia to form a committee for establishing a better administration, discussing various problems of internal policy, and, incidentally, to establish a new code for the natives of Siberia. The Yakut, who were listed as nomads, were excluded from the list of electors, but they sent their deputy anyway and he was allowed to join the committee by a special order of the Empress.' <sup id="cite_ref-1202" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1202">[1,202]</a></sup> 'The overall development of commodity relationships helped to speed up the development of agriculture and here and there ploughing was enforced by the administration.' <sup id="cite_ref-1203" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1203">[1,203]</a></sup> 'No less significant changes occurred in the administrative organization of the Yakut country. In the seventeenth century Yakutsk was the center of a great independent country directly subordinate to Moscow, although for some specific questions it was dependent on the governors of Tobolsk. In the time of Peter the Great, Yakutsk entered into the newly organized Siberian Goubernyia (government) and with the division of the Siberian government into provinces was included in Irkutsk Province. In 1775 Irkutsk Province was organized into a government and the Yakut country formed one of the provinces of the new government. In 1783 the government was again reorganized into a vice-royalty composed of four provinces, one of which was Yakutsk Province. In 1797 the vice-royalty was abolished and the government restored. In [Page 225] 1805 under the Emperor Alexander I, the Yakut country was made a separate province dependent upon Irkutsk. In 1852 the Yakut country was given a separate governor. After the revolution in February, 1917, a commissar was appointed by the Provisional Government.' <sup id="cite_ref-1204" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1204">[1,204]</a></sup> Sieroszewski reports corruption and exploitation of the Sakha population by administrators: 'The government undertook to regulate the distribution of Yakut land, [Page 764] partly to cease the disorders which arose as a result of this a nd partly to as sure and regulate the taking of yassak, which was being gathered with unbelievable arbitrariness and accompanied by terrible ill use, was stolen, substituted for, and hidden, and they stole from the Great Tsars by putting far too little in the treasury and by undervaluing the yassak greatly, and they impoverished the yassak-paying people and robbed the taxes and injured them.' <sup id="cite_ref-1205" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1205">[1,205]</a></sup> In addition to Russian officials, land-holding toyons also doubled as officials in their districts: 'The population was also divided into three or four classes: the toyon households belonged to the first class, and received a first-class plot, the middle households were usually assigned to the second class and the poorer people to the third and fourth classes, each receiving the corresponding clan plot. Thus, the system itself gave the toyons plots of land which were three or four times larger than those of the poorer people. It is true that in return for this the toyons had somewhat greater obligations, but the difference in their extent was extremely small. However, this inequality was by no means the only thing. The toyons actually possessed much more land, having seized it in a variety of different ways. For example, they had several plots, rather than just one, by registering them in the names of their children, workers and so on. It was also the custom to give officials (who were more often than not themselves toyons) additional plots of land, so-called [...] (from the Russian word “ukaz” [edict]), for which, incidentally, there was no payment. The influential toyons also obtained extra plots called ugayy (or kharyy).  Furthermore, the toyons frequently enjoyed the right of possessing larger plots, sometimes through inheritance, cleared from the forest or formed at the site of a drained lake. The leasing of land was also common.' <sup id="cite_ref-1206" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1206">[1,206]</a></sup> We have considered furs collected from clan elders as tribute and contributions collected from households as taxation.

<p><b>♠ Wages ♣ ♥</b> Note: Pastoralism has a long history in the region: 'In prehistoric times, beginning with the northern retreat of the glaciers, many southern peoples who had to adjust themselves to the severe conditions of life in the northern forests or the polar tundra, occupied Siberia. Some of the newcomers, like the Tungus, lost many of their former culture traits, and became reindeer breeders or hunters, while others, like the Yakut, were able in the far north to retain their cattle-breeding culture of the Central Asiatic steppes. But this northward [Page 61] migration was involuntary; the southerners were forced out from their former habitat by the competition of alien tribes. Naturally, in the course of their wandering, they left some traces which have been disclosed by the work of archaeologists. Skeletal finds also have shown that northern Siberia was primarily inhabited by a long-headed people of the Nordic type who had come from the west, and who were assimilated or else annihilated by Mongoloid newcomers from the south. Many of these questions still await solution through the work of archaeologists.' <sup id="cite_ref-1207" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1207">[1,207]</a></sup> 'We have some knowledge of prehistoric Yakut monuments through the recent work of Russian archaeologists, chiefly Petri, whose excavations in the region of Lake Baikal revealed many remains of a horse and cattle breeding tribe, in all probability, the prehistoric Yakut.' <sup id="cite_ref-1208" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1208">[1,208]</a></sup> 'The identifications by the chief zoologist of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Bialanitski-Birula, of animal bones found at the Murino sites and the caves of Orkhon show that these are chiefly the remains of domesticated animals-of oxen, rams, goats, and horses. Remains of wild animals, the products of hunting, are very scarce, proving that the people were cattle breeders. Besides, no traces of agriculture were found to the north of Lake Baikal, presenting negative evidence that the prehistoric inhabitants were herders. Further, Bialanitski-Birula pointed out that the ox of these people, like that of the Yakut, was a cross-breed of the yak. Among the iron arrows were found many with bifurcated heads, a characteristic of Yakut arrows. The iron knives and scissors found have the same distinguishing marks as Yakut knives, as will be shown in the discussion of their iron industry. The horseshoe found in the excavations is exactly like the Yakut horseshoe; it is narrow, with holes for nails and one calk in the middle. The Siberian natives, even in stony mountainous places, seldom shoe their horses. The iron bits of an ancient bridle consisted of two unequal parts, without appendages in the corners. This may be explained by the manner in which the rider held the reins on the left side of the horse as do the present Yakut. Modern Yakut bits consist of two equal parts, a form which may be regarded as having been adopted from the Russians, from whom the Yakut learned to harness horses to sledges and carts, for which long reins are necessary. Formerly, the Yakut used the horse only as a riding and pack animal. Appurtenances of horse harness show that the people bred horses. An iron sickle for hay making was found by Petri. It is quite different from the Russian form and resembles the present Yakut sickle. [Page 62] An iron hook for digging edible roots and plants and iron fish hooks were also found.' <sup id="cite_ref-1209" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1209">[1,209]</a></sup> 'It is indubitable that the training of the deer was at one time the occupation of the natives throughout the country. Even in those areas of the Yakut region where there are no deer at present, deer bones are found in the ground intermingled with human ones and with metallic items of deer harness. Many localities have preserved legends about the one-time existence of the domestic deer among the inhabitants. I can point, as an example, to the valley of the Borgonski settlement, which until the coming of the Yakuts was the scene of nomadic travels of the Tungus Miore with his numerous herds; also--to the valley of the Suntarski lake, which supposedly derived its name from the Tungus Suntar. The Tungus did not know any other cattle, except the deer...The deer are the Tungus cattle! unanimously assert the legends. They also assert, that the Yakuts imitated the Tungus in their use of the deer.' <sup id="cite_ref-1210" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1210">[1,210]</a></sup> 'The capacity to bear bad weather, cold, and hunger, to eat little and literally everything and anything that grows, to be satisfied with little in time of need, and afterwards to fatten up on the good feed and to live on the reserves of the fat and the meat stored up--this capacity is remarkably developed in the [Page 313] Yakut cattle. A great deal of energy is thus spent to survive. From the point of view of productivity this capacity for survival has no significance except, perhaps, a negative one. On the other hand this quality of survival makes the Yakut cattle invaluable in pioneering. Only because of it were the Yakuts able to penetrate with their cattle so far to the north. At present the Yakuts are the northernmost cattle breeders not only in Asia, but on the whole globe. Their northernmost cattle breeding sett lements known to me are on the Amoloi river at 70° N.L. and the northernmost one visited by me (in 1882) was on The Yana River at 69° where the Kungyas River enters it. On the Kolyma, the Alazei, and the Indigirka, the breeding of horned cattle does not, at present, reach such proportions, and stops about two degrees 152 south of the above mentioned point. In ancient times, cattle breeding reached the Arctic but was practised--of course--only in the river valleys. Fossils of horned cattle are found in Ustyansk, and legends about it are preserved in Nizhne-Kolymsk and on the Allaikha (the lower course of the Indigir-' <sup id="cite_ref-1211" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1211">[1,211]</a></sup> 'All those who have tried to connect the horses of the Yakut with those of southern or western Siberia in external appearance have most often pointed to the breed of horses of the Kirghiz. So far there have been no scientific investigations based on any numerous and exact measurements. The only data worthy of attention on this subject are those found in Cherskii. On the basis of a study of the skull of a contemporary Yakut horse, brought by Doctor Bunge from the Adycha River (Berkhoyansk Okrug), Cherskii was able to establish a distinct type of Yakut horse, differing from other Siberian horses and coming closest to the tarpans of southern Russia and the western Siberian subfossilis horse. I. Cherskii classifies the Yakut horse in the eastern group, with the breed of dwarfs (the length of the skull at the base is 472 millimeters) and with medium browed horses (the width of the forehead is 235.2 millimeters). The post-tertiary fossil horse  whose remains are found in great number at the Yakutsk Oblast, bears a certain relation, in the shape of the skull and of the bones, to present Siberian breeds and, by the way, to the Yakut horse. This is the opinion of the same Doctor Cherskii. This relationship expresses itself in the moderate width of the forehead, the inclined position of the bones above the eyebrows, the narrow width of the offshoots of the bones in the forehead to the skull, the concavity of the profile, and the singular dental systemThe size of the fossil [Page 343] Yakut horses makes one class them with the tall breeds (around Lake Lyakhov) and the very tall breeks (Yana River).' <sup id="cite_ref-1212" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1212">[1,212]</a></sup> 'The finding of the fully preserved corpse of a white horse in the frozen soil of the lower Yana, as reported by Bunge , strengthens this interest, as it seems to indicate the possibility of coming to a definitive solution of this problem. The answer to both these questions is directly bound with the time of the northern migration of the Yakut and with the location of their original homeland. Here I will only note that white is still the predominant color among Yakut horses, and that [Page 344] the interbreeding of domestic with wild animals is considered by them to be advantageous for the improvement of the breed. Such interbreeding in the case of domesticated deer, as I mentioned above, is practiced even now by the Yakut and Tungus of the far north.' <sup id="cite_ref-1213" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1213">[1,213]</a></sup> 'We must analyze some discrepancies in the account of the finds representing supposedly old Yakut culture. The excavations were made in old earth huts and caves. Thus this horse and cattle-breeding tribe must have been nomadic, yet, at the same time, must have had permanent dwellings. This may be explained by their double occupation. Iron [Page 63] mining, smelting, forging, and smithing required a sedentary life. While some families of a clan, or even some members of a family, were engaged in the iron industry, their relatives nomadized with their herds. Caves may have served as temporary shelters during the winter when the wet walls became frozen and a fire was used as protection from the cold.' <sup id="cite_ref-1214" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1214">[1,214]</a></sup> The Sakha were initially nomadic pastoralists: 'Traditional pastoralism in central Yakutia required homestead self-reliance, with intense dependence on calves and foals in a harsh climate. Stables, corrals, and haying developed in conjunction with hardy breeds of cattle and short, fat, furry horses. Richer families owned hundreds of horses and cattle; poorer ones raised a few cattle or herded for others. A huge variety of dairy products, including fermented mare's milk, (Russian: KUMYS), was the staple food, with meat for special occasions. The diet was augmented by hunting (bears, elk, squirrels, hare, ferrets, fowl), fishing (salmon, carp, MUSKSUN, MUNDU), and, under Russian influence, agriculture (cereals). Wealthy Yakut hunted on horseback using dogs. The poorest Yakut, those without cattle, relied on fishing with horsehair nets and, in the north, herded reindeer like their Evenk and Yukagir neighbors.' <sup id="cite_ref-1215" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1215">[1,215]</a></sup> Most implements were made in the home: 'Before iron was imported, ironworkers used ore from local marshes. Similarly, ceramics from local clay preceded Russian pottery. Most homemade crafts were for household use: decorated birch-bark containers, leather bags, dairy-processing equipment, horsehair blankets, fur clothing, benches, hitching posts, and elaborately carved wooden containers (including CHORONS for KUMYS).' <sup id="cite_ref-1216" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1216">[1,216]</a></sup> 'Although occupations within a household were divided by gender and status, the atmosphere was usually one of productive group activity. All participated in hay making, cattle herding, and milking, but, in general, horses were more a male preserve and cattle a female responsibility. Women tended children and fires, prepared food, carried water, and made clothing and pottery. Men handled more strenuous firewood preparation, house building, sled making, hunting, fishing, and mowing. Ivory carving and wood- and metalworking were male tasks.' <sup id="cite_ref-1217" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1217">[1,217]</a></sup> Sieroszewski reports some trades, such as carpentry and blacksmithing, for the south: 'In the north, where most of the household utensils are mad at home, all are prepared with the aid of only these clumsy implements.  In the south, where trades are kept separate to a greater degree, a carpenter owns, besides these, a wide and a narrow saw, planes, a brace and bit, chisels, and sometimes even a rasp. But everywhere the axe is most important. The Yakut handle the axe in a masterly fashion and are excellent carpenters. The majority of the churches in the Yakutsk Okrug and almost all the house s in the town of Yakutsk have been built by Yakut carpenters. In their carpentry work they use the same methods, the same compass for cutting, the same pitch rope, plumb, triangle, and ruler as do the Russians. The head of the carpenters artel, the elder carpenter, is called the regulator, after the Russian fashion. But their chief instruments, the axes and knives, have retained their ancient shape.They weigh from two to no more  than four pounds, and cost from fifty kopecks to one ruble. The Yakut cut with them smoothly, cleanly, and quickly; they are ready to fashion even small pieces with an axe.' <sup id="cite_ref-1218" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1218">[1,218]</a></sup> 'As with other Siberian peoples, Yakut shamans (OIUN if male, UDAGAN if female) combine medical and spiritual practice. [...] In the nineteenth century a few Yakut leaders financed the building of Russian Orthodox churches, and many Yakut declared themselves Christian, but this did not mean that they saw Christianity and shamanism as mutually exclusive. The Yakut also believed in the spiritual power of blacksmiths.' <sup id="cite_ref-1219" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1219">[1,219]</a></sup>  But most Sakha continued to rely on household-level subsistence production after the introduction of cereal agriculture: 'In pre-Revolutionary Yakutiya the poor and middle peasant families totaled more than 80 percent of all households. One-seventh of all the households were entirely without sowings, and many were only able to sow a few hundredths of a hectare each. Most of the households (97 percent) had to do without factory-made agricultural implements. Stockbreeding produced extremely poor results. The owners of large areas of land and abundant livestock i.e.,-the kulaks and toyons, grew rich, but not so much by raising the level of land cultivation and animal husbandry as by exploiting the poor and middle peasants.' <sup id="cite_ref-1220" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1220">[1,220]</a></sup> Temporary wage labour was slightly more common in areas close to Russian settlements: 'The Yakut are unwilling to hire themselves out on a daily basis, although the daily rate of pay is always higher than the monthly or yearly rates.  Among themselves they hardly ever do this. This has begun to come into custom only in the vicinity of cities, and only very lately. The Skoptsy were particularly responsible for spreading this custom.  The Skopsty usually pay their workers in flours, baked bread, potatoes, brick tea, and sugar; only rarely in money and  in cotton goods.' <sup id="cite_ref-1221" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1221">[1,221]</a></sup> Some of the below variables may not be applicable to the Sakha.
