<dd> Decentralization trend through this period (still relatively centralized 300 CE) created Indian state of 400-1200 CE: "The essence of the state structure, beginings of which are located with varying emphasis in both pre-Gupta and Gupta periods, may be understood by referring to two interrelated points which feature repeatedly in writings on the period under review: (i) decentralized administration and (ii) political hierarchy. Both points are posited as making a sharp contrast to the state structure of the Mauryas (Close of the fourth century BC to the beginning of the second century BC), the perceived contrast being expressed in such positive statements as: '... the Kusana political organization did not possess that rigid centralization which characterized the Mauryan administrative machinery.' Corrosion of centralization acquired a faster pace in the Gupta period. According to one opinion which envisages severage stages in the evolution of early Indian polity, 'the fifth stage was marked by the process of decentralized administration in which towns, feudatories and military elements came to the forefront in both the Deccan and the north. This was partly neutralized by the emphasis on the divinity of the king. The Kusana princes assumed the official title of devaputra and instituted the cult of the worship of the dead king, and the Satavahana princes came to be compared to deified epic heroes. The last age, identical with the Gupta period, may be called the period of proto-feudal polity.' The processes which worked towards administrative decentralization are essentially seen to have derived from: (i) the practice of making land grants along with administrative privileges, and (ii) the breakdown of the state's monopoly over the army. It is thus stressed that the beneficiaries who received grants of land from kings and their feudatories were given a wide range of fiscal and administrative immunities and the immunities were such that: 'In grants, from the time of Pravarasena II Vakataka onwards (fifth century AD) the ruler gave up his control over almost all sources of revenue, including pasturage, hides and charcoal, mines for the production of salt, forced labour, and all hidden treasures and deposits.' The administrative concomitant of these fiscal immunities was that the 'donor abandoned the right to govern the inhabitants of the village that were granted'. The image of a decentralized administrative apparatus, or, more appropriately, of the virtual absence of any administrative apparatus, comes through most vividly in the following statement: 'The function of the collection of taxs, levy of forced labour, regulation of mines, agriculture, etc., together with those of the maintenance of law and order, and defence, which were hitherto performed by the state officials, were now step by step abandoned, first to the priestly class, and later to the warrior class.' That the decay of state power was comprehensive is also suggested, it is believed, by the breakup of the army into 'small police garrisons' as also through the process of the emergence of virtually autonomous military officials. At the level of commerce, the departure from the Mauryan pattern of rigidly state-controlled commerce and industry is seen in the emergence of autonomous nigamas and srenis, both connoting corporate bodies which regulated their own affairs without interference from the state. The autonomy of the corporations is again believed to have crystallized by the late Gupta period. An example, often cited, is provided by a set of charters from western India dated to the close of the sixth century. The charters were addressed to a group of traders and granted them various immunities; they exempted them from various dues, 'left them free to deal with labourers, herdsmen, etc. and authorised them to impose forced labour on certain artisans. The traders were allowed immunity from the entry of royal officials in their area and from payment of dues and rations for supporting these officials. ... Administrative decentralization, manifest in different ways, was linked primarily with the emergence of political hierarchy, which again contrasts sharply with Mauryan bureaucratic centralization and the absence of intermediary layers in the Mauryan political system."<sup id="cite_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Asvamedha ♥</b> The asvamedha is an elaborate ritual performed by a consecrated king, with the help of hundreds of retainers. Its central act consists of the sacrifice of a horse (there is debate as to whether this sacrifice was literal or symbolic). This horse had been allowed to roam freely, escorted by 300 armed men and 100 horses, in the period preceding the ritual: a year according to most sources, although it is possible that this "year" was actually only one or a few days. The king could claim whichever territory the horse wandered into, whether it belonged to him or not. As for the sacrifice itself, it was preceded by the sacrifice of a dog (or a different animal, or several animals), and followed by mock-copulation between the queen and the dead horse, as well as by the recitation, on the part of the king, of obscene phrases. This ritual was performed rarely, and only by particularly powerful kings. It had many aims. According to Doniger <sup id="cite_ref-195" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-195">[195]</a></sup>, its main aim was to purify the king from the bloodshed that his position as ruler of an empire made inevitable, and to provide him with the pretext of conquering new territories. According to Zaroff <sup id="cite_ref-196" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-196">[196]</a></sup>, it was meant "to strengthen social bonds, assure military victory and [the] well being of the community". According to Kak <sup id="cite_ref-197" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-197">[197]</a></sup>, it was meant to "regenerates the powers and the fame of the king".</dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ puja ♥</b> "While the Yajna was central during Vedic times, the ceremonial rites of Puja became widespread in the post-Vedic or classical period [i.e. circa 400 BCE-300 CE], coming to the foreground as the quintessential Hindu ritual. [...] "Appearing initially in the scenic rites of sacred dramas and more fully developed within the textual tradition of the Agamas, Puja or Deva Puja was a form of religious ritual that Hindus began to perform on a variety of occasions to petition or show respect to their chosen gods or goddesses. Puja may be defined as any act of showing reverence to a god, a spirit, or another aspect of the divine through invocations, prayers, offerings, songs, and rituals. An essential part of Puja for the Hindu devotee is making a personal connection with the divine. Most often the contact is facilitated through an object: an element of nature, a sculpture, a vessel, or a painting. During Puja an image or other symbol of the god serves as a means of gaining access to the divine. The icon is not the deity itself; rather it is believed to be filled with the deity’s cosmic energy or spirit. [...]. "Many devout Hindus in the modern world still perform Puja once or twice a day. As such, Puja should be done after a shower or bath, and it is recommended that Puja rites be performed before food intake to ensure purity (sattva) and full concentration (dhyana). Puja is performed on special occasions in addition to the daily ritual. [...] "Puja normally includes activities or observances like meditation (dhyana), the practice of austerity (tapas), chanting (mantra), scripture reading (svadhyaya), offering food (naivedya) and prostrations (ashtanga pranama, dandavat). The individual may apply a tilaka mark on the forehead with sandalwood paste and then a vermillion (kumkum) dot in its centre. This signifies submission to the divine presence. "Puja is usually concluded with an Arati ceremony to the deity, including a series of offerings. Puja may be performed by an individual or as part of a group. The ritual may be observed in silence or accompanied by prayers and songs. [...] "As part of the overall Puja ritual sequence, an Arati ceremony is usually conducted in which the flame from burning wicks soaked in ghee (clarified butter) or camphor is offered to one or more Devas or Devis. [...] In relation to food offerings, it takes place just after the food is placed on the altar and 'consumed' by the deity. Generally Arati is performed during most all Hindu ceremonies and occasions. The activity involves the clockwise movement of the offered article, whether incense, flower, lamp wick, plate, or other, before the image or symbol and is generally accompanied by the singing of songs in praise of a deva or holy person. In the process the article itself is supposed to acquire sacred power. The priest may then circulate the article, especially the plate with burning lamp wick, among all those present, who cup their downturned hands over the flame and then raise their palms to their forehead. The purificatory blessing, passed from the divine to the flame, has now been passed to the devotee. [...] "One of the purposes of performing Arati is to ward off evil effects and the malefic influence of the 'evil eye.' [...] "The Vishnudharmasutra (chapter 65) provides one of the earliest (ca. 300 b.c.e. ) detailed descriptions of Deva Puja of Vishnu. This Puja ceremony has integrated the Vedic chanting of the Gayatri Mantra and the Purusha-Sukta. The Pujaprakasa section presents the details of this Deva Puja in sixteen stages or Upacaras that have become more or less standardized in temple ritual sequences: avahana (invite), asana (offer seat), padya (wash feet), arghya (wash hands), acamaniya (offer water to drink), snana (bathe), vastra (clothe), yajnopavita (offer sacred thread), anulepana (offer sandalwood paste), gandha (offer fragrances), puspa (offer flowers), dhupa (offer incense), dipa (offer lamp wick), naivedya (offer food), namaskara (offer prostrations), pradakshina (circumambulate) and visarjana (conclude).

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ puja ♥</b> "While the Yajna was central during Vedic times, the ceremonial rites of Puja became widespread in the post-Vedic or classical period [i.e. circa 400 BCE-300 CE], coming to the foreground as the quintessential Hindu ritual. [...] "Appearing initially in the scenic rites of sacred dramas and more fully developed within the textual tradition of the Agamas, Puja or Deva Puja was a form of religious ritual that Hindus began to perform on a variety of occasions to petition or show respect to their chosen gods or goddesses. Puja may be defined as any act of showing reverence to a god, a spirit, or another aspect of the divine through invocations, prayers, offerings, songs, and rituals. An essential part of Puja for the Hindu devotee is making a personal connection with the divine. Most often the contact is facilitated through an object: an element of nature, a sculpture, a vessel, or a painting. During Puja an image or other symbol of the god serves as a means of gaining access to the divine. The icon is not the deity itself; rather it is believed to be filled with the deity’s cosmic energy or spirit. [...]. "Many devout Hindus in the modern world still perform Puja once or twice a day. As such, Puja should be done after a shower or bath, and it is recommended that Puja rites be performed before food intake to ensure purity (sattva) and full concentration (dhyana). Puja is performed on special occasions in addition to the daily ritual. [...] "Puja normally includes activities or observances like meditation (dhyana), the practice of austerity (tapas), chanting (mantra), scripture reading (svadhyaya), offering food (naivedya) and prostrations (ashtanga pranama, dandavat). The individual may apply a tilaka mark on the forehead with sandalwood paste and then a vermillion (kumkum) dot in its centre. This signifies submission to the divine presence. "Puja is usually concluded with an Arati ceremony to the deity, including a series of offerings. Puja may be performed by an individual or as part of a group. The ritual may be observed in silence or accompanied by prayers and songs. [...] "As part of the overall Puja ritual sequence, an Arati ceremony is usually conducted in which the flame from burning wicks soaked in ghee (clarified butter) or camphor is offered to one or more Devas or Devis. [...] In relation to food offerings, it takes place just after the food is placed on the altar and 'consumed' by the deity. Generally Arati is performed during most all Hindu ceremonies and occasions. The activity involves the clockwise movement of the offered article, whether incense, flower, lamp wick, plate, or other, before the image or symbol and is generally accompanied by the singing of songs in praise of a deva or holy person. In the process the article itself is supposed to acquire sacred power. The priest may then circulate the article, especially the plate with burning lamp wick, among all those present, who cup their downturned hands over the flame and then raise their palms to their forehead. The purificatory blessing, passed from the divine to the flame, has now been passed to the devotee. [...] "One of the purposes of performing Arati is to ward off evil effects and the malefic influence of the 'evil eye.' [...] "The Vishnudharmasutra (chapter 65) provides one of the earliest (ca. 300 b.c.e. ) detailed descriptions of Deva Puja of Vishnu. This Puja ceremony has integrated the Vedic chanting of the Gayatri Mantra and the Purusha-Sukta. The Pujaprakasa section presents the details of this Deva Puja in sixteen stages or Upacaras that have become more or less standardized in temple ritual sequences: avahana (invite), asana (offer seat), padya (wash feet), arghya (wash hands), acamaniya (offer water to drink), snana (bathe), vastra (clothe), yajnopavita (offer sacred thread), anulepana (offer sandalwood paste), gandha (offer fragrances), puspa (offer flowers), dhupa (offer incense), dipa (offer lamp wick), naivedya (offer food), namaskara (offer prostrations), pradakshina (circumambulate) and visarjana (conclude).

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Spring Festival ♥</b> The Spring Festival appears to be one of the oldest Hindu celebrations.<sup id="cite_ref-324" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-324">[324]</a></sup> Because it has changed through time and is performed somewhat differently in different regions, but no accounts appear to exist of how it was performed in this polity specifically, the ritual coded here is a generic, "essential" version. "With respect to the fundamental characteristics of the Vasantotsava as found in the above Sanskrit texts, we can fruitfully focus our attention in four general directions. Firstly, the Spring Festival crosses sectarian boundaries. It is a popular festival celebrated by several sects as well as outside any readily identifiable sectarian context. No main deity or group of deities is here the consistent object of devotion; the Vasantotsava may be celebrated by all, regardless of private or public devotional affiliations. Second, the element of fire appears in some context in almost all descriptions of this festival: it is a symbol of death, renewal, transformation and purification. Third, the significance of the marriage motif with respect to the Vasantotsava is indicated by a number of texts including the Bhavisya Purana (as previously noted). [...] Fourth and finally the rituals of the Vasantotsava revolve, to a greater or lesser extent, around sensuality. The festival is a fertility festival and erotic motifs from both the mortal and the immortal realms are freely combined with fertility motifs. These four components of the Spring Festival will be treated in turn in the sections that follow. "[...] "The eroticism of the spring celebrations as found in the Ratnavali is characterized by a certain amount of social freedom and licentiousness. Thus the Spring Festival is a peculiar mix of control and freedom: the festival occurs within the city under the auspices of kings and Brahmins and at the same time social barriers are purposefully broken down and the erotic permeates the ritual. The breakdown of social relationships is indicated by rituals such as playing 'Holi' (throwing colored powder), mixing of castes and men and women in the streets, sex, licence, and powder. Eroticism and sexual licence as brought out in the throwing of powder and dancing which comprise this festival reflect the sexual potency of the season." <sup id="cite_ref-325" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-325">[325]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ pilgrimage initiation ritual ♥</b> Dysphoria is not alien to Indian ritual systems. However, the vast majority of the scholarly literature, at least in English, focuses uniquely on dysphoric rituals that are performed by individuals, often in isolation--e.g. particularly extreme forms of Jain fasting rituals, or Aghori corpse meditation. Collective dysphoric rituals exist in contemporary South India, and some of them appear to have particularly ancient origins. Of course, it is problematic to assume that contemporary South Indian rituals have been the same for hundreds, or even thousands, of years. However, at this early stage of the Seshat enterprise, it is acceptable to use "low-hanging fruit", as we wait for experts to look through the data and confirm or deny the validity of our choices. Moreover, this is what anthropologist Paul Younger <sup id="cite_ref-365" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-365">[365]</a></sup> writes on the subject of the antiquity of certain rituals: "in some festivals participants insisted that the festival had been celebrated in exactly the same way since preagricultural times and that the hunting symbols providing the basic structure of the celebration were taken from the everyday occupation of the early celebrants. While I was sceptical at first, and made determined efforts to find external evidence to date the celebrations, in the end I found the internal evidence convincing, and suspect that the festivals structured around preagricultural ritual symbols might well be quite old." The ritual coded here is a pilgrimage ritual, loosely based on the pilgrimage to the Sabarimalai shrine of Ayyappan in the mountains of Kerala. The following is a detailed description of this pilgrimage. Though it is unlikely that this ritual was performed exactly the same way in ancient India, it seems reasonable to infer that groups of young men performed arduous and possibly dangerous journeys to remote shrines, as a kind of initiation into adulthood. "For either 41 or 51 days (there seems to be a difference on how long the vow should hold) a small group (I observed groups as small as three and as large as fifty) is bound together in the three activities of preparation, travel, and celebration. [...] For the duration of the pilgrimage, this small group cuts itself off from the rest of society and tries to leave all distinctions of age, status, or any other form of social identity behind. Acting as one unified personality, they assume the personality of an exuberant male youth familiar with the forest. "For a rather high percentage of the participants, the 'first‐timers' (kaṇṇis), the entire exercise is an initiation, much like Manikantha's when he went into the forest for tiger's milk just before he was to be crowned as yuvarāja. Probably in years past this initiatory aspect of the pilgrimage was more central, and almost the whole of the ritual was an initiation of South Indian youth. Even now, most of the preparatory rituals are much like initiation rites. "The most important step in the preparation is saying the solemn vow in the home‐town temple. For this ceremony a large number of family members usually accompany the participant to lend their support. The vow involves a promise to wear a black lungi (a dramatic contrast to the usual white one worn by South Indian men), to eat only the simple fruits and millets in the forest, to abstain from sexual activity, and to grow a beard. The vow is sealed by the wearing of a rudrākṣa necklace. The group takes this vow together and thereby place themselves under an experienced spiritual guide, or periyaswāmi, who will take charge until they return. "Under the strict guidance of the periyaswāmi, the trip begins with each kaṇṇi wrapping up a two‐compartment packet (irumuṭi). The front compartment holds items for the final act of worship (a coconut filled with ghee, dried rice, betel leaves, arecanuts, and a coin), and the back compartment holds other coconuts for worship along the way and more rice and gram for the pilgrim's consumption. The packet is carried on the head throughout the trip. Once the packets are ready, the periyaswāmi leads the group off toward the mountains, visiting as many temples as he can find along the way. All along the way (under some periyaswāmis for 24 hours of every day), antiphonal chants ring out (called the śaraṇam viḷi) varying the name from 'Ayyappaṉ śaraṇam' ('I take refuge in Ayyappaṉ') to 'Swāmiye śaraṇam,' to 'Śaraṇam Ayyappaṉ,' until the participants are dazed and participate in the nonstop activity of the group with blind impulsiveness. "When the group reaches the little town of Erumeli at the edge of the forest, the second‐year swāmis paint the kaṇṇis in colored paints and require them to perform the wild petta tuḷḷal dance until they reach uncontrollable frenzy. After this, the initiates are again warned that the forest is full of tigers and wild elephants and reminded that the trip involves the climbing of steep slopes and the swimming of turbulent rivers, so that only those spiritually prepared are likely to live. Thus prepared, the group undertakes the last part of the pilgrimage, which involves walking through the dense forest for 4 days and 45 kilometers of arduous climbing. "Finally the pilgrims arrive at the long‐sought wondrous shrine. There the noisy crowd becomes an object of reverence itself, and the cries of thousands constantly ascend. Gradually groups line up at the 18 steep stone steps before the temple, and in a last cry of exuberance throw ghee‐filled coconuts against the stone. Then, with the assistance of anchored ropes and calm police constables standing on carefully braced platforms, the worshipers climb the sacred steps and enter the quieter confines of the temple. There they watch in wonder as the priests pour the ghee from their coconuts over the image of Ayyappaṉ. In a surprisingly short time, they head for home. "One of the most notable features of this festival, which distinguishes it from all others I know in the area, is that women are not allowed to participate. Women were not allowed to participate in the past because the central ritual is really a male initiation rite that tests the young man's ability to stand up to the rigor of a dangerous forest." <sup id="cite_ref-366" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-366">[366]</a></sup></dd>

<p><b>♠ Rulers are legitimated by gods ♣ present ♥</b> “The magical power which pervaded the king at his consecration was restored and strengthened in the course of his reign by further rites, such as the ceremonial rejuvenation of the ‘’vajapeya’’ and the horse-sacrifice (‘’asvamedha’’, p. 42), which not only ministered to his ambition and arrogance, but also ensured the prosperity and fertility of the kingdom. Implicit in the whole brahmanic ritual was the idea of the king’s divine appointment, and though the rajasuya was replaced in later times by a simplified ‘’abhiseka’’, or baptism, the ceremony still had its magical flavour.” <sup id="cite_ref-415" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-415">[415]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Rulers are gods ♣ present ♥</b> “Divinity was cheap in ancient India. Every brahman was in a sense a god, as were ascetics with a reputation for sanctity. Householders sponsoring and financing sacrifices were in theory raised to divinity, at least for the duration of the ceremony, while even sticks and stones might be alive with inherent godhead. Moreover the gods were fallible and capable of sin. If the king was a god on earth he was only one god among many, and so his divinity might not always weigh heavily upon his subjects.” <sup id="cite_ref-422" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-422">[422]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of equality ♣ absent ♥</b> Caste system. "There have been a number of attempts to underplay, to question, and to lampoon the hierarchical inequality and even the existence of the caste system. As we will also see it differs, in some degree, from region to region. However, the concepts of varna and, more importantly, jati lie at the heart of the caste system and they form an ideal core around which the complexity of detail and difference can then be erected. [...] Thus the four varnas are the Brahmins who represent priesthood and learning, the Kshatriyas who represent the warriors and kings, who protect the people, the Vaishyas who represent the people who engage in agriculture, farming and trade, and the Shudras who represent the servants who look after and serve the others. The Brahmins fulfil the function of the mouth, the Kshatriyas fulfil the function of the arms, the Vaishyas fulfil the function of the thighs, and the Shudras fulfil the function of the feet. The model is clearly a hierarchy but it is a complementary hierarchy and unity, wherein the different elements sustain one another. [...] In practice the key to the caste system are the sub-castes, or jatis. There are a great number of these in each varna, and in practice there is a hierarchy within each set so that only certain jatis can marry and eat with each other. Not all Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas or Shudras can marry or eat together. Those privileges are confined to a limited number of jatis within each varna. [...] Clearly there have been changes in the system over long centuries. Particular jatis have elevated themselves through economic means, through disputing status, through propaganda, through moving, through changing religion, and so on. But on the whole, over such a long period of time, the system has remained strong, especially in the villages. [...] The strength of the caste system has been enhanced by another principle emphasised by Dumont (1980) in his classical work entitled ‘’Homo Hierarchicus: The Caste System and its Implications’’. According to Dumont, in addition to the distinctions already outlined that fit varnas and jatis into hierarchies, another must be added. This distinction takes caste hierarchical divides beyond the kind of class distinctions found in eighteenth-century Britain or in the Ancien Regime in Europe, by stressing the opposition between purity and pollution. Caste difference, according to this classification, goes beyond class differences into this other realm of ritual purity and pollution. The Brahmins are the highest and purest varna, and the Dalits are the lowest, in that they are outside varna and are impure altogether. The other varnas rank in between. Pollution occurs in different ways. It occurs through bodily contact of one sort or another, with menstrual cycles, through birth and death, through emissions such as faeces, urine and saliva, and through contact with night-soil, dirty clothes, unswept rooms and so on. Thus marriage and sex have to function within the correct set of jatis in the correct varna. Polluting jobs such as laundering and sweeping are done by people of lower castes so that the blood of people of higher castes can remain ‘pure’. Equally menstrual activity among older women makes them more ‘impure’ than men or pre-menstrual virgins, and therefore women are more polluting than men. They will thus often live semi-separately while menstruating, during which time they will also avoid going to the temple and therefore ‘polluting’ the gods. Furthermore, untouchable Dalits were prohibited from entering many temples before the post-Independence freedom-of-temple-entry legislation and even now they are kept out of some temples in many villages. [...] It is also true to say that Dumont’s thesis suffers from exaggeration and other matters are important in discussing caste. Nevertheless, there is at least an element of truth in the notion that purity and pollution has relevance in any discussion of caste.” <sup id="cite_ref-423" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-423">[423]</a></sup>

</p><p><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of monogamy ♣ absent ♥</b>  “Notwithstanding the Hindu ideal of monogamous marriage as a saṃskara, a one-to-one union for life, traditional Hindu law clearly permitted polygamy to men in certain situations and on certain grounds. In this, Hindu law is similar to Islamic law in approach, as well as to Chinese law and African laws, all of which tolerate polygamy to some extent. Meyer (1952: 108) wrote that (p.378) polygamy in India is ‘as old as the hills and does not form the slightest offence in the Brahmanic system’, although since Vedic times monogamy is seen as the ideal. This is confirmed by Mitra (1965: 49) with quotes from earlier sources, to the effect that ‘the fundamental conception of marriage was monogamous and not polygamous’. M.

<dd><b>♠ morality ♣ present ♥</b> “Universal dharma relates to all humanity and it includes ethical virtues such as compassion, generosity, gratitude, and non-violence. These virtues that are said to be common to all humans are known as sadharana (common) or sanatana (eternal) dharma. For example, the Law of Manu (X:63) argues that non-injury, truth, not stealing, purity and control of the senses summarise dharma for the four castes. Elsewhere Manu (VI:91- 2) asserts that avoiding backbiting, hypocrisy, greed, infatuation, anger and discontent is approved dharma for all the stages of life. The problem is that there are different views as to what the actuality of universal dharma is. Radhakrishnan, for example, argues for a sanatana dharma, based upon Advaita Vedanta thought, that is said to be present in all religious traditions. It is a kind of perennial philosophy that is at the heart of every religious tradition not just at the heart of the Hindu tradition. Others concentrate upon a universal dharma within the Hindu tradition itself but there is no absolute consensus as to what it is. Nevertheless, in theory, the ethical virtues of compassion, generosity, gratitude, and non-violence are universally regarded by most Hindus.” <sup id="cite_ref-438" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-438">[438]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Number of officially sanctioned supernatural beings ♣ polytheistic ♥</b> "According to one popular formula, there are 330 million gods in Hinduism. Nevertheless, most Hindus have believed that there is ultimately one deity, and that the diversity of other gods are his or her emanations or manifestations, representing his or her agency in particular contexts. [...] The three gods most commonly worshipped as the ultimate in Hindu traditions are Visnu, Siva, and the Goddess, variously called Devī, "Goddess," and Sakti, "Power." This triad of deities must be distinguished from an overlapping group of three deities who are conceived in the Puranas and other authoritative traditions to perform particular cosmic functions - Brahma, who creates the universe anew in each vast cosmic cycle, and also, in some accounts, bestows the Veda upon humanity; Visnu, who preserves the universe by intervening to rectify problems through his avataras, "descents" or "incarnations"; and Siva, who destroys the universe at the end of each cosmic cycle. [...] [W]hichever deity is conceived as the ultimate is understood to be the source who emanates the others, both the triad who perform the aforementioned cosmic functions and lower supernatural beings, and thus to be the ultimate agent in their actions. [...] There are numerous other important deities besides those frequently conceived as a monotheistic ultimate. One of the most important of these is Ganesa, a son of Siva with the head of an elephant, believed to be a protective figure that removes obstacles. Another is Hanuman, the monkey-god who helped Rama in his battle against Ravana, idealized for his devotion to Rama and Sīta. Other deities important in particular regions include the South Indian Ayappa, regarded as the son of Siva and a female avatara of Visnu; and smallpox goddesses such as the North Indian Sitala." <sup id="cite_ref-465" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-465">[465]</a></sup></dd>

He sees the entire universe, the sun, stars, and planets, and all the people gathered on the battlefield within the body of Krishna. Krishna tells him that everything that exists is part of himself, but that he is not limited to everything that exists.

By the law of karma, every thought, word, and deed carries with it a like reaction. Beings are born, live, die, and are reborn based on their actions. Every good deed brings a reward, and every bad deed a punishment. The terms ‘reward’ and ‘punishment’ are deceptive, however; for karma is not seen as a set of rewards and punishments doled out by a just God, but in impersonal terms, as the working of natural law. Karma attracts reactions to moral agents like an ethical law of gravity. Benevolent actions produce good results for the person who engages in them. Similarly, actions intended to cause suffering will lead to suffering for those who commit them." <sup id="cite_ref-468" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-468">[468]</a></sup></dd></dl>

Not all Brahmins have been priests and not all Kshatriyas have been rulers. The complexity of the caste system, regional and linguistic differences and historical change have all militated against this rigidity. [...]Brahmins have traditionally been seen as ritually more pure than Kshatriyas and more versed in religious knowledge. They are, in theory if not always in fact, the key scholars in the Hindu tradition. The Kshatriyas have traditionally been seen, again in theory if not always in practice, as the rulers who maintain society, uphold dharma and protect the householder system. They built and sponsored temples, protected their subjects and their deities and, to that extent, the Brahmins recognised a ruler’s overlordship. However, the kingly role in ruling and guardianship duties involved more ‘polluting tendencies’ than were usual in a Brahmin’s life. The Brahmins have had a dual role in society. Those who are active priests in temples have engaged in functions that involve being given gifts by worshippers and such temple priests are more involved with lower castes. Paradoxically Brahmins who are versed in promoting scholarship and in advancing religious learning but who do not act as serving priests are, in general, more widely admired because they have less contact with the public. Thus Brahmins who are not priests can be more akin to those renouncers engaged in lifelong learning and spirituality, rather than in the hurly-burly of householder life. To that extent they would receive greater respect than Kshatriyas." <sup id="cite_ref-479" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-479">[479]</a></sup></dd>

According to Dumont, in addition to the distinctions already outlined that fit varnas and jatis into hierarchies, another must be added. This distinction takes caste hierarchical divides beyond the kind of class distinctions found in eighteenth-century Britain or in the Ancien Regime in Europe, by stressing the opposition between purity and pollution. Caste difference, according to this classification, goes beyond class differences into this other realm of ritual purity and pollution. The Brahmins are the highest and purest varna, and the Dalits are the lowest, in that they are outside varna and are impure altogether. The other varnas rank in between. Pollution occurs in different ways. It occurs through bodily contact of one sort or another, with menstrual cycles, through birth and death, through emissions such as faeces, urine and saliva, and through contact with night-soil, dirty clothes, unswept rooms and so on. Thus marriage and sex have to function within the correct set of jatis in the correct varna. Polluting jobs such as laundering and sweeping are done by people of lower castes so that the blood of people of higher castes can remain ‘pure’. Equally menstrual activity among older women makes them more ‘impure’ than men or pre-menstrual virgins, and therefore women are more polluting than men. They will thus often live semi-separately while menstruating, during which time they will also avoid going to the temple and therefore ‘polluting’ the gods. Furthermore, untouchable Dalits were prohibited from entering many temples before the post-Independence freedom-of-temple-entry legislation and even now they are kept out of some temples in many villages. [...] It is also true to say that Dumont’s thesis suffers from exaggeration and other matters are important in discussing caste. Nevertheless, there is at least an element of truth in the notion that purity and pollution has relevance in any discussion of caste." <sup id="cite_ref-482" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-482">[482]</a></sup></dd>

The householder’s business is the maintenance and support of those in the other three stages of life: the students who have not yet entered into the world of work, the retirees who have seen the birth of grandchildren and spotted their first gray hairs, and the renunciants, those who have left behind not only the world of work and material possession but who have also left behind family and self-interest for a life focused on spiritual freedom. Householders are the ones with material wealth, and their responsibility, their dharma, is to share it with others. [...] The link between the world of the householder and the world of the renunciant is gift giving - dana. The classic image is of the renouncer with the begging bowl, making the rounds for alms. On a daily basis, in Hindu society, food is given to sannyasins and sadhus, the world renouncers who have "cast off" from the settled world of "this shore."<sup id="cite_ref-485" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-485">[485]</a></sup> However, no evidence could be found for actual enforcement of this behaviour--e.g. punishment for not giving food to renouncers.
