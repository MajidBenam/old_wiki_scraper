<p>China was reunified after the Northern and Southern dynasties period by the short-lived Sui dynasty (581-618 CE).

Yangdi  undertook massive infrastructure projects including the fortification of the Great Wall, and the construction of a third capital at Jiangdu, and the Grand Canal. He also conducted many military campaigns including multiple attempts to conquer the Korean Peninsula. <sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> His overuse of conscripted corvee labor coupled with natural disasters led to famine, and the dynasty was overthrown by massive peasant rebellions and revolts by nobles after only 37 years of rule.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> Sui construction of infrastructure and government reforms paved the way for the lasting rule of the Tang.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup>

First, the number of combat troops is difficult to reconcile with the organizational structure and unit strengths outlined above. Emperor Yang’s host at Zhuo commandery consisted of thirty armies, each composed of 4000 cavalry and 8000 infantry plus musicians, mounted archers, and an unspecified number of personnel attached to the baggage train; since this last group was also organized into four battalions, it seems likely that it did not greatly exceed 8000 men. The strength of each would then have been in the neighborhood of 20,000, making a total of 600,000. When the men who appear to have been assigned to the fleet are added to this figure, we are left with a grand total of 670,000." <sup id="cite_ref-181" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-181">[181]</a></sup>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ imperial sacrifice at the capital ♥</b> No sources could be found which offered an explicit description of how the imperial sacrifice to Heaven was carried out during the Sui dynasty. At best, we can infer that descriptions of this ritual as it was performed during the Tang dynasty may have roughly corresponded to the way it was performed during the Sui dynasty as well: "(1) Observance of the seclusion regulations. The emperor observes seven days of seclusion (mal) prior to the sacrifice. [...] "(2) Establishment of the ritual positions. Three days before the ceremony, positions for an the participants and invited spectators, as well as for the ritual vessels, sacrificial victims, and other paraphernalia are marked out at the altar site. [...] "(3) Inspection of the sacrificial victims and vessels. [...] On the day of the sacrifice, before dawn, the sacrificial victims are slaughtered; the hide and blood of the animals are used to fill dishes that later will be placed before the spirit-thrones of the gods on the altar, and the flesh of the animals is cooked. "(4) The imperial carriage leaves the palace. At dawn the emperor is escorted by his officials, amidst panoply and music, from the T'ai-chi Hall to the detached palace at the site of the round altar. The detached palace is the scene of the emperor's last day of strict seclusion prior to performing the sacrifice to Heaven. After arriving at the detached palace, the emperor meets in audience with his civil and military officials, who afterward return to the imperial palace. "(5) Presentation of jade and silk. Before dawn on the day of the sacrifice, the ritual officers place offerings of jade and silk in round baskets and food in various vessels. They are then carried to the round altar, which is now swept clean. Musicians, dancers, presiding ritual officers, and spectators all take their places. Shortly before dawn, the emperor is borne by palanquin out of the detached palace. He mounts his carriage of state and is escorted as far as the great canopy, to which he is again borne by palanquin, and where he rests. Precisely at dawn the emperor changes his robe to one traditionally worn by rulers sacrificing to Heaven, and is led into the inner precincts of the altar. Emperor, participants, and spectators all make double obeisances toward the spirit-thrones of Hao-t'ien shang-ti and the <i>p'ei</i>, Kao-tsu. The ritual officials then kneel and remove the jade and silk offerings from their baskets. The emperor mounts the altar by the southern stairs and faces north, as subject, now, not as sovereign. Receiving the jade and silk, he kneels and places them at the spirit-throne of Hao-t'ien shang-ti. The emperor prostrates himself, rises, and is led to the spirit-throne of the associated ancestral deity, Kao-tsu, where, facing east, he makes another offering of silk. He then descends the altar. "(6) Offerings of cooked food. As the emperor had been making his offerings of jade and silk, ritual officers had brought trays of food consecrated to Hao-t'ien shang-ti to the outer precincts of the altar. They are now brought to the various staircases of the altar proper. The dishes of skin and blood from the sacrificial animals are taken up to the top tier and placed before the spirit-throne of Hao-t'ien shang-ti. The emperor is led to a washstand, where he laves his hands and the ritual winecup and dries them carefully. He then mounts the altar via the southern staircase. A ritual officer ladles wine into the winecup, and the emperor is led to Hao-t'ien shang-ti's spirit-throne. Facing north, he kneels and places the winecup down before the spirit-throne. An officer now intones the sacrificial prayer in which the emperor refers to himself as "Your Subject, X, who has succeeded to the position Son of Heaven". The emperor makes a similar offering of wine before the spirit-throne of the associated ancestral deity, while another prayer is intoned, this time referring to the emperor as the p'ei's such-and-such generation descendant, "Emperor and Subject, X". After performing a double obeisance, the emperor is again led to Hao-t'ien shang-ti's spirit-throne and handed the ritual winecup. Kneeling before the spirit-throne, the emperor sacrifices the wine, sipping it. He replaces the winecup, prostrates himself, and rises. The trays containing the sacrificial flesh are now brought in and given to the emperor, who hands them in turn to his attendants. The emperor kneels, takes up the winecup again, and drains the wine. He prostrates himself, rises, makes a double obeisance, and descends the altar. Secondary (<i>ya-hsien</i>) and tertiary offerings (<i>chung-hsien</i>) are made to Hao-t'ien shang-ti and the associated ancestral deity by other ritual participants, and the more minor deities on and around the round altar are also sacrificed to. "Afterward, the emperor is led to the station for 'observing the fire.' where he assumes his customary place facing south. Ritual officers approach the spirit-thrones on the round altar with baskets, removing the jade and silk offerings and the prayer-tablets. They take these, along with the dishes containing the sacrificial flesh, millet, glutinous rice, and the ritual wine and descend the altar via different staircases, proceeding to yet another altar constructed of firewood. All the articles removed from the round altar are placed on the firewood. The wood is ignited, and when it is half-consumed by the fire the ceremony is pronounced completed. The emperor is now led back to his great canopy. "(7) Return of the imperial carriage to the palace." <sup id="cite_ref-236" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-236">[236]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ ancestor worship ♥</b> "The living communicated with their ancestors through solemn divination, reports, prayers, and offerings of wine and food. Those in charge of states, fiefs, and families were privileged and obliged to officiate at rites; those not so privileged were expected to assist in whatever capacity was appropriate to them. The chief sacrificer had to purify himself in advance through abstinence of varying duration. At the appointed time, he would enter the consecrated ancestral shrine, bow, prostrate himself, and make offerings of food and wine. He was assisted by a variety of attendants, including those who prepared the food, took charge of the utensils, performed divinations, and pronounced prayers. During major sacrifices, one boy or man, preferably a son of the chief sacrificer, would act as a vessel for the spirit of the ancestors. This impersonator also needed to undergo purification before the rite. During the rite he would drink the wine offered to the ancestors and in trancelike fashion passively allow the spirits to animate him. A ritual expert would interpret the ancestors' wishes, which in the standard liturgy of the <i>I-Ii</i> was to convey blessings." <sup id="cite_ref-323" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-323">[323]</a></sup> NOTE: It seems more sensible, here, to exclude "major sacrifices" and only consider the simpler types of ancestor worship: it seems reasonable to infer that the latter occurred more frequently than the former. However, it would be quite easy to change a few key variables from "absent" to "present" should it be decided to incorporate the major sacrifices in this ritual--Cho-Yun and Linduff (1988), in particular, offer a detailed description of these rites.</dd>

Pounding drums disturb heaven and flaming torches light the earth; people don animal masks and men wear women's clothes. Actors and acrobats contort their shapes and make strange their appearance. Crassness is taken for pleasure and baseness is used for amusement. Intimates and strangers are seen together, with no sort of avoidance. Tall awnings straddle the streets, and broad tents mount to the clouds. The clothes are gay, the faces painted, the horses and carriages packed tight. Meat and liquor are laid out in profusion, while strings and pipes combine with abandon. Assets are exhausted and goods destroyed, all to compete for this one moment. Whole households and their children do not acknowledge noble and lowly; men and women are chaotically mixed, black and plain cloth (that is, monks and laity) are not distinguished.'

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ blood covenant ♥</b> "The oldest forms of Chinese oath-making appear to have been oaths of allegiance, specifically the blood covenats of ancient times. Such rites [...] could be performed in a number of circumstances, including forming alliances, resolving conflicts, or determining guilt, with the gods serving not only as witnesses to these rituals, but also as potential punitive agents should the participants fail to keep their word (Lewis 1990; see also Liu 1998; ter Haar 1998: 163, 178, 181). [...] The participants in such rites first purified themselves through fasting. After the composition of a written agreement (<i>zaishu</i>), the killing of an animal victim (referred to as <i>shen</i>) took place at an altar, following which its left ear was placed in one vessel and its blood in another. Blood was then sprinkled on the altar as a means of summoning the gods or ancestors, following which the text of the covenant was read. Each of the participants in the covenant then drank some of the victim's blood, or in other cases smeared the blood on his lips (<i>shaxue</i>). One copy of the covenant was buried in a pit (<i>keng</i>) containing the corpse of the animal victim, while the parties to the ritual also ratified their alliance (<i>limeng</i>). Another copy of the covenant was stored in an archive (<i>mengfu</i>) (Dobson 1968: 271-272). Dobson also cites the use of human blood, including in oaths between lovers to take care of illegitimate children (<i>ibid.</i>: 272-273, 278). "Blood covenants invariably included a contingent curse on those who violated their terms in the form of a 'malediction' (<i>zu</i>). [...] One passage in the <i>Zuozhuan</i> describing a covenant rite performed in 562 BCE contains the following malediction: 'If anyone violates these commands, may the guardians of reverence and covenants, the spirits of the great mountains and rivers, the collected heavenly spirits and spirits who receive sacrifice, the former kings and lords, and the ancestors of the seven surnames and twelve states destroy him so that his people desert him, he loses rank and clan, and his state and family are extinguished.' (Lewis 1990: 47-48)" <sup id="cite_ref-435" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-435">[435]</a></sup> "Certain military rituals (<i>junli</i>) also featured the use of blood covenants, including a variety of banner worship rites (usually referred to as <i>jiqi</i>, <i>maya</i>, or <i>jianya</i>) that have been performed by both Han and non-Han peoples since at least the Han dynasty. One of the most detailed accounts of such rites may be found in the <i>Suishu</i>. According to this text, the rites began with a blood covenant, with the blood and hair of the victim (usually an ox) being smeared on the army's drums. In some cases, the victim's ear would be cut off; in others, the participants (including, occasionally, the emperor himself) would daub their lips with its blood (<i>shaxue</i>) (<i>Suishu</i>, 8.159; see also Graff 2000: 99-101).

</p><p><b>Description of the Normative Ideology</b>
</p><p>The Three Teachings (San Jiao)
</p><p>“Although these four traditions can be discussed separately, it is important to bear in mind that were in constant interaction. Taoism, for example, cannot be fully understood outside the context of Buddhism and Confucianism, on the one hand, and the popular tradition, on the other. A good way to conceptualize the situation is the adapt a metaphor introduced by Eric Zurcher, according to which Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism can be pictured as three pyramid-shaped peaks sharing a common mountain base. As the peaks arise out of the same pass of undifferentiated ‘popular’ practice and belief, they begin to take form as discernable traditions. This metaphor should not be construed to mean that the high traditions developed out of popular tradition- the vertical interaction was complex and went both up and down. The higher the peaks rise, the more clearly they are differentiated from the other peaks and as their ranks narrow into a professional literate elite. Conversely, as one descends the peaks, the more they merge into the area of popular religious practice that cannot be clearly labeled as Buddhist, Taoist or Confucian.” <sup id="cite_ref-618" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-618">[618]</a></sup>
</p><p>Daoism only became a unified state imperial religion in the Sui and early Tang. At the end of the period of division (220-589), the state recognized the “Three Teachings”- Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism as equally important. They used the three teachings to form a united front against shamanism. <sup id="cite_ref-619" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-619">[619]</a></sup>
</p><p>"The Sui dynasty (581-618 CE) reunified China for the first time in centuries, and its first emperor and empress were strong supporters of Buddhism. Although short-lived, the Sui laid the foundation for the long period of comparative peace and prosperity under the Tang dynasty. Official patronage of Buddhism reached perhaps its greatest height under Tang Empress Wu Zetian, who invited the Buddhist monk Fazang to the palace to teach her." <sup id="cite_ref-620" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-620">[620]</a></sup>

This term is usually translated as ‘merit’ and refers to certain significant kinds of action that are regarded as auspicious and potent deeds. Essentially, merit is good ‘karma’ ( karman/kamma)&nbsp;: wholesome ( kuśla/kusala ) deeds which plant seeds that bear fortunate and pleasant fruits, whether in this life or lives to come, and thereby create conditions for further meritorious action in the future. These are the kinds of action that conduce to the development of the qualities of the eightfold path. Moreover it is making merit that binds the lay and monastic communities together. The traditional ‘bases of merit’ are generosity (dāna), ethical conduct ( śīla/sīla ), and meditation ( bhāvanā ).

In addition the lay disciple may on special occasions (traditionally the full moon ‘observance’ days) or for longer periods take the eight precepts, replacing the third precept (refraining from sexual misconduct) with complete sexual abstinence and adding (6) refraining from eating after midday, (7) refraining from attending entertainments and using perfumes, etc., and (8) refraining from using luxurious beds.</i><sup id="cite_ref-701" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-701">[701]</a></sup> <i>The nature of bad action is usually illustrated by reference to a list of the ten courses of unwholesome action ( karma/kamma-patha ) which consist of three bodily courses of action (taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct), four vocal courses of action (lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech, frivolous speech), and three mental courses of action (covetousness, ill-will, wrong view). [...] Essentially the psychological states that motivate the ten unwholesome courses of action— strong greed, hatred, and delusion —lead to rebirth in the unhappy destinies or ‘descents’: in a hell realm, as a hungry ghost, an animal, or a jealous god.

[...] Buddhists speak of good karma as ‘merit’ (puñña, Sanskrit: puṇya), and much effort is expended in acquiring it. Some picture it as a kind of spiritual capital—like money in a bank account—whereby credit is built up as the deposit on a heavenly rebirth. One of the best ways for a layman to earn merit is by supporting the order of monks. This can be done by placing food in the bowls of monks as they pass on their daily alms round, by providing robes for the monks, by listening to sermons and attending religious services, and by donating funds for the upkeep of monasteries and temples.</i> <sup id="cite_ref-704" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-704">[704]</a></sup>  <i>The nature of bad action is usually illustrated by reference to a list of the ten courses of unwholesome action ( karma/kamma-patha ) which consist of three bodily courses of action (taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct), four vocal courses of action (lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech, frivolous speech), and three mental courses of action (covetousness, ill-will, wrong view).

In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsāric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f ). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings.

He said that if one is really loyal, really doing one’s duty, ‘how could you not instruct your ruler?’ As we have seen with filial piety above, criticism is permitted, if done reverently, though the results may be hard on the son or government minister. In a later text, the Book of Ritual, it is noted that a filial son may speak up to criticize his parents three times, but, if ignored, he is to follow their wishes. Similarly, it says, a government minister should speak to his ruler and offer advice and criticism. If after three attempts the ruler continues to ignore the min- ister, the minister should resign.

As with so many other moral and religious terms, Confucius and his followers radically reinterpreted it 5 to mean appropriate behaviour visà-vis one’s parents, and not only after their death. Merely providing sustenance was immediately disparaged as grotesquely inadequate: ‘Ziyou [i.e. the disciple Yan Yan, b. 506 bce] asked about filial piety. The Master said: “What is ‘filial’ nowadays refers to the ability to feed [one’s parents]. Even dogs and horses can be fed.

That violence cannot be ended by violence but only by its opposite, non-violence, is moreover a deeply-rooted Buddhist conviction. [...]If a king is threatened by a foreign army he should first try to prevent the conflict with every conceivable non-violent strategy - showing kindness to the enemy, for instance, or even granting certain favours. He might also attempt to deter the enemy with a display of the strength of his own army. Should all peaceful means fail however he is justified in declaring war, but should do so with the sole motive of protecting his own people and should do his utmost to spare the lives of the hostile soldiers (see Zimmermann, 2000). The notion of Buddhism’s ‘state-protecting’ function was carried so far that Buddhists not only supported and encouraged wars of national defence but even became actively involved in them. [...] Although Buddhists have legitimised the conditional use of violence the emphasis has always been on acting as non-violently and peacefully as possible.” <sup id="cite_ref-739" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-739">[739]</a></sup> In Daoism: “From the very beginning of the written tradition of Taoism, there existed a close relation between it and Chinese military and practice. The ‘’Daode jing’’ contains passages that propounded ideas about the nature of warfare (that weapons are inauspicious implements; desolation follows an army) and the proper way for the ruler to engage in combat (conquer strength by manifesting weakness; do not value victory; do not attempt to dominate the world by force of arms) that were immensely influential in later times. [...] Generals were encouraged not to act out of anger; to practice self-cultivation to strengthen their ‘’qi’’ and harmonize it with the cosmos; to unify the army with their own person; to make minute preparations and assessments of their own and the enemy’s strengths and weaknesses before embarking on a campaign; to attack only when victory was certain, for the highest type of victory was to win without ever having to actually engage in combat; to be formless (‘’wuxing’’) while forcing the enemy to show his form (‘’youxing’’); to manipulate emptiness (‘’xu’’) and fullness (‘’shi’’), the regular (‘’zheng’’) and the irregular (‘’qi’’) forces; and to adapt to the ever-changing conditions of the battlefield by seizing the positional advantage (‘’shi’’).” <sup id="cite_ref-740" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-740">[740]</a></sup> Overall, the promotion of bravery was not one of the values promoted by any branch of Chinese ideology, though it’s worth noting that there existed a number of local cults devoted to military figures. <sup id="cite_ref-741" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-741">[741]</a></sup></dd>

Wendi then created his own standard currency, which, lettered with the characters wuzhu on its face, is referred to in history as the Sui wuzhu. This was followed by a series of edicts aimed at phasing out coinages of pre-Sui vintage. By 585, these efforts began to pay off and the monetary system was standardized. As the top Sui leader in the South, Yangdi was ordered by his father to set up five furnaces to manufacture coins in Yangzhou. Aware of the inadequate money supply in the South, he requested that furnaces be set up at copper mines in E Prefecture (with its seat in Wuchang, Hubei). At that time, Yangdi was familiar with the process of coin production, and understood its significance to the economy. But as emperor, he soon lost control of the government’s monopoly on mintage. As private minting became rampant, the weight of the coin deteriorated noticeably. The standard weight of 1,000 cash declined under Yangdi from 4 jin 2 liang (pre-607) or 2,756 grams,3 first to 2 jin (post-607) or 445 grams, then to 1 jin (post-607) or 223 grams—less than one twelfth of the standard. Coins made of sheet iron, leather, and paper were in circulation. The deterioration of numismatic standards in weight and metal content is a telltale sign of a weakened economy and this was clearly the case in Yangdi’s reign. The debasement of coins that started in late-Sui times, compounded by the rise in commodity values, resulted in runaway inflation that continued well into Early Tang times." <sup id="cite_ref-759" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-759">[759]</a></sup></dd>
