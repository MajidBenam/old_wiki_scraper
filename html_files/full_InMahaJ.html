The smallest category of sites was represented by simple ceramic scatters and has been interpreted as agricultural sites, as they had no evidence of craft activities. Craft activities were represented in the next category, sites between 6 and 9.99 hectares, as slag was recovered from a number of those settlements surveyed. Erdosy has termed the next category, between 10 and 49.9 hectares, towns, and the site of Kara has provided evidence of metal, semi-precious stone and shell working and coins."<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Asvamedha ♥</b> The aśvamedha is an elaborate ritual performed by a consecrated king, with the help of hundreds of retainers. Its central act consists of the sacrifice of a horse (there is debate as to whether this sacrifice was literal or symbolic). This horse had been allowed to roam freely, escorted by 300 armed men and 100 horses, in the period preceding the ritual: a year according to most sources, although it is possible that this "year" was actually only one or a few days. The king could claim whichever territory the horse wandered into, whether it belonged to him or not. As for the sacrifice itself, it was preceded by the sacrifice of a dog (or a different animal, or several animals), and followed by mock-copulation between the queen and the dead horse, as well as by the recitation, on the part of the king, of obscene phrases. This ritual was performed rarely, and only by particularly powerful kings. It had many aims. According to Doniger <sup id="cite_ref-118" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-118">[118]</a></sup>, its main aim was to purify the king from the bloodshed that his position as ruler of an empire made inevitable, and to provide him with the pretext of conquering new territories. According to Zaroff <sup id="cite_ref-119" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-119">[119]</a></sup>, it was meant "to strengthen social bonds, assure military victory and [the] well being of the community". According to Kak <sup id="cite_ref-120" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-120">[120]</a></sup>, it was meant to "regenerates the powers and the fame of the king".</dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ agnistoma ♥</b> There exists a class of Vedic rituals which involve the use of a drug-like beverage deriving from a plant known in ancient times as soma. This class of rituals includes the rajasuya, the consecration of the king, but the most basic "soma-sacrifice" ritual is the agnistoma <sup id="cite_ref-205" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-205">[205]</a></sup>. Detailed descriptions of this ritual are difficult to find, and the best ones may be in German sources. Most notably, it is never entirely clear whether the soma actually affected those who consumed it. The earliest descriptions of the substance's effects suggest that it inspired poets, prevented sleep, and may even have been used in anticipation of sexual intercourse <sup id="cite_ref-206" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-206">[206]</a></sup>, suggesting it resulted in states of heightened awareness and increased energy. However, the soma beverage was often mixed with a number of other substances, such as honey, which may well have lessened the drug's effects. And, most importantly, it is hard to tell whether participants in the ritual partook of the soma, or whether they merely offered it to the gods. Perhaps soma was used as a drug outside of ritual, not as part of it. In any case, the basic agnistoma ritual would have been performed three times in a day--in the morning, at midday, and in the late afternoon--and it involved the consecration of the worshippers, and the pressing and offering of the soma <sup id="cite_ref-207" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-207">[207]</a></sup>. In the rajasuya, the soma sacrifice is simply a slightly more elaborate version of an agnistoma, with a more prolonged period of consecration (or purification) of the worshipper, in this case, the king <sup id="cite_ref-208" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-208">[208]</a></sup>. It is perhaps best to leave this ritual uncoded for now, pending the retrieval of new information on soma use in Vedic ritual.</dd>

IMPORTANT NOTE
Note from Phase I sheets ‘As with the Early Vedic period, most of the information about the Later Vedic period comes from the Vedic texts, many of which were composed at this time (but written down after this period). The Late Vedic texts include: Books 1, 8, 9 and 10 of the Rig Veda Samhita, the Samhitas of the Sama, Yajur, and Atharva Vedas, and the Brahmanas, Aranyakas, and Upanishads attached to all four Vedas.<sup id="cite_ref-209" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-209">[209]</a></sup> The same caveats apply to these texts as to the Early Vedic texts, summarised by Singh (2008): firstly, the texts are primarily hymns used by elite members of society (a section of the Brahmanas) and are therefore not representative of the daily life of the majority of people at the time. Secondly, the date of the composition of the Vedic texts is uncertain, and so cannot be tied to a certain period. Thirdly, the earliest surviving manuscripts date to the 11th century CE, hundreds (or even thousands) of years after the texts were supposedly composed, leaving much room for alterations and the culmination of mistakes from the original compositions. There is also a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the translation of the texts which have survived, not least because the original core of the texts are not available and because of difficulties in interpreting words and phrases, whose meanings vary with the context in which they were written.<sup id="cite_ref-210" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-210">[210]</a></sup> Nonetheless, the texts do contain a lot of information about Later Vedic society. There are references that suggest the presence of a king (raja) ruling over the clans. Later texts refer to the king as a “leader in battle” and a “protector of settlement and of people”.<sup id="cite_ref-211" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-211">[211]</a></sup>

He received voluntary gifts and prestations in kind, for which the term bali came to be used - an extension of its meaning as an offering to the gods. There was no regular tax that he could claim, nor had he any rights over the land. He was entitled to a portion of the booty from successful cattle-raids after the bhaga, shares, had been sorted out, and he would obviously claim a larger one. Mention is also made of shulka, literally the value or worth of an item.

The roots of these developments lie in the period c. 1000-600BCE. While some communities retained their tribal character, others were making the transition towards statehood. Larger political units were formed through the coalescing of tribes. The Purus and Bharatas came together to from the mighty Kurus, the Turvashas and Krivis formed the Panchalas, and the Kurus and Panchalas seem to have been allies or confederates. Later Vedic texts reflect a transition from a tribal polity based on lineage to a territorial state. Some historians argue that this transition was not yet complete. On the other hand, since the end of the period of composition of later Vedic texts falls within the 6th century BCE, when territorial states did evidently exist according to the testimony of other sources, it makes little sense to insist that the state emerged in the post-Vedic and not in the later part of the Vedic age.

<p><b>♠ Proportion of population enslaved ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> ‘The authors of the Vedic Index say that slaves were certainly included in the term sudra. But the number of slaves seems to have been very small. We lean of ten thousands of women slaves, captured from various countries and and given away by Anga to his brahmana priest Atreya. The number is obviously exaggerated and conventional. Aruni, the father of Svetaketu, boasts that he possesses gold, cattle, horses, maid-servents (dasis), retinue and dress, but does not speak of men slaves. Tradition has it that the brahmanas received women slaves at the time of the great coronation sacrifice of Yudhisthira, which may be ascribed to the later Vedic period. Clearly, then, during this period women slaves were owned on a considerable scale by the ruling chiefs and priests, but the same cannot be said of men slaves... perhaps the number of male sudras being employed as slaves was so negligible as to not attract any notice. This would naturally rule out the possibility of male sudras being employed as slaves on any considerable scale. Therefore Keith’s statement, that in the period of the Brahmanas the peasant working in his own fields was being substituted for the landowner cultivating his estate by means of slave labour, may not represent the true state of affairs. Slaves working on land are first heard of in the Srautasutras, which were composed towards the end of the Vedic Period and later. one of them informs us that two slaves are to be given away along with grain, plough and cattle, suggesting thereby that slaves were employed in ploughing and could be freely disposed of by their masters. But in several passages the practice of making gifts of land and of the people working on it is looked upon with disfavour. Thus it is stated that at the asvamedha sacrifice the sacrificial fee could not include land and men working on it (bhumipurusavarjam). Again, in connection with the gifts in the one-day (ekaha) sacrifice, it is laid down that land and sudras could not be given away (bhumisudravarjam). There is, however, the alternative that sometimes the sudras could be also given away, but the commentary adds that this can be done only in the case of those who are born slaves... These references indicate a new social development possibly after the close of the Vedic period. Sudras were employed as slaves working on lands owned by individuals (mostly ruling chiefs), and they could be given away as gifts along with the land itself, although this did not   prevail even towards ’ <sup id="cite_ref-294" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-294">[294]</a></sup>

The term serf denotes one who is attached to the soil of his master... but such a system did not prevail even towards the end of the Vedic period, and hence the interpretation of the Vedic period, and hence the interpretation of the word sudra as serf does not quite suit the relevant references. First, individual ownership of land in the Vedic period was of a very limited nature. Ownership implies free disposal of property, but there are no examples of land grants in the Samhitas. There is one such example, however, in the Chandogya Upanishad, in which a whole village is granted by the kind Janasruti to Raikva. Another instance is to be found in two later Brahmanas. They inform us that land could be given away only with the consent of the clan, and even there the earth refused to be transferred. In the earlier period there is no example of sudras being given away with the land. The development is to be found in some of the Srautasutras, but according to a commentary such sudras appear to be born slaves (garbhadasa) and not serfs attached to the soil. This seems to be confirmed by the fact that in post-Vedic times the sudras do not appear as peasants paying taxes. ’ <sup id="cite_ref-301" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-301">[301]</a></sup> ‘It is difficult to define the position of the sudras in the Vedic period in terms of slavery or serfdom.

<p>We are interested here in any systems of thought and behavior that can influence people's actions, which we term a <i>Normative Ideology</i>.  Normative ideologies are thought-systems concerned with the correct behavior of people, governments/leaders, and other groups (and particularly the relationships between these groups).
</p><p>Mainly, this will be a religious or ritual system. As usual, when we mention Religious or Ritual System our focus  is on the 'official cult', defined the same way as in the Rituals section:
</p>
<dl><dd>With the official cult we refer to the set of collective religious practices that are most closely associated with legitimation of the power structure (including elites, if any).</dd></dl>
<p>However, Normative Ideologies are not restricted to religious/ritual systems. They include other thought systems, such as philosophy or anything that prescribes a particular pattern of behaviour. An example is  classical Greek philosophy, such as the works of Plato and Aristotle, who were concerned with correct or moral behaviour and whose thoughts influenced the actual practice of several societies (the empire of Alexander the Great, notably).

While generosity is not exclusively expected of a vira, munificence is one of the two dominant ways in which this role is defined.95 And if Indra’s example is his model, a brave man should fully embody his manly disposition by accumulating wealth in various forms from martial excursions.

<p><b>Human sacrifice</b> (HS) is defined as deliberate and ritualized killing of an individual to please or placate supernatural beings. Common examples of supernatural beings are gods and ancestors, including a recently deceased one. In other words, sacrificing humans to follow a high-status individual in the afterlife is a legitimate example of HS. HS is distinct from capital punishment, however, even for offenses against religion (e.g., burning of heretics, punishment of vestals for transgressions). Such practices should be coded as <b>Capital Punishment for Religious Offenses</b>. Execution of 'witches' even if regularly occurring at funerals of a high-status individual is not HS. We can reflect such practices under <b>Capital Punishment for Witchcraft</b>. See Law, Robin. 1985. Human Sacrifice in Pre-Colonial West Africa. African Affairs 84 (334):53-87 for further discussion.
</p><p>There are several distinct categories of HS listed below. First code any special kinds of HS that are present in the (quasi)polity. Then code the general code (<b>♠ Human sacrifice ♥</b>) based on the codes for special kinds of HS. Note that HS is also coded under Rituals; here, however, we address general features of HS not tied to any particular ritual.

Rgvedic poets promote various ways in which men can prove their masculinity, but the principal role is that of man as warrior. Like nRmṇa and paumsya, the terms vira and virya are deployed by poets to construct a dominant masculine ideology, which they encode primarily in Indra for symbolic, economic, and political ends. As we will see, ritual practitioners expect that men defined by the terms vira and virya will acquire wealth from violent excursions and distribute the spoils among clansmen during ritual performances.

<p>‘Scholars who have studied the antecedents of Ayurvedic medicine tell us that among the “respectable people” in the period 800 to 600 BCE, two books fo knowledge (veda) were called into being. Both dealt in one way or another with the causes of disease and possible cures. These were the Rgveda c. 800 BCE and the Atharvaveda c. 600 BCE. In them, diseases that affected a person’s inner working were generally seen as being caused by one or another category of demons. In those cases, proto-medical professionals attempted to effect cures by ritually casting out the demons, not en masse, but one at a time, each demon being held responsible for each particular symptom.’ <sup id="cite_ref-341" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-341">[341]</a></sup>
