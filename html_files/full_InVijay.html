</p><p>As a result of repeated invasions from Muslim states to the North and civil wars within, Vijayanagara authority was fragmented in the seventeenth century<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>, leading to an imperial collapse<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>. In 1646, the Vijaynagar empire is finally conquered by the sultanates of Bijapur and Golconda. Many of the empire's largest vassal states immediately declare independence, so the territorial gains made by the sultanates are limited. Those vassals, Mysore, Keladi Nayaka, and the Nayaks and Nayakas of Chitradurga, Gingee, Madurai, and Tanjore, all become powerful states in southern India <sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>.
</p><p><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ loose; confederated state; nominal ♥ </b> loose: 1336-1509; confederated state: 1509-1565; nominal: 1565-1646
While there is some debate over whether to define the relations between local lordships and the Vijayanagara kings as feudal or other, but there is no doubt that the degree of centralization differed during various periods of the kingdom.
</p><p>The early Vijayanagara kingdom was more a group of semi-autonomous states rather than a unified kingdom. Centralized authority was enhanced by the occasional appointment of non-kinsmen, including Brahmans, to important military commands, and even to governorships of one of the five core provinces in the center of the kingdom. But this was not the usual policy; most often sons of the king ruled for him<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>.
</p><p>Through most of the first dynasty, Vijayanagara kings were content to be conquerors whose conquests left the ancient Cholas and Panyas in their sovereign places, except that they were reduced by their homage to Vijayanagara. Until the early sixteenth century, the latter were ritual sovereigns everywhere outside their Deccan heartland; apart from occasional plundering forays, they were content with the homage of distant lords<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>. Krishnadevaraya (reigned 1509-29<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup>) changed much of this. He replaced earlier royal predecessors by his own Brahmans and military commanders and charged his agents to extract money tribute from subordinate lords who had previously been required to pay nothing to Vijayanagara, merely to acknowledge the latter's hegemony in a number of symbolic ways<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>.
</p><p>Krishnadevaraya cast aside the ancient the ancient Chola and Pandya kings in the South and installed military commanders who not long after established centers of sovereignty opposed to its successors<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>.
</p><p>After the catastrophic sack of the capital of Vijayanagara in 1565, the kingdom saw a big decline in power, and a series of civil wars<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>. It was also during this time that the 'Nayaka kingdoms', which had emerged at the very zenith of the Vijayanagara monarchy (during the early 16th century; e.g. Mysore and Ikkeri), became increasingly independent and sought to avert the re-emergence of a strong Vijayanagara king capable of reducing their authority and territorial ambitions<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>. Thus, the level of the centralization of the kingdom post-1565 should be defined as 'nominal'.

1513 CE. Under the advice of his minister and general Saluva Timma, Krishnadeva Raya turned against Gajapati Prataparuda of Orissa in 1513, with a view of recovering the territories that his predecessors had captured from Vijayanagar during the reigns of the last rulers of the first dynasty. Over the next two years, he captured the fortress of Udayagiri, the fortress of Konavidu and others of lesser importance in the area, as well as Kondapalli.

"Dasara (<i>dasara</i> in Kannada) is a festival celebrated on the first ten lunar days of the bright fortnight of the lunar month of <i>ashvajuya</i> (the seventh month of the lunar calendar which corresponds to the period from September to October in the solar calendar). [...] In southern India, the tradition of the Dasara or Mahanavami festival as a public ritual of kinsghip can be traced back to the time of the Vijayanagara kingdom in the fifteenth century. [...] The earliest account of the Mahanavami festival is that of an Italian traveller, Nicolo Conti, who visited Vijayanagara (present-day Hampi) in 1420 AD. A Persian ambassador, Abdur Razzak, also left an account of the festival in 1442. The most detailed description was given by two Portuguese travellers, Domingos Paes and Fernao Nuniz, in the sixteenth century. [...] According to the description by Domingos Paes and Fernao Nuniz, the nine day ritual was performed on several huge platform-like constructions inside the palace compund at the capital city of Vijayanagara. Some of them functioned as galleries for the audience from which they enjoyed watching dancing-women, the bloody fight of royal wrestlers, and, most of all, a large-scale animal sacrifice. The king himself offered a prayer to the ideol on one of the edifices, called the 'House of Victory' or 'Throne Platform' by foreign travellers and archaeologists, or 'the Mahanavami Dibba' by the residents of Hampi, the present-day name of the former capital, Vijayanagara. Neither Paes nor Nuniz clearly gave the name or nature of this idol, but it is believed that it was of Pampa, the tutelary goddess of the capital city, and consort of Siva (Stein 1989: 38). According to Paes' description, they built a shrine of the idol (or goddess) covered with a cloth on top of the edifice. The king went inside the shrine and performed a ritual for the goddess, and occasionally the cloth was taken away in order that the audience could see the ritual being performed by the king. "Another important aspect of the Naravatri festival in Vijayanagara was the royal assemblage, durbar, which subordinate chiefs had to attend and where they had to exchange homage and gifts with the king of Vijayanagara. They entered the palace one after another according to their status and rank, and gave <i>salam</i> (greetings) to the king. The description by Paes and Nuniz clearly shows that the durbar was a powerful tool of control in the Vijayanagara kingdom. Subordinate chiefs had to visit the capital with their soldiers, horses, and elephants, and attend the durbar in the court during this festival. They were obliged to maintain a certain number of soldiers according to their obligation towards the king. The Mahanavami festival was the occasion where these subordinate chiefs had to show that they were carrying out their duties in front of the king." <sup id="cite_ref-175" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-175">[175]</a></sup> "Celebrated in this rite were the victories, powers, and protection of the tutelary goddess of the kings, the apotheosis of perfect kingship as symbolised by the god Rama, and the puissance and protection of all of the gods and people 'of the world' by the Vijayanagara kings who were the focus of the festival. This annual, royal rite was probably the most important ceremony that occurred in the city during its two centuries as a great capital" <sup id="cite_ref-176" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-176">[176]</a></sup>.</dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ puja ♥</b> "Both the Saiva and Vaishnava medieval temple liturgies evolved out of the Agama traditions of Puja. While objects were offered into the fire in the Vedic rites, objects were offered to deities on altars in temple Puja. In the Puja system the items were meant for the enjoyment of the deity rather than as offerings tendered for a tangible (or intangible) benefit of the patron or community. As Davis recounts, 'in Puja, a worshipper invokes or invites the deity into some material form, most often an image or icon visually and symbolically representing the deity, and presents to him both material offerings such as food and clothing and devoted services such as the recitation of his praises, music, dance, and songs. Agama texts classify all these material and performatory presentations to the deity as "services" (Upacara). Vishnu and Siva, as gods simultaneously transcendent and immanent, enter into a variety of both anthropomorphic and aniconic objects so that their devotees may see them and make their offerings of homage.' "In Puja the divine service always takes place in reference to an altar upon which are placed statues or images (Murti) requiring regular worship. Puja in temples and shrines gradually developed into a complicated daily service that was enhanced during special monthly and seasonal observances. Puja is generally centered on pleasing the Lord in the temple with offerings of food, water, incense, flowers, fan, sweets, camphor, lamp wick, unguents, and conch. Music and devotional songs were key items in this arsenal of offerings. While many Pujas continued to include unaccompanied Stuti or Stotra (hymns of praise) to the deities in Sanskrit, they also contained more and more vernacular hymns and songs accompanied by musical instruments."<sup id="cite_ref-215" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-215">[215]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Spring Festival ♥</b> The Spring Festival appears to be one of the oldest Hindu celebrations.<sup id="cite_ref-297" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-297">[297]</a></sup> Because it has changed through time and is performed somewhat differently in different regions, but no accounts appear to exist of how it was performed in this polity specifically, the ritual coded here is a generic, "essential" version. "With respect to the fundamental characteristics of the Vasantotsava as found in the above Sanskrit texts, we can fruitfully focus our attention in four general directions. Firstly, the Spring Festival crosses sectarian boundaries. It is a popular festival celebrated by several sects as well as outside any readily identifiable sectarian context. No main deity or group of deities is here the consistent object of devotion; the Vasantotsava may be celebrated by all, regardless of private or public devotional affiliations. Second, the element of fire appears in some context in almost all descriptions of this festival: it is a symbol of death, renewal, transformation and purification. Third, the significance of the marriage motif with respect to the Vasantotsava is indicated by a number of texts including the Bhavisya Purana (as previously noted). [...] Fourth and finally the rituals of the Vasantotsava revolve, to a greater or lesser extent, around sensuality. The festival is a fertility festival and erotic motifs from both the mortal and the immortal realms are freely combined with fertility motifs. These four components of the Spring Festival will be treated in turn in the sections that follow. "[...] "The eroticism of the spring celebrations as found in the Ratnavali is characterized by a certain amount of social freedom and licentiousness. Thus the Spring Festival is a peculiar mix of control and freedom: the festival occurs within the city under the auspices of kings and Brahmins and at the same time social barriers are purposefully broken down and the erotic permeates the ritual. The breakdown of social relationships is indicated by rituals such as playing 'Holi' (throwing colored powder), mixing of castes and men and women in the streets, sex, licence, and powder. Eroticism and sexual licence as brought out in the throwing of powder and dancing which comprise this festival reflect the sexual potency of the season." <sup id="cite_ref-298" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-298">[298]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣  ♥</b> Dysphoria is not alien to Indian ritual systems. However, the vast majority of the scholarly literature, at least in English, focuses uniquely on dysphoric rituals that are performed by individuals, often in isolation--e.g. particularly extreme forms of Jain fasting rituals, or Aghori corpse meditation. Collective dysphoric rituals exist in contemporary South India, and some of them appear to have particularly ancient origins. Of course, it is problematic to assume that contemporary South Indian rituals have been the same for hundreds, or even thousands, of years. However, at this early stage of the Seshat enterprise, it is acceptable to use "low-hanging fruit", as we wait for experts to look through the data and confirm or deny the validity of our choices. Moreover, this is what anthropologist Paul Younger <sup id="cite_ref-338" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-338">[338]</a></sup> writes on the subject of the antiquity of certain rituals: "in some festivals participants insisted that the festival had been celebrated in exactly the same way since preagricultural times and that the hunting symbols providing the basic structure of the celebration were taken from the everyday occupation of the early celebrants. While I was sceptical at first, and made determined efforts to find external evidence to date the celebrations, in the end I found the internal evidence convincing, and suspect that the festivals structured around preagricultural ritual symbols might well be quite old."</dd>
<dd>The ritual coded here is loosely based on a contemporary festival celebrating the Goddess Mariyamman, in Tamilnadu (though similar festivals are widespread in South India <sup id="cite_ref-339" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-339">[339]</a></sup>). This ritual appears to have medieval origins <sup id="cite_ref-340" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-340">[340]</a></sup>. Though it is unlikely that this ritual was performed exactly the same way in medieval India, it seems reasonable to infer that similar rituals were performed, involving an initial stage in which participants kept difficult vows in the hope that a deity would grant them, their family or their community respite from a period of hardship, and a second stage when those who have successfully kept their vows form a public procession to the deity's temple, bringing their dysphoria to a climax with "strenuous forms of worship and ecstacy" <sup id="cite_ref-341" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-341">[341]</a></sup>. "The basic pattern of worship is that a worshiper will take a vow (viratam, Sanskrit: vrata) some months before the festival to worship in a particular way at festival time. Worshipers make these vows in the face of a crisis in their personal lives. Often the crisis involves the health of children or the longing for children, but sometimes it involves other problems with disease, the loss of income, fear of sorcery, and a more general anxiety about 'enemies' in the extended family, in the neighbourhood, or in the workplace. Once the vow has been made, it is thought to take on a power of its own, and nonfulfillment would involve severe penalty. Most vows involve months of fasting and sexual abstinence, shaving the head and putting on bright yellow clothes, taking an exhausting walk from home to the temple area, and finally dramatically 'dancing' along the crowded roadway to the temple. The dance takes many forms. Couples carry newborn babes in a yellow cloth hammock suspended on sugar cane stalks. Some women, elderly people, and small children carry only a small pot on their heads filled with the deity's favourite margosa leaves. Many carry a cock for offering. Middle‐aged women carry large pots of burning charcoal, usually dancing wildly and careening in and out of the crowd at the side of the road. A few vow‐keepers have undergone a special ordeal and have a weapon penetrating their tongue or their cheeks. Young men often have a shrine‐like structure or kavati built around them and anchored to their skin by 30 or 40 wires. Skilfully dancing along through the crowd with feathers, flowers, and weapons all flying about, these shrine‐carriers stir the crowd into 'oos' and 'ahs' of reverence. Finally, the heroic champions of the worship are the 'hook swingers,' who come along the road suspended from a long boom and held by a hook through a muscle in the back. Holding a child up to be blessed by one of these heroes, as they are swung about above the crowd, provides the richest benefit of all.</dd>
<dd>"As the more heroic of these vow‐keepers make their way along the crowded roadway, they have a whole group of people assisting them, much as handlers assist a prizefighter. Usually one person dances gently ahead, leading the party through the crowd. Then come the drummers, who set a beat consistent with the spirit of the vow‐keeper. Then come one or two other people holding up the vow‐keeper, who is often in a semiconscious swoon. Others follow, carrying the water constantly thrown over the vow‐keeper and the fuel for the firepots, and so on. The movement of the worshiper is usually sporadic. Standing in the midst of the crowd in the blazing summer sun, eyes glazing over, he or she seems for a time to collapse into the arms of the handlers, until, suddenly, the body stiffens and the worshiper, as if possessed, points ahead, and the party goes off at a run. Where the dancing is vigorous, there is a less evident sense of dependence on the handlers, but in this case the supernatural state of mind is equally evident in the wild directions the dance takes. As the dancers enter the presence of the deity, they stuff small metallic 'eyes,' 'arms,' 'legs,' clay 'babies,' cocks, money, jewellery, and 'letters' in the direction of the offering box and then go into a final burst of dance, which often ends in a total swoon. [...] "In the inner sanctum of the Tēvi or Ammaṉ, the atmosphere is actually surprisingly quiet. The drummers, the handlers, and sometimes even the dancers have been stopped some distance back, and only the moans of those recovering from their swoons are sometimes heard. A few worshipers go up as close as they can, and a few others have kept aside offerings of food or of flowers (more appropriate for a Brâhmanical temple), which they hand over to the priests. "Before long the worshipers go out one of the back doors into a whole new phase of the worship, the identification of the 'power' that the Tēvi has given them. The central feature of this phase, in contrast to the energetic 'dance' of the first phase, is the 'trance' of possession, which allows some of the worshipers to become mediums for the others. For many of the worshipers, the possession is a brief moment directly following the swoon in which they feel that they have the answer to their own immediate 'problem' and claim to be 'healed,' to be 'free' of an offending evil spirit, to know the course of action they are to follow, or whatever. When the voice in the possessed person continues to speak in an unearthly hoarseness, however, a crowd quickly gathers around, and individuals begin inquiring of the spirit about their own problems." <sup id="cite_ref-342" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-342">[342]</a></sup></dd>

<p><b>♠ social mobility ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Social life was dominated by hereditary guilds and caste organizations. Decisions in villages were made by the mahajanas (presumably Brahaman caste landowners). Lower caste villages could simply be moved to make-way for a settlement (agrahara) for temple-workers and priests. Improved economic standing of artisans and merchants in this period enabled them to donate to temples and play a role in ceremony of those sects more accessible to non-Brahmans. <sup id="cite_ref-401" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-401">[401]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-402" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-402">[402]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-403" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-403">[403]</a></sup> Caste system. "There have been a number of attempts to underplay, to question, and to lampoon the hierarchical inequality and even the existence of the caste system. As we will also see it differs, in some degree, from region to region. However, the concepts of varna and, more importantly, jati lie at the heart of the caste system and they form an ideal core around which the complexity of detail and difference can then be erected. [...] Thus the four varnas are the Brahmins who represent priesthood and learning, the Kshatriyas who represent the warriors and kings, who protect the people, the Vaishyas who represent the people who engage in agriculture, farming and trade, and the Shudras who represent the servants who look after and serve the others. The Brahmins fulfil the function of the mouth, the Kshatriyas fulfil the function of the arms, the Vaishyas fulfil the function of the thighs, and the Shudras fulfil the function of the feet. The model is clearly a hierarchy but it is a complementary hierarchy and unity, wherein the different elements sustain one another. [...] In practice the key to the caste system are the sub-castes, or jatis. There are a great number of these in each varna, and in practice there is a hierarchy within each set so that only certain jatis can marry and eat with each other. Not all Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas or Shudras can marry or eat together. Those privileges are confined to a limited number of jatis within each varna. [...] Clearly there have been changes in the system over long centuries. Particular jatis have elevated themselves through economic means, through disputing status, through propaganda, through moving, through changing religion, and so on. But on the whole, over such a long period of time, the system has remained strong, especially in the villages. [...] The strength of the caste system has been enhanced by another principle emphasised by Dumont (1980) in his classical work entitled ‘’Homo Hierarchicus: The Caste System and its Implications’’. According to Dumont, in addition to the distinctions already outlined that fit varnas and jatis into hierarchies, another must be added. This distinction takes caste hierarchical divides beyond the kind of class distinctions found in eighteenth-century Britain or in the Ancien Regime in Europe, by stressing the opposition between purity and pollution. Caste difference, according to this classification, goes beyond class differences into this other realm of ritual purity and pollution. The Brahmins are the highest and purest varna, and the Dalits are the lowest, in that they are outside varna and are impure altogether. The other varnas rank in between. Pollution occurs in different ways. It occurs through bodily contact of one sort or another, with menstrual cycles, through birth and death, through emissions such as faeces, urine and saliva, and through contact with night-soil, dirty clothes, unswept rooms and so on. Thus marriage and sex have to function within the correct set of jatis in the correct varna. Polluting jobs such as laundering and sweeping are done by people of lower castes so that the blood of people of higher castes can remain ‘pure’. Equally menstrual activity among older women makes them more ‘impure’ than men or pre-menstrual virgins, and therefore women are more polluting than men. They will thus often live semi-separately while menstruating, during which time they will also avoid going to the temple and therefore ‘polluting’ the gods. Furthermore, untouchable Dalits were prohibited from entering many temples before the post-Independence freedom-of-temple-entry legislation and even now they are kept out of some temples in many villages. [...] It is also true to say that Dumont’s thesis suffers from exaggeration and other matters are important in discussing caste. Nevertheless, there is at least an element of truth in the notion that purity and pollution has relevance in any discussion of caste.” <sup id="cite_ref-404" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-404">[404]</a></sup>

Samayas, at the behest of the treasury, bound peasants to land as cultivators who could be taxed.  Peasants owned the land and passed this right on to their sons but were not free to move. <sup id="cite_ref-405" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-405">[405]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-406" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-406">[406]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-407" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-407">[407]</a></sup>

Meyer (1952: 108) wrote that (p.378) polygamy in India is ‘as old as the hills and does not form the slightest offence in the Brahmanic system’, although since Vedic times monogamy is seen as the ideal. This is confirmed by Mitra (1965: 49) with quotes from earlier sources, to the effect that ‘the fundamental conception of marriage was monogamous and not polygamous’. M. Basu (2001: 28)summarizes the traditional position: ‘Vedic literature generally endorsed monogamy and [it] was considered the best practice of the highest virtue. However, polygamy was also in practice, especially among the nobles.

Elsewhere Manu (VI:91- 2) asserts that avoiding backbiting, hypocrisy, greed, infatuation, anger and discontent is approved dharma for all the stages of life. The problem is that there are different views as to what the actuality of universal dharma is. Radhakrishnan, for example, argues for a sanatana dharma, based upon Advaita Vedanta thought, that is said to be present in all religious traditions. It is a kind of perennial philosophy that is at the heart of every religious tradition not just at the heart of the Hindu tradition.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Number of officially sanctioned supernatural beings ♣ polytheistic ♥</b> "According to one popular formula, there are 330 million gods in Hinduism. Nevertheless, most Hindus have believed that there is ultimately one deity, and that the diversity of other gods are his or her emanations or manifestations, representing his or her agency in particular contexts. [...] The three gods most commonly worshipped as the ultimate in Hindu traditions are Visnu, Siva, and the Goddess, variously called Devī, "Goddess," and Sakti, "Power." This triad of deities must be distinguished from an overlapping group of three deities who are conceived in the Puranas and other authoritative traditions to perform particular cosmic functions - Brahma, who creates the universe anew in each vast cosmic cycle, and also, in some accounts, bestows the Veda upon humanity; Visnu, who preserves the universe by intervening to rectify problems through his avataras, "descents" or "incarnations"; and Siva, who destroys the universe at the end of each cosmic cycle. [...] [W]hichever deity is conceived as the ultimate is understood to be the source who emanates the others, both the triad who perform the aforementioned cosmic functions and lower supernatural beings, and thus to be the ultimate agent in their actions. [...] There are numerous other important deities besides those frequently conceived as a monotheistic ultimate. One of the most important of these is Ganesa, a son of Siva with the head of an elephant, believed to be a protective figure that removes obstacles. Another is Hanuman, the monkey-god who helped Rama in his battle against Ravana, idealized for his devotion to Rama and Sīta. Other deities important in particular regions include the South Indian Ayappa, regarded as the son of Siva and a female avatara of Visnu; and smallpox goddesses such as the North Indian Sitala." <sup id="cite_ref-463" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-463">[463]</a></sup></dd>

He sees the entire universe, the sun, stars, and planets, and all the people gathered on the battlefield within the body of Krishna.

By the law of karma, every thought, word, and deed carries with it a like reaction. Beings are born, live, die, and are reborn based on their actions. Every good deed brings a reward, and every bad deed a punishment. The terms ‘reward’ and ‘punishment’ are deceptive, however; for karma is not seen as a set of rewards and punishments doled out by a just God, but in impersonal terms, as the working of natural law. Karma attracts reactions to moral agents like an ethical law of gravity. Benevolent actions produce good results for the person who engages in them. Similarly, actions intended to cause suffering will lead to suffering for those who commit them." <sup id="cite_ref-466" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-466">[466]</a></sup></dd></dl>

The complexity of the caste system, regional and linguistic differences and historical change have all militated against this rigidity. [...]Brahmins have traditionally been seen as ritually more pure than Kshatriyas and more versed in religious knowledge. They are, in theory if not always in fact, the key scholars in the Hindu tradition. The Kshatriyas have traditionally been seen, again in theory if not always in practice, as the rulers who maintain society, uphold dharma and protect the householder system. They built and sponsored temples, protected their subjects and their deities and, to that extent, the Brahmins recognised a ruler’s overlordship. However, the kingly role in ruling and guardianship duties involved more ‘polluting tendencies’ than were usual in a Brahmin’s life. The Brahmins have had a dual role in society. Those who are active priests in temples have engaged in functions that involve being given gifts by worshippers and such temple priests are more involved with lower castes. Paradoxically Brahmins who are versed in promoting scholarship and in advancing religious learning but who do not act as serving priests are, in general, more widely admired because they have less contact with the public. Thus Brahmins who are not priests can be more akin to those renouncers engaged in lifelong learning and spirituality, rather than in the hurly-burly of householder life.

According to Dumont, in addition to the distinctions already outlined that fit varnas and jatis into hierarchies, another must be added. This distinction takes caste hierarchical divides beyond the kind of class distinctions found in eighteenth-century Britain or in the Ancien Regime in Europe, by stressing the opposition between purity and pollution. Caste difference, according to this classification, goes beyond class differences into this other realm of ritual purity and pollution. The Brahmins are the highest and purest varna, and the Dalits are the lowest, in that they are outside varna and are impure altogether. The other varnas rank in between. Pollution occurs in different ways. It occurs through bodily contact of one sort or another, with menstrual cycles, through birth and death, through emissions such as faeces, urine and saliva, and through contact with night-soil, dirty clothes, unswept rooms and so on. Thus marriage and sex have to function within the correct set of jatis in the correct varna. Polluting jobs such as laundering and sweeping are done by people of lower castes so that the blood of people of higher castes can remain ‘pure’. Equally menstrual activity among older women makes them more ‘impure’ than men or pre-menstrual virgins, and therefore women are more polluting than men. They will thus often live semi-separately while menstruating, during which time they will also avoid going to the temple and therefore ‘polluting’ the gods. Furthermore, untouchable Dalits were prohibited from entering many temples before the post-Independence freedom-of-temple-entry legislation and even now they are kept out of some temples in many villages. [...] It is also true to say that Dumont’s thesis suffers from exaggeration and other matters are important in discussing caste. Nevertheless, there is at least an element of truth in the notion that purity and pollution has relevance in any discussion of caste." <sup id="cite_ref-480" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-480">[480]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ care/harm ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> The following quote shows that caring for others is an important value in Hinduism: "According to Hindu Dharmashastras, of the four stages of life, the person who is at the householder stage is the anchor of society. The householder’s business is the maintenance and support of those in the other three stages of life: the students who have not yet entered into the world of work, the retirees who have seen the birth of grandchildren and spotted their first gray hairs, and the renunciants, those who have left behind not only the world of work and material possession but who have also left behind family and self-interest for a life focused on spiritual freedom. Householders are the ones with material wealth, and their responsibility, their dharma, is to share it with others. [...] The link between the world of the householder and the world of the renunciant is gift giving - dana. The classic image is of the renouncer with the begging bowl, making the rounds for alms.

<dd><b>♠ fairness/cheating ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> According to Hindu Law: "Misconduct by doctors, judges and examiners of coins has been transferred from steya to sahasa by Mādhava who has prescribed the highest punishment for a quack, a judge who punishes an innocent person and lets the guilty go scot free, and for an examiner of coins who lies about the genuineness of coins. These rules from Narada are available in all the texts under review, but Varadaraja and Devana have placed them under steya.
