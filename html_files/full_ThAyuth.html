<dl><dd>The city of Ayutthaya was founded in 1351 CE in the Chao Phraya Basin, in modern-day Thailand, and soon emerged as a dominant force in the region, turning neighbouring <i>mueang</i>, or city-states, into its tributaries.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> This was largely thanks to its advantageous geographical position, which allowed it to become an <i>entrepôt</i> where goods could be exchanged between China to the east, India and Arabia to the west, and the Malay archipelago to the south.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> In 1569, Ayutthaya fell to the Burmese army.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> Here, we only consider the second phase of the polity's history, starting in 1593, when Ayutthaya regained its independence after defeating Burma at the Battle of Nong Sarai.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> The kingdom flourished throughout the 17th century, regaining its status as the dominant political and economic power of mainland Southeast Asia and ruling over Khmer, Lao, Lanna, and Shan.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> The polity may have reached its peak under King Borommakot (reigned 1733‒1758): during this time, Ayutthaya faced no serious external threats (indeed, it made peace with Burma and consolidated its hold over Cambodia), and supplanted Sri Lanka as the preeminent centre of Buddhist culture.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> Shortly afterwards, however, hostilities with Burma resumed due to the ambitions of a new Burmese dynasty.

In actuality, members of the nobility through ad hoc appointments led Southeast Asian armies. These men were usually personal favorites of the ruler or one of his relatives, or were outlying lords obligated to bring local levies to participate in campaigns.

The Chinese Khun Phatthanasombat supervised not only gambling activities, but also transactions in drinks, and obviously other forms of recreation for the leisured and the rich.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ daily almsgiving ♥</b> Merit-making rituals are key to Thai Buddhism, and the most widespread of these is probably the daily act of almsgiving (<i>bindabat</i>, <i>binthabaat</i>, <i>binthabat</i>). Descriptions of how the ritual occurred in sixteenth- to eighteenth-century Thailand are hard to come by, but it is a sufficiently ancient tradition that it was almost certainly performed at the time ("[p]roviding basic sustenance for monks and nuns has been the primary form of Buddhist charity from the religion's beginnings" <sup id="cite_ref-213" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-213">[213]</a></sup>), and it is a sufficiently simple ritual that contemporary descriptions may well broadly correspond to how it was carried out in the past as well: starting 6 a.m. every morning in modern-day Thailand, "[m]onks walk at a steady pace, in line and in order of seniority, their bowls held in front of them or just below waist level, and their eyes on the road or path a few steps ahead of them. A monk carries his bowl in a cloth sling, whereas a novice does not use a sling but carries the bowl in both hands in front of him. While walking, a monk is not supposed to be anticipating the food he will be offered, but reflecting on the essentials of the monastic life: the robes, the <i>kuti</i> or other shelter, medicine, and the alms bowl which is his means of obtaining food to support his life rather than for pleasurable consumption" <sup id="cite_ref-214" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-214">[214]</a></sup>. Moreover, "in countries such as Thailand [...] the transaction is conducted silently and impersonally" <sup id="cite_ref-215" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-215">[215]</a></sup>. NOTE: Making a daily offering to one's "spirit house" may have more of a "local flavour" as a ritual--that is, it might be more polity-specific--but, from the descriptions <sup id="cite_ref-216" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-216">[216]</a></sup>, it does not appear to be a collective ritual.</dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Cult of the Emerald Buddha ♥</b> The statue of the Emerald Buddha was rediscovered in 1443 and transported to the Wat vihara. Soon after, it was recognised and its return celebrated by the whole population. The king od C'ieng Mai ordered that it be transferred to the capital. The statue was placed upon the back of a white elephant and accompanied by a procession. Along the road, lay people and bonzes paid tribute to the statue with songs, dancing and prayers.  Where the procession stopped, the Vessantarajataka was recited. In Jayasaka, the elephant fell down; the king understood that the statue would not make it to the capital and continued to Lampang, until 1481 when it moved to C'ieng Mai. It then went to Ventiane (1564), and Bangkok in 1778.  The Ratanabimbavamsa is the only book that gives some details on the cult of the Emerald Buddha in C'ieng Rai and Lampang. When the statue was first recognised, the king spread perfumed water on it; quickly followed by all inhabitants of the city. Those who had been virtuous saw the water turn to oil that made their lamps burn bright, and those who had sinned didn't see the water spread on the statue, it didn't fall into their lamps and neither was it converted to oil. However, if had begged forgiveness for their sins, the water turned to good oil. Hence, the statue was considered to be alive and capable of miracles. In Lampang, the statue was placed in a niche closed by a door. On the 8th, 14th and 15th days of the ascending and descending moon cycles, the door was opened for all to offer tribute and have devotions. In a specific period of the year, the statue was taken out and put on a throne in the centre of the vihara. The inhabitants of the city, preceded by the king and court, came in a procession carrying vases of scented water, to anoint the statue. The statue then emitted rays of green, yellow or white light. In Ventiane, the statue was placed in a special pavilion of the palace, and was given special furniture (golden bowl, parasol, umbrella and vases as well as cult objects) as well as 100 male and 100 female slaves to serve it. King Yotfa was very attached to the Emerald Buddha and required the presence of the statue in all ceremonies.  Vassals had to swear allegiance under the auspice of the statue. For crowning and New Year ceremonies, its presence was also required, and the statue was effectively transported to attend them until the mid 19th century. <sup id="cite_ref-297" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-297">[297]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Drinking of the Water of Allegiance ♥</b> Though the following description dates to the early twentieth century,"the Ceremony of Drinking the Water of Allegiance in the Ayudhya period was the same as that followed in Bangkok from the first reign onwards [i.e. between late eighteenth and early twentieth centuries], King Rama I having restored the ancient usage on his accession; and it is mentioned by La Loubere in the seventeenth century" <sup id="cite_ref-299" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-299">[299]</a></sup>. "The rites take place with great splendour twice yearly, on the third day of the waxing of the fifth month (Chaitra), and on the thirteenth day of the waning of the tenth month (Bhadrapada). The Drinking of the Water takes place in the Chapel Royal in Bangkok, and also in one temple in each seat of provincial government. The water is previously hallowed in the usual way by the monks, who recite mantras, the sacred sincana thread being stretched round the water-vessels, while the Court Brahmans also dip into the water the State Sword and other royal weapons, this being a rite of contagious magic, by the power of which any official meditating treason would be destroyed. It is said that persons have not infrequently in the past died of cholera after drinking the hallowed water, a result which no doubt did much to strengthen the general belief in the efficacy of the magic. On the day of the ceremony a Brahman reads out the Oath, and each official must drink the contents of a small cup, which he must drain to the last drop. Any appearance of difficulty in swallowing was, in the old days, considered as equivalent to an admission of disloyalty. The ladies of the palace, as well as members of the royal family, drink the Water of Allegiance, but, of course, with suitable privacy. Officials confined to their houses through illness are not excused from drinking the Water, but it is taken to their bedsides by royal pages or other officials." <sup id="cite_ref-300" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-300">[300]</a></sup> The Oath of Allegiance is too long to be included here, but it involves asking supernatural forces to punish the participants very thoroughly were they to fail their king: "may [the gods] plague us with evil, destroy our lives, effect our destruction and death by breakage, by severance; cause our death by lightning and thunderbolts, by royal weapons, the powerful royal sword, by poison and the power of land and water animals; let there be some opportunity for the destruction of the perfidious ones; let swift destruction come; let us not escape all great disasters and consequences of all localities, which those who have the power can inflict for all offences. We beseech the power of the deities to plague with poisonous boils, rapidly fatal, and all manner of diseases the dishonourable, perverse, and treacherous, plague with untimely, wretched and appalling deaths, manifest to the eyes of the world; when we shall have departed this life from earth, cause us to be sent and all to be born in the great hell, where we shall burn with quenchless fire for tens and hundreds of thousands of ages and limitless transmigrations; and when we have expiated our penalty there, and are again born in any world, we pray we may fail to find the least happiness in worlds of pleasurable enjoyments; let us not meet the god Buddha, the sacred teachings, the sacred priests, who come to be gracious to animals, helping them escape misery, reach heaven and attain a cessation of births and deaths; should we meet them let them grant us no gracious assistance." <sup id="cite_ref-301" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-301">[301]</a></sup></dd>

<p>We are interested here in any systems of thought and behavior that can influence people's actions, which we term a <i>Normative Ideology</i>.  Normative ideologies are thought-systems concerned with the correct behavior of people, governments/leaders, and other groups (and particularly the relationships between these groups).
</p><p>Mainly, this will be a religious or ritual system. As usual, when we mention Religious or Ritual System our focus  is on the 'official cult', defined the same way as in the Rituals section:
</p>
<dl><dd>With the official cult we refer to the set of collective religious practices that are most closely associated with legitimation of the power structure (including elites, if any).</dd></dl>
<p>However, Normative Ideologies are not restricted to religious/ritual systems. They include other thought systems, such as philosophy or anything that prescribes a particular pattern of behaviour. An example is  classical Greek philosophy, such as the works of Plato and Aristotle, who were concerned with correct or moral behaviour and whose thoughts influenced the actual practice of several societies (the empire of Alexander the Great, notably).

</p><p><b>♠ Description of the Normative Ideology ♣ ♥</b> "Theravada, the way of the elder, differs from other strains of Buddhism in the prime position accorded to the monk and monastic practice. The duty of the Sangha or monkhood is to preserve the thamma or teachings of the Buddha by adhering strictly to the winaya or monastic code. Some monks study the texts, preserve them by recopying, and preach their contents to the laity. Other monks exemplify the teachings by living an imitation of the Buddha’s own life, gaining insight through ascetic rigour and meditation. The duty of the laity, including the ruler, is to sustain the monkhood by patronage and protection. The enthusiasm for Theravada in the Chao Phraya basin, as elsewhere, stemmed especially from urban society’s appreciation of its openness and inherent egalitarianism: all have the same opportunity to become a monk, to give the monkhood their patronage, and to achieve the ultimate release from the material world (nibbana). "In practice, this pure form of Theravada was blended with other religious practices, including roles for Hindu gods, notions of supernatural power often borrowed from tantric types of Buddhism, and folk beliefs in spirits - especially in their power to foretell and influence the future.

Consequently, Buddhism’s ethical system emerged resting squarely on a body of preestablished forms of family practice, and supported by a fairly codified sociolegal system that had already taken form under the aegis of the Brahmanical tradition, sometime before the sixth-century bce. Thus, as a relatively late arriver, Buddhism accepted, tacitly, many of the given forms of social praxis in India. And, even when Buddhism sought to redefine religious goals and family values, these efforts were manifested vis-a-vis patterns that had already been in place for centuries. In short, whatever the exact historical reasons, one will look in vain for Buddhist spokespersons seeking to redo marriage law in India or in other Asian countries.” <sup id="cite_ref-459" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-459">[459]</a></sup> The same probably applied to Thailand, where, by "1361, the 'Law of Husbands and Wives' allowed men to practice polygamy" <sup id="cite_ref-460" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-460">[460]</a></sup>.

If we take care of our own spiritual development, we render a service to others; and if we develop love towards others, we thereby also help ourselves. Accordingly, it is explicitly stated, someone who pursues the path of salvation only for his or her own benefit is to be censured, while the one who follows the path for one’s own benefit and for the benefit of others is to be commended (see AN 7:64).” <sup id="cite_ref-461" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-461">[461]</a></sup> “Three segments of the Noble Eightfold Path (3 - 5) are traditionally subsumed under the principle of morality (sila): ‘right speech’ (3), ‘right action’ (4) and ‘right livelihood’ (5).

From monks and nuns complete sexual abstention is demanded. ‘Right livelihood’ means abstaining from those sources of income which involve harming other beings: trading in weapons for instance, or trading in living beings, meat, intoxicants or poison; also included is the avoidance of fraud and avarice.” <sup id="cite_ref-462" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-462">[462]</a></sup>

"Southeast Asian rulers favoured the Hindu gods because of the opportunity, exemplified at Angkor, to associate the ruler with the power gods of the Hindu pantheon (Vishnu, Siva, Indra). Hence, the Ayutthayan kings imported Brahmans to plan and execute royal rituals. But Hinduism developed no local following in Siam. In popular practice, Hindu gods were transformed into attendants of the Buddha or converted into local spirits (as in their popularity in spirit houses).

<dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement against harm ♣ present ♥</b> “The heart of Buddhist spiritual life, whether lay or monastic, is puṇya (Pali puñña ). This term is usually translated as ‘merit’ and refers to certain significant kinds of action that are regarded as auspicious and potent deeds. Essentially, merit is good ‘karma’ ( karman/kamma)&nbsp;: wholesome ( kuśla/kusala ) deeds which plant seeds that bear fortunate and pleasant fruits, whether in this life or lives to come, and thereby create conditions for further meritorious action in the future. These are the kinds of action that conduce to the development of the qualities of the eightfold path. Moreover it is making merit that binds the lay and monastic communities together. The traditional ‘bases of merit’ are generosity (dāna), ethical conduct ( śīla/sīla ), and meditation ( bhāvanā ). [...]The practice of good conduct takes the form of commitment to the five precepts usually recited in conjunction with the three refuges: (1) to refrain from harming living creatures, (2) to refrain from taking what is not given, (3) to refrain from sexual misconduct, (4) to refrain from false speech, (5) to refrain from intoxicants that cause heedlessness (see pp. 170- 2). In addition the lay disciple may on special occasions (traditionally the full moon ‘observance’ days) or for longer periods take the eight precepts, replacing the third precept (refraining from sexual misconduct) with complete sexual abstinence and adding (6) refraining from eating after midday, (7) refraining from attending entertainments and using perfumes, etc., and (8) refraining from using luxurious beds.”<sup id="cite_ref-486" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-486">[486]</a></sup> “The nature of bad action is usually illustrated by reference to a list of the ten courses of unwholesome action ( karma/kamma-patha ) which consist of three bodily courses of action (taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct), four vocal courses of action (lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech, frivolous speech), and three mental courses of action (covetousness, ill-will, wrong view). [...] Essentially the psychological states that motivate the ten unwholesome courses of action- strong greed, hatred, and delusion -lead to rebirth in the unhappy destinies or ‘descents’: in a hell realm, as a hungry ghost, an animal, or a jealous god. In fact rather a precise correlation exists here: dominated by greed one becomes a hungry ghost, a class of beings ever discontent and anguished because of being unable to satisfy their greed; dominated by hatred one enters one of the hell realms where one suffers terrible pain; dominated by ignorance one becomes an animal ruled by the instincts of food and reproduction.” <sup id="cite_ref-487" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-487">[487]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of fairness ♣ present ♥</b> “In the cosmology set out above, karma functions as the elevator that takes people from one floor of the building to another. Good deeds result in an upward movement and bad deeds in a downward one. Karma is not a system of rewards and punishments meted out by God but a kind of natural law akin to the law of gravity. [...] Buddhists speak of good karma as ‘merit’ (puñña, Sanskrit: puṇya), and much effort is expended in acquiring it. Some picture it as a kind of spiritual capital-like money in a bank account-whereby credit is built up as the deposit on a heavenly rebirth. One of the best ways for a layman to earn merit is by supporting the order of monks.

What ‘right action’ and ‘right livelihood’ positively involve becomes clearer in the numerous practical guidelines for dealing with one’s parents, teachers, spouse, children, friends, one’s master and servant, Brahmans and Sramanas. So, for example, in the very popular Sigālovāda Sutta (DN 31): Children should honour their parents, be grateful and support them when they are in need or grow old; parents should show their love to their children by teaching them virtue, training them for a profession and passing on their inheritance when it is due; [...] a husband should minister to his wife ‘by honouring her, by not disparaging her, by not being unfaithful to her, by giving authority to her, by providing her with adornments’. A wife will reciprocate ‘by properly organising her work, by being kind to the servants, by not being unfaithful, by protecting stores, and by being skilful and diligent in all she has to do’.” <sup id="cite_ref-496" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-496">[496]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of in-group loyalty ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> “As mentioned before, the development of a loving mind towards all beings, whether friend or foe, is the aim of one of the meditative practices of early Buddhism (see above p. 53f ). In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsāric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f ). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21).” <sup id="cite_ref-497" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-497">[497]</a></sup> “[...] Buddhism maintained a fairly flexible posture vis-a-vis competing religions and never sought to require laity to identify themselves exclusively as Buddhist or to rely singularly on the Buddhist clergy for all their spiritual needs.” <sup id="cite_ref-498" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-498">[498]</a></sup></dd>

Some texts affirm that even killing in self-defence, or in defence of family or friends, is wrongful, and in general an attitude of non-resistance in the face of violence is commended. The commentary to the Dhammapada relates how on one occasion when the Buddha's kinsmen, the Sakyas, were under attack, they allowed themselves to be slaughtered rather than break the First Precept.

<dd><b>♠ Labor ♣ present ♥</b> "Over the era of warfare, all men (and some women) outside the noble ranks had been brought within systems of servitude and forced labour. Under methods adapted from teh Tai hill states, most freemen (<i>phrai</i>) were registered on a conscription roll, and placed under an overseer (<i>nai</i> or <i>munnai</i>) who was responsible for mobilization. [...] Conscripts served on a rotational basis (alternate months, or alternating half-years). As warfare diminished, these corvée forces were transferred to other tasks such as building temples and palaces, carrying palanquins, rowing boats, or loading the trading junks. The king and great noble-officials controlled this forced labour and sometimes competed over it." <sup id="cite_ref-543" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-543">[543]</a></sup></dd>
