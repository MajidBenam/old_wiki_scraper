</p><p><b> ♠ Peak Date  ♣ 1867-1900 CE ♥ </b> A peak date is hard to identify for the A’chik population itself. The Empire peaked in the 19th century, in the last quarter of which the Garo Hills were incorporated into the British colonial structure. The British sent punitive campaigns into the hills in order to suppress resistance as well as infighting. Administrative control was established around 1873. Most authors consider the area 'pacified' for the remainder of the colonial period. 'The 19th century marked the full flower of the British Empire. Administration and policy changed during the century from the haphazard arrangements of the 17th and 18th centuries to the sophisticated system characteristic of Joseph Chamberlain’s tenure (1895-1900) in the Colonial Office. That office, which began in 1801, was first an appendage of the Home Office and the Board of Trade, but by the 1850s it had become a separate department with a growing staff and a continuing policy; it was the means by which discipline and pressure were exerted on the colonial governments when such action was considered necessary. [...] In the wake of the Indian Mutiny (1857), the British crown assumed the East India Company’s governmental authority in India. Britain’s acquisition of Burma (Myanmar) was completed in 1886, while its conquest of the Punjab (1849) and of Balochistān (1854-76) provided substantial new territory in the Indian subcontinent itself. The French completion of the Suez Canal (1869) provided Britain with a much shorter sea route to India. Britain responded to this opportunity by expanding its port at Aden, establishing a protectorate in Somaliland (now Somalia), and extending its influence in the sheikhdoms of southern Arabia and the Persian Gulf. Cyprus, which was, like Gibraltar and Malta, a link in the chain of communication with India through the Mediterranean, was occupied in 1878. Elsewhere, British influence in the Far East expanded with the development of the Straits Settlements and the federated Malay states, and in the 1880s protectorates were formed over Brunei and Sarawak.' <sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup>

When British rule came to an end in 1947, the subcontinent was partitioned along religious lines into two separate countries-India, with a majority of Hindus, and Pakistan, with a majority of Muslims; the eastern portion of Pakistan later split off to form Bangladesh.

<b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ loose ♥ </b> Prior to British imperial rule, the A’chik tribal population was not organized around a common political or administrative centre, with clans and lineages being the only supra-local social institutions: ‘The Garos are divided into nine subtribes: the Awe, Chisak, Matchi-Dual, Matabeng, Ambeng, Ruga-Chibox, Gara-Ganching, Atong, and the Megam. These are geographic subtribes, but are also dialectal and subcultural groups. According to their beliefs and religion, the Garos are divided into the SONGSAREK (following their indigenous beliefs and practices) and the Christians.’ <sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> During the colonial period, a British administrative structure was superimposed on the native population, but the latter largely continued to regulate local matters according to A’chik laws and institutions: ‘Garo tribe inhabit the Garo Hills district in the state of Meghalaya. The district used to be administered as a ‘partially excluded area’ by the Deputy Commissioner under the executive orders of the British Government during the British rule. The tribal ways of life, community ownership and use of land and the administration of the society according to the traditional laws and customs were least interfered with overtly under the British Administration.’ <sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> The A’chik retained some autonomy under Indian rule as well: ‘The history of Khasi, and Jaintia hills and its people can be found from the early part of the sixteenth century, as prior to this neither the records nor traditions reveal any substantial information. Moderately large changes were brought forth through development of the settlements and the formation of the Khasi and the Jaintia Hill district in the year 1835 and the Garo district in the year 1866. The capital of these provinces was Cherrapunji in 1827 which later on was shifted to Shillong in 1864. The prevailing groups in the State are the Khasi, Jaintia and Garo. In an amendment made recently in the provision of Scheduled Tribe in the Constitution of India, the Rabha, the Bodo-Kachari and the Koch have been given the status of Scheduled Tribe in the State.’ <sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup>

In 1775-76 the Zeminders of Mechpara and Karaibari led expeditions to the hills near about their Zeminderies and subjugated a portion of what is at present the Garo Hills district.

The Garos are divided into nine subtribes: the Awe, Chisak, Matchi-Dual, Matabeng, Ambeng, Ruga-Chibox, Gara-Ganching, Atong, and the Megam. These are geographic subtribes, but are also dialectal and subcultural groups.’ <sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup> ‘Linguistic affinities and personal traits clearly show that the Garos are only a division of the great Bodo race of Assam. The Bodos were spread, as at present, throughout the whole of the Brahmaputra valley as well as in North Bengal. Aryans are now generally believed to have entered into Assam by two routes, one leading from the west through the Gangetic valley and the other through the Himalayas along the courses of the rivers entering Assam. The Bodos who were the earlier inhabitants of the province also came here in different hordes and following different routes from the north-west as well as from the north-east. It  may be supposed that the Bodos, before entering into Assam and North Bengal which might have been then a part of Assam (Kamrupa of Old), divided themselves into groups somewhere in the Himalayan kingdom of Tibet. I think the ancestors of the Garos of Assam came down from Tibet to Bhutan and thence by following the course of the river Sonkos and her tributaries to Dhubri (now headquarters of the district of Goalpara) and this might be the latest migration of the people of the Bodo race into Assam and North Bengal. These people then crossed the Brahmaputra at different points and populated the southern parts of Goalpara, the northern and the western parts of the Garo Hills and then gradually they spread in the entire Garo Hills and some parts of the Kamrup district.’ <sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> ’Linguistically and ethnologically, the Garos belong to the Bodo family, who were one-time occupants of a large part of the Brahmaputra valley but were probably pushed into the hills by later invaders. The Garos strongly believe that their ancestors came from Tibet and settled in Cooch Behar for about 400 years.’ <sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup> ‘The denomination of these linguistic speakers was subsequently driven away by the Tibeto- Burman hordes into Khasi Hills and the Jaintia Hills. This is the only part of the North East India in which this sub-family exists now. The three groups of the Tibeto-Burman family like Kuki-Chin and Naga were driven to the North-Eastern Hills. The Bodo dominated in the plains of Garo Hills and the North Cachar Hills. They were later subdivided into Garo, Kachari, Mech, Dimasa, Tippera, Lalung, Chutiya and Rabha groups (Barkakati 1969). Playfair ( c.f. Barkakati, 1969) writes that the Garo and the Kachari originally belonged to one group before splitting into two  groups-one group over the Southern bank of Brahmaputra and the other Kachar, spreading over the North Garo Hills. The latter was occupied by the British in the year 1872. Prior to this the area was administered as a part of Bengal. The area became a part of Assam in 1874, when it was carved out as a separate province.’ <sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup> ‘The non-Garo settled population of the district consists of the Hajong, Koch, Dalu and Rabha (All excepting the Hajong are Bodo speaking tribes). The Hajong have adopted the Jharua dialect of Assamese and have been greatly Hinduized. The Dalu are closely akin to the Hajong but they are recent migrants from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). These people inhabit the outer fringes of the district extending to the adjacent areas of the neighbouring plains districts. They are in occupation of the fertile agricultural lands suitable for wet paddy cultivation. There is also a small number of settled Muslim population (nearly 5% of the total population of the district according to 1961 census) in the north-eastern tip of the district adjacent to the Dhubri subdivision of the Goalpara district and to the district of Rongpur of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh).’ <sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup> We have followed eHRAF in the grouping of Bodo Peoples with South Asia <sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup>.

The districts border Bangladesh on the south and west and Assam on the north. Hills cover most of the district, with plains along the fringes. There are a number of hilly streams and rivers; excepting for the Simsang River which forms a wide flood plain none is navigable. The monsoon area produces a thick vegetation on the hills.’ <sup id="cite_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup> Given how colonial authorities introduced an administrative system in which the A’chik participated through the office of Laskar (see below), we have chosen to code for the district rather than for the village level.
</p><p><b> ♠ Polity Population ♣  138,000: 1900 CE ♥ </b> People. 1872 CE: 80,000; 1901 CE: 138,274; 1951 CE: 242,075 Regional integration was an artefact of colonial rule and the superimposition of a colonial administration upon a native system: ‘The Garo Hills were sparsely populated at the time the British came. According to Hunter, population of the Garo Hills was 80,000 in 1872; there was hardly any immigration and the hills were mostly populated by the Garos. Population went on increasing rapidly after that. In 1901 Garos were 74% of total population. It became 78% in 1951 and 85% in 1961 and 78.81% in 1971. High rate of growth of population is mainly due to population influx. What is of interest is, considerable influx of Garo population which is evident from the increasing proportion of the Garos in the total population.’ <sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup> ‘We find an increase of the population of the Garo between 1901 and 1951, 84% and between 1951 and 1961, 39%; while the percentages of general population increase for the periods were 61 and 26 respectively. Thus it is clear that the Garo population of the district is increasing at a faster rate as compared to the general population. This is due probably to the reason that many Garo families have migrated to the district from the adjoining Garo areas in the plains, while there was no such influx of non-Garo families, rather a number of their families have moved out of the district for various reasons. We can expect a greater percentage of increase during the period 1961-1971, because there was an influx of a large number of Garo families from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) during the first half of this decade.’ <sup id="cite_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup> ‘The population of the district according to the 1951 census was 242,075, of which 190,901 gave Garo as their mother tongue. Most of the non-Garo-speaking population of the district is concentrated around the edges, leaving most of the interior almost ethnically pure. In fact, the only people other than Garos who are at all dispersed throughout the district are a few Nepalis living in widely scattered settlements. They are recent immigrants who maintain large herds of cattle and sell milk or manufacture ghee. Another 50,000 Garos were listed by the census in other parts of Assam, mostly in the districts immediately bordering the Garo Hills, and about 40,000 live in the adjacent districts of East Pakistan. Except for a few recent emigrants, then, the Garos form a geographically compact population. If they are distributed through a number of districts, this is largely because the borders of the district do not coincide perfectly with the area occupied by the tribe, though the borders were intended to do this as well as possible. The census reports of the district have shown an increase in every ten-year period since 1901, when the population was returned  as only 138,274, just over half that shown by the most recent census. Part of the increase is probably due to immigration from other districts, but most is surely the result of natural expansion which-in spite of an appalling death rate, especially among children-seems to be keeping pace with the rest of India.’ <sup id="cite_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-68">[68]</a></sup> We can therefore speak of a shared polity population in this case.
</p><p><b> ♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ [7,000-9,000]: 1956 CE ♥ </b> Inhabitants. The A’chik population was mostly rural: ‘The population in a village ranges from 20 to 1,000 persons. The population density tends to decrease as one moves towards the interior areas from the urban areas of the districts. Villages are scattered and distant from one another in the interior areas. These villages are generally situated on the top of hillocks. The houses are built together with granaries, firewood sheds, and pig sties. The houses are built, together with granaries, firewood sheds, and pigsties, on piles around the slope of the hillock, using locally available bamboo, wood, grass, etc. The approach to the rectangular house is always built facing the leveled surface of the top, while the rear part of the house remains horizontal to the slope. Nowadays new pile-type buildings using wood and iron as major components are being made in some traditional villages also. In addition, buildings similar to those of the neighboring plains are also constructed. The villages may remain distant from agricultural fields (JHUM). In order to guard a crop (during agricultural seasons) from damage by wild animals, the people build temporary watchtowers (BORANQ) in trees in the field. Bachelor dormitories exist in some villages for meetings and recreation.’ <sup id="cite_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-69">[69]</a></sup> Tura, the district capital, was the only urban centre of the British colonial and independent Indian administrations, but members of the A’chik community formed about half the population of the town: ‘Tura is the only town in the district. It is the administrative headquarters of the Garo Hills district. According to 1961 Census, it had a population of 8,888 out of which 4,370 were Garo. Tura is linked with the plains of Assam by three major roads; one enters the district near its north-eastern corner and traverses the district almost diagonally half-way; the other two roads enter the district through the north-western corner and one traverses the district south-eastwardly diagonally half-way, and the other follows the western border of the district, but from the middle of the western border line enters Tura from an westerly direction.

</p><p><b>♠ Largest communication distance ♣ [200-400] ♥</b> in kilometers. The Garo Hills as an administrative district was created by colonial rule: ‘The two Garo Hills districts are situated between 25 degrees, 9 minutes and 26 degrees, 1 minute north latitude and 89 degrees, 49 minutes and 91 degrees, 2 minutes east longitude, covering an area of 8,000 square kilometers.

The monsoon area produces a thick vegetation on the hills.’ <sup id="cite_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup> During the colonial and early indepedent periods, the rural population completed most travel on foot: ‘I have seen young people as well as people past their middle age going virtually from one end to the other of the district only to meet relatives for a day or two. The journey to and from may cover ten to twelve days, if not more. The district being next to Cherapunji which claims the greatest rainfall in India, has naturally a very high degree of rainfall throughout the year, particularly between April and August. The foot tracks on the hills during rains become very slippery and difficult to tread. To add to this trouble the forest undergrowths and weeds of various kinds gain luxurious growth during rains and practically cover up the entire area of foot tracks. Different types of pests also appear with the rains. Insects of various kinds and leeches are abundant in the area throughout the rainy season. It is a painful experience to live in the hills during the rains for one who is not habituated with the condition of the land. I had difficulties in pursuading the plains people to accompany me to the hills during the rainy season. Malarial fever in epidemic form appears during the rains and continues up to the autumn. Digestive and other intestinal troubles also are very common amongst the people living in the hills, particularly during this season. In one word, the Garos maintain a miserable existence in the hills during the rainy season. Fortunately, they have not to do much of outdoor work during this season excepting weeding their fields where necessary.’ <sup id="cite_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-72">[72]</a></sup>

Bachelor dormitories exist in some villages for meetings and recreation.’ <sup id="cite_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-74">[74]</a></sup> The mean size of villages may have decreased during the colonial period: ‘In former days, Garo villages were of considerable size and used to contain as many as two or three hundred houses. Liability to attack by a neighbouring village made this necessary, and the danger was further guarded against by sowing the approaches with sharp-pointed bamboo stakes called  wamisi in Garo, but better known as  panjis. These presented a very formidable obstacle to an enemy, and effectually prevented a sudden attack. Nowadays, when every man is at peace with his neighbour, the necessity no longer exists for large collections of houses, and the difficulty of finding sufficient land close to big villages for the support of their inhabitants, has resulted in their being broken up into small hamlets situated perhaps as much as four or five miles apart, which, however, in most cases, retain the name of the parent village. In order to distinguish them there is added to the name of each hamlet the name of its  nokma, or headman.’ <sup id="cite_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-75">[75]</a></sup> ‘In Garo society the village is the largest group of which all the members regularly join in cooperative activities, but more extensive organizations are also recognized. First, several neighboring villages may be considered to be related. One of these is usually believed to have been the original village from which the founders of the other “daughter” villages moved. [...] The peace which the British imposed on the hills may have made it possible to live in smaller and more scattered villages than the people had formerly done. Perhaps most of the groups of linked villages that are now to be found have resulted from the splitting of larger villages during the period of British rule. The difficulty of access to the fields would make more dispersed settlement desirable so long as enemies did not threaten. Nowadays villages only rarely move, split up, or die out. I saw just one village in the process of being moved. This was an undertaking that was destined to last for three years, since the villagers could not muster sufficient labor to rebuild more than a third of their houses in a single year. The move was being made solely for the sake of the water supply, which was failing at the old site.’ <sup id="cite_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-76">[76]</a></sup> New villages grow out of small pioneer hamlets: ‘There are different sizes of village in the Garo Hills. I have seen small villages consisting of two or three huts, practically isolated from all the advantages of a big village. On the other hand, in a big village there may be as many as fifty or more huts. The size of the big village entirely depends on the space that is available for the house building and also the facilities the inhabitants of the village may derive for cultivation and other purposes from the surroundings of the locality. The largest village, I visited, was situated on the slopes of the hills, as is the usual practice, facing long strip of valley, nearly about a mile and a half long and about half a mile broad. It is easily understandable that people living in such villages take to plough and utilise the valley for agricultural purposes. It has, therefore, the advantage of accommodating larger people than it is possible for the village which is situated on the hill slopes and which is to depend primarily on  jhum cultivation as described hereafter. Usually, an average sized village contains ten to fifteen houses. The economic factor is one of the main guiding principles regarding the expansion of a village. Availability of arrable land or hillocks for jhum cultivation, good drinking water, facilities of conveyance and also facilities of market places are some of the main factors, which the Garos consider before they fix up a place to start a new village. The common practice is to have one house for one family consisting of husband, wife, and children. Occasionally, the old mother or the mother-in-law also stays in the family.’ <sup id="cite_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-77">[77]</a></sup> As indicated above, we have provisionally assumed that migration to Tura was fairly insignificant in the early colonial period.

</p><p>During colonial rule, supralocal executive offices were superimposed onto village- and lineage-based A’chik structures: ‘When the Britishers took over the administration of this district, one witnessed an imposition of hierarchy of new political and administrative units in the district over the traditional democratic village set-up. The British Government, being actuated with the desire to have effective control over the villages and to facilitate the collection of revenues and house tax introduced the office of  laskar with limited police, civil and criminal powers. Accordingly there was a  laskar over a circle of villages; each having jurisdiction covering ten or twelve of villages. Although, the villagers were left to settle all disputes through the  nokma and the village courts, they had right to appeal to the court of  laskars against the decisions of the village councils.’ <sup id="cite_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-78">[78]</a></sup> ’In the same way the introduction of offices of  sardar, hill  mandal and hill  mauzadar curtailed the powers and authorities of the  nokmas and their village councils. The new offices were created for the effective administration over the Garo with the idea of village self-government under the direct control of Deputy Commissioner at the centre.’ <sup id="cite_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-79">[79]</a></sup> Clans and lineages associated with village clusters nevertheless continued to exercise social control on the local level: ‘In Garo society the most important social group is the clan known as MACHONG. A machong is an exogamous matrilineal descent group wherein a Garo is automatically assigned by birth to the unilineal group of his mother. A CHATCHI (moiety) is divided into many machong. Each married couple chooses one daughter--or, if they have none, they adopt a close relative of the mother--to be heiress (NAKNA DONQIPIKA MECHIK) of the family. Her husband traditionally is selected from the lineage group of the father and is accepted as the NOKROM of the house. He resides with his wife in her parents' house. He has to take on the responsibility of looking after his parents-in-law during their old age, and his wife inherits the property.’ <sup id="cite_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-80">[80]</a></sup> Local authority is exercised by lineage elders: ‘The authority within a lineage is exercised according to age, the older member always being allowed to direct and punish the younger members. The age differences are otherwise symbolized  in only one way-the order in which rice beer is served. When beer is first passed out at a gathering, the people should be served in order of formal seniority. A maternal uncle should be served before his nephew, and an older brother before a younger one. Even an older sister may precede a younger brother, though generally men and women do not drink together. [...] In spite of this formal deference, older people do not monopolize positions of power, and an old person cannot exercise authority outside his lineage simply because of his age. One defers to one’s lineage seniors, but not to old people in general.’ <sup id="cite_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-81">[81]</a></sup> Village headmen act as intermediaries in local disputes: ‘Among the Garos most disputes arise over the issues of property, inheritance, and domestic quarrels within the family. Such problems are to a large extent settled by the MAHARI (lineage) of the offended and the offender. A new situation develops when someone's cattle cause damage to another's crops. Under such situation the NOKMA (village headman) acts as an intermediary only. If he fails to settle the dispute, the matter can go to the civil court of the district council.’ <sup id="cite_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-82">[82]</a></sup>  ‘Traditionally, the  nokma’s position was connected with the indigeneous customary rites. His temporal and ritual powers in a traditional society were linked with his position. The conversion of a  nokma to Christianity automatically led to the loss of his ritualistic role. When the  nokma’s were endowed with real temporal power, the resistance was great as  Nokmas were non-Christians. But when the  Nokma accepted Christianity,  nokmaship passed to another person who could act as a  nokma in performing rites and rituals. However, the Government still recognized the converted persons as  nokmas. This created dislocation in the traditional system, one looking after the customary right and other ritual responsibilities. As the author has tried to show that in the traditional system the two roles cannot be separated, the two roles are enmeshed into each other.’ <sup id="cite_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-83">[83]</a></sup> Nokmas also formally hold titles to land: ‘In a Garo village very little difference of status is seen. A particular clan holds right of ownership of the village homestead and shifting cultivation lands, and the title of ownership is inherited by a particular household. The head of the land-owning household is known as the  nokma, and the particular area under which he holds ownership right is known as   a’king. He also acts as the religious head of the village, and he is to perform the ceremonies for the general well-being of the village. He is called upon to settle disputes between villagers. But in all his decisions he is guided by the elders of the village. He is not entitled to any tribute from the villagers, and he has no special paraphernalia to indicate himself as the  nokma. However, in the village a rich man gets respect, because in times of need people have to seek help from him. But in a Garo village it is usually very rare to find an extremely rich man. To a Garo wealth consists of a number of brass gongs called  rang and some ornaments made of silver or some such metal. Now-a-days a gun is also regarded as the status symbol of a wealthy man. In recent days they have started to acquire landed property, because in areas where permanent cultivation is practised individual ownership of land has gradually come to be recognized. Among the Chisak and the Matchi, however, a wealthy man can perform a status giving ceremony, called  jaksil gana, in which along with a set of religious rites the aspirant is to give a liberal feast to all the villagers, and in return he is entitled to wear an armlet called  jaksil, which is considered as a status symbol and the wearer is designated as  nokma though he may not have to do anything with an  a’king.’ <sup id="cite_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-84">[84]</a></sup> While village headmen were acknowledged by the British administration, the imposition of the above-mentioned administrative structure led to a loss of political power among Nokmas: ‘There was a move for retention of the old institution of  nokmaship which could not function with authority since the British administration had appointed the  laskars and  sardars for the smooth running of their administration from 1824 onwards. The  nokmas became only the clan chief and custodian of the clan land  a’king. The  nokma could not administer effectively as he used to do prior to the British administration in the district. The  nokmas were supposed to be well versed with their functions and duties in the villages. The British administration enforced the Rules of Administration of Justice in the Garo Hills both Civil and Police in 1937. These rules have been renewed again and again. They are in use till the present day. The head of the district administration was the Deputy Commissioner and his Assistants and it has never been changed.’ <sup id="cite_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-85">[85]</a></sup>

A kamal has neither special privilege nor prestige from his service to the society.’ <sup id="cite_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-86">[86]</a></sup> The village priest or healer deals with misfortune caused by malicious sprites: ‘These  mite live in many places. Some dwell in the village, others in the jungle, near a tree, or by a stream or waterfall. A fork in a road is a favorite place, and powerful  mite are said to live on mountain tops. All are dealt with in the same general fashion, though the details of the sacrifices differ. Several men usually spend about two hours building an altar. Most altars  are built of bamboo and leaves, but the precise form depends upon the particular spirit to whom the sacrifice is to be directed. Once the altar is built, a ritually skilled man must offer an egg, a chicken, a pig, or even a cow, depending upon the seriousness of the disease and the demands of the  mite. This priest kills the animal in a ritually prescribed manner, and smears the blood on to the altar. He recites a number of chants while standing or squatting before the altar, and usually pours a bit of rice beer on to the ground as an additional offering. At a sacrifice to cure disease, as on other occasions when animals are ceremoniously killed, the priest inspects their viscera for omens. If the proper portion of a chicken’s intestines prove to be filled, for instance, the prognosis is good; otherwise it is bad. While the priest is performing the ritual, the men who have helped build the altar sit around, chatting and joking, with no outward signs of respect or attention. There is no ecstasy and no sleight of hand, and the sick person is not even necessarily present. When the formalities are completed, the helpers prepare the animal and cook it into a curry. Rice is boiled, and all of the helpers share in the ensuing meal. Typically, the entire sacrifice, from the time the participants first assemble to the time they finish the feast, takes three or four hours. Afterward the participants go to their own houses. They are not supposed to go to their fields for the whole day, though they may do chores about the house. Sacrifices of this sort are the commonest kind of ceremony performed by the people of Rengsanggri. They involve only a half dozen or so neighbors and relatives, and they are held whenever the need arises. Occasionally two or three may even be held on the same day if several people in the village are sick. Altogether several hundred sacrifices are likely to be performed in the village of Rengsanggri in a single year.’ <sup id="cite_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-87">[87]</a></sup> They also officiate at village festivals: ‘Wangala is one of the three festivals at which group dancing takes place. This occurs in the courtyards in front of the houses, where people like to keep a sizable cleared space for this very purpose. Both married and unmarried people take part, though dancing is generally felt to be most appropriate for the young, especially those who are unmarried. Group dancing is almost exclusively a night pastime, and may continue intermittently until dawn.’ <sup id="cite_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-88">[88]</a></sup> During the colonial period, the A’chik population became the target of missionary activities: ‘The third major influence on the Garos, and in some ways the most important, has been that of Christianity. American Baptist missionaries began to have a few peripheral contacts with the Garos even before their hills were occupied by the British. Missionaries were stationed in Goalpara, a town on the Brahmaputra just north of the Garo Hills, and some of their work was with Garos. However, intensive Christianization began only after the occupation of the hills. American missionaries followed the government officers into the hills and like them set up their headquarters in the town of Tura, which remains the center of Garo Christian activities today. The missionaries not only evangelized, but from the beginning carried out extensive medical and educational work.’ <sup id="cite_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-89">[89]</a></sup> But the process of Christianization was initially slow and statistically insignificant for most of the colonial period, the majority of the population remaining Songsarek (i.e., attached to indigenous beliefs and rituals), although the subsequent decades experienced a rapid growth of the Christian population: ‘As per the census report, prior to 1941 in the Garo Hills none claimed as Christians. The presence of Buddhists in the Garo  Hills was first reported in the 1941 census report and the presence of Muslim in the 1961 census report. Islam in the Garo Hills was spread by traders much before 1961, and Christianity by the British as early as 1847. By 1911, there were 5314 people enrolled as Christians. There was steady rise in the Christian population after independence. The rise in the Christian population was very high. After 1961 there was rise in the Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist population but, their increase has not been significant as compared with the rise in Christian population.’ <sup id="cite_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-90">[90]</a></sup>

Though some of the households can sell a part of their produce just after the harvest, there is no large scale farmer selling major portion of their produce for cash. There are no occupational groups in the village. Nor do they borrow the services of occupational groups from the plains. In this respect the contrast with the non-Garo population in the surrounding villages is interesting. The Koch and the Hajong of the neighbouring areas utilize the services of barbers from the plains, who are annualy remunerated  by giving a fixed quantity of paddy by each household. However, some of the Wajadagiri people, who can manage a small sum of money, occasionally do a little prospective business of cash crops. But nobody has yet taken up trading as a wholetime occupation.’ <sup id="cite_ref-96" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-96">[96]</a></sup> Permanent professional occupations are rare or absent: ‘No occupational classes have developed in the village. Individuals and households change over from one occupation to another. One household occasionally deals in dry fish. Three of the households possess some permanent agricultural lands in the plains areas. Though the owners do not cultivate these lands themselves, they get their lands cultivated on share-crop basis and bring the owner’s half of the yield to the village for consumption.’ <sup id="cite_ref-97" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-97">[97]</a></sup> Trade is mostly based on cash crops rather than salaries from non-agricultural labour: ‘But people must exchange their produce to meet their requirements, and both hill and plains Garos needed such trade. Hence some trade started at border points on a very limited scale. Over time, these contacts grew into organized HUTTA (weekly markets) under the initiative of the Zamindars, who were subjects of the Muslim ruler. Initially cotton was exchanged in silent barter for pigs, cattle, goat, tobacco and metallic tools. This trade has continued to the present, with increasing involvement of peoples from the neighboring areas, and has now become fully monetized. Cotton, ginger and, dried chilies produced by the Garos are sold to the traders.

The village headman and elders are not bureaucrats, but a colonial bureaucratic structure was superimposed onto the A’chik system of informal village and lineage leadership. ‘Many of the disputes of the Garos were decided in their village  Panchayats. When a man has some complaints against another he reports them to the Nokma or the village-head. If the nature of the complaints is simple, the Nokma in a meeting of the few leading persons of the village, decides the dispute; but if the nature of the complaints is complicated and not easy of solution the Nokma reports the matter to the Laskar. The Laskar is a very important and influential man in the Garo Hills District. The hills areas are divided into some elekas and each of such elekas is placed under a Laskar for convenient collection of the house tax as well as for deciding the disputes of small nature locally. The Laskar need not essentially be a literate man, worldly prudence is enough for the management of his eleka. In practice a Laskar wields immense influence in his eleka.’ <sup id="cite_ref-110" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-110">[110]</a></sup> The degree of professionalization differs according to administrative level, with full-time bureaucrats restricted to the higher ones: ‘The  loskor has several duties. He collects the house tax within his district, keeping a fixed portion of this as his own payment, and he organizes work parties to keep the roads open. His most important duty, however, is to supervise and try to settle legal disputes. The  loskor sometimes appoints one or more assistants called  sordars, to whom the District Council pays an annual stipend of 100 Rupees, together with a shirt and a pair of short pants. Saljing, who lived in Rengsanggri, was a  sordar; but not every village had one, and a  sordar does not have jurisdiction over a particular village. As a general assistant to the  loskor he may assist in collecting information about a dispute, and in petty matters a  sordar may sit as representative of the  loskor and preside at a trial.

This officer took into his hands the collection of rents claimed by the Zaminders from the Garos, and abolished the duties levied by them on the hill producers. For some years a policy of  non-interference was followed but without the desired success; so it was decided to appoint an officer-in-charge of the hills and in 1869 a.d. the Garo Hills were formed into a separate district with Tura as its headquarters.

Their powers do not exceed those of inflicting fines and awarding compensation to injured parties. This is but an adaptation of the ancient usages of the people, for in former times, the village met in conference to decide any matter in dispute between its members. When in these meetings evidence could not be adduced, recourse was, and is yet had to trial by ordeal. This is of two kinds, the  [...] ordeal of hot iron, and the [...] ordeal of boiling water.’ <sup id="cite_ref-151" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-151">[151]</a></sup> ‘Before the advent of the British, Garos settled all the criminal offences through killing. It was the only way of resolving any dispute of criminal nature. The Britishers could not stop this practice of killing of each other for any slightest dispute. It took a long time and ultimately with the demonstration of gun and bullet, they could succeed to put a stop to it after the Garo Hills became a district in 1869. The laskar was appointed to look into the disputes of both civil and criminal nature in the village. If it is of purely criminal nature, the matter is reported to the Deputy Commissioner at Tura and disposed there. The cases which are not serious are settled by the village  Nokma and  Laskar with fines upto the amount not exceeding Rs. 50 for injury to property, injury to persons not endangering life or limb, house trespass, affronts of whatever kind; gambling and drunken or disorderly brawling (Milton Sangma, 1981, p. 187).’ <sup id="cite_ref-152" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-152">[152]</a></sup> Serious cases are handled by district-level courts: ‘The cases which are brought to the courts are serious and quite entangled ones, otherwise these could be decided amicably at the  mahari or  chra level in the village. When one does have a dispute involving an alien village, one does not get any support from any member of that village since they do not belong to the same clan. The village authority decides the case and gives judgement according to the customary law.’ <sup id="cite_ref-153" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-153">[153]</a></sup> Legal practicioners may appear before those higher courts: ‘The judicial officers (who preside over those courts) are appointed by, or with the approval of the Governor. The rules as to administration of justice do not contain specific provisions as to their tenure and salary, or as to their full time or part time character. But most of these matters will be regulated as rules or orders issued under Rule 15 of the Assam Autonomous Districts (Constitution of District Councils) Rules, 1951. It may be of interest to note that there is a specific prohibition against a member of the Executive Committee being appointed to these courts. To this extent, their independence is protected. A legal practitioner can appear before these courts. But in cases where an accused is not arrested, the legal practitioner takes the permission of the District Council Court for such appearance.’ <sup id="cite_ref-154" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-154">[154]</a></sup> It is assumed here (provisionally) that by 'legal praciticioners' advocates are meant.

<p><b> ♠ Communal buildings ♣ present ♥ </b> ‘Bachelor dormitories exist in some villages for meetings and recreation.’ <sup id="cite_ref-155" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-155">[155]</a></sup> ‘Description of the Garo houses will not be complete without a note on the Nokpantes. The word  nokpante literally means ‘a house of bachelor’ (nok-house, pante-bachelor). Almost all the Garo villages have their own nokpantes; the unmarried youth sleep together in the nokpantes at night. Nokpantes are very big houses built of bamboo, wood, thatches and cane. A nokpante is sometimes 20 feet high and 80 to 90 feet long; it is decently built on bamboo machang and its walls are also neatly woven. Almost half the length of the house is kept open while the other half is enclosed with bamboo mats of sufficiently polished works; two doors are kept, one in the front and the  other in the back side of it. The bamboo machang is six to ten feet from the ground and a ladder helps one to ascend the nokpante; along the ladder a big and unusually long cane stalk is hung from the roofs of the house and it is used as support while ascending it. The ladder is nothing but a big log of wood with steps cut on it. The nokpantes are really big village halls.’ <sup id="cite_ref-156" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-156">[156]</a></sup> ‘Carvings and paintings are also worked into the front posts of the nokpante; these are big wood posts either of sal trees or such other trees. In certain nokpantes pig heads and tusks are seen hung from the beams; these are nothing but heads and tusks of pigs killed for village or community feasts. Inside the house and on the bamboo machang or platform a rectangular hearth is constructed where fires are lit during the winter to roast porks and other meats for feasts. Feathers of fowls, horns of cattle and drums and gongs which are public property are also kept in the nokpante. Entrance of a lady into a nokpante is very strictly regulated; entrance of a lady through the front door is never allowed; certain respectable and reliable ladies are, however, allowed to enter the house through the back door to supply liquor and important informations in times of feasts only.’ <sup id="cite_ref-157" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-157">[157]</a></sup> ‘Besides being a bachelor’s house, a nokpante serves many a good purpose of the village. Village elders meet here to discuss and decide important affairs of common interest; people go there at leisure and particularly after the day’s supper and in the afternoon to make baskets, mats and fishing nets etc. The officers or other persons happening to be there from distant places are also allowed to live there temporarily. Some villages again build small separate houses with cooksheds attached to them for guests; such houses are called by the Garos  alda.’ <sup id="cite_ref-158" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-158">[158]</a></sup> Most Christianized villages abandoned the practice some decades after independence, but bachelor's houses were a common institution during the colonial period.
</p><p><b> ♠ Special purpose house ♣ present ♥ </b> The Nokma's house played a special role during festivals: ‘After this ceremony the  nokma’s house is decorated. The women of each house prepare fine rice flour and mix it with water to form a paste. In the  nokma’s house the posts and beams are first marked with finger dots of rice paste. If the men can reach the ridgepole, they decorate it with rice-flour prints of the whole palm. Afterwards the bachelors go about the village helping the men of each house to decorate it in the same way. When new, the flour looks bright and white, but as the months go by it yellows and blends with the yellow of the bamboo, though it never disappears completely, and after several years one may see several layers of this  Wangala decoration. Only a new house built within the current year is entirely without it.’ <sup id="cite_ref-159" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-159">[159]</a></sup> This was also true for the rituals conducted after head-hunting raids: ‘They went to the house of their respective mothers then and had similar enjoyments. Then from there they went to nokpanthe (bachelors’ dormitory) and had merriment there too. The women folk then boiled the heads of the dead and took them to a stream, cleared them, and the skulls were brought back home. These skulls were all put in a basket which was kept in the privy of the Nokma’s nok. All the skulls were kept in one place because they performed Marang Harikka in one house only. If skulls were kept in different places marang, i.e., evil would befall on them all.’ <sup id="cite_ref-160" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-160">[160]</a></sup> The practice was gradually abandoned during the colonial period.

Wet cultivation was expanded in the post-independence period: ‘There would appear to be somewhat less mutuality in labor exchange in areas of intensive wet rice agriculture. Not only can land be loaned to others on a sharecropping basis, but agricultural labor can sometimes be hired, especially at transplanting and harvest, when the demands of labor are particularly heavy. Labor is also sometimes hired for house-building, a practice unknown in Rengsanggri. Even when labor is given without payment, it is more often calculated and paid back in closely equivalent amounts, and less often given freely, than in the more traditional areas. In some plains areas, unlike Rengsanggri, money is also loaned at interest. Perhaps the relatively diverse origins of the people of wet rice areas makes traditional free labor exchange more difficult. One cannot so easily rely on the ancient bonds of kinship to supply the help that may be needed.’ <sup id="cite_ref-162" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-162">[162]</a></sup> ‘Hill farmers seem to have had little opposition to the clearing of some land for wet rice, even though this has meant that it could no longer be used for dry cultivation. In most villages the areas in which wet cultivation is possible are more or less limited, it never yet having occurred to a Garo that hillsides  might be terraced; and the threat of alienation of the land has not yet seemed particularly serious. Strangers, and sometimes even non-Garos, have been allowed to settle and clear new land. At the present time the laws passed by the Garo Hills District Council in an effort to encourage wet rice cultivation provide that if local villagers do not take advantage of suitable land, others will have the right to convert it to paddy fields. In some cases new settlers have probably paid the  nokma or even the  a’king owners (title-holders) a fee to permit its use and alienation. Some might interpret this as  a’wil, the fee that is traditionally paid to the  a’king owner by non-villagers who wish to use dry fields, though ordinarily  a’wil confers only a temporary right. Others might interpret it as purchase price for the land; or, finally, it might be considered a bribe, since no such purchase is recognized as legal by the government. However regarded, such a fee might help to smooth over any antagonism toward the new arrival, though in practice it appears that the villagers have often failed to appreciate the value of potential paddy land and have let it go with little or no opposition.’ <sup id="cite_ref-163" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-163">[163]</a></sup> The code reflects dry rather than wet cultivation.</dd>
<dd><b> ♠ drinking water supply systems ♣ absent ♥ </b> Villages relied on natural water sources: ‘Unlike other hill tribes, such as the Nagas and the Lushais, who build their villages high up on the slopes of hills, the Garos construct theirs in valleys or in depressions on the hillsides, close to running water. They attach great importance to pure water, and it is quite the exception for them to live at any distance from a good stream. The sites chosen for the houses are nevertheless generally steep, and the villages are rarely on flat ground.’ <sup id="cite_ref-164" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-164">[164]</a></sup> Access to rivers was an important factor when choosing a site for a new village: ‘There are different sizes of village in the Garo Hills. I have seen small villages consisting of two or three huts, practically isolated from all the advantages of a big village. On the other hand, in a big village there may be as many as fifty or more huts. The size of the big village entirely depends on the space that is available for the house building and also the facilities the inhabitants of the village may derive for cultivation and other purposes from the surroundings of the locality. The largest village, I visited, was situated on the slopes of the hills, as is the usual practice, facing long strip of valley, nearly about a mile and a half long and about half a mile broad. It is easily understandable that people living in such villages take to plough and utilise the valley for agricultural purposes. It has, therefore, the advantage of accommodating larger people than it is possible for the village which is situated on the hill slopes and which is to depend primarily on  jhum cultivation as described hereafter. Usually, an average sized village contains ten to fifteen houses. The economic factor is one of the main guiding principles regarding the expansion of a village. Availability of arrable land or hillocks for jhum cultivation, good drinking water, facilities of conveyance and also facilities of market places are some of the main factors, which the Garos consider before they fix up a place to start a new village. The common practice is to have one house for one family consisting of husband, wife, and children. Occasionally, the old mother or the mother-in-law also stays in the family.’ <sup id="cite_ref-165" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-165">[165]</a></sup></dd>

In other words, to generate surplus they needed slaves. To get slaves they had to attack the plains or neighbouring villages. To win and capture slaves they needed to be strong and alert. Obviously in a situation like this economic strength promoted the physical strength.’ <sup id="cite_ref-166" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-166">[166]</a></sup> ‘Each of the markets in the Garo Hills is held on a particular day in the seven-day week. They are staggered to allow the traders to make the rounds of several markets, staying just one  day at each before moving on. The traders are plains men, mostly Bengalis. The Rengsanggri people deal primarily with two markets. The most important is the Friday market at Rongram, which is on the road about three miles from the village; but a few villagers always attend the Saturday market which is held in Tura, another nine miles along the road to the south. More rarely one or two men from Rengsanggri visit the market which is held at Garobadha, to the west of Tura. The Rongram market has been opened only since the partition of India, following which a new road was put through to Tura to avoid the threat of disrupted communications raised by the partition. Formerly most marketing was done in Tura, but the one at Rongram is more convenient and has become one of the most important markets of the Garo Hills. It draws people from all sides-particularly from the north and east, since in those directions there are no markets for many miles, while it has competition from Tura and Garobadha in the south and west. People are already streaming into the market area by Thursday afternoon, since the Friday market really begins then. Those who come from a great distance camp for the night in the market area and cook their supper at open fires from food that they bring with them. On Friday morning they are joined by many more people from the villages closer by. Garos walk in over the footpaths that crisscross the hills, and almost everybody carries a basket hung by a tump line from his forehead. Some carry goods to sell, others need the space to carry home their purchases, and everyone brings along a few personal possessions. Traders come by truck or by bus, bringing large burlapwrapped bundles of their wares. Activity in Rongram reaches a peak early Friday morning, when as many as three thousand people may be milling around the market; by noon, people are leaving again. Many go back to their villages, but most of the traders, and a few of the Garos, move up to Tura for the market the next day.’ <sup id="cite_ref-167" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-167">[167]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b> ♠ food storage sites ♣ absent ♥ </b> According to SCCS variable 20 'Food Storage' 'Individual households', not 'Communal facilities', 'Political agent controlled repositories', or 'Economic agent controlled repositories' were present. Village granaries are built in one place, but individual granaries are owned by households rather than the community: ‘In one corner of the village, or if it is a very large one, in two or three places outside the ring of living-houses, there is always a collection of smaller huts, which, from their size and appearance, are clearly not intended for human habitation. These are the village granaries, of which each family possesses one or more. The custom of building all the granaries in one place no doubt has its origin in the fact that the grain is thus in less danger of fire than if it were stored in the living houses. In many parts of the hills the grain is protected from the inroads of rats and other vermin by laying the floors of the granaries on posts, the tops of which are carved in the shape of a mushroom, so as to give the animals the least possible foothold.  The practice of placing these granaries at a distance from other houses has, however, its drawbacks, for it is no rare thing for an elephant to come round at night, and finding unguarded houses full of his favourite food, to pull one down and help himself to the contents. In these granaries the paddy is placed in a large basket made of strips of bamboo, which takes up nearly the whole of the floor space. Bunches of Indian corn and millet are often suspended from the roof, and various roots occupy the remaining space on the floor.’ <sup id="cite_ref-168" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-168">[168]</a></sup> [I cannot imagine a "government granary".  I believe that people occasionally bought or sold a bit of unhusked rice, but not much.  People grew and ate their own rice for the most part.  Gvt. never had a hand in it.  There may have been more buying and selling in wet rice areas.  There was zero wet rice in the Rengsanggri area in the 50's.]</dd></dl>

One man only, the  nokma or ‘headman’ who acts as ceremonial leader of the village, sacrifices a chicken. Only when the sacrifice is complete can the sowing begin. [...] A bit of  rice and curry is placed by the altar, as an offering to Saljong, the god, and then the family “eat with Saljong,” squatting in the open near the offering place. People soon begin to circulate about the fields, visiting neighbors and offering drinks of rice beer back and forth. It would be considered rude not to offer a drink to anyone who passes by, and everyone rapidly waxes gay. Shortly before noon, after perhaps five hours in the fields, people make their way back to the village in a thoroughly festive mood. A few must take naps to sleep off the rice beer they have already consumed, but others visit their neighbor’s houses informally and continue drinking; the next few days are spent in celebrating the festival of  Agalmaka.’ <sup id="cite_ref-175" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-175">[175]</a></sup> But sacrificial stones were more permanent: ‘In every big Garo village there are sacrificial stones called  kosi at the entrance of the village.

The sacrificial stone is cleansed once in a year with the blood of cow, dog, fowl or any other animal. It is important that all the members of the village should participate in this activity. No outsider is allowed to enter or go out of the village at the time of this celebration. If anybody violates this, he or she can be forced to pay any amount of  dai. It may be a one-day or two-day affair depending on the size of the feasts they arrange. The  nokma of the village has all the rights and obligations in organising the feasts. The blood of the sacrificed animal is offered to the stones and while doing so all the villagers are expected to take part in the worship of their  mite. They have to pray to this  mite to keep the village safe and sound from the enemies, diseases and also wild animals. The annual celebration of the stone is called as  A’songtata. A priest in place of  nokma can officiate at this sacrifice but it is for the  nokma to provide or sanction it. No person has the right to perform  A’songtata without the sanction from the  nokma.

<dd><b> ♠ Burial site ♣ absent ♥ </b> Burial sites were non-permanent: ‘As soon as they hear the news of a death, relatives and friends collect at the house of the deceased person. Visiting groups frequently come from other villages where relatives live, and particularly from the village where a man lived before his marriage. These visiting groups are rather formally conducted. They are organized by a close relative of the dead man, and may include from half a dozen to twenty or more people. They always carry with them the ‘headman’s’ ceremonial drum, as well as two or three metal gongs, and they beat these and blow a horn as they walk single file to the other village. Such a party therefore announces its mission very clearly. The main ceremony is held in the village of the dead man. Generally at any death, except that of a small child, everybody in the village refrains from going to the fields for one day and most people take an active part in the funeral. Except for the closest kin, who are said to be too sad to help, one woman from each household of the village is expected to come to the dead person’s house carrying a contribution of cotton and rice beer, which are used in the rituals, and a bunch of feathers which are waved over the corpse but are later taken back home again. Similarly one man from each household must cut a wooden pole and contribute it to the funeral pyre. The most closely related people work around the house of the dead person, preparing the body and helping with sacrifices. The women stay around the corpse, which is kept through the day in the back of the house. They wail from time to time in a highly stylized manner. Some women are recognized as being especially skillful at wailing, but most people show little evidence of genuine grief at a funeral. The most affluent villagers invite the men to a series of drinking parties, which are supposed to cheer up the relatives. I have stumbled upon these gatherings and have been gaily welcomed and urged to drink, and would never have recognized  the occasion without being told that they were making the relatives of a dead man happy. The men who assemble with wood and who help build the pyre chat as pleasantly as at other times. In the evening some of the closest male relatives carry the body to the funeral pyre, where it is burned to the accompaniment of the beating of drums and gongs, and the ghost is sped on its way to the after-world. A few of the charred bones must be collected, wrapped in a cloth, and carried back to the house. The next day some of the closer friends and relatives of the family, but not all of the villagers, assemble in front of the dead person’s house and assist in the building of a structure into which considerable amounts of grain are poured, and on which are hung pots, baskets, gourds, and other articles useful in the spirit world. The bones are buried in a small hole beneath this structure. Usually a man who is skilled at woodwork carves a rough head on the end of a wooden pole. The pole is decorated with some of the dead man’s clothes or other characteristic objects. A rice-beer bottle or a replica of a man’s gun may be hung from it, or the face may be decorated with a mustache. This crude image of the dead person announces to visitors that someone has died and, as one man explained to me, “that they should cry.” The man who carves the post is supposed to be paid one leg of a cow which is killed. The bones are left buried for six months or so, until one of the major village ceremonies. At this time the deceased person’s family takes the opportunity to hold a post-funeral ceremony ( delangsoa), at which the structure is burned and if possible a cow is sacrificed and eaten by those friends and relatives who come to help. This ceremony ends the formal remembrance of the dead person.’ <sup id="cite_ref-177" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-177">[177]</a></sup></dd>

The houses are long and narrow, with the front door at one end, and when possible they are oriented in such a way that several of them converge on an open yard which covers the top of a small hill. The backs of the houses radiate out over the descending slopes. A single village may include several such yards, each with its cluster of houses. Chickens and pigs, dogs and cats run freely through the villages in the daytime. Cows are generally tethered and all are shut in at night as protection against wild animals.’ <sup id="cite_ref-178" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-178">[178]</a></sup> 'Pigs run freely through the village during the daytime, but are prevented from entering the fields by the fence which surrounds it.

The family was Jengnon’s, which consisted of two adult men, three adult women, and four children who probably averaged less than half an adult portion each. The dry weight of the rice they consumed was about 3¼ seers (40 seers equal one maund, and thus one seer is just slightly over two English pounds), which would come to almost ½ seer per day per adult, and probably did reach ½ seer per adult male. Plains people, who are more used to estimating consumption in standard units, frequently give ½ seer as the daily requirement of an adult male. Garos probably like to approximate this standard, but if rice is in short supply they may substitute millet for part of it. A family of this size, which is somewhat larger than average, would require about five or six seers of paddy per day (weight before husking) or perhaps fifty maunds (4000 lbs.) per year.’ <sup id="cite_ref-181" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-181">[181]</a></sup></dd>

The Rengsanggri people have a nodding acquaintance with the European calendar and are sometimes able to arrange government business according to its terms; but in describing their own agricultural cycle they more often use the Bengali calendar, though even this is imperfectly understood. They are acquainted with the names of the twelve Bengali months, though the Garo pronunciation of them might surprise a Bengali. They know that a new moon marks the beginning of a new month, and they are usually able to assign a particular agricultural task or festival to a particular month; but they do not understand how the lunar calendar is kept in step with the solar year, and they cannot usually tell the name of the present month with confidence. Beyond any formal calendar, however, they also note natural signs: they know, for instance, that when the bright red blossoms of the mandal tree burst forth the time has come to plant rice.’ <sup id="cite_ref-183" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-183">[183]</a></sup> ‘Besides technical skills, maturing Garos also acquire considerable intellectual knowledge, though it is not consciously taught. No formal instruction in arithmetic, for instance, is ever given, but Garo men can add, subtract, and do a certain amount of multiplication and division in their heads. They may not be able to read a single figure, but they must know something about calculation in order to buy and sell in the market.

The comparison is of great with small, for the Dimapur stones are of immense size, while the k˘imas are but wooden posts. Still, the resemblance certainly exists, and the fact that k˘imas are always carved to the same pattern (except when they represent a human face) tends to prove that the carving is done on some definite principle, handed down perhaps from one generation to another, the origin of which has long been lost. When we consider further the small number of the monoliths, it is not improbable that they were erected to commemorate a chief or person [Page 17] of high degree, while the ordinary person had nothing better erected in his memory than the k˘imas which are set up in every Garo village.' <sup id="cite_ref-187" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-187">[187]</a></sup> Ceremonial gifts served to 'record' obligations between families: 'Kokam is a payment given to those who slaughter a cow in honor of the deceased. Slaughtering may be done by a son, but also by a more distant relative, whether a member of the same lineage or not, and it is frequently done by the man who leads a party from another village to attend a funeral. Killing a cow brings honor both to the deceased and to the man who organizes the killing, and the occasion provides a fine meal to the friends and relatives who help. The organizer receives the kokam from the household of the dead man, and like magual this is most appropriately a brass heirloom gong, though something else may be substituted if no gongs are available. The gong is carried back to the organizer’s village, where the cow is killed and a slender wooden post erected to advertise the event. The gong thus acquired can be used for nothing other than to be returned to the original family when somebody in the acquiring family dies. At that time the original family must sacrifice a cow in return. In other words, the kokam gifts form a symbolic record of the obligations that are set up for returning the honor of killing a [Page 200] cow, and in this way households bestow honor upon one another. One man may be followed in death by several cows.' <sup id="cite_ref-188" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-188">[188]</a></sup></dd>

Research into their origin and language during the British rule confirmed their tradition though the exact place of their former home could not be located. Scholars differ on the routes they followed; Playfair holds the view that the present settlers in Garo hills came in separate batches along the river Brahmaputra. D.S. Rongmuthu, who has done research in traditional Garo literature is of the opinion that they came through Garhwal. According to some scholars their migration dates back to the Vedic period. In the course of their migration over the years they became scattered all over North-East India and Bangladesh.

Though the primary object of the bards in narrating the history, legends and myths is undeniably to entertain, the desire to inform and to create awareness, too, might be another. The literature is not merely to entertain, it is part and parcel of festival, various ceremonies, rites and rituals and important occasions. Without it, they cannot be complete, just as the various ceremonies, religious and otherwise, is incomplete without the rice beer and the Wangala without the dance. Literature, thus, in the traditional society, by which I mean the community practising traditional religion, customs and ways of life, pervades a great deal of the activities of life.

Alam claims little investment on the part of cash croppers: ‘On the other hand, almost the entire money income, received by the local people from various sources, is mainly spent for consumption purposes on various types of consumption goods of daily use brought by the outside traders in the markets. As a result, the increasing money income of the people does not lead to higher saving and investment and development of industries to satisfy the needs of various consumer goods. It is only one way drainage of resources. Thus we have a picture of a colonial type of economy operating in Garo Hills through the markets. The district supplies its valuable native products at a relatively cheaper rate to the metropolitan businessmen or industrialists either for final consumption or for use as raw materials for various industries. On the other hand, the increase in money income in the district leads to greater demand for various consumer goods manufactured by the metropolitan industries. The local people pay higher prices for these goods. The markets also help in operating such colonial type economy, first by providing an outlet for supplying primary products, secondly, by changing the consumption habits of the people. Because of exhibition of ever new items of consumption brought to the market, new and sometimes artificial demands are created. Thus the increasing marginal propensity to consume has become a potent cause of resource drainage.’ <sup id="cite_ref-209" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-209">[209]</a></sup> Momin writes about the introduction of banking schemes, but this may not apply to the colonial period: ‘Banking can play a very important role in any economic development effort. With the introduction of lead Bank scheme, bank branches have been opened in different blocks to cater to  the needs of the people and to extend banking facilities to the remote areas. This would help in tapping the idle resources in the rural sector and at the same time, provide credit facilities to the rural population. In 1986 there were as many as 34 bank branches with total deposit of Rs. 1,728 lakhs and total advances of Rs. 555 lakhs. For a small beginning it is a welcome sign.

Wealth was mostly stored in the form of valuable objects: ‘Gongs vary according to metal and workmanship, and range in price from cheap ones worth only a few rupees to elegant ones worth several hundred. Garos recognize more than a dozen kinds, measuring anywhere from perhaps a yard in diameter down to no more than a few inches, and variously made of iron, brass, or bell metal. Some of the finest gongs are decorated with engraved outlines of elephants, tigers, snakes, and other animals. No one seems to know the origin of these gongs, and the Garos consider them to have been handed down from antiquity. Most of them, including the ordinary ones that are beaten at festivals, are more or less basin-shaped and can be held by one rim and struck on the bottom. The most valuable gongs are never beaten but only displayed at the  Wangala festival. A gong worth several hundred rupees is an extremely valuable piece of property to a Garo, who can hardly hope by wage labor to earn more than two rupees in one day. Like other heirlooms they can be sold for money, and so they represent a saving which can be cashed in if the family runs into difficulties, but heirlooms are sold only at infrequent intervals and with great reluctance. Garos reckon the rise and fall of families by the number of gongs they are able to buy or are forced to sell.’ <sup id="cite_ref-211" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-211">[211]</a></sup></dd></dl>

The journey to and from may cover ten to twelve days, if not more. The district being next to Cherapunji which claims the greatest rainfall in India, has naturally a very high degree of rainfall throughout the year, particularly between April and August. The foot tracks on the hills during rains become very slippery and difficult to tread. To add to this trouble the forest undergrowths and weeds of various kinds gain luxurious growth during rains and practically cover up the entire area of foot tracks. Different types of pests also appear with the rains. Insects of various kinds and leeches are abundant in the area throughout the rainy season. It is a painful experience to live in the hills during the rains for one who is not habituated with the condition of the land. I had difficulties in pursuading the plains people to accompany me to the hills during the rainy season. Malarial fever in epidemic form appears during the rains and continues up to the autumn. Digestive and other intestinal troubles also are very common amongst the people living in the hills, particularly during this season. In one word, the Garos maintain a miserable existence in the hills during the rainy season.

The principal of these is the Asongtata ceremony. Close to the outskirts of every big village a number of stones may be noticed stuck into the ground, apparently without order or method. These are known by the name of  asong, and on them is offered the sacrifice which the Asougtata demands. The sacrifice of a goat takes place, and a month later, that of a  langur ( Entcllus monkey), or a bamboo-rat is considered necessary. The animal chosen has a rope fastened round its neck and is led by two men, one on each side of it, to every house in the village. It is taken inside each house in turn, the assembled villagers, meanwhile, beating the walls from the outside, to frighten and drive out any evil spirits which may have taken up their residence within. The round of the village having been made in this manner, the monkey or rat is led to the outskirts of the village, killed by a blow of a  duo, which disembowels it, and then crucified on bamboos set up in the ground. Round the crucified animal long, sharp bamboo stakes are placed, which form  chcvaux de frisc round about it. Those commemorate the days when such defences surrounded the villages on all sides to keep off human enemies, and they are now a symbol to ward off sickness and dangers to life from the wild animals of the forest. The  langur required for the purpose is hunted down some days before, but should it be found impossible to catch one, a brown monkey may take its place; a hulock may not be used.’ <sup id="cite_ref-236" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-236">[236]</a></sup> ‘In former days, Garo villages were of considerable size and used to contain as many as two or three hundred houses. Liability to attack by a neighbouring village made this necessary, and the danger was further guarded against by sowing the approaches with sharp-pointed bamboo stakes called  wamisi in Garo, but better known as  panjis. These presented a very formidable obstacle to an enemy, and effectually prevented a sudden attack. Nowadays, when every man is at peace with his neighbour, the necessity no longer exists for large collections of houses, and the difficulty of finding sufficient land close to big villages for the support of their inhabitants, has resulted in their being broken up into small hamlets situated perhaps as much as four or five miles apart, which, however, in most cases, retain the name of the parent village. In order to distinguish them there is added to the name of each hamlet the name of its  nokma, or headman.’ <sup id="cite_ref-237" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-237">[237]</a></sup></dd>

<p><b> ♠ Standing armies ♣ absent ♥ </b>
The British sent punitive campaigns into the hills in order to suppress resistance as well as infighting. Full administrative control was established around 1873. Most authors consider the area 'pacified' for the remainder of the colonial period. The codes refer to armed groups of A’chik villagers rather than the British colonial troops. The colonial authorities did not establish an armed corps for the A’chik: ‘Their character has undergone a remarkable change within the last seventy-five years. In the latter  half of the 19th century, the British Government tried to establish their control over the area. They had to suffer defeat on two or three occasions in the hands of the Garos although the latter were not so well equipped as the British soldiers. The tact and skill of the Garo inflicted a heavy loss on the British army which despatched a military expedition to bring the area under control. I have myself visited three such places where the Garo told me, the British military force was completely beaten. Ultimately, they were brought under control, and then the government established an administrative headquarters at Tura and appointed a Deputy Commissioner to carry on the administration of the district. Till that time, the Garos were a head hunting tribe. In the records of the district, it is mentioned that from one village alone more than two hundred human skulls were recovered. It was the custom amongst the Garos to preserve the head of the man killed by them as a trophy. More the number of skulls gathered by an individual more honoured was his place in the society. It was considered as an act of valour and won respect and prestige from the members of the society. They not only carried on organised raids on the villages in the neighbouring districts, i.e., the villages in the districts of Mymensingh, now in East Pakistan, and Goalpara in Assam to collect the human heads but also carried on such raids on enemy villages within the districts of Garo Hills. I have mentioned in connection with the death ceremony that they used to consider it necessary to kill a human being on the occasion of the cremation of the dead body. For this purpose, they used to organise raids on the villages in the plains or on an enemy village in the hills to catch hold of a man who may be brought for the purpose of sacrifice, to be performed, near the funeral pyre. The Mimang (spirit of the dead) of this sacrificed man becomes a  nokol, i.e., a servant of the Mimang of the dead person and accompanies the latter to the Mimang land at Balpakram. If a Mimang goes there without a nokol or a cow or some good presents, he is to live there as a nokol of the Mimangs who are well off there.’ <sup id="cite_ref-238" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-238">[238]</a></sup> Conflicts among the A’chik themselves were fought by village grous rather than armies: ‘In the early days, the Garos used to wage many wars. Such an occasion arose once (perhaps the first of such warfare) when people of one village living under a certain Nokma went to work for their hadang (field for cultivation) beyond their area and entered another Nokma’s jurisdiction. This was a cause of conflict, and they started fighting. There were heavy casualties on both sides. Finally, both the parties ran away to their own area.

The district being next to Cherapunji which claims the greatest rainfall in India, has naturally a very high degree of rainfall throughout the year, particularly between April and August. The foot tracks on the hills during rains become very slippery and difficult to tread. To add to this trouble the forest undergrowths and weeds of various kinds gain luxurious growth during rains and practically cover up the entire area of foot tracks. Different types of pests also appear with the rains. Insects of various kinds and leeches are abundant in the area throughout the rainy season. It is a painful experience to live in the hills during the rains for one who is not habituated with the condition of the land. I had difficulties in pursuading the plains people to accompany me to the hills during the rainy season. Malarial fever in epidemic form appears during the rains and continues up to the autumn.

During the latter half of the 19th century, the A’chik resisted British punitive campaigns, fought feuds against each other, and raided neighbouring plains peoples. ‘The hills people are more freedom loving; it was not that the Britishers could bring them under their control without resistance; in certain hills the foreigners had to fight hard battles and to take resort to ruthless killing to subjugate these brave tribes. As soon as the hills were brought under the British administration Christian Missionaries were imported into them for proselytising works. Though the Christian Missionaries preached everywhere in the world yet they found the backward areas only to be the best grounds for their proselytising activities. It is indeed universally admitted that these Missionaries have done great good to the backward people of the world but it is also apprehended that some of them helped the last differences and the suspicions between classes of people to crop up anew and widen; this is perhaps more true in Assam. This was not so much perceptible during the foreign rule when the hills, at least many parts of them, were kept as excluded areas from the plains. After independence the after-effects of the foreign rule have become more vivid; they have played their role more perfectly now than ever.’ <sup id="cite_ref-253" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-253">[253]</a></sup> ‘Their character has undergone a remarkable change within the last seventy-five years.

The latter, which were much bigger than they now are, were all protected by  chevaux de frisc of sharp pointed bamboo stakes, and the main approaches were carefully guarded.

Liability to attack by a neighbouring village made this necessary, and the danger was further guarded against by sowing the approaches with sharp-pointed bamboo stakes called  wamisi in Garo, but better known as  panjis. These presented a very formidable obstacle to an enemy, and effectually prevented a sudden attack. Nowadays, when every man is at peace with his neighbour, the necessity no longer exists for large collections of houses, and the difficulty of finding sufficient land close to big villages for the support of their inhabitants, has resulted in their being broken up into small hamlets situated perhaps as much as four or five miles apart, which, however, in most cases, retain the name of the parent village.

</p><p><b>♠ Mutilation ♣ present: 1867-1873 CE; absent: 1874-1956 CE ♥</b> ‘Hunting, raiding, beheading and attacking were the way of life for the Garo. In those days, people collected human skulls and decorated the roof of their houses with them. Head hunting was considered an act of chivalry, a symbol of higher status and social distinction. We may speculate that this practice might have originated owing to mutual suspicions, which led to attack and counter-attack. But it is clear that this was not a senseless activity because the institution of slavery was closely associated with it. During the raids the people who were caught were kept as  ‘nokkol’ (slaves). These slaves were expected to work in the fields and households of their masters. Keeping slaves was not merely a status symbol but enhanced the economy and position of their masters. Some of the prosperous families had as many as sixty slaves. More slaves meant more prosperity of their owners. As their economic status went up they engaged themselves in trade. They could not tolerate the sight of an outsider anywhere as a result of which a lot of mutual suspicion was generated. They often raided the villages in the neighbourhood, as well as in the plains (Pianazzi Fr. 1934, p. 3).’ <sup id="cite_ref-286" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-286">[286]</a></sup> ‘This collection of human skulls was once a matter of pride to them.

In the former case it was customary to lay the body on a  ganchi or funeral pyre, round which the people danced. The body was then decapitated, and the hands and feet were cut off. The latter were then taken to the outskirts of the village, and placed in holes in the ground in which  mandal trees ( Erithrina suberosa) were afterwards planted. In some cases, instead of burying the hands, they were fastened to bamboos with the fingers outspread. These bamboos were then stuck into the ground by the side of the path leading to the next village, as if to warn strangers not to approach.

It was the custom amongst the Garos to preserve the head of the man killed by them as a trophy. More the number of skulls gathered by an individual more honoured was his place in the society. It was considered as an act of valour and won respect and prestige from the members of the society. They not only carried on organised raids on the villages in the neighbouring districts, i.e., the villages in the districts of Mymensingh, now in East Pakistan, and Goalpara in Assam to collect the human heads but also carried on such raids on enemy villages within the districts of Garo Hills. I have mentioned in connection with the death ceremony that they used to consider it necessary to kill a human being on the occasion of the cremation of the dead body. For this purpose, they used to organise raids on the villages in the plains or on an enemy village in the hills to catch hold of a man who may be brought for the purpose of sacrifice, to be performed, near the funeral pyre. The Mimang (spirit of the dead) of this sacrificed man becomes a  nokol, i.e., a servant of the Mimang of the dead person and accompanies the latter to the Mimang land at Balpakram.

For some years a policy of  non-interference was followed but without the desired success; so it was decided to appoint an officer-in-charge of the hills and in 1869 a.d. the Garo Hills were formed into a separate district with Tura as its headquarters. It is said in some parts of the district even now that the British administrators had to get away with many of the influential chiefs and other men of the tribe by killing them for, they could not easily bow down to the foreigners.

<dl><dd>Note: The below rituals were imported from the Ritual Database. There may be ritual transformations that the ethnographic record does not capture. In particular, rituals associated with head-hunting and warfare may demand more consideration in future coding efforts, given the practice of raiding among the A’chik in pre-colonial times (see also below).</dd>
<dd>The following general description was extracted from the eHRAF Culture Summary for the A’chik: 'There are two faiths prevalent among the Garos: native and Christian. People who follow the traditional faith are known as Songsarek. Difference in religion has not brought any split in the population. The traditional world of the Garos includes a number of spirits who behave like human beings but have no shape. They are SALJONG, the spirit of sun and fertility; GAERA, the spirit of strength and the thunderbolt; SUSIME, the spirit of wealth. Propitiation for each is followed by the sacrifice of an animal and an offering of beer. A Christian Garo is supposed to avoid such practices. There are also ogres and biting spirits, called MITES.' <sup id="cite_ref-292" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-292">[292]</a></sup> 'A Garo religious practitioner is known as KAMAL. The word is used to mean 'specialist'; thus a midwife may be a kamal. A kamal has neither special privilege nor prestige from his service to the society.' <sup id="cite_ref-293" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-293">[293]</a></sup> 'All traditional annual festivals were connected with the different stages of shifting cultivation: AGALMAKA, MAIMUQ, RENACHUGALA, AHAIA, WANGALA, etc. Wangala is considered to be the national festival among the Garos, taking place during October-December. When a member of a family becomes Christian, he refuses to participate in Songsarek festivals.' <sup id="cite_ref-294" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-294">[294]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>The following seasonal festivals were not coded for here, but are found in the ritual database: 'The second festival, Agalmaka, was observed after the swiddens had been fired. The festival began with the nokma sacrificing a cock in his own swidden, after which the head of every household in the village would offer an egg, each in his own field. Although the sacrifice and offerings were accomplished in a single morning, the festival itself lasted for several days. On the first day the nokma sponsored a feast for his villagers. After eating and drinking, the [Page 142] people would make music, dance and sing at the nokma’s house. On the following days people would visit each other’s houses, the arrangements for food, drink, dancing and singing being the responsibility of each individual household.'<sup id="cite_ref-295" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-295">[295]</a></sup> 'Before seeds were sown in the swiddens, the Garo would observe the festival called Asiroka. On this occasion the nokma sacrificed a cock at a bamboo altar erected somewhere within the village itself. Following this sacrifice, the villagers would slaughter a cow, which they had purchased beforehand. This cow was not sacrificed to propitiate any mite, but simply killed for its flesh, which was distributed among the villagers according to the amount of money they had contributed for its purchase in the first place. After this distribution of meat, the villagers returned home to rest for the remainder of the day. The next day, each household head would sacrifice an animal (ox, pig, goat, or at least a cock, the kind of animal depending upon the household’s economic condition) in his own swidden. After the sacrifice the villagers would feast, dance and sing. But the following day was again set aside as a day of rest. After this the villagers began their planting operations.' <sup id="cite_ref-296" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-296">[296]</a></sup> 'Around June to July, when the padi was growing in the swiddens, the Garo would observe a festival called Miamua. This festival lasted only a single day and, during it, the nokma would sacrifice a pig in his own swidden and sponsor a feast for all the villagers. After the feast, which took place around noon, the people used to sing and play music. But they were forbidden on this occasion to beat drums. It was said that the beating of drums at this particular time could attract the attention of some malevolent mite, like Bang, Rakashi or Chual, who might then decide to come to the village to enjoy the sound of the drums and subsequently cause damage to the growing padi plants. And, because there were no drums to accompany them, the villagers would not dance on the occasion of Miamua either.' <sup id="cite_ref-297" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-297">[297]</a></sup> 'Before they harvested their swidden crops, the villagers would observe the festival called Rongchugala. This usually fell in August. On this occasion the nokma would offer the mite a special dish called rongchu, which is rice which has been cooked until dry and crisp. The rongchu was spread out on a banana leaf and kept in the nokma’s house. After the nokma had made this traditional offering, there would be feasting, drinking and music-making. But, for the very same reason as at the Miamua festival, there would be no drumming or dancing on this occasion.'<sup id="cite_ref-298" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-298">[298]</a></sup> 'After the harvest, in September, the Garo villagers observed the festival called Ahaia. On this occasion each household head would prepare a fish for the mite, the offering being made in the farmer’s own swidden. Then, for several days, there would be much feasting, drinking, dancing and music-making. All the households would exchange visits during the course of the Ahaia festival.'<sup id="cite_ref-299" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-299">[299]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>Prior to the colonial period, the A’chik had a tradition of head-hunting and human sacrifice (see also 'warfare' for reference). According to some sources, there was a connection between mortuary ritual and raiding/human sacrifice in pre-colonial times: ‘Hunting, raiding, beheading and attacking were the way of life for the Garo. In those days, people collected human skulls and decorated the roof of their houses with them. Head hunting was considered an act of chivalry, a symbol of higher status and social distinction. We may speculate that this practice might have originated owing to mutual suspicions, which led to attack and counter-attack.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Asongtata ceremony ♥</b> 'Asongtata ceremony. Close to the outskirts of every big village a number of stones may be noticed stuck into the ground, apparently without order or method. These are known by the name of asong, and on them is offered the sacrifice which the Asougtata demands. The sacrifice of a goat takes place, and a month later, that of a langur  (Entellus monkey), or a bamboo-rat is considered necessary. The animal chosen has a rope fastened round its neck and is led by two men, one on each side of it, to every house in the village. It is taken inside each house in turn, the assembled villagers, meanwhile, beating the walls from the outside, to frighten and drive out any evil spirits which may have taken up their residence within. The round of the village having been made in this manner, the monkey or rat is led to the outskirts of the village, killed by a blow of a duo,  which disembowels it, and then crucified on bamboos set up in the ground. Round the crucified animal long, sharp bamboo stakes are placed, which form chevaux de frise round about it. These commemorate the days when such defences surrounded the villages on all sides to keep off human enemies, and they are now a symbol to ward off sickness and dangers to life from the wild animals of the forest. The langur   required for the purpose is hunted down some days before, but should it be found impossible to catch one, a brown monkey may take its place.' <sup id="cite_ref-305" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-305">[305]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Wangala ♥</b> 'After the rice harvest has been fully gathered in, the great sacrifice and festival of the year, the Wangala  or Guréwata takes place. This is the most festive observance of the year, and combines religious sacrifice with much conviviality. The cost of the entertainment falls principally on the nokma of the village, who provides a pig to be eaten by his guests, and plenty of liquor. Among the Akawés and Chisaks of the north and north-eastern hills a curious feature of the ceremony is the manufacture of guré  or “horses” out of pieces of plantain-stem for the body, and of bamboo for the head and legs. The image of the “horse” is laid on the floor of the nokma’s  house, and the assembled guests dance and sing around it the whole night long, with the usual intervals for refreshments. Early the next morning, the “horse” is taken to the nearest river and launched on the water to find its way down stream on the current. For those who possess the necessary paraphernalia, the guré takes the shape of a horse’s head of large size, made of straw, and covered with cloth. The head is mounted on a stick, which a man holds before him in such a way that the head comes up to the level of his chest. Two straps pass over his shoulders to relieve his hands of the weight. The body of the “horse” is then built round his own body with cane and cloth. For a tail, yak’s tails are fastened in with his own hair, which, for the occasion, is allowed to hang down instead of being tied up. The performer commences to dance a shuffling step to the usual music. In front of him dances the priest, who goes through the pantomime of beckoning to the animal to come to him. The remaining guests of the nokma  form a line of dancers behind the “horse”. When the first man gets tired, another takes his place, and the dancing goes on right through the night. A pleasant part of the performance is the pelting of the guré  with eggs. Strictly speaking, this festival should last for three days and two nights. When it is over, the guré is taken to a stream and the body thrown into the water, the head being preserved for another year. The people who come to see it off, bring rice with them, and a meal by the water’s edge closes the proceedings. At the Wangala, it is the custom to mix flour with water, and for the assembled people to dip their hands into the mixture and make white hand-marks on the posts and walls of the house and on the backs of the guests.' <sup id="cite_ref-372" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-372">[372]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ traumatic birth ritual ♥</b> (Previous ritual no. 413 in Ritual Database) 'When a woman is about to be confined for the birthing, her husband vows to offer up a sacrifice of a bull, a goat, or a fowl, according to his means, if the child is safely born. The vow is fulfilled immediately after the birth, or, if the labour is of long duration, sometime after its commencement. The animal or bird is killed outside the house by the kamal, who recites a long incantation to avert the influence of evil spirits. The women who are attending the expectant mother have a like duty to perform. Rice is scattered on the floor of the house round their patient, and a chant kept up, of which the following is a translation: “Go away! go away! evil spirit; in the way of the n °ama, of the na °sa, of the banggni, and of the giljaré  do not stand watching; do not prevent it; do not wait for it; do not watch; do not lick; do not swallow; do not smack your lips; do not let your mouth water.” The names above mentioned are those of fish, and they are intended as symbols for the child which is about to enter the world. (Beginning of ritual under consideration; ritual database ritual no. 414): Should the birth be long deferred, a goat is brought into the house, and its body placed in contact with that of the woman. At the same time the kamal   takes a little water in his mouth, blows it in a fine spray over the woman, and utters the word “poinrang,” which seems to be nearly equivalent to “good luck.”' <sup id="cite_ref-569" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-569">[569]</a></sup></dd>

</p><p>Note: Prior to colonization, the A’chik were not governed by a state structure. Clans and lineages exercised social control on the village and local levels: ‘In Garo society the most important social group is the clan known as MACHONG. A machong is an exogamous matrilineal descent group wherein a Garo is automatically assigned by birth to the unilineal group of his mother. A CHATCHI (moiety) is divided into many machong. Each married couple chooses one daughter--or, if they have none, they adopt a close relative of the mother--to be heiress (NAKNA DONQIPIKA MECHIK) of the family. Her husband traditionally is selected from the lineage group of the father and is accepted as the NOKROM of the house. He resides with his wife in her parents' house. He has to take on the responsibility of looking after his parents-in-law during their old age, and his wife inherits the property.’ <sup id="cite_ref-636" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-636">[636]</a></sup> Local authority was exercised by lineage elders: ‘The authority within a lineage is exercised according to age, the older member always being allowed to direct and punish the younger members. The age differences are otherwise symbolized  in only one way-the order in which rice beer is served. When beer is first passed out at a gathering, the people should be served in order of formal seniority. A maternal uncle should be served before his nephew, and an older brother before a younger one. Even an older sister may precede a younger brother, though generally men and women do not drink together. [...] In spite of this formal deference, older people do not monopolize positions of power, and an old person cannot exercise authority outside his lineage simply because of his age. One defers to one’s lineage seniors, but not to old people in general.’ <sup id="cite_ref-637" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-637">[637]</a></sup> Village headmen acted as intermediaries in local disputes: ‘Among the Garos most disputes arise over the issues of property, inheritance, and domestic quarrels within the family. Such problems are to a large extent settled by the MAHARI (lineage) of the offended and the offender. A new situation develops when someone's cattle cause damage to another's crops. Under such situation the NOKMA (village headman) acts as an intermediary only. If he fails to settle the dispute, the matter can go to the civil court of the district council.’ <sup id="cite_ref-638" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-638">[638]</a></sup>  ‘Traditionally, the  nokma’s position was connected with the indigeneous customary rites. His temporal and ritual powers in a traditional society were linked with his position. The conversion of a  nokma to Christianity automatically led to the loss of his ritualistic role. When the  nokma’s were endowed with real temporal power, the resistance was great as  Nokmas were non-Christians. But when the  Nokma accepted Christianity,  nokmaship passed to another person who could act as a  nokma in performing rites and rituals. However, the Government still recognized the converted persons as  nokmas. This created dislocation in the traditional system, one looking after the customary right and other ritual responsibilities. As the author has tried to show that in the traditional system the two roles cannot be separated, the two roles are enmeshed into each other.’ <sup id="cite_ref-639" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-639">[639]</a></sup> Nokmas also formally held titles to land: ‘In a Garo village very little difference of status is seen. A particular clan holds right of ownership of the village homestead and shifting cultivation lands, and the title of ownership is inherited by a particular household. The head of the land-owning household is known as the  nokma, and the particular area under which he holds ownership right is known as   a’king. He also acts as the religious head of the village, and he is to perform the ceremonies for the general well-being of the village. He is called upon to settle disputes between villagers. But in all his decisions he is guided by the elders of the village. He is not entitled to any tribute from the villagers, and he has no special paraphernalia to indicate himself as the  nokma. However, in the village a rich man gets respect, because in times of need people have to seek help from him. But in a Garo village it is usually very rare to find an extremely rich man. To a Garo wealth consists of a number of brass gongs called  rang and some ornaments made of silver or some such metal. Now-a-days a gun is also regarded as the status symbol of a wealthy man.’ <sup id="cite_ref-640" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-640">[640]</a></sup> Formalization was largely absent from village councils and trials: ‘The Rules require the village court to “try all suits and cases in accordance with the customary laws of the village.” Village courts are supposed to be non-professional bodies and decide [minor, village-level] cases in an informal atmosphere without procedural technicalities and formalities.’ <sup id="cite_ref-641" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-641">[641]</a></sup> During colonial rule, supralocal executive offices were superimposed onto village- and lineage-based A’chik structures: ‘When the Britishers took over the administration of this district, one witnessed an imposition of hierarchy of new political and administrative units in the district over the traditional democratic village set-up. The British Government, being actuated with the desire to have effective control over the villages and to facilitate the collection of revenues and house tax introduced the office of  laskar with limited police, civil and criminal powers. Accordingly there was a  laskar over a circle of villages; each having jurisdiction covering ten or twelve of villages. Although, the villagers were left to settle all disputes through the  nokma and the village courts, they had right to appeal to the court of  laskars against the decisions of the village councils.’ <sup id="cite_ref-642" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-642">[642]</a></sup> ’In the same way the introduction of offices of  sardar, hill  mandal and hill  mauzadar curtailed the powers and authorities of the  nokmas and their village councils. The new offices were created for the effective administration over the Garo with  the idea of village self-government under the direct control of Deputy Commissioner at the centre.’ <sup id="cite_ref-643" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-643">[643]</a></sup> Village headmen and elders were not bureaucrats, but mediated between village self-governance and colonial authorities: ‘Many of the disputes of the Garos were decided in their village  Panchayats. When a man has some complaints against another he reports them to the Nokma or the village-head. If the nature of the complaints is simple, the Nokma in a meeting of the few leading persons of the village, decides the dispute; but if the nature of the complaints is complicated and not easy of solution the Nokma reports the matter to the Laskar. The Laskar is a very important and influential man in the Garo Hills District. The hills areas are divided into some elekas and each of such elekas is placed under a Laskar for convenient collection of the house tax as well as for deciding the disputes of small nature locally. The Laskar need not essentially be a literate man, worldly prudence is enough for the management of his eleka. In practice a Laskar wields immense influence in his eleka.’ <sup id="cite_ref-644" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-644">[644]</a></sup> The degree of professionalization differs according to administrative level, with full-time bureaucrats restricted to the higher ones. Judges employed at government courts and other top officials functioned on a higher administrative level than the native village councils and were solely dependent on the colonial or independent Indian district executive: ‘During the first few years of the British rule in Assam the district of Garo Hills was treated as a part of the Goalpara district. The whole tract was placed under a Civil Commissioner. This officer took into his hands the collection of rents claimed by the Zaminders from the Garos, and abolished the duties levied by them on the hill producers. For some years a policy of  non-interference was followed but without the desired success; so it was decided to appoint an officer-in-charge of the hills and in 1869 a.d. the Garo Hills were formed into a separate district with Tura as its headquarters. It is said in some parts of the district even now that the British administrators had to get away with many of the influential chiefs and other men of the tribe by killing them for, they could not easily bow down to the foreigners. Once this hills area was completely brouht undegr the control of the government, the Garos lived peacefully.’ <sup id="cite_ref-645" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-645">[645]</a></sup> ‘The judicial officers (who preside over those courts) are appointed by, or with the approval of the Governor. The rules as to administration of justice do not contain specific provisions as to their tenure and salary, or as to their full time or part time character. But most of these matters will be regulated as rules or orders issued under Rule 15 of the Assam Autonomous Districts (Constitution of District Councils) Rules, 1951. It may be of interest to note that there is a specific prohibition against a member of the Executive Committee being appointed to these courts. To this extent, their independence is protected. A legal practitioner can appear before these courts. But in cases where an accused is not arrested, the legal practitioner takes the permission of the District Council Court for such appearance.’ <sup id="cite_ref-646" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-646">[646]</a></sup> Positions given to native petty officials were less formalized: ‘The  loskor has several duties. He collects the house tax within his district, keeping a fixed portion of this as his own payment, and he organizes work parties to keep the roads open. His most important duty, however, is to supervise and try to settle legal disputes. The  loskor sometimes appoints one or more assistants called  sordars, to whom the District Council pays an annual stipend of 100 Rupees, together with a shirt and a pair of short pants. Saljing, who lived in Rengsanggri, was a  sordar; but not every village had one, and a  sordar does not have jurisdiction over a particular village. As a general assistant to the  loskor he may assist in collecting information about a dispute, and in petty matters a  sordar may sit as representative of the  loskor and preside at a trial. The  loskorship demands a large part of a man’s time, but a  sordar spends most of his time working in his fields like his neighbors.’ <sup id="cite_ref-647" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-647">[647]</a></sup> The material seems to indicate that native officials performed their duties on a part-time basis only. Appointed officials on the lower, less professionalized level received stipends or drew their wages from tax income. Lineage elders were appointed to colonial courts on a temporary basis, but only as advisers: ‘The District Council may, whenever it deems necessary, also nominate two or more local elders well conversant with the tribal usages and customary laws, to sit with the judicial officer of the court as a bench and may, by order, invest such bench with any of the powers conferred or conferrable by or under the rules for the trial of suits and cases based on the tribal usages and the tribal customary laws only.’ <sup id="cite_ref-648" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-648">[648]</a></sup> While village headmen were acknowledged by the British administration, the imposition of appointed officials led to a loss of political power among Nokmas: ’In the same way the introduction of offices of  sardar, hill  mandal and hill  mauzadar curtailed the powers and authorities of the  nokmas and their village councils. The new offices were created for the effective administration over the Garo with  the idea of village self-government under the direct control of Deputy Commissioner at the centre.’ <sup id="cite_ref-649" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-649">[649]</a></sup> ‘There was a move for retention of the old institution of  nokmaship which could not function with authority since the British administration had appointed the  laskars and  sardars for the smooth running of their administration from 1824 onwards. The  nokmas became only the clan chief and custodian of the clan land  a’king. The  nokma could not administer effectively as he used to do prior to the British administration in the district. The  nokmas were supposed to be well versed with their functions and duties in the villages. The British administration enforced the Rules of Administration of Justice in the Garo Hills both Civil and Police in 1937. These rules have been renewed again and again. They are in use till the present day. The head of the district administration was the Deputy Commissioner and his Assistants and it has never been changed.’ <sup id="cite_ref-650" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-650">[650]</a></sup> The result was a complex system made up of colonial administrators, native headmen, and petty officials who mediated between formal and informal forms of authority. Accordingly, some of the below variables may not be applicable to the colonial period. It may be expedient to code for the British governors rather than Nokmas in this case.

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from military ♣ absent ♥</b> Given the absence of a standing A’chik army, the village headmanship should be taken as the primary institution for ad-hoc, improvised military organization. Male villagers probably acted as war parties under the leadership of a nokma: ‘In the early days, the Garos used to wage many wars. Such an occasion arose once (perhaps the first of such warfare) when people of one village living under a certain Nokma went to work for their hadang (field for cultivation) beyond their area and entered another Nokma’s jurisdiction. This was a cause of conflict, and they started fighting. There were heavy casualties on both sides. Finally, both the parties ran away to their own area. Thus neither party gained or lost any land.’ <sup id="cite_ref-651" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-651">[651]</a></sup> We are unsure whether village headmen got involved with the colonial military. We have replicated the code from the colonial-era data sheet for the time being, but this is open to review. Given the institutional transformations of the colonial period, this variable may not be applicable, though.</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from legislative ♣ absent ♥</b> Local disputes were settled in informal village councils: ‘Among the Garos most disputes arise over the issues of property, inheritance, and domestic quarrels within the family.

Village life is so organized that few important village-wide decisions must be made, but when problems do arise people are usually willing to go along with the decisions of [Page 208] the elite. The nokma must formally designate the day for ceremonies, but before doing so he informally samples the opinions of other wealthy men. If disagreements arise about the distribution of plots for cultivation, the wealthy men can usually carry along public opinion toward some solution. I once watched villagers buying a cow for a ceremony. Every household had contributed money toward the price of the cow, but it was four or five wealthy men who put their heads together and decided whether or not to try to make the seller come down in price. These are not profound questions; but somebody must decide them, and most villagers are happy to leave them to the wealthy men. After all, they “feed” the poorer people, and their very wealth is evidence of their ability. My own judgment of the ability of the various men in the village was close to the consensus of the villagers.

Judges employed at government courts and other top officials functioned on a higher administrative level than the native village councils and were solely dependent on the colonial or independent Indian district executive: ‘During the first few years of the British rule in Assam the district of Garo Hills was treated as a part of the Goalpara district. The whole tract was placed under a Civil Commissioner. This officer took into his hands the collection of rents claimed by the Zaminders from the Garos, and abolished the duties levied by them on the hill producers. For some years a policy of  non-interference was followed but without the desired success; so it was decided to appoint an officer-in-charge of the hills and in 1869 a.d. the Garo Hills were formed into a separate district with Tura as its headquarters. It is said in some parts of the district even now that the British administrators had to get away with many of the influential chiefs and other men of the tribe by killing them for, they could not easily bow down to the foreigners. Once this hills area was completely brouht undegr the control of the government, the Garos lived peacefully.’ <sup id="cite_ref-672" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-672">[672]</a></sup> ‘The judicial officers (who preside over those courts) are appointed by, or with the approval of the Governor. The rules as to administration of justice do not contain specific provisions as to their tenure and salary, or as to their full time or part time character. But most of these matters will be regulated as rules or orders issued under Rule 15 of the Assam Autonomous Districts (Constitution of District Councils) Rules, 1951. It may be of interest to note that there is a specific prohibition against a member of the Executive Committee being appointed to these courts. To this extent, their independence is protected. A legal practitioner can appear before these courts. But in cases where an accused is not arrested, the legal practitioner takes the permission of the District Council Court for such appearance.’ <sup id="cite_ref-673" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-673">[673]</a></sup> Positions given to native petty officials were less formalized: ‘The  loskor has several duties. He collects the house tax within his district, keeping a fixed portion of this as his own payment, and he organizes work parties to keep the roads open. His most important duty, however, is to supervise and try to settle legal disputes. The  loskor sometimes appoints one or more assistants called  sordars, to whom the District Council pays an annual stipend of 100 Rupees, together with a shirt and a pair of short pants. Saljing, who lived in Rengsanggri, was a  sordar; but not every village had one, and a  sordar does not have jurisdiction over a particular village. As a general assistant to the  loskor he may assist in collecting information about a dispute, and in petty matters a  sordar may sit as representative of the  loskor and preside at a trial. The  loskorship demands a large part of a man’s time, but a  sordar spends most of his time working in his fields like his neighbors.’ <sup id="cite_ref-674" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-674">[674]</a></sup> The material seems to indicate that native officials performed their duties on a part-time basis only. Appointed officials on the lower, less professionalized level received stipends or drew their wages from tax income. Lineage elders were appointed to colonial courts on a temporary basis, but only as advisers: ‘The District Council may, whenever it deems necessary, also nominate two or more local elders well conversant with the tribal usages and customary laws, to sit with the judicial officer of the court as a bench and may, by order, invest such bench with any of the powers conferred or conferrable by or under the rules for the trial of suits and cases based on the tribal usages and the tribal customary laws only.’ <sup id="cite_ref-675" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-675">[675]</a></sup> While village headmen were acknowledged by the British administration, the imposition of appointed officials led to a loss of political power among Nokmas: ’In the same way the introduction of offices of  sardar, hill  mandal and hill  mauzadar curtailed the powers and authorities of the  nokmas and their village councils. The new offices were created for the effective administration over the Garo with  the idea of village self-government under the direct control of Deputy Commissioner at the centre.’ <sup id="cite_ref-676" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-676">[676]</a></sup> ‘There was a move for retention of the old institution of  nokmaship which could not function with authority since the British administration had appointed the  laskars and  sardars for the smooth running of their administration from 1824 onwards. The  nokmas became only the clan chief and custodian of the clan land  a’king. The  nokma could not administer effectively as he used to do prior to the British administration in the district. The  nokmas were supposed to be well versed with their functions and duties in the villages. The British administration enforced the Rules of Administration of Justice in the Garo Hills both Civil and Police in 1937. These rules have been renewed again and again. They are in use till the present day. The head of the district administration was the Deputy Commissioner and his Assistants and it has never been changed.’ <sup id="cite_ref-677" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-677">[677]</a></sup> The result was a complex system made up of colonial administrators, native headmen, and petty officials who mediated between formal and informal forms of authority. However, no judiciary emerged as a separate institution on the village level. Accordingly, we have repeated the code from the pre-colonial data sheet. This is open to review. Given the institutional transformations of the colonial period, this variable may not be applicable here. See also 'note' above for further information.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Customary mechanism ♣ present ♥</b> Clans and lineages exercised social control on the village and local levels: ‘In Garo society the most important social group is the clan known as MACHONG. A machong is an exogamous matrilineal descent group wherein a Garo is automatically assigned by birth to the unilineal group of his mother. A CHATCHI (moiety) is divided into many machong. Each married couple chooses one daughter--or, if they have none, they adopt a close relative of the mother--to be heiress (NAKNA DONQIPIKA MECHIK) of the family. Her husband traditionally is selected from the lineage group of the father and is accepted as the NOKROM of the house. He resides with his wife in her parents' house. He has to take on the responsibility of looking after his parents-in-law during their old age, and his wife inherits the property.’ <sup id="cite_ref-678" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-678">[678]</a></sup> Local authority was exercised by lineage elders: ‘The authority within a lineage is exercised according to age, the older member always being allowed to direct and punish the younger members. The age differences are otherwise symbolized  in only one way-the order in which rice beer is served. When beer is first passed out at a gathering, the people should be served in order of formal seniority. A maternal uncle should be served before his nephew, and an older brother before a younger one. Even an older sister may precede a younger brother, though generally men and women do not drink together. [...] In spite of this formal deference, older people do not monopolize positions of power, and an old person cannot exercise authority outside his lineage simply because of his age. One defers to one’s lineage seniors, but not to old people in general.’ <sup id="cite_ref-679" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-679">[679]</a></sup> Village headmen acted as intermediaries in local disputes: ‘Among the Garos most disputes arise over the issues of property, inheritance, and domestic quarrels within the family. Such problems are to a large extent settled by the MAHARI (lineage) of the offended and the offender. A new situation develops when someone's cattle cause damage to another's crops. Under such situation the NOKMA (village headman) acts as an intermediary only. If he fails to settle the dispute, the matter can go to the civil court of the district council.’ <sup id="cite_ref-680" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-680">[680]</a></sup>  ‘Traditionally, the  nokma’s position was connected with the indigeneous customary rites. His temporal and ritual powers in a traditional society were linked with his position. The conversion of a  nokma to Christianity automatically led to the loss of his ritualistic role. When the  nokma’s were endowed with real temporal power, the resistance was great as  Nokmas were non-Christians. But when the  Nokma accepted Christianity,  nokmaship passed to another person who could act as a  nokma in performing rites and rituals. However, the Government still recognized the converted persons as  nokmas. This created dislocation in the traditional system, one looking after the customary right and other ritual responsibilities. As the author has tried to show that in the traditional system the two roles cannot be separated, the two roles are enmeshed into each other.’ <sup id="cite_ref-681" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-681">[681]</a></sup> Nokmas were typically husbands of heiresses (for more information on transmission of property, see below): 'Besides objects and wealth, social status is also inherited by the heir and heiress. When an older member of a household dies, the Garos view his heir as stepping into the social position of the dead person-a woman into the position of her mother and a man into the position of his ‘uncle’ and father-in-law. The clearest symbolic expression of this is the assumption by the heir of kinship terms formerly appropriate to his father-in-law. After the old man’s death, other sons-in-law call the heir by the term which is more generally used for “father-in-law,” and are in turn called “son-in-law” by the heir. It has been pointed out that Garos also speak as if the son-in-law inherited his mother-in-law when her husband dies, since after this she is regarded as a ‘wife’ of the younger man. Moreover, the wife’s siblings call him by a term that otherwise means father’s younger brother. This terminology is analyzed more fully in Appendix C. Beyond this somewhat superficial terminological matter, the occupants of the family house are considered to be the living incumbents in the role of man and woman of that particular house. Households continue, though their members come and go. The most striking example of this is the title of nokma or ‘headman’ which, as will be explained in Chapter IX, adheres to the senior household of the village. The man who happens to be married to the heiress of that household is considered to be the ‘headman’ of the village.' <sup id="cite_ref-682" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-682">[682]</a></sup> Accordingly, Nokmas formally held titles to land: 'Perhaps the most important single characteristic of a nokma is the possession of titles to land. The land which surrounds a village is divided into numerous patches, and titles to these patches are typically distributed among a few of the richest households of the village, including those of the nokmas. A plot of land to which a man holds title is known as a’king, and a nokma who holds a title is known as an a’king nokma. Titles to a’king can be bought and sold among members of the village; [Page 226] however, at the present time sale is unusual, and land titles often stay in the same family for generations, always being inherited intact by the heir and heiress of the last title-holders. Prices in the past have varied from 25 to 75 rupees for the amount of land suitable for one family’s cultivation; on the other hand, titles even today are sometimes purchased with brass gongs instead of money.' <sup id="cite_ref-683" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-683">[683]</a></sup> 'Holding a title brings almost no direct benefit, for the titleholder has no more right to use the land than anyone else in the village. Nevertheless it confers great prestige, and titles like, heirlooms and jewelry, can be an important repository of savings. They can be converted into other forms of wealth and used to tide the household over poor years, as well as to give stability to its position of wealth in the village. Titles are considered even safer than ownership of heirlooms, since heirlooms can be stolen or destroyed. Moreover, title to some land is a necessary prerequisite for being considered a nokma, though land title alone is not enough. Four men in Rengsanggri had title to some land: Gajang, Jengnon, Nanggan, and Bano; but the first two of these held the most, and only they were considered nokmas. Bano was not a wealthy man, though the household he inherited had formerly been much wealthier. He performed no ceremonies appropriate to nokmaship, and people suggested that he might soon be forced to sell some of his land titles. Nanggan was much richer. He held title to more land than Bano, but still not as much as either Jengnon or Gajang. Nanggan did not perform the ceremonies of a nokma or possess any of the symbols of one; but the main obstacle to his being considered a nokma was that his household had such little genealogical depth. Nanggan purchased some of his title from one Rojang, who was from a family that had formerly been very wealthy, but who was gradually forced to sell some of his land to fellow villagers, and eventually moved away from Rengsanggri. Nanggan himself was an heir, but his father-in-law had been a non-heir who had married a girl from what is now Jengnon’s household and lived [Page 227] separately. In another generation or two, if Nanggan’s heir and his heir’s heir continue to maintain the wealth of the household, they will be obvious candidates for nokmaship, and may assume the symbols and obligations of the office.' <sup id="cite_ref-684" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-684">[684]</a></sup> ‘In a Garo village very little difference of status is seen. A particular clan holds right of ownership of the village homestead and shifting cultivation lands, and the title of ownership is inherited by a particular household. The head of the land-owning household is known as the  nokma, and the particular area under which he holds ownership right is known as   a’king. He also acts as the religious head of the village, and he is to perform the ceremonies for the general well-being of the village. He is called upon to settle disputes between villagers. But in all his decisions he is guided by the elders of the village. He is not entitled to any tribute from the villagers, and he has no special paraphernalia to indicate himself as the  nokma. However, in the village a rich man gets respect, because in times of need people have to seek help from him. But in a Garo village it is usually very rare to find an extremely rich man. To a Garo wealth consists of a number of brass gongs called  rang and some ornaments made of silver or some such metal. Now-a-days a gun is also regarded as the status symbol of a wealthy man.’ <sup id="cite_ref-685" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-685">[685]</a></sup>  Burling provides a general description of Nokmas and how men became village leaders: 'I have referred in a number of places to ‘headmanship,’ and it is at last possible to explain the nature, duties, and privileges of a ‘headman.’ In any village at least one man-and often two, three, or occasionally even more-is referred to by the term nokma, which is generally-though badly-translated as ‘headman.’ These nokmas wear no symbol of their position which would permit a stranger to recognize them, but any villager can name and point out the individuals in his village who rate this title.' <sup id="cite_ref-686" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-686">[686]</a></sup> 'To explain how a man becomes nokma, it is first necessary to refer once more to the lineage structure of the village. It is simplest to consider villages with a single main lineage first. Just as one household of each cooperating group is considered to be senior by virtue of the fact that all the other households have “come out” from it, one household is the most senior of the whole village, since all of the houses ultimately “came out” from it. The process may, of course, have involved many stages, but the senior household is ordinarily considered to be that of the first nokma. Normally the nokma, like any other man, looks for a ‘nephew,’ that is, a younger man from his own lineage, to come and be his son-in-law and heir. In this case, the ‘nephew’ not only becomes the heir to the house and property but also [Page 224] succeeds to the ‘headmanship’ when his father-in-law dies. Inevitably the nokmas of many villages have grown up in a different village, and belong to a different sib and to the opposite moiety from the people of the main village lineage. A nokma should, however, be a member of the same lineage and from the same village as the previous nokma, so generally a succession of ‘headmen’ are members of one village and lineage by descent but hold the status of ‘headman’ in another village by virtue of being married to the women who are successively chosen as heiress in the senior house of the village.' <sup id="cite_ref-687" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-687">[687]</a></sup> 'The ‘headmanship’ is thought of as adhering more closely to the house than to any individual person. All the symbols of office go with the house and not with the man. The most important of the symbols is a particular kind of drum so heavily endowed with supernatural power that no one else in the village dares to keep it in his house. It is not necessarily dangerous to use, for at village festivals the drum is carried from house to house and then anybody may beat it. Funeral parties will even carry it to another village if they should go to pay condolences after a death in that village, but it can only be kept permanently in the nokma’s house. The house itself is constructed with specially carved posts which are flattened on two sides instead of being left round as in all other houses; and when a house of a nokma is thatched, special little straw animals decorate the roof. Even the term nokma is etymologically related to that for ‘house’ or ‘household’-i.e. nok; while - ma is a suffix which in some contexts means ‘big’ or ‘large’; thus nokma literally means the ‘big house,’ though it is used to refer to the man of that house.' <sup id="cite_ref-688" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-688">[688]</a></sup> There could be more than one Nokma per village: 'It has already been pointed out that a single village often has more than one nokma. If so, one of them is always considered to be the “first” nokma and the others are considered to be secondary to him. The ranking of nokmas may conceivably have been encouraged by the government’s custom of recording only a single nokma’s name for certain official purposes. But while in some doubtful cases two nokmas of about equal stature may have been [Page 225] given inequality in this way, it seems more likely that the inequality of nokmas and the requirement that one be considered senior has been inherent in Garo social organization and is not simply a response to foreign rule. If two lineages are found in the same village, each always has its own nokma, the man of its senior house. Since the nokmaship is acquired by marrying into a lineage, the nokma can never belong to the lineage of which he is nokma. So in Songmagri, where there are two lineages, the first nokma is the Chambigong nokma and is himself a Manda Sangma, but like his father-in-law he comes from another village. The Manda nokma, on the other hand, is a Chambigong of the Songmagri lineage of Chambigong. Even if a nokma comes from the opposite lineage of a two-lineage village, he is nokma only because of his marriage and never simply because of his own lineage affiliation.' <sup id="cite_ref-689" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-689">[689]</a></sup> 'Even villages with only one lineage may have two or more nokmas. In Rengsanggri the second nokma is Jengnon, who is himself an Agidok from Waramgri, as were his father-in-law and his grandfather-in-law before him. He is married to the woman who is heiress in the house that is considered the second oldest in the village. Jengnon is explicitly considered a nokma, but he is unquestionably second to Gajang, the first nokma, who is himself a Manda from Songmagri. Jengnon’s house does not happen to have all the symbols of nokmaship, such as the specially carved house posts or the special drum, though in other villages more than one house is sometimes equipped with these things.' <sup id="cite_ref-690" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-690">[690]</a></sup> While village headmen were acknowledged by the British administration, the imposition of appointed officials led to a loss of political power among Nokmas: ’In the same way the introduction of offices of  sardar, hill  mandal and hill  mauzadar curtailed the powers and authorities of the  nokmas and their village councils. The new offices were created for the effective administration over the Garo with  the idea of village self-government under the direct control of Deputy Commissioner at the centre.’ <sup id="cite_ref-691" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-691">[691]</a></sup> ‘There was a move for retention of the old institution of  nokmaship which could not function with authority since the British administration had appointed the  laskars and  sardars for the smooth running of their administration from 1824 onwards. The  nokmas became only the clan chief and custodian of the clan land  a’king. The  nokma could not administer effectively as he used to do prior to the British administration in the district.

However, we have provisionally assumed that the mechanism of power transfer (i.e. headmanship being attached to senior lineages, with husbands of heiresses following their fathers-in-law) remained essentially intact.</dd>

The British Government, being actuated with the desire to have effective control over the villages and to facilitate the collection of revenues and house tax introduced the office of  laskar with limited police, civil and criminal powers. Accordingly there was a  laskar over a circle of villages; each having jurisdiction covering ten or twelve of villages.

The new offices were created for the effective administration over the Garo with  the idea of village self-government under the direct control of Deputy Commissioner at the centre.’ <sup id="cite_ref-700" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-700">[700]</a></sup> ‘When the Britishers took over the administration of this district, one witnessed an imposition of hierarchy of new political and administrative units in the district over the traditional democratic village set-up. The British Government, being actuated with the desire to have effective control over the villages and to facilitate the collection of revenues and house tax introduced the office of  laskar with limited police, civil and criminal powers. Accordingly there was a  laskar over a circle of villages; each having jurisdiction covering ten or twelve of villages. Although, the villagers were left to settle all disputes through the  nokma and the village courts, they had right to appeal to the court of  laskars against the decisions of the village councils.’ <sup id="cite_ref-701" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-701">[701]</a></sup> ‘The  laskar had his jurisdiction over many villages and was the agent of the British Administration. This system still continues at the district level. The  laskar used to bring the cases to the subordinate District Council Court from the Village Court. From the District Council Court the appeals could be preferred to the High Court at Gauhati.’ <sup id="cite_ref-702" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-702">[702]</a></sup> 'The loskor has several duties. He collects the house tax within his district, keeping a fixed portion of this as his own payment, and he organizes work parties to keep the roads open. His most important duty, however, is to supervise and try to settle legal disputes. The loskor sometimes appoints one or more assistants called sordars, to whom the District Council pays an annual stipend of 100 Rupees, together with a shirt and a pair of short pants. Saljing, who lived in Rengsanggri, was a sordar; but not every village had one, and a sordar does not have jurisdiction over a particular village. As a general assistant to the loskor he may assist in collecting information about a dispute, and in petty matters a sordar may sit as representative of the loskor and preside at a trial. The loskorship demands a large part of a man’s time, but a sordar spends most of his time working in his fields like his neighbors.' <sup id="cite_ref-703" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-703">[703]</a></sup> 'In theory it is the loskor who, as presiding officer at a meeting to settle a dispute, passes judgment upon the rights and wrongs of the argument. Often the loskor is in no position to do more than guide the consensus of opinion among the men who meet, but he does put the government’s stamp of approval on the decision. He must act well within the bounds of customary law; but if the evidence is contradictory or unusually complex, the loskor may exert considerable influence toward the settlement of the dispute in one way or another. Today the loskors are powerful men. Any decision of the loskor may be appealed to the higher courts of the district, but the procedure of appeal is lengthy and expensive, and it is certainly more convenient to settle a case at the local level if that is possible. Decisions of both the District Council court and the Deputy Commissioner’s court can be appealed to the high court of Assam, though for most Garos the procedure is prohibitively expensive.' <sup id="cite_ref-704" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-704">[704]</a></sup> 'The loskor, or whoever presides at the hearing of a case, must act within the limits of customary law since he usually has to rely upon the kinship groups of the principals in the case for enforcing his decisions. This obliges him to find a solution [Page 250] which both sides can accept. One of the most important obligations of members of a kinship group is to support each other in legal cases and to punish each other when guilty. In any serious quarrel which arises out of misbehaviour-such as divorce, theft, or false accusation-the two principals, each with their relatives, come together at a formal meeting such as that which considered Mingcheng’s behavior. This assembly constitutes the lowest Garo court, and its sessions are always described by the Garos as consisting of a meeting between two opposing groups of relatives who are seen as representing the principals. They defend and look out for the interests of their protégé if his rights have been infringed upon, and they are considered to be collectively responsible for any improper act of which he may be guilty. Specifically they are responsible for cash contributions toward the compensation that is given to redress any injury. Conversely, the relatives have the right, or even the duty, to punish him, by either a physical beating or a verbal denunciation or both. If a man behaves so badly that his relatives have to contribute their money to pay his compensation, he deserves to be punished by them. Relatives also share in any compensation that is received by an injured party, and thus gain recognition of the support which they have given. The money required for compensation is neither collected nor distributed in a systematic fashion, and sometimes after a trial in which compensation is given, different participants in a case give quite different guesses as to how much the various relatives gave or received. Garos were amused at my curiosity about these amounts, since even the closest relatives did not feel this was important enough to remember. One contributes in order to uphold his own and his family’s honor. It would be uncouth to calculate such a contribution too closely, but the contribution is the most explicit act of support that one can give to one’s kinsmen, and it certainly does a man’s reputation no harm to be known as a vigorous supporter of his relatives at trials.' <sup id="cite_ref-705" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-705">[705]</a></sup> 'The loskors have always been Garos, and their job has always been explicitly defined as the administration of customary law according to traditional practice. Even in the district courts, which have generally been presided over by non-Garos, an attempt has been made to [Page 301] apply traditional law. Old men, who were presumed to be knowledgeable in Garo tradition, have been called in to give their opinion, and in the records of cases in the District Council, references have occasionally been made to a published ethnological article on Garo law. However sincere the attempt to follow traditional laws, the imposition of neutral judicial officers, the guarantee of settlement by the district government, and the reservation of force by the government authorities, could not help but bring changes. The office of loskor appears gradually to have accumulated power, probably at the expense both of the nokmas and of the matrilineal descent groups. This does not mean that the latter are no longer significant institutions, but only that their relative importance has probably declined somewhat as that of the loskor has risen. Today the loskors and their courts, and the administration above them are so much a part of the Garo social organization that it is quite inaccurate to describe the Garos as forming anything but a dependent non-sovereign unit in a much larger society. Significant power over the Garos was for eighty years concentrated in London; with Indian independence, this power has been inherited by New Delhi.' <sup id="cite_ref-706" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-706">[706]</a></sup> 'Today the courts of the loskors are formally established under regulations passed by the District Council and approved by the governor of Assam; however, in 1956 Indian independence and the shift in jurisdiction over the loskors’ courts from the Deputy Commissioner’s office to the District Council were only beginning to have any effect on the villages in the district. Disputes were still settled in the same manner as during the period of British rule.' <sup id="cite_ref-707" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-707">[707]</a></sup> The introduction of appointed officials introduced a power shift away from elders and headmen, although they remained prominent: 'The older men in the Garo Hills proper remember the time when “speakers” played a more important role in legal disputes than they do now. Speakers are said generally to have been older ‘brothers’ ( ada) or ‘uncles’ ( mama) of the principals. To be a “speaker” is described as a skilled job, requiring intimate knowledge of the fine points of law in addition to the ability to speak well. Most people were unable to handle it. Today, older members of the kinship groups still state their opinions at trials, but with less formality than seems to have been the case formerly. Today much of the power has shifted away from kinship groups and their speakers to the ideally neutral loskors. Of course even in Mymensingh disputes can be taken to the government courts, but recourse to the courts seems to come at a later stage in the proceedings. Before the assumption of administration by the British, the only appeal from disagreement at such a meeting was presumably violence.' <sup id="cite_ref-708" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-708">[708]</a></sup> ‘There was a move for retention of the old institution of  nokmaship which could not function with authority since the British administration had appointed the  laskars and  sardars for the smooth running of their administration from 1824 onwards. The  nokmas became only the clan chief and custodian of the clan land  a’king. The  nokma could not administer effectively as he used to do prior to the British administration in the district. The  nokmas were supposed to be well versed with their functions and duties in the villages. The British administration enforced the Rules of Administration of Justice in the Garo Hills both Civil and Police in 1937. These rules have been renewed again and again. They are in use till the present day. The head of the district administration was the Deputy Commissioner and his Assistants and it has never been changed.’ <sup id="cite_ref-709" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-709">[709]</a></sup> The colonial authorities introduced formal legal codes that applied to different administrative levels: ‘The application of the Rules for the Administration of Justice vested in the village headman and  laskars with judicial authority created some formal stereotypes for the administration which affected the traditional set-up, based on unwritten customary laws. The Codes of Civil and Criminal Procedure were not applied but only the spirit of the Penal Code was followed. A villager can no longer avenge a death by killing. The sanction of tribal law does not lie in custom alone but in the principles on which their society is based. ‘ <sup id="cite_ref-710" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-710">[710]</a></sup> ‘At present, there are atleast three major sets of statutory instruments relevant to the judicial administration which are applicable in the Garo Hills District.

The rules as to administration of justice do not contain specific provisions as to their tenure and salary, or as to their full time or part time character. But most of these matters will be regulated as rules or orders issued under Rule 15 of the Assam Autonomous Districts (Constitution of District Councils) Rules, 1951. It may be of interest to note that there is a specific prohibition against a member of the Executive Committee being appointed to these courts. To this extent, their independence is protected. A legal practitioner can appear before these courts. But in cases where an accused is not arrested, the legal practitioner takes the permission of the District Council Court for such appearance.’ <sup id="cite_ref-713" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-713">[713]</a></sup> They may be assited by appointed elders: ‘The District Council may, whenever it deems necessary, also nominate two or more local elders well conversant with the tribal usages and customary laws, to sit with the judicial officer of the court as a bench and may, by order, invest such bench with any of the powers conferred or conferrable by or under the rules for the trial of suits and cases based on the tribal usages and the tribal customary laws only.’ <sup id="cite_ref-714" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-714">[714]</a></sup> The transition was violent: ‘During the first few years of the British rule in Assam the district of Garo Hills was treated as a part of the Goalpara district. The whole tract was placed under a Civil Commissioner. This officer took into his hands the collection of rents claimed by the Zaminders from the Garos, and abolished the duties levied by them on the hill producers. For some years a policy of  non-interference was followed but without the desired success; so it was decided to appoint an officer-in-charge of the hills and in 1869 a.d. the Garo Hills were formed into a separate district with Tura as its headquarters. It is said in some parts of the district even now that the British administrators had to get away with many of the influential chiefs and other men of the tribe by killing them for, they could not easily bow down to the foreigners. Once this hills area was completely brouht undegr the control of the government, the Garos lived peacefully.’ <sup id="cite_ref-715" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-715">[715]</a></sup> The result was a dual system in which local and colonial patterns of dispute resolution coexisted to an extent, given the British system of indirect rule: 'If peace was to be maintained, some method of settling disputes other than a resort to violence had to be established, and the new British administration was forced to guarantee the settlement of all legal cases, even petty ones. A dispute that could not be settled by traditional methods could not be allowed to lead to inter-village warfare. Inevitably the British government had to give some supervision to the settlement of trouble cases, and they had to provide a system of higher courts to which decisions that could not be settled at the village level could be appealed. They also, of course, had an interest in collecting taxes, and in building roads to allow for the development of the district. The solution to these needs was found in the system of loskorships with their petty courts at the lowest level, and the district courts above them to which their decisions could be appealed.' <sup id="cite_ref-716" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-716">[716]</a></sup> ‘Among the Garos most disputes arise over the issues of property, inheritance, and domestic quarrels within the family. Such problems are to a large extent settled by the MAHARI (lineage) of the offended and the offender. A new situation develops when someone's cattle cause damage to another's crops. Under such situation the NOKMA (village headman) acts as an intermediary only.

When a man has some complaints against another he reports them to the Nokma or the village-head. If the nature of the complaints is simple, the Nokma in a meeting of the few leading persons of the village, decides the dispute; but if the nature of the complaints is complicated and not easy of solution the Nokma reports the matter to the Laskar. The Laskar is a very important and influential man in the Garo Hills District. The hills areas are divided into some elekas and each of such elekas is placed under a Laskar for convenient collection of the house tax as well as for deciding the disputes of small nature locally. The Laskar need not essentially be a literate man, worldly prudence is enough for the management of his eleka. In practice a Laskar wields immense influence in his eleka.’ <sup id="cite_ref-718" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-718">[718]</a></sup> ‘The cases which are brought to the courts are serious and quite entangled ones, otherwise these could be decided amicably at the  mahari or  chra level in the village. When one does have a dispute involving an alien village, one does not get any support from any member of that village since they do not belong to the same clan. The village authority decides the case and gives judgement according to the customary law.’ <sup id="cite_ref-719" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-719">[719]</a></sup> Burling provides a short summary of the post-colonial situation: 'For almost one hundred years there has existed in Assam a political division known as the Garo Hills District. Today its relation to the State of Assam and to the Indian nation are defined by the Indian constitution. The Deputy Commissioner’s office established by the British continues as the chief local arm of the state administration, supervising state schools, roads, and [Page 244] forests. Certain legal problems, including such major crimes as murder and treason, remain under the jurisdiction of its court. In the time of British rule the Deputy Commissioner was always British; since then he has been a plains Indian, usually a member of the Indian Civil Service. The constitution, however, provided for the establishment of a new District Council, to be composed of about twenty members elected from several constituencies into which the district was divided. This council elects from among its members a “chief executive member” just as the parliament in New Delhi chooses the national prime minister. Jurisdiction of Garo customary law was transferred to the District Council, and courts were established to judge disputes covered by this law. The collection of various taxes, including the important house tax, was likewise transferred, and the District Council began to build roads, to open schools, and to administer forests. In 1956, the jurisdictional boundaries between it and the Deputy Commissioner’s office had not yet become completely clear.' <sup id="cite_ref-720" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-720">[720]</a></sup> For the purpose of coding, we have provisionally treated colonial officials as state-level administrators and native petty officials as local-level administrators.

It appears that native petty officials were not promoted to higher-level positions, but acted as intermediaries between 'traditional' and colonial systems: ’In the same way the introduction of offices of  sardar, hill  mandal and hill  mauzadar curtailed the powers and authorities of the  nokmas and their village councils.

Accordingly there was a  laskar over a circle of villages; each having jurisdiction covering ten or twelve of villages.

Saljing, who lived in Rengsanggri, was a sordar; but not every village had one, and a sordar does not have jurisdiction over a particular village. As a general assistant to the loskor he may assist in collecting information about a dispute, and in petty matters a sordar may sit as representative of the loskor and preside at a trial.

Today the loskors are powerful men.

This obliges him to find a solution [Page 250] which both sides can accept. One of the most important obligations of members of a kinship group is to support each other in legal cases and to punish each other when guilty. In any serious quarrel which arises out of misbehaviour-such as divorce, theft, or false accusation-the two principals, each with their relatives, come together at a formal meeting such as that which considered Mingcheng’s behavior. This assembly constitutes the lowest Garo court, and its sessions are always described by the Garos as consisting of a meeting between two opposing groups of relatives who are seen as representing the principals.

Specifically they are responsible for cash contributions toward the compensation that is given to redress any injury. Conversely, the relatives have the right, or even the duty, to punish him, by either a physical beating or a verbal denunciation or both. If a man behaves so badly that his relatives have to contribute their money to pay his compensation, he deserves to be punished by them. Relatives also share in any compensation that is received by an injured party, and thus gain recognition of the support which they have given. The money required for compensation is neither collected nor distributed in a systematic fashion, and sometimes after a trial in which compensation is given, different participants in a case give quite different guesses as to how much the various relatives gave or received. Garos were amused at my curiosity about these amounts, since even the closest relatives did not feel this was important enough to remember. One contributes in order to uphold his own and his family’s honor. It would be uncouth to calculate such a contribution too closely, but the contribution is the most explicit act of support that one can give to one’s kinsmen, and it certainly does a man’s reputation no harm to be known as a vigorous supporter of his relatives at trials.' <sup id="cite_ref-742" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-742">[742]</a></sup> 'The loskors have always been Garos, and their job has always been explicitly defined as the administration of customary law according to traditional practice.

Today its relation to the State of Assam and to the Indian nation are defined by the Indian constitution. The Deputy Commissioner’s office established by the British continues as the chief local arm of the state administration, supervising state schools, roads, and [Page 244] forests. Certain legal problems, including such major crimes as murder and treason, remain under the jurisdiction of its court. In the time of British rule the Deputy Commissioner was always British; since then he has been a plains Indian, usually a member of the Indian Civil Service. The constitution, however, provided for the establishment of a new District Council, to be composed of about twenty members elected from several constituencies into which the district was divided. This council elects from among its members a “chief executive member” just as the parliament in New Delhi chooses the national prime minister. Jurisdiction of Garo customary law was transferred to the District Council, and courts were established to judge disputes covered by this law. The collection of various taxes, including the important house tax, was likewise transferred, and the District Council began to build roads, to open schools, and to administer forests. In 1956, the jurisdictional boundaries between it and the Deputy Commissioner’s office had not yet become completely clear.' <sup id="cite_ref-745" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-745">[745]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Number of regional administrative units ♣ ♥</b> This is somewhat unclear and may well coincide with the number of A’chik villages, given the incorporation of native elders and headmen into the British imperial system of indirect rule and its co-optation of native forms of social control.
</p><p><b>♠ Local-level administrators ♣ present ♥</b> Clans and lineages exercised social control on the village and local levels: ‘In Garo society the most important social group is the clan known as MACHONG. A machong is an exogamous matrilineal descent group wherein a Garo is automatically assigned by birth to the unilineal group of his mother. A CHATCHI (moiety) is divided into many machong. Each married couple chooses one daughter--or, if they have none, they adopt a close relative of the mother--to be heiress (NAKNA DONQIPIKA MECHIK) of the family. Her husband traditionally is selected from the lineage group of the father and is accepted as the NOKROM of the house. He resides with his wife in her parents' house. He has to take on the responsibility of looking after his parents-in-law during their old age, and his wife inherits the property.’ <sup id="cite_ref-746" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-746">[746]</a></sup> Local authority was exercised by lineage elders: ‘The authority within a lineage is exercised according to age, the older member always being allowed to direct and punish the younger members. The age differences are otherwise symbolized  in only one way-the order in which rice beer is served. When beer is first passed out at a gathering, the people should be served in order of formal seniority. A maternal uncle should be served before his nephew, and an older brother before a younger one. Even an older sister may precede a younger brother, though generally men and women do not drink together. [...] In spite of this formal deference, older people do not monopolize positions of power, and an old person cannot exercise authority outside his lineage simply because of his age. One defers to one’s lineage seniors, but not to old people in general.’ <sup id="cite_ref-747" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-747">[747]</a></sup> Village headmen acted as intermediaries in local disputes: ‘Among the Garos most disputes arise over the issues of property, inheritance, and domestic quarrels within the family. Such problems are to a large extent settled by the MAHARI (lineage) of the offended and the offender. A new situation develops when someone's cattle cause damage to another's crops. Under such situation the NOKMA (village headman) acts as an intermediary only. If he fails to settle the dispute, the matter can go to the civil court of the district council.’ <sup id="cite_ref-748" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-748">[748]</a></sup>  ‘Traditionally, the  nokma’s position was connected with the indigeneous customary rites. His temporal and ritual powers in a traditional society were linked with his position. The conversion of a  nokma to Christianity automatically led to the loss of his ritualistic role. When the  nokma’s were endowed with real temporal power, the resistance was great as  Nokmas were non-Christians. But when the  Nokma accepted Christianity,  nokmaship passed to another person who could act as a  nokma in performing rites and rituals. However, the Government still recognized the converted persons as  nokmas. This created dislocation in the traditional system, one looking after the customary right and other ritual responsibilities. As the author has tried to show that in the traditional system the two roles cannot be separated, the two roles are enmeshed into each other.’ <sup id="cite_ref-749" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-749">[749]</a></sup> Formalization was largely absent from village councils and trials: ‘The Rules require the village court to “try all suits and cases in accordance with the customary laws of the village.” Village courts are supposed to be non-professional bodies and decide [minor, village-level] cases in an informal atmosphere without procedural technicalities and formalities.’ <sup id="cite_ref-750" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-750">[750]</a></sup> During colonial rule, supralocal executive offices were superimposed onto village- and lineage-based A’chik structures: ‘When the Britishers took over the administration of this district, one witnessed an imposition of hierarchy of new political and administrative units in the district over the traditional democratic village set-up. The British Government, being actuated with the desire to have effective control over the villages and to facilitate the collection of revenues and house tax introduced the office of  laskar with limited police, civil and criminal powers.

They established in Tura the office of Deputy Commissioner, which until the time of Indian independence was filled by a Britisher. Law courts were set up for the peaceful settlement of legal disputes, and though most of these were settled by Garo petty officials coming under the administration of the Deputy Commissioner, he himself sat as judge in the [Page 20] court of appeals. The government also undertook to build and maintain roads, to establish reserved forests, and to control trade and the markets. At first, education was left largely to the missionaries, but gradually the main responsibility for education has also been shifted to the government.' <sup id="cite_ref-752" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-752">[752]</a></sup> Appointed petty officials acted as intermediaries: ’In the same way the introduction of offices of  sardar, hill  mandal and hill  mauzadar curtailed the powers and authorities of the  nokmas and their village councils.

Disputes were still settled in the same manner as during the period of British rule.' <sup id="cite_ref-760" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-760">[760]</a></sup> The introduction of appointed officials introduced a power shift away from elders and headmen, although they remained prominent: 'The older men in the Garo Hills proper remember the time when “speakers” played a more important role in legal disputes than they do now. Speakers are said generally to have been older ‘brothers’ ( ada) or ‘uncles’ ( mama) of the principals. To be a “speaker” is described as a skilled job, requiring intimate knowledge of the fine points of law in addition to the ability to speak well. Most people were unable to handle it. Today, older members of the kinship groups still state their opinions at trials, but with less formality than seems to have been the case formerly. Today much of the power has shifted away from kinship groups and their speakers to the ideally neutral loskors. Of course even in Mymensingh disputes can be taken to the government courts, but recourse to the courts seems to come at a later stage in the proceedings. Before the assumption of administration by the British, the only appeal from disagreement at such a meeting was presumably violence.' <sup id="cite_ref-761" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-761">[761]</a></sup> ‘There was a move for retention of the old institution of  nokmaship which could not function with authority since the British administration had appointed the  laskars and  sardars for the smooth running of their administration from 1824 onwards. The  nokmas became only the clan chief and custodian of the clan land  a’king. The  nokma could not administer effectively as he used to do prior to the British administration in the district. The  nokmas were supposed to be well versed with their functions and duties in the villages. The British administration enforced the Rules of Administration of Justice in the Garo Hills both Civil and Police in 1937. These rules have been renewed again and again. They are in use till the present day. The head of the district administration was the Deputy Commissioner and his Assistants and it has never been changed.’ <sup id="cite_ref-762" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-762">[762]</a></sup> The colonial authorities introduced formal legal codes that applied to different administrative levels: ‘The application of the Rules for the Administration of Justice vested in the village headman and  laskars with judicial authority created some formal stereotypes for the administration which affected the traditional set-up, based on unwritten customary laws. The Codes of Civil and Criminal Procedure were not applied but only the spirit of the Penal Code was followed. A villager can no longer avenge a death by killing. The sanction of tribal law does not lie in custom alone but in the principles on which their society is based. ‘ <sup id="cite_ref-763" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-763">[763]</a></sup> ‘At present, there are atleast three major sets of statutory instruments relevant to the judicial administration which are applicable in the Garo Hills District. They are: (a) Rules for the Administration of Justice and Police in the Garo Hills, 1937, issued on the 29th March, 1937 to the extent to which some portions of these Rules still survive. (This is a matter of considerable obscurity), (b) Rules for the Administration of Justice in the Garo Hills Autonomous District, 1953, issued on the 18th December, 1953 and (c) The Assam High Court Order, 1954 dealing with the jurisdiction of the High Court in relation to various District Council Courts in the tribal area in question.’ <sup id="cite_ref-764" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-764">[764]</a></sup> The highest judicial authorities operated as judges on the district level: ‘The Judicial Officer appointed to preside over the District Council Court, exercises original jurisdiction to try cases and suits and exercises such powers as defined in Chapter III of the Code of the Criminal Procedure, 1898, and such other powers conferred by or under these rules, as he is invested with by the Executive Member of the District Council with the approval of the Governor for the disposal of the case and suits arising within the territorial jurisdiction of the said court.’ <sup id="cite_ref-765" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-765">[765]</a></sup> Judges employed at government courts were thus solely dependent on the colonial or independent Indian district executive: ‘The judicial officers (who preside over those courts) are appointed by, or with the approval of the Governor. The rules as to administration of justice do not contain specific provisions as to their tenure and salary, or as to their full time or part time character. But most of these matters will be regulated as rules or orders issued under Rule 15 of the Assam Autonomous Districts (Constitution of District Councils) Rules, 1951. It may be of interest to note that there is a specific prohibition against a member of the Executive Committee being appointed to these courts. To this extent, their independence is protected. A legal practitioner can appear before these courts. But in cases where an accused is not arrested, the legal practitioner takes the permission of the District Council Court for such appearance.’ <sup id="cite_ref-766" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-766">[766]</a></sup>They may be assited by appointed elders: ‘The District Council may, whenever it deems necessary, also nominate two or more local elders well conversant with the tribal usages and customary laws, to sit with the judicial officer of the court as a bench and may, by order, invest such bench with any of the powers conferred or conferrable by or under the rules for the trial of suits and cases based on the tribal usages and the tribal customary laws only.’ <sup id="cite_ref-767" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-767">[767]</a></sup> The transition was violent: ‘During the first few years of the British rule in Assam the district of Garo Hills was treated as a part of the Goalpara district. The whole tract was placed under a Civil Commissioner. This officer took into his hands the collection of rents claimed by the Zaminders from the Garos, and abolished the duties levied by them on the hill producers. For some years a policy of  non-interference was followed but without the desired success; so it was decided to appoint an officer-in-charge of the hills and in 1869 a.d. the Garo Hills were formed into a separate district with Tura as its headquarters. It is said in some parts of the district even now that the British administrators had to get away with many of the influential chiefs and other men of the tribe by killing them for, they could not easily bow down to the foreigners. Once this hills area was completely brouht undegr the control of the government, the Garos lived peacefully.’ <sup id="cite_ref-768" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-768">[768]</a></sup> The result was a dual system in which local and colonial patterns of dispute resolution coexisted to an extent, given the British system of indirect rule: 'If peace was to be maintained, some method of settling disputes other than a resort to violence had to be established, and the new British administration was forced to guarantee the settlement of all legal cases, even petty ones. A dispute that could not be settled by traditional methods could not be allowed to lead to inter-village warfare. Inevitably the British government had to give some supervision to the settlement of trouble cases, and they had to provide a system of higher courts to which decisions that could not be settled at the village level could be appealed. They also, of course, had an interest in collecting taxes, and in building roads to allow for the development of the district. The solution to these needs was found in the system of loskorships with their petty courts at the lowest level, and the district courts above them to which their decisions could be appealed.' <sup id="cite_ref-769" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-769">[769]</a></sup> ‘Among the Garos most disputes arise over the issues of property, inheritance, and domestic quarrels within the family. Such problems are to a large extent settled by the MAHARI (lineage) of the offended and the offender. A new situation develops when someone's cattle cause damage to another's crops. Under such situation the NOKMA (village headman) acts as an intermediary only. If he fails to settle the dispute, the matter can go to the civil court of the district council.’ <sup id="cite_ref-770" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-770">[770]</a></sup> ‘Many of the disputes of the Garos decided in their village  Panchayats. When a man has some complaints against another he reports them to the Nokma or the village-head. If the nature of the complaints is simple, the Nokma in a meeting of the few leading persons of the village, decides the dispute; but if the nature of the complaints is complicated and not easy of solution the Nokma reports the matter to the Laskar. The Laskar is a very important and influential man in the Garo Hills District. The hills areas are divided into some elekas and each of such elekas is placed under a Laskar for convenient collection of the house tax as well as for deciding the disputes of small nature locally. The Laskar need not essentially be a literate man, worldly prudence is enough for the management of his eleka. In practice a Laskar wields immense influence in his eleka.’ <sup id="cite_ref-771" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-771">[771]</a></sup> ‘The cases which are brought to the courts are serious and quite entangled ones, otherwise these could be decided amicably at the  mahari or  chra level in the village. When one does have a dispute involving an alien village, one does not get any support from any member of that village since they do not belong to the same clan. The village authority decides the case and gives judgement according to the customary law.’ <sup id="cite_ref-772" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-772">[772]</a></sup> Burling provides a short summary of the post-colonial situation: 'For almost one hundred years there has existed in Assam a political division known as the Garo Hills District. Today its relation to the State of Assam and to the Indian nation are defined by the Indian constitution. The Deputy Commissioner’s office established by the British continues as the chief local arm of the state administration, supervising state schools, roads, and [Page 244] forests. Certain legal problems, including such major crimes as murder and treason, remain under the jurisdiction of its court. In the time of British rule the Deputy Commissioner was always British; since then he has been a plains Indian, usually a member of the Indian Civil Service. The constitution, however, provided for the establishment of a new District Council, to be composed of about twenty members elected from several constituencies into which the district was divided. This council elects from among its members a “chief executive member” just as the parliament in New Delhi chooses the national prime minister. Jurisdiction of Garo customary law was transferred to the District Council, and courts were established to judge disputes covered by this law. The collection of various taxes, including the important house tax, was likewise transferred, and the District Council began to build roads, to open schools, and to administer forests. In 1956, the jurisdictional boundaries between it and the Deputy Commissioner’s office had not yet become completely clear.' <sup id="cite_ref-773" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-773">[773]</a></sup> For the purpose of coding, we have provisionally treated colonial officials as state-level administrators and native petty officials as local-level administrators.

The British Government, being actuated with the desire to have effective control over the villages and to facilitate the collection of revenues and house tax introduced the office of  laskar with limited police, civil and criminal powers. Accordingly there was a  laskar over a circle of villages; each having jurisdiction covering ten or twelve of villages.

They established in Tura the office of Deputy Commissioner, which until the time of Indian independence was filled by a Britisher. Law courts were set up for the peaceful settlement of legal disputes, and though most of these were settled by Garo petty officials coming under the administration of the Deputy Commissioner, he himself sat as judge in the [Page 20] court of appeals. The government also undertook to build and maintain roads, to establish reserved forests, and to control trade and the markets. At first, education was left largely to the missionaries, but gradually the main responsibility for education has also been shifted to the government.' <sup id="cite_ref-775" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-775">[775]</a></sup> Appointed petty officials acted as intermediaries between the British imperial and 'traditional' systems: ’In the same way the introduction of offices of  sardar, hill  mandal and hill  mauzadar curtailed the powers and authorities of the  nokmas and their village councils.

He collects the house tax within his district, keeping a fixed portion of this as his own payment, and he organizes work parties to keep the roads open. His most important duty, however, is to supervise and try to settle legal disputes. The loskor sometimes appoints one or more assistants called sordars, to whom the District Council pays an annual stipend of 100 Rupees, together with a shirt and a pair of short pants. Saljing, who lived in Rengsanggri, was a sordar; but not every village had one, and a sordar does not have jurisdiction over a particular village. As a general assistant to the loskor he may assist in collecting information about a dispute, and in petty matters a sordar may sit as representative of the loskor and preside at a trial.

Often the loskor is in no position to do more than guide the consensus of opinion among the men who meet, but he does put the government’s stamp of approval on the decision. He must act well within the bounds of customary law; but if the evidence is contradictory or unusually complex, the loskor may exert considerable influence toward the settlement of the dispute in one way or another. Today the loskors are powerful men. Any decision of the loskor may be appealed to the higher courts of the district, but the procedure of appeal is lengthy and expensive, and it is certainly more convenient to settle a case at the local level if that is possible. Decisions of both the District Council court and the Deputy Commissioner’s court can be appealed to the high court of Assam, though for most Garos the procedure is prohibitively expensive.' <sup id="cite_ref-780" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-780">[780]</a></sup> 'The loskor, or whoever presides at the hearing of a case, must act within the limits of customary law since he usually has to rely upon the kinship groups of the principals in the case for enforcing his decisions. This obliges him to find a solution [Page 250] which both sides can accept. One of the most important obligations of members of a kinship group is to support each other in legal cases and to punish each other when guilty. In any serious quarrel which arises out of misbehaviour-such as divorce, theft, or false accusation-the two principals, each with their relatives, come together at a formal meeting such as that which considered Mingcheng’s behavior. This assembly constitutes the lowest Garo court, and its sessions are always described by the Garos as consisting of a meeting between two opposing groups of relatives who are seen as representing the principals. They defend and look out for the interests of their protégé if his rights have been infringed upon, and they are considered to be collectively responsible for any improper act of which he may be guilty. Specifically they are responsible for cash contributions toward the compensation that is given to redress any injury. Conversely, the relatives have the right, or even the duty, to punish him, by either a physical beating or a verbal denunciation or both. If a man behaves so badly that his relatives have to contribute their money to pay his compensation, he deserves to be punished by them. Relatives also share in any compensation that is received by an injured party, and thus gain recognition of the support which they have given. The money required for compensation is neither collected nor distributed in a systematic fashion, and sometimes after a trial in which compensation is given, different participants in a case give quite different guesses as to how much the various relatives gave or received. Garos were amused at my curiosity about these amounts, since even the closest relatives did not feel this was important enough to remember. One contributes in order to uphold his own and his family’s honor. It would be uncouth to calculate such a contribution too closely, but the contribution is the most explicit act of support that one can give to one’s kinsmen, and it certainly does a man’s reputation no harm to be known as a vigorous supporter of his relatives at trials.' <sup id="cite_ref-781" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-781">[781]</a></sup> 'The loskors have always been Garos, and their job has always been explicitly defined as the administration of customary law according to traditional practice.

Old men, who were presumed to be knowledgeable in Garo tradition, have been called in to give their opinion, and in the records of cases in the District Council, references have occasionally been made to a published ethnological article on Garo law.

The office of loskor appears gradually to have accumulated power, probably at the expense both of the nokmas and of the matrilineal descent groups. This does not mean that the latter are no longer significant institutions, but only that their relative importance has probably declined somewhat as that of the loskor has risen. Today the loskors and their courts, and the administration above them are so much a part of the Garo social organization that it is quite inaccurate to describe the Garos as forming anything but a dependent non-sovereign unit in a much larger society.

Disputes were still settled in the same manner as during the period of British rule.' <sup id="cite_ref-783" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-783">[783]</a></sup> The introduction of appointed officials introduced a power shift away from elders and headmen, although they remained prominent: 'The older men in the Garo Hills proper remember the time when “speakers” played a more important role in legal disputes than they do now. Speakers are said generally to have been older ‘brothers’ ( ada) or ‘uncles’ ( mama) of the principals. To be a “speaker” is described as a skilled job, requiring intimate knowledge of the fine points of law in addition to the ability to speak well. Most people were unable to handle it. Today, older members of the kinship groups still state their opinions at trials, but with less formality than seems to have been the case formerly. Today much of the power has shifted away from kinship groups and their speakers to the ideally neutral loskors. Of course even in Mymensingh disputes can be taken to the government courts, but recourse to the courts seems to come at a later stage in the proceedings. Before the assumption of administration by the British, the only appeal from disagreement at such a meeting was presumably violence.' <sup id="cite_ref-784" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-784">[784]</a></sup> ‘There was a move for retention of the old institution of  nokmaship which could not function with authority since the British administration had appointed the  laskars and  sardars for the smooth running of their administration from 1824 onwards. The  nokmas became only the clan chief and custodian of the clan land  a’king. The  nokma could not administer effectively as he used to do prior to the British administration in the district. The  nokmas were supposed to be well versed with their functions and duties in the villages. The British administration enforced the Rules of Administration of Justice in the Garo Hills both Civil and Police in 1937. These rules have been renewed again and again. They are in use till the present day. The head of the district administration was the Deputy Commissioner and his Assistants and it has never been changed.’ <sup id="cite_ref-785" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-785">[785]</a></sup> The combination of oversight by colonial authorities with much agency 'on the ground' for native petty officials seems to indicate a form of indirect control in accordance with the Britih imperial system of indirect rule.

Since the period of British rule the government has attempted to record land titles at the district headquarters, but the distribution of the titles is extremely complex in practice and the records have tended to imply a simplified system of rights. Moreover, writing them down introduces into the system an inflexibility which is not found in the actual feelings of Garos about their rules. For each village or village cluster the district government recognizes a single nokma who is regarded as having title to the land of those villages. Sketch maps record the village boundaries, and the government confirms inheritance of the title by the nokma’s heir. It is also recognized that titles can be sold, though the courts seem to have been quite consistent in demanding general agreement among the villagers before a sale of land is recognized. That is, though he holds title, no nokma has been able to sell land to another village without permission. There are occasional legal disputes over the nokmaship, which are seen primarily as disputes over title to the village land. If the choice of the nokma’s heir proceeds according to the normal rule, then there can be no question about legitimacy; but complicating [Page 268] factors can arise. In one village the nokma’s first wife died, and he was given a replacement. Many years later the nokma died, and a dispute arose as to whether the replacement wife or the only daughter of the first wife should be entitled to the land. The rules for inheritance of personal property are not entirely clear in such a case, and disposition depends upon the decision of the family as to the next heiress. This particular case was decided by the district court on the reasonable basis that the land title was not entirely personal property but that the villagers had a voice in choosing the title-holder. The court concluded that the villagers preferred the replacement wife to the daughter.' <sup id="cite_ref-804" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-804">[804]</a></sup> 'These rather complex disputes over inheritance are unusual. More often, the nokmaship passes without ambiguity to a man’s heir. Similar ambiguities could arise over inheritance of personal property, but where traditional shifting agriculture is practiced this is simply not valuable enough to make a dispute worthwhile, and families are able to make amicable settlements without going to court. Only the nokmaship and land titles are really worth quarreling over.' <sup id="cite_ref-805" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-805">[805]</a></sup> The matrilineal kin groups of accuser and accused played key roles in the negotiation and resolution of disputes: 'The greatest responsibility is held by the closely related [Page 251] members of the lineages of the principals to a dispute, but the precise range of relatives is ill-defined and varies from case to case. More people will assemble to deal with a serious case than with a petty one. Relatives who live near by, and especially those living in the village of the principals, are more likely to assemble than those from elsewhere. Finally, while lineage mates are more likely to assemble than others, close relatives of other lineages also join them. A father will be considered on the side of his son, for instance, even though he is not his lineage mate. A father may even contribute to the compensation his son pays, or share in what he receives, though a father never takes part in beating or publicly denouncing his son.' <sup id="cite_ref-806" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-806">[806]</a></sup> 'The group that supports a disputant might be briefly characterized as a matrilineally skewed kindred, since all relatives can take part, but those related to one in the matrilineal direction are more likely to do so than others. The degree of relationship out to which kinsmen feel responsibility is in no way fixed, but depends upon the seriousness of the case and upon the availability or absence of other more closely related kinsmen who might more appropriately take charge. Since the lineages never split up in a precise manner, no boundaries can neatly distinguish those responsible from those who are not. Responsibility simply grows weaker as one becomes less closely related.' <sup id="cite_ref-807" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-807">[807]</a></sup> 'Criminal law as such does not exist for the Garos, since a suit is always brought by a private party, even though a government official supervises the court. But while all trials are seen as disputes between two opposing kinship groups, people at most ordinary trials do not obstinately back up their own relative and refuse to consider the opposite side. Quite the reverse is in fact the case. When it is evident that one’s own relative is at fault, one does not try to minimize this fact; rather, by arranging compensation with dispatch and by vigorously punishing the culprit, one demonstrates to the other side and to the public at large that here is a group of men who know their responsibilities and are willing to live up to them. The actual tenor of [Page 252] the trials I attended was a firm intention to reach a consensus as to what action should be taken. There were well-defined procedures to be followed, and usually there was little question of fixing guilt since people knew each other’s characters so intimately. Most cases could be disposed of by arranging compensation, which was set according to reasonably fixed standards. Members of the two “opposing” sides show no animosity toward each other, and never exhibit an unreasonable disposition to back up a relative at the expense of their reputation as reasonable and law-abiding citizens.' <sup id="cite_ref-808" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-808">[808]</a></sup> 'Garos today often say that adjudication of disputes was formerly the nokma’s job, but it seems reasonable to suggest that disputes were more frequently settled by negotiation between kinship groups, with a less significant part played by any neutral party, and this seems to be implied by Hamilton, who mentions “headmen of families” and “wise men” in addition to the “chiefs” themselves. In most of the Garo area today, only the most petty cases are decided without the presence of a neutral representative of the government. Chondu told me of a time when he and some of his relatives met in order to settle a dispute which had arisen when some children had stolen a few eggs. They met without any governmental representative, but Chondu described the meeting in exactly the same terms used to describe court cases, and the relatives collected money for a compensation, just as they do in more serious matters.' <sup id="cite_ref-809" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-809">[809]</a></sup> Prior to enforcement of colonial regulations, disputes were often decided by oath and ordeal: ‘Since the annexation of the Garo Hills by the British Government, a body of men called  laskars has been formed, who act as a kind of rural police and also as honorary magistrates. They are empowered to deal with all minor matters and settle unimportant disputes. They do this by calling together meetings of villagers, in which they sit as presidents and give final decisions. Their powers do not exceed those of inflicting fines and awarding compensation to injured parties. This is but an adaptation of the ancient usages of the people, for in former times, the village met in conference to decide any matter in dispute between its members. When in these meetings evidence could not be adduced, recourse was, and is yet had to trial by ordeal. This is of two kinds, the  s˘il-s[unknown]o °a, or ordeal of hot iron, and the  ch[unknown]okéla-s[unknown]o °a, or ordeal of boiling water.’ <sup id="cite_ref-810" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-810">[810]</a></sup> 'One type of ordeal required the two opponents to dive under water, the last to come up thereby demonstrating his veracity. In another, boiling water was poured over the arm of the accused person; if it burned him, he was shown to be guilty. Other procedures had the same purpose, though they did not involve tests of personal strength. A favorite method was to heat a carefully measured amount of water with a carefully measured amount of wood. If the water boiled over, the accused man was shown to be indeed guilty. At other times, a chicken was tied outside at night. If it survived the night without being taken by a wild animal, the accused was shown to be innocent. In every case, the result was to show clearly that one person or [Page 254] the other was in the wrong. Most people accepted the outcome, compensations were paid, and the cases were settled. I was told of many cases in which even the man shown to be guilty admitted his guilt after the outcome of an ordeal. Sometimes a man would continue to protest his innocence, but it did him little good since even his relatives were by that time convinced that he was lying. In any case a compensation would have to be paid, and the dispute should then be at an end.' <sup id="cite_ref-811" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-811">[811]</a></sup> ‘The Garo system of trial of cases beings with earth-taking. The complainant and the accused both swear by taking a lump of soil in their hands in front of the gathering with a promise that they will state the truth and nothing but the truth. It is believed by some Garos that this is the origin of the word “A’chik”, others believed that they have been called the A’chiks as they inhabited the high undulating land.’ <sup id="cite_ref-812" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-812">[812]</a></sup> Due to the influence of missionaries, ordeals were abandoned in the colonial and post-colonial periods: 'In this skeptical age, the teaching of missionaries and indirect exposure to new ideas from the rest of the world have destroyed the former faith in the reliability of these ordeals, and a new difficulty has arisen in the settlement of disputes. Today, when evidence is insufficient the case must simply be dismissed. This brings Garo practice into line with the Western belief that no man should be punished unless the evidence against him leaves no reasonable doubt of his guilt, but it also leaves cases dangling without final settlement. People may continue to believe in a person’s guilt but have no way of winding up an argument. While I was in Rengsanggri, a prominent member of the village was accused by his wife of having committed adultery with another woman of the village. They both denied it, and the case was eventually dismissed for lack of evidence. Villagers with whom I talked were privately convinced that the accusation was justified. In earlier years they probably could have extracted compensation from the accused man and his relatives, or at least they would have been able to test him by an ordeal. Today, evidence is presented more formally than before, and the intimate knowledge villagers have of one another is less likely to be taken into account in reaching a decision. Since ordeals are no longer possible, denial of guilt has become more attractive. In this case charging adultery, since it ended without a decision, hard feelings were created which were never mollified; and some villagers predicted that these people would continue their adulterous relationship at every opportunity.' <sup id="cite_ref-813" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-813">[813]</a></sup> Upon the resolution of a dispute, the party found to be in the wrong was obligated to pay compensation to the other party. In the colonial period, these payments were monetized: 'Ideally, and usually in practice as well, the compensation should end the dispute and clear the air. To pay compensation is to acknowledge guilt formally, and grant satisfaction to the other side. Afterward everyone should return to normal life, and not nurse injured feelings. The explicit purpose of the trial is to pacify people, to soothe their damaged reputations, or to compensate them for any loss. Every effort is made to find a solution which will be accepted so firmly by all sides that bickering will be avoided. Of course, not everyone is always satisfied. People sometimes feel that justice has miscarried and go away from a trial discontented; but ideally this should not happen, and usually there is enough agreement so that a man who feels unfairly treated will have little sympathy from his relatives and little choice but to accept the public consensus. Garo law has little in the way of moral overtone. Unlawful acts are felt to be wrong because they hurt some particular person, not because they violate an abstract moral precept. The injured party has legal means of redressing such an action, and Garos are more apt to cite the danger of legal action than abstract principles when explaining why some behavior must not be indulged in.' <sup id="cite_ref-814" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-814">[814]</a></sup> Feuding was common in the pre-colonial period: '“The chiefs known as nokmas and the head men of families assemble in a council called jingma changga [which in modern Garo simply means “to assemble in a crowd”] and endeavor to reconcile all those of the clan who have disputes; for it would not appear that they have a right to inflict any punishment unless a man should be detected in uttering a falsehood before them, in which case he would be put to instant death, more from popular indignation than from a regular progress of justice. Dishonesty or stealing seem rarely to be practiced, and almost the only source of dispute seems to be murder, which would appear to be an ordinary crime. But the relations of the person killed are, by custom, held bound to demand blood for blood, and ought to put to death either the murderer or one of his kindred, or at least one of his slaves. The other family then is bound to pursue a similar mode of retaliation, and the feud would thus continue endless, unless the council interfered and brought about a mutual reconciliation, which it is usually able to effectuate, by inducing the parties to accept a price for the blood that has been split. Although every head of a family has an equal right to sit in their assemblies, the influence of the chiefs, or of one or two wise men usually decides everything.' <sup id="cite_ref-815" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-815">[815]</a></sup> However, feuding was suppressed by the colonial authorities. During colonial rule, supralocal executive offices were superimposed onto village- and lineage-based A’chik structures: ‘When the Britishers took over the administration of this district, one witnessed an imposition of hierarchy of new political and administrative units in the district over the traditional democratic village set-up. The British Government, being actuated with the desire to have effective control over the villages and to facilitate the collection of revenues and house tax introduced the office of  laskar with limited police, civil and criminal powers. Accordingly there was a  laskar over a circle of villages; each having jurisdiction covering ten or twelve of villages. Although, the villagers were left to settle all disputes through the  nokma and the village courts, they had right to appeal to the court of  laskars against the decisions of the village councils.’ <sup id="cite_ref-816" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-816">[816]</a></sup> 'The British reserved the use of force to themselves and their officials. They established in Tura the office of Deputy Commissioner, which until the time of Indian independence was filled by a Britisher. Law courts were set up for the peaceful settlement of legal disputes, and though most of these were settled by Garo petty officials coming under the administration of the Deputy Commissioner, he himself sat as judge in the [Page 20] court of appeals. The government also undertook to build and maintain roads, to establish reserved forests, and to control trade and the markets. At first, education was left largely to the missionaries, but gradually the main responsibility for education has also been shifted to the government.' <sup id="cite_ref-817" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-817">[817]</a></sup> Appointed petty officials acted as intermediaries: ’In the same way the introduction of offices of  sardar, hill  mandal and hill  mauzadar curtailed the powers and authorities of the  nokmas and their village councils. The new offices were created for the effective administration over the Garo with  the idea of village self-government under the direct control of Deputy Commissioner at the centre.’ <sup id="cite_ref-818" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-818">[818]</a></sup> ‘When the Britishers took over the administration of this district, one witnessed an imposition of hierarchy of new political and administrative units in the district over the traditional democratic village set-up.

This system still continues at the district level. The  laskar used to bring the cases to the subordinate District Council Court from the Village Court. From the District Council Court the appeals could be preferred to the High Court at Gauhati.’ <sup id="cite_ref-820" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-820">[820]</a></sup> 'The loskor has several duties. He collects the house tax within his district, keeping a fixed portion of this as his own payment, and he organizes work parties to keep the roads open. His most important duty, however, is to supervise and try to settle legal disputes. The loskor sometimes appoints one or more assistants called sordars, to whom the District Council pays an annual stipend of 100 Rupees, together with a shirt and a pair of short pants. Saljing, who lived in Rengsanggri, was a sordar; but not every village had one, and a sordar does not have jurisdiction over a particular village. As a general assistant to the loskor he may assist in collecting information about a dispute, and in petty matters a sordar may sit as representative of the loskor and preside at a trial. The loskorship demands a large part of a man’s time, but a sordar spends most of his time working in his fields like his neighbors.' <sup id="cite_ref-821" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-821">[821]</a></sup> 'In theory it is the loskor who, as presiding officer at a meeting to settle a dispute, passes judgment upon the rights and wrongs of the argument. Often the loskor is in no position to do more than guide the consensus of opinion among the men who meet, but he does put the government’s stamp of approval on the decision. He must act well within the bounds of customary law; but if the evidence is contradictory or unusually complex, the loskor may exert considerable influence toward the settlement of the dispute in one way or another. Today the loskors are powerful men. Any decision of the loskor may be appealed to the higher courts of the district, but the procedure of appeal is lengthy and expensive, and it is certainly more convenient to settle a case at the local level if that is possible. Decisions of both the District Council court and the Deputy Commissioner’s court can be appealed to the high court of Assam, though for most Garos the procedure is prohibitively expensive.' <sup id="cite_ref-822" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-822">[822]</a></sup> 'The loskor, or whoever presides at the hearing of a case, must act within the limits of customary law since he usually has to rely upon the kinship groups of the principals in the case for enforcing his decisions. This obliges him to find a solution [Page 250] which both sides can accept. One of the most important obligations of members of a kinship group is to support each other in legal cases and to punish each other when guilty. In any serious quarrel which arises out of misbehaviour-such as divorce, theft, or false accusation-the two principals, each with their relatives, come together at a formal meeting such as that which considered Mingcheng’s behavior. This assembly constitutes the lowest Garo court, and its sessions are always described by the Garos as consisting of a meeting between two opposing groups of relatives who are seen as representing the principals. They defend and look out for the interests of their protégé if his rights have been infringed upon, and they are considered to be collectively responsible for any improper act of which he may be guilty. Specifically they are responsible for cash contributions toward the compensation that is given to redress any injury. Conversely, the relatives have the right, or even the duty, to punish him, by either a physical beating or a verbal denunciation or both. If a man behaves so badly that his relatives have to contribute their money to pay his compensation, he deserves to be punished by them. Relatives also share in any compensation that is received by an injured party, and thus gain recognition of the support which they have given. The money required for compensation is neither collected nor distributed in a systematic fashion, and sometimes after a trial in which compensation is given, different participants in a case give quite different guesses as to how much the various relatives gave or received. Garos were amused at my curiosity about these amounts, since even the closest relatives did not feel this was important enough to remember. One contributes in order to uphold his own and his family’s honor. It would be uncouth to calculate such a contribution too closely, but the contribution is the most explicit act of support that one can give to one’s kinsmen, and it certainly does a man’s reputation no harm to be known as a vigorous supporter of his relatives at trials.' <sup id="cite_ref-823" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-823">[823]</a></sup> 'The loskors have always been Garos, and their job has always been explicitly defined as the administration of customary law according to traditional practice. Even in the district courts, which have generally been presided over by non-Garos, an attempt has been made to [Page 301] apply traditional law. Old men, who were presumed to be knowledgeable in Garo tradition, have been called in to give their opinion, and in the records of cases in the District Council, references have occasionally been made to a published ethnological article on Garo law. However sincere the attempt to follow traditional laws, the imposition of neutral judicial officers, the guarantee of settlement by the district government, and the reservation of force by the government authorities, could not help but bring changes. The office of loskor appears gradually to have accumulated power, probably at the expense both of the nokmas and of the matrilineal descent groups. This does not mean that the latter are no longer significant institutions, but only that their relative importance has probably declined somewhat as that of the loskor has risen. Today the loskors and their courts, and the administration above them are so much a part of the Garo social organization that it is quite inaccurate to describe the Garos as forming anything but a dependent non-sovereign unit in a much larger society. Significant power over the Garos was for eighty years concentrated in London; with Indian independence, this power has been inherited by New Delhi.' <sup id="cite_ref-824" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-824">[824]</a></sup> 'Today the courts of the loskors are formally established under regulations passed by the District Council and approved by the governor of Assam; however, in 1956 Indian independence and the shift in jurisdiction over the loskors’ courts from the Deputy Commissioner’s office to the District Council were only beginning to have any effect on the villages in the district. Disputes were still settled in the same manner as during the period of British rule.' <sup id="cite_ref-825" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-825">[825]</a></sup> The introduction of appointed officials introduced a power shift away from elders and headmen, although they remained prominent: 'The older men in the Garo Hills proper remember the time when “speakers” played a more important role in legal disputes than they do now. Speakers are said generally to have been older ‘brothers’ ( ada) or ‘uncles’ ( mama) of the principals. To be a “speaker” is described as a skilled job, requiring intimate knowledge of the fine points of law in addition to the ability to speak well. Most people were unable to handle it. Today, older members of the kinship groups still state their opinions at trials, but with less formality than seems to have been the case formerly. Today much of the power has shifted away from kinship groups and their speakers to the ideally neutral loskors. Of course even in Mymensingh disputes can be taken to the government courts, but recourse to the courts seems to come at a later stage in the proceedings. Before the assumption of administration by the British, the only appeal from disagreement at such a meeting was presumably violence.' <sup id="cite_ref-826" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-826">[826]</a></sup> The colonial authorities introduced formal legal codes that applied to different administrative levels: ‘The application of the Rules for the Administration of Justice vested in the village headman and  laskars with judicial authority created some formal stereotypes for the administration which affected the traditional set-up, based on unwritten customary laws. The Codes of Civil and Criminal Procedure were not applied but only the spirit of the Penal Code was followed. A villager can no longer avenge a death by killing. The sanction of tribal law does not lie in custom alone but in the principles on which their society is based. ‘ <sup id="cite_ref-827" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-827">[827]</a></sup> ‘At present, there are atleast three major sets of statutory instruments relevant to the judicial administration which are applicable in the Garo Hills District. They are: (a) Rules for the Administration of Justice and Police in the Garo Hills, 1937, issued on the 29th March, 1937 to the extent to which some portions of these Rules still survive. (This is a matter of considerable obscurity), (b) Rules for the Administration of Justice in the Garo Hills Autonomous District, 1953, issued on the 18th December, 1953 and (c) The Assam High Court Order, 1954 dealing with the jurisdiction of the High Court in relation to various District Council Courts in the tribal area in question.’ <sup id="cite_ref-828" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-828">[828]</a></sup> The highest judicial authorities operated as judges on the district level: ‘The Judicial Officer appointed to preside over the District Council Court, exercises original jurisdiction to try cases and suits and exercises such powers as defined in Chapter III of the Code of the Criminal Procedure, 1898, and such other powers conferred by or under these rules, as he is invested with by the Executive Member of the District Council with the approval of the Governor for the disposal of the case and suits arising within the territorial jurisdiction of the said court.’ <sup id="cite_ref-829" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-829">[829]</a></sup> They may be assited by appointed elders: ‘The District Council may, whenever it deems necessary, also nominate two or more local elders well conversant with the tribal usages and customary laws, to sit with the judicial officer of the court as a bench and may, by order, invest such bench with any of the powers conferred or conferrable by or under the rules for the trial of suits and cases based on the tribal usages and the tribal customary laws only.’ <sup id="cite_ref-830" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-830">[830]</a></sup> The result was a dual system in which local and colonial patterns of dispute resolution coexisted to an extent, given the British system of indirect rule: 'If peace was to be maintained, some method of settling disputes other than a resort to violence had to be established, and the new British administration was forced to guarantee the settlement of all legal cases, even petty ones. A dispute that could not be settled by traditional methods could not be allowed to lead to inter-village warfare. Inevitably the British government had to give some supervision to the settlement of trouble cases, and they had to provide a system of higher courts to which decisions that could not be settled at the village level could be appealed. They also, of course, had an interest in collecting taxes, and in building roads to allow for the development of the district. The solution to these needs was found in the system of loskorships with their petty courts at the lowest level, and the district courts above them to which their decisions could be appealed.' <sup id="cite_ref-831" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-831">[831]</a></sup> ‘Among the Garos most disputes arise over the issues of property, inheritance, and domestic quarrels within the family. Such problems are to a large extent settled by the MAHARI (lineage) of the offended and the offender. A new situation develops when someone's cattle cause damage to another's crops. Under such situation the NOKMA (village headman) acts as an intermediary only. If he fails to settle the dispute, the matter can go to the civil court of the district council.’ <sup id="cite_ref-832" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-832">[832]</a></sup> ‘Many of the disputes of the Garos decided in their village  Panchayats. When a man has some complaints against another he reports them to the Nokma or the village-head. If the nature of the complaints is simple, the Nokma in a meeting of the few leading persons of the village, decides the dispute; but if the nature of the complaints is complicated and not easy of solution the Nokma reports the matter to the Laskar. The Laskar is a very important and influential man in the Garo Hills District. The hills areas are divided into some elekas and each of such elekas is placed under a Laskar for convenient collection of the house tax as well as for deciding the disputes of small nature locally. The Laskar need not essentially be a literate man, worldly prudence is enough for the management of his eleka. In practice a Laskar wields immense influence in his eleka.’ <sup id="cite_ref-833" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-833">[833]</a></sup> ‘The cases which are brought to the courts are serious and quite entangled ones, otherwise these could be decided amicably at the  mahari or  chra level in the village.

The village authority decides the case and gives judgement according to the customary law.’ <sup id="cite_ref-834" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-834">[834]</a></sup> Burling provides a short summary of the post-colonial situation: 'For almost one hundred years there has existed in Assam a political division known as the Garo Hills District. Today its relation to the State of Assam and to the Indian nation are defined by the Indian constitution. The Deputy Commissioner’s office established by the British continues as the chief local arm of the state administration, supervising state schools, roads, and [Page 244] forests. Certain legal problems, including such major crimes as murder and treason, remain under the jurisdiction of its court. In the time of British rule the Deputy Commissioner was always British; since then he has been a plains Indian, usually a member of the Indian Civil Service. The constitution, however, provided for the establishment of a new District Council, to be composed of about twenty members elected from several constituencies into which the district was divided. This council elects from among its members a “chief executive member” just as the parliament in New Delhi chooses the national prime minister. Jurisdiction of Garo customary law was transferred to the District Council, and courts were established to judge disputes covered by this law. The collection of various taxes, including the important house tax, was likewise transferred, and the District Council began to build roads, to open schools, and to administer forests. In 1956, the jurisdictional boundaries between it and the Deputy Commissioner’s office had not yet become completely clear.' <sup id="cite_ref-835" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-835">[835]</a></sup>

The British Government, being actuated with the desire to have effective control over the villages and to facilitate the collection of revenues and house tax introduced the office of  laskar with limited police, civil and criminal powers. Accordingly there was a  laskar over a circle of villages; each having jurisdiction covering ten or twelve of villages. Although, the villagers were left to settle all disputes through the  nokma and the village courts, they had right to appeal to the court of  laskars against the decisions of the village councils.’ <sup id="cite_ref-839" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-839">[839]</a></sup> ‘The  laskar had his jurisdiction over many villages and was the agent of the British Administration. This system still continues at the district level. The  laskar used to bring the cases to the subordinate District Council Court from the Village Court. From the District Council Court the appeals could be preferred to the High Court at Gauhati.’ <sup id="cite_ref-840" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-840">[840]</a></sup> 'The loskor has several duties. He collects the house tax within his district, keeping a fixed portion of this as his own payment, and he organizes work parties to keep the roads open. His most important duty, however, is to supervise and try to settle legal disputes. The loskor sometimes appoints one or more assistants called sordars, to whom the District Council pays an annual stipend of 100 Rupees, together with a shirt and a pair of short pants. Saljing, who lived in Rengsanggri, was a sordar; but not every village had one, and a sordar does not have jurisdiction over a particular village. As a general assistant to the loskor he may assist in collecting information about a dispute, and in petty matters a sordar may sit as representative of the loskor and preside at a trial. The loskorship demands a large part of a man’s time, but a sordar spends most of his time working in his fields like his neighbors.' <sup id="cite_ref-841" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-841">[841]</a></sup> 'In theory it is the loskor who, as presiding officer at a meeting to settle a dispute, passes judgment upon the rights and wrongs of the argument. Often the loskor is in no position to do more than guide the consensus of opinion among the men who meet, but he does put the government’s stamp of approval on the decision. He must act well within the bounds of customary law; but if the evidence is contradictory or unusually complex, the loskor may exert considerable influence toward the settlement of the dispute in one way or another. Today the loskors are powerful men. Any decision of the loskor may be appealed to the higher courts of the district, but the procedure of appeal is lengthy and expensive, and it is certainly more convenient to settle a case at the local level if that is possible. Decisions of both the District Council court and the Deputy Commissioner’s court can be appealed to the high court of Assam, though for most Garos the procedure is prohibitively expensive.' <sup id="cite_ref-842" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-842">[842]</a></sup> 'The loskor, or whoever presides at the hearing of a case, must act within the limits of customary law since he usually has to rely upon the kinship groups of the principals in the case for enforcing his decisions. This obliges him to find a solution [Page 250] which both sides can accept. One of the most important obligations of members of a kinship group is to support each other in legal cases and to punish each other when guilty. In any serious quarrel which arises out of misbehaviour-such as divorce, theft, or false accusation-the two principals, each with their relatives, come together at a formal meeting such as that which considered Mingcheng’s behavior. This assembly constitutes the lowest Garo court, and its sessions are always described by the Garos as consisting of a meeting between two opposing groups of relatives who are seen as representing the principals. They defend and look out for the interests of their protégé if his rights have been infringed upon, and they are considered to be collectively responsible for any improper act of which he may be guilty. Specifically they are responsible for cash contributions toward the compensation that is given to redress any injury. Conversely, the relatives have the right, or even the duty, to punish him, by either a physical beating or a verbal denunciation or both. If a man behaves so badly that his relatives have to contribute their money to pay his compensation, he deserves to be punished by them. Relatives also share in any compensation that is received by an injured party, and thus gain recognition of the support which they have given. The money required for compensation is neither collected nor distributed in a systematic fashion, and sometimes after a trial in which compensation is given, different participants in a case give quite different guesses as to how much the various relatives gave or received. Garos were amused at my curiosity about these amounts, since even the closest relatives did not feel this was important enough to remember. One contributes in order to uphold his own and his family’s honor. It would be uncouth to calculate such a contribution too closely, but the contribution is the most explicit act of support that one can give to one’s kinsmen, and it certainly does a man’s reputation no harm to be known as a vigorous supporter of his relatives at trials.' <sup id="cite_ref-843" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-843">[843]</a></sup> 'The loskors have always been Garos, and their job has always been explicitly defined as the administration of customary law according to traditional practice. Even in the district courts, which have generally been presided over by non-Garos, an attempt has been made to [Page 301] apply traditional law. Old men, who were presumed to be knowledgeable in Garo tradition, have been called in to give their opinion, and in the records of cases in the District Council, references have occasionally been made to a published ethnological article on Garo law. However sincere the attempt to follow traditional laws, the imposition of neutral judicial officers, the guarantee of settlement by the district government, and the reservation of force by the government authorities, could not help but bring changes. The office of loskor appears gradually to have accumulated power, probably at the expense both of the nokmas and of the matrilineal descent groups. This does not mean that the latter are no longer significant institutions, but only that their relative importance has probably declined somewhat as that of the loskor has risen. Today the loskors and their courts, and the administration above them are so much a part of the Garo social organization that it is quite inaccurate to describe the Garos as forming anything but a dependent non-sovereign unit in a much larger society. Significant power over the Garos was for eighty years concentrated in London; with Indian independence, this power has been inherited by New Delhi.' <sup id="cite_ref-844" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-844">[844]</a></sup> 'Today the courts of the loskors are formally established under regulations passed by the District Council and approved by the governor of Assam; however, in 1956 Indian independence and the shift in jurisdiction over the loskors’ courts from the Deputy Commissioner’s office to the District Council were only beginning to have any effect on the villages in the district. Disputes were still settled in the same manner as during the period of British rule.' <sup id="cite_ref-845" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-845">[845]</a></sup> The introduction of appointed officials introduced a power shift away from elders and headmen, although they remained prominent: 'The older men in the Garo Hills proper remember the time when “speakers” played a more important role in legal disputes than they do now. Speakers are said generally to have been older ‘brothers’ ( ada) or ‘uncles’ ( mama) of the principals. To be a “speaker” is described as a skilled job, requiring intimate knowledge of the fine points of law in addition to the ability to speak well. Most people were unable to handle it. Today, older members of the kinship groups still state their opinions at trials, but with less formality than seems to have been the case formerly. Today much of the power has shifted away from kinship groups and their speakers to the ideally neutral loskors. Of course even in Mymensingh disputes can be taken to the government courts, but recourse to the courts seems to come at a later stage in the proceedings. Before the assumption of administration by the British, the only appeal from disagreement at such a meeting was presumably violence.' <sup id="cite_ref-846" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-846">[846]</a></sup> The colonial authorities introduced formal legal codes that applied to different administrative levels: ‘The application of the Rules for the Administration of Justice vested in the village headman and  laskars with judicial authority created some formal stereotypes for the administration which affected the traditional set-up, based on unwritten customary laws. The Codes of Civil and Criminal Procedure were not applied but only the spirit of the Penal Code was followed. A villager can no longer avenge a death by killing. The sanction of tribal law does not lie in custom alone but in the principles on which their society is based. ‘ <sup id="cite_ref-847" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-847">[847]</a></sup> ‘At present, there are atleast three major sets of statutory instruments relevant to the judicial administration which are applicable in the Garo Hills District. They are: (a) Rules for the Administration of Justice and Police in the Garo Hills, 1937, issued on the 29th March, 1937 to the extent to which some portions of these Rules still survive. (This is a matter of considerable obscurity), (b) Rules for the Administration of Justice in the Garo Hills Autonomous District, 1953, issued on the 18th December, 1953 and (c) The Assam High Court Order, 1954 dealing with the jurisdiction of the High Court in relation to various District Council Courts in the tribal area in question.’ <sup id="cite_ref-848" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-848">[848]</a></sup> The highest judicial authorities operated as judges on the district level: ‘The Judicial Officer appointed to preside over the District Council Court, exercises original jurisdiction to try cases and suits and exercises such powers as defined in Chapter III of the Code of the Criminal Procedure, 1898, and such other powers conferred by or under these rules, as he is invested with by the Executive Member of the District Council with the approval of the Governor for the disposal of the case and suits arising within the territorial jurisdiction of the said court.’ <sup id="cite_ref-849" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-849">[849]</a></sup> They may be assited by appointed elders: ‘The District Council may, whenever it deems necessary, also nominate two or more local elders well conversant with the tribal usages and customary laws, to sit with the judicial officer of the court as a bench and may, by order, invest such bench with any of the powers conferred or conferrable by or under the rules for the trial of suits and cases based on the tribal usages and the tribal customary laws only.’ <sup id="cite_ref-850" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-850">[850]</a></sup> The result was a dual system in which local and colonial patterns of dispute resolution coexisted to an extent, given the British system of indirect rule: 'If peace was to be maintained, some method of settling disputes other than a resort to violence had to be established, and the new British administration was forced to guarantee the settlement of all legal cases, even petty ones. A dispute that could not be settled by traditional methods could not be allowed to lead to inter-village warfare. Inevitably the British government had to give some supervision to the settlement of trouble cases, and they had to provide a system of higher courts to which decisions that could not be settled at the village level could be appealed. They also, of course, had an interest in collecting taxes, and in building roads to allow for the development of the district. The solution to these needs was found in the system of loskorships with their petty courts at the lowest level, and the district courts above them to which their decisions could be appealed.' <sup id="cite_ref-851" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-851">[851]</a></sup> ‘Among the Garos most disputes arise over the issues of property, inheritance, and domestic quarrels within the family. Such problems are to a large extent settled by the MAHARI (lineage) of the offended and the offender. A new situation develops when someone's cattle cause damage to another's crops. Under such situation the NOKMA (village headman) acts as an intermediary only. If he fails to settle the dispute, the matter can go to the civil court of the district council.’ <sup id="cite_ref-852" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-852">[852]</a></sup> ‘Many of the disputes of the Garos decided in their village  Panchayats. When a man has some complaints against another he reports them to the Nokma or the village-head. If the nature of the complaints is simple, the Nokma in a meeting of the few leading persons of the village, decides the dispute; but if the nature of the complaints is complicated and not easy of solution the Nokma reports the matter to the Laskar. The Laskar is a very important and influential man in the Garo Hills District. The hills areas are divided into some elekas and each of such elekas is placed under a Laskar for convenient collection of the house tax as well as for deciding the disputes of small nature locally. The Laskar need not essentially be a literate man, worldly prudence is enough for the management of his eleka. In practice a Laskar wields immense influence in his eleka.’ <sup id="cite_ref-853" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-853">[853]</a></sup> ‘The cases which are brought to the courts are serious and quite entangled ones, otherwise these could be decided amicably at the  mahari or  chra level in the village. When one does have a dispute involving an alien village, one does not get any support from any member of that village since they do not belong to the same clan. The village authority decides the case and gives judgement according to the customary law.’ <sup id="cite_ref-854" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-854">[854]</a></sup> Burling provides a short summary of the post-colonial situation: 'For almost one hundred years there has existed in Assam a political division known as the Garo Hills District. Today its relation to the State of Assam and to the Indian nation are defined by the Indian constitution. The Deputy Commissioner’s office established by the British continues as the chief local arm of the state administration, supervising state schools, roads, and [Page 244] forests. Certain legal problems, including such major crimes as murder and treason, remain under the jurisdiction of its court. In the time of British rule the Deputy Commissioner was always British; since then he has been a plains Indian, usually a member of the Indian Civil Service. The constitution, however, provided for the establishment of a new District Council, to be composed of about twenty members elected from several constituencies into which the district was divided. This council elects from among its members a “chief executive member” just as the parliament in New Delhi chooses the national prime minister. Jurisdiction of Garo customary law was transferred to the District Council, and courts were established to judge disputes covered by this law. The collection of various taxes, including the important house tax, was likewise transferred, and the District Council began to build roads, to open schools, and to administer forests. In 1956, the jurisdictional boundaries between it and the Deputy Commissioner’s office had not yet become completely clear.' <sup id="cite_ref-855" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-855">[855]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Criminal Prosecution ♣ absent ♥</b> It appears that there was no criminal law in the strict sense of the term. On the local level, legal cases were negotiated in the form of disputes rather than trials. Disputes typically arose over property and inheritance: 'No disputes arouse as much heat or go on so interminably as those over land titles. Since the period of British rule the government has attempted to record land titles at the district headquarters, but the distribution of the titles is extremely complex in practice and the records have tended to imply a simplified system of rights. Moreover, writing them down introduces into the system an inflexibility which is not found in the actual feelings of Garos about their rules. For each village or village cluster the district government recognizes a single nokma who is regarded as having title to the land of those villages. Sketch maps record the village boundaries, and the government confirms inheritance of the title by the nokma’s heir. It is also recognized that titles can be sold, though the courts seem to have been quite consistent in demanding general agreement among the villagers before a sale of land is recognized. That is, though he holds title, no nokma has been able to sell land to another village without permission. There are occasional legal disputes over the nokmaship, which are seen primarily as disputes over title to the village land. If the choice of the nokma’s heir proceeds according to the normal rule, then there can be no question about legitimacy; but complicating [Page 268] factors can arise. In one village the nokma’s first wife died, and he was given a replacement. Many years later the nokma died, and a dispute arose as to whether the replacement wife or the only daughter of the first wife should be entitled to the land. The rules for inheritance of personal property are not entirely clear in such a case, and disposition depends upon the decision of the family as to the next heiress. This particular case was decided by the district court on the reasonable basis that the land title was not entirely personal property but that the villagers had a voice in choosing the title-holder. The court concluded that the villagers preferred the replacement wife to the daughter.' <sup id="cite_ref-856" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-856">[856]</a></sup> 'These rather complex disputes over inheritance are unusual. More often, the nokmaship passes without ambiguity to a man’s heir. Similar ambiguities could arise over inheritance of personal property, but where traditional shifting agriculture is practiced this is simply not valuable enough to make a dispute worthwhile, and families are able to make amicable settlements without going to court. Only the nokmaship and land titles are really worth quarreling over.' <sup id="cite_ref-857" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-857">[857]</a></sup> The matrilineal kin groups of accuser and accused played key roles in the negotiation and resolution of disputes: 'The greatest responsibility is held by the closely related [Page 251] members of the lineages of the principals to a dispute, but the precise range of relatives is ill-defined and varies from case to case. More people will assemble to deal with a serious case than with a petty one. Relatives who live near by, and especially those living in the village of the principals, are more likely to assemble than those from elsewhere. Finally, while lineage mates are more likely to assemble than others, close relatives of other lineages also join them. A father will be considered on the side of his son, for instance, even though he is not his lineage mate. A father may even contribute to the compensation his son pays, or share in what he receives, though a father never takes part in beating or publicly denouncing his son.' <sup id="cite_ref-858" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-858">[858]</a></sup> 'The group that supports a disputant might be briefly characterized as a matrilineally skewed kindred, since all relatives can take part, but those related to one in the matrilineal direction are more likely to do so than others. The degree of relationship out to which kinsmen feel responsibility is in no way fixed, but depends upon the seriousness of the case and upon the availability or absence of other more closely related kinsmen who might more appropriately take charge. Since the lineages never split up in a precise manner, no boundaries can neatly distinguish those responsible from those who are not. Responsibility simply grows weaker as one becomes less closely related.' <sup id="cite_ref-859" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-859">[859]</a></sup> 'Criminal law as such does not exist for the Garos, since a suit is always brought by a private party, even though a government official supervises the court. But while all trials are seen as disputes between two opposing kinship groups, people at most ordinary trials do not obstinately back up their own relative and refuse to consider the opposite side. Quite the reverse is in fact the case. When it is evident that one’s own relative is at fault, one does not try to minimize this fact; rather, by arranging compensation with dispatch and by vigorously punishing the culprit, one demonstrates to the other side and to the public at large that here is a group of men who know their responsibilities and are willing to live up to them. The actual tenor of [Page 252] the trials I attended was a firm intention to reach a consensus as to what action should be taken. There were well-defined procedures to be followed, and usually there was little question of fixing guilt since people knew each other’s characters so intimately. Most cases could be disposed of by arranging compensation, which was set according to reasonably fixed standards. Members of the two “opposing” sides show no animosity toward each other, and never exhibit an unreasonable disposition to back up a relative at the expense of their reputation as reasonable and law-abiding citizens.' <sup id="cite_ref-860" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-860">[860]</a></sup> 'Garos today often say that adjudication of disputes was formerly the nokma’s job, but it seems reasonable to suggest that disputes were more frequently settled by negotiation between kinship groups, with a less significant part played by any neutral party, and this seems to be implied by Hamilton, who mentions “headmen of families” and “wise men” in addition to the “chiefs” themselves. In most of the Garo area today, only the most petty cases are decided without the presence of a neutral representative of the government. Chondu told me of a time when he and some of his relatives met in order to settle a dispute which had arisen when some children had stolen a few eggs. They met without any governmental representative, but Chondu described the meeting in exactly the same terms used to describe court cases, and the relatives collected money for a compensation, just as they do in more serious matters.' <sup id="cite_ref-861" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-861">[861]</a></sup> Prior to enforcement of colonial regulations, disputes were often decided by oath and ordeal: ‘Since the annexation of the Garo Hills by the British Government, a body of men called  laskars has been formed, who act as a kind of rural police and also as honorary magistrates. They are empowered to deal with all minor matters and settle unimportant disputes. They do this by calling together meetings of villagers, in which they sit as presidents and give final decisions. Their powers do not exceed those of inflicting fines and awarding compensation to injured parties. This is but an adaptation of the ancient usages of the people, for in former times, the village met in conference to decide any matter in dispute between its members. When in these meetings evidence could not be adduced, recourse was, and is yet had to trial by ordeal. This is of two kinds, the  s˘il-s[unknown]o °a, or ordeal of hot iron, and the  ch[unknown]okéla-s[unknown]o °a, or ordeal of boiling water.’ <sup id="cite_ref-862" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-862">[862]</a></sup> 'One type of ordeal required the two opponents to dive under water, the last to come up thereby demonstrating his veracity. In another, boiling water was poured over the arm of the accused person; if it burned him, he was shown to be guilty. Other procedures had the same purpose, though they did not involve tests of personal strength. A favorite method was to heat a carefully measured amount of water with a carefully measured amount of wood. If the water boiled over, the accused man was shown to be indeed guilty. At other times, a chicken was tied outside at night. If it survived the night without being taken by a wild animal, the accused was shown to be innocent. In every case, the result was to show clearly that one person or [Page 254] the other was in the wrong. Most people accepted the outcome, compensations were paid, and the cases were settled. I was told of many cases in which even the man shown to be guilty admitted his guilt after the outcome of an ordeal. Sometimes a man would continue to protest his innocence, but it did him little good since even his relatives were by that time convinced that he was lying. In any case a compensation would have to be paid, and the dispute should then be at an end.' <sup id="cite_ref-863" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-863">[863]</a></sup> ‘The Garo system of trial of cases beings with earth-taking. The complainant and the accused both swear by taking a lump of soil in their hands in front of the gathering with a promise that they will state the truth and nothing but the truth. It is believed by some Garos that this is the origin of the word “A’chik”, others believed that they have been called the A’chiks as they inhabited the high undulating land.’ <sup id="cite_ref-864" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-864">[864]</a></sup> Due to the influence of missionaries, ordeals were abandoned in the colonial and post-colonial periods: 'In this skeptical age, the teaching of missionaries and indirect exposure to new ideas from the rest of the world have destroyed the former faith in the reliability of these ordeals, and a new difficulty has arisen in the settlement of disputes. Today, when evidence is insufficient the case must simply be dismissed. This brings Garo practice into line with the Western belief that no man should be punished unless the evidence against him leaves no reasonable doubt of his guilt, but it also leaves cases dangling without final settlement. People may continue to believe in a person’s guilt but have no way of winding up an argument. While I was in Rengsanggri, a prominent member of the village was accused by his wife of having committed adultery with another woman of the village. They both denied it, and the case was eventually dismissed for lack of evidence. Villagers with whom I talked were privately convinced that the accusation was justified. In earlier years they probably could have extracted compensation from the accused man and his relatives, or at least they would have been able to test him by an ordeal. Today, evidence is presented more formally than before, and the intimate knowledge villagers have of one another is less likely to be taken into account in reaching a decision. Since ordeals are no longer possible, denial of guilt has become more attractive. In this case charging adultery, since it ended without a decision, hard feelings were created which were never mollified; and some villagers predicted that these people would continue their adulterous relationship at every opportunity.' <sup id="cite_ref-865" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-865">[865]</a></sup> Upon the resolution of a dispute, the party found to be in the wrong was obligated to pay compensation to the other party. In the colonial period, these payments were monetized: 'Ideally, and usually in practice as well, the compensation should end the dispute and clear the air. To pay compensation is to acknowledge guilt formally, and grant satisfaction to the other side. Afterward everyone should return to normal life, and not nurse injured feelings. The explicit purpose of the trial is to pacify people, to soothe their damaged reputations, or to compensate them for any loss. Every effort is made to find a solution which will be accepted so firmly by all sides that bickering will be avoided. Of course, not everyone is always satisfied. People sometimes feel that justice has miscarried and go away from a trial discontented; but ideally this should not happen, and usually there is enough agreement so that a man who feels unfairly treated will have little sympathy from his relatives and little choice but to accept the public consensus. Garo law has little in the way of moral overtone. Unlawful acts are felt to be wrong because they hurt some particular person, not because they violate an abstract moral precept. The injured party has legal means of redressing such an action, and Garos are more apt to cite the danger of legal action than abstract principles when explaining why some behavior must not be indulged in.' <sup id="cite_ref-866" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-866">[866]</a></sup> Feuding was common in the pre-colonial period: '“The chiefs known as nokmas and the head men of families assemble in a council called jingma changga [which in modern Garo simply means “to assemble in a crowd”] and endeavor to reconcile all those of the clan who have disputes; for it would not appear that they have a right to inflict any punishment unless a man should be detected in uttering a falsehood before them, in which case he would be put to instant death, more from popular indignation than from a regular progress of justice. Dishonesty or stealing seem rarely to be practiced, and almost the only source of dispute seems to be murder, which would appear to be an ordinary crime. But the relations of the person killed are, by custom, held bound to demand blood for blood, and ought to put to death either the murderer or one of his kindred, or at least one of his slaves. The other family then is bound to pursue a similar mode of retaliation, and the feud would thus continue endless, unless the council interfered and brought about a mutual reconciliation, which it is usually able to effectuate, by inducing the parties to accept a price for the blood that has been split. Although every head of a family has an equal right to sit in their assemblies, the influence of the chiefs, or of one or two wise men usually decides everything.' <sup id="cite_ref-867" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-867">[867]</a></sup> However, feuding was suppressed by the colonial authorities. We are unsure about criminal prosecution in colonial courts. Accordingly, the code is open to review.

<p><b>♠ Non-state judiciary ♣ present ♥</b> There was little legal formalization on village level. Village headmen and lineage elders exercised informal authority: ‘Among the Garos most disputes arise over the issues of property, inheritance, and domestic quarrels within the family. Such problems are to a large extent settled by the MAHARI (lineage) of the offended and the offender. A new situation develops when someone's cattle cause damage to another's crops.

Since the period of British rule the government has attempted to record land titles at the district headquarters, but the distribution of the titles is extremely complex in practice and the records have tended to imply a simplified system of rights. Moreover, writing them down introduces into the system an inflexibility which is not found in the actual feelings of Garos about their rules. For each village or village cluster the district government recognizes a single nokma who is regarded as having title to the land of those villages. Sketch maps record the village boundaries, and the government confirms inheritance of the title by the nokma’s heir. It is also recognized that titles can be sold, though the courts seem to have been quite consistent in demanding general agreement among the villagers before a sale of land is recognized. That is, though he holds title, no nokma has been able to sell land to another village without permission. There are occasional legal disputes over the nokmaship, which are seen primarily as disputes over title to the village land. If the choice of the nokma’s heir proceeds according to the normal rule, then there can be no question about legitimacy; but complicating [Page 268] factors can arise. In one village the nokma’s first wife died, and he was given a replacement. Many years later the nokma died, and a dispute arose as to whether the replacement wife or the only daughter of the first wife should be entitled to the land. The rules for inheritance of personal property are not entirely clear in such a case, and disposition depends upon the decision of the family as to the next heiress. This particular case was decided by the district court on the reasonable basis that the land title was not entirely personal property but that the villagers had a voice in choosing the title-holder. The court concluded that the villagers preferred the replacement wife to the daughter.' <sup id="cite_ref-870" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-870">[870]</a></sup> 'These rather complex disputes over inheritance are unusual. More often, the nokmaship passes without ambiguity to a man’s heir. Similar ambiguities could arise over inheritance of personal property, but where traditional shifting agriculture is practiced this is simply not valuable enough to make a dispute worthwhile, and families are able to make amicable settlements without going to court. Only the nokmaship and land titles are really worth quarreling over.' <sup id="cite_ref-871" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-871">[871]</a></sup> The matrilineal kin groups of accuser and accused played key roles in the negotiation and resolution of disputes: 'The greatest responsibility is held by the closely related [Page 251] members of the lineages of the principals to a dispute, but the precise range of relatives is ill-defined and varies from case to case. More people will assemble to deal with a serious case than with a petty one. Relatives who live near by, and especially those living in the village of the principals, are more likely to assemble than those from elsewhere. Finally, while lineage mates are more likely to assemble than others, close relatives of other lineages also join them. A father will be considered on the side of his son, for instance, even though he is not his lineage mate. A father may even contribute to the compensation his son pays, or share in what he receives, though a father never takes part in beating or publicly denouncing his son.' <sup id="cite_ref-872" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-872">[872]</a></sup> 'The group that supports a disputant might be briefly characterized as a matrilineally skewed kindred, since all relatives can take part, but those related to one in the matrilineal direction are more likely to do so than others. The degree of relationship out to which kinsmen feel responsibility is in no way fixed, but depends upon the seriousness of the case and upon the availability or absence of other more closely related kinsmen who might more appropriately take charge. Since the lineages never split up in a precise manner, no boundaries can neatly distinguish those responsible from those who are not. Responsibility simply grows weaker as one becomes less closely related.' <sup id="cite_ref-873" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-873">[873]</a></sup> 'Criminal law as such does not exist for the Garos, since a suit is always brought by a private party, even though a government official supervises the court. But while all trials are seen as disputes between two opposing kinship groups, people at most ordinary trials do not obstinately back up their own relative and refuse to consider the opposite side. Quite the reverse is in fact the case. When it is evident that one’s own relative is at fault, one does not try to minimize this fact; rather, by arranging compensation with dispatch and by vigorously punishing the culprit, one demonstrates to the other side and to the public at large that here is a group of men who know their responsibilities and are willing to live up to them. The actual tenor of [Page 252] the trials I attended was a firm intention to reach a consensus as to what action should be taken. There were well-defined procedures to be followed, and usually there was little question of fixing guilt since people knew each other’s characters so intimately. Most cases could be disposed of by arranging compensation, which was set according to reasonably fixed standards. Members of the two “opposing” sides show no animosity toward each other, and never exhibit an unreasonable disposition to back up a relative at the expense of their reputation as reasonable and law-abiding citizens.' <sup id="cite_ref-874" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-874">[874]</a></sup> 'Garos today often say that adjudication of disputes was formerly the nokma’s job, but it seems reasonable to suggest that disputes were more frequently settled by negotiation between kinship groups, with a less significant part played by any neutral party, and this seems to be implied by Hamilton, who mentions “headmen of families” and “wise men” in addition to the “chiefs” themselves. In most of the Garo area today, only the most petty cases are decided without the presence of a neutral representative of the government. Chondu told me of a time when he and some of his relatives met in order to settle a dispute which had arisen when some children had stolen a few eggs. They met without any governmental representative, but Chondu described the meeting in exactly the same terms used to describe court cases, and the relatives collected money for a compensation, just as they do in more serious matters.' <sup id="cite_ref-875" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-875">[875]</a></sup> Prior to enforcement of colonial regulations, disputes were often decided by oath and ordeal: ‘Since the annexation of the Garo Hills by the British Government, a body of men called  laskars has been formed, who act as a kind of rural police and also as honorary magistrates. They are empowered to deal with all minor matters and settle unimportant disputes. They do this by calling together meetings of villagers, in which they sit as presidents and give final decisions. Their powers do not exceed those of inflicting fines and awarding compensation to injured parties. This is but an adaptation of the ancient usages of the people, for in former times, the village met in conference to decide any matter in dispute between its members. When in these meetings evidence could not be adduced, recourse was, and is yet had to trial by ordeal. This is of two kinds, the  s˘il-s[unknown]o °a, or ordeal of hot iron, and the  ch[unknown]okéla-s[unknown]o °a, or ordeal of boiling water.’ <sup id="cite_ref-876" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-876">[876]</a></sup> 'One type of ordeal required the two opponents to dive under water, the last to come up thereby demonstrating his veracity. In another, boiling water was poured over the arm of the accused person; if it burned him, he was shown to be guilty. Other procedures had the same purpose, though they did not involve tests of personal strength. A favorite method was to heat a carefully measured amount of water with a carefully measured amount of wood. If the water boiled over, the accused man was shown to be indeed guilty. At other times, a chicken was tied outside at night. If it survived the night without being taken by a wild animal, the accused was shown to be innocent. In every case, the result was to show clearly that one person or [Page 254] the other was in the wrong. Most people accepted the outcome, compensations were paid, and the cases were settled. I was told of many cases in which even the man shown to be guilty admitted his guilt after the outcome of an ordeal. Sometimes a man would continue to protest his innocence, but it did him little good since even his relatives were by that time convinced that he was lying. In any case a compensation would have to be paid, and the dispute should then be at an end.' <sup id="cite_ref-877" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-877">[877]</a></sup> ‘The Garo system of trial of cases beings with earth-taking. The complainant and the accused both swear by taking a lump of soil in their hands in front of the gathering with a promise that they will state the truth and nothing but the truth. It is believed by some Garos that this is the origin of the word “A’chik”, others believed that they have been called the A’chiks as they inhabited the high undulating land.’ <sup id="cite_ref-878" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-878">[878]</a></sup> Due to the influence of missionaries, ordeals were abandoned in the colonial and post-colonial periods: 'In this skeptical age, the teaching of missionaries and indirect exposure to new ideas from the rest of the world have destroyed the former faith in the reliability of these ordeals, and a new difficulty has arisen in the settlement of disputes. Today, when evidence is insufficient the case must simply be dismissed. This brings Garo practice into line with the Western belief that no man should be punished unless the evidence against him leaves no reasonable doubt of his guilt, but it also leaves cases dangling without final settlement. People may continue to believe in a person’s guilt but have no way of winding up an argument. While I was in Rengsanggri, a prominent member of the village was accused by his wife of having committed adultery with another woman of the village. They both denied it, and the case was eventually dismissed for lack of evidence. Villagers with whom I talked were privately convinced that the accusation was justified. In earlier years they probably could have extracted compensation from the accused man and his relatives, or at least they would have been able to test him by an ordeal. Today, evidence is presented more formally than before, and the intimate knowledge villagers have of one another is less likely to be taken into account in reaching a decision. Since ordeals are no longer possible, denial of guilt has become more attractive. In this case charging adultery, since it ended without a decision, hard feelings were created which were never mollified; and some villagers predicted that these people would continue their adulterous relationship at every opportunity.' <sup id="cite_ref-879" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-879">[879]</a></sup> Upon the resolution of a dispute, the party found to be in the wrong was obligated to pay compensation to the other party. In the colonial period, these payments were monetized: 'Ideally, and usually in practice as well, the compensation should end the dispute and clear the air. To pay compensation is to acknowledge guilt formally, and grant satisfaction to the other side. Afterward everyone should return to normal life, and not nurse injured feelings. The explicit purpose of the trial is to pacify people, to soothe their damaged reputations, or to compensate them for any loss. Every effort is made to find a solution which will be accepted so firmly by all sides that bickering will be avoided. Of course, not everyone is always satisfied. People sometimes feel that justice has miscarried and go away from a trial discontented; but ideally this should not happen, and usually there is enough agreement so that a man who feels unfairly treated will have little sympathy from his relatives and little choice but to accept the public consensus. Garo law has little in the way of moral overtone. Unlawful acts are felt to be wrong because they hurt some particular person, not because they violate an abstract moral precept. The injured party has legal means of redressing such an action, and Garos are more apt to cite the danger of legal action than abstract principles when explaining why some behavior must not be indulged in.' <sup id="cite_ref-880" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-880">[880]</a></sup> Feuding was common in the pre-colonial period: '“The chiefs known as nokmas and the head men of families assemble in a council called jingma changga [which in modern Garo simply means “to assemble in a crowd”] and endeavor to reconcile all those of the clan who have disputes; for it would not appear that they have a right to inflict any punishment unless a man should be detected in uttering a falsehood before them, in which case he would be put to instant death, more from popular indignation than from a regular progress of justice. Dishonesty or stealing seem rarely to be practiced, and almost the only source of dispute seems to be murder, which would appear to be an ordinary crime. But the relations of the person killed are, by custom, held bound to demand blood for blood, and ought to put to death either the murderer or one of his kindred, or at least one of his slaves. The other family then is bound to pursue a similar mode of retaliation, and the feud would thus continue endless, unless the council interfered and brought about a mutual reconciliation, which it is usually able to effectuate, by inducing the parties to accept a price for the blood that has been split. Although every head of a family has an equal right to sit in their assemblies, the influence of the chiefs, or of one or two wise men usually decides everything.' <sup id="cite_ref-881" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-881">[881]</a></sup> However, feuding was suppressed by the colonial authorities. During colonial rule, supralocal executive offices were superimposed onto village- and lineage-based A’chik structures: ‘When the Britishers took over the administration of this district, one witnessed an imposition of hierarchy of new political and administrative units in the district over the traditional democratic village set-up. The British Government, being actuated with the desire to have effective control over the villages and to facilitate the collection of revenues and house tax introduced the office of  laskar with limited police, civil and criminal powers. Accordingly there was a  laskar over a circle of villages; each having jurisdiction covering ten or twelve of villages. Although, the villagers were left to settle all disputes through the  nokma and the village courts, they had right to appeal to the court of  laskars against the decisions of the village councils.’ <sup id="cite_ref-882" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-882">[882]</a></sup> 'The British reserved the use of force to themselves and their officials. They established in Tura the office of Deputy Commissioner, which until the time of Indian independence was filled by a Britisher. Law courts were set up for the peaceful settlement of legal disputes, and though most of these were settled by Garo petty officials coming under the administration of the Deputy Commissioner, he himself sat as judge in the [Page 20] court of appeals. The government also undertook to build and maintain roads, to establish reserved forests, and to control trade and the markets. At first, education was left largely to the missionaries, but gradually the main responsibility for education has also been shifted to the government.' <sup id="cite_ref-883" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-883">[883]</a></sup> Appointed petty officials acted as intermediaries: ’In the same way the introduction of offices of  sardar, hill  mandal and hill  mauzadar curtailed the powers and authorities of the  nokmas and their village councils. The new offices were created for the effective administration over the Garo with  the idea of village self-government under the direct control of Deputy Commissioner at the centre.’ <sup id="cite_ref-884" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-884">[884]</a></sup> ‘When the Britishers took over the administration of this district, one witnessed an imposition of hierarchy of new political and administrative units in the district over the traditional democratic village set-up.

This system still continues at the district level. The  laskar used to bring the cases to the subordinate District Council Court from the Village Court. From the District Council Court the appeals could be preferred to the High Court at Gauhati.’ <sup id="cite_ref-886" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-886">[886]</a></sup> 'The loskor has several duties. He collects the house tax within his district, keeping a fixed portion of this as his own payment, and he organizes work parties to keep the roads open. His most important duty, however, is to supervise and try to settle legal disputes. The loskor sometimes appoints one or more assistants called sordars, to whom the District Council pays an annual stipend of 100 Rupees, together with a shirt and a pair of short pants. Saljing, who lived in Rengsanggri, was a sordar; but not every village had one, and a sordar does not have jurisdiction over a particular village. As a general assistant to the loskor he may assist in collecting information about a dispute, and in petty matters a sordar may sit as representative of the loskor and preside at a trial. The loskorship demands a large part of a man’s time, but a sordar spends most of his time working in his fields like his neighbors.' <sup id="cite_ref-887" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-887">[887]</a></sup> 'In theory it is the loskor who, as presiding officer at a meeting to settle a dispute, passes judgment upon the rights and wrongs of the argument. Often the loskor is in no position to do more than guide the consensus of opinion among the men who meet, but he does put the government’s stamp of approval on the decision. He must act well within the bounds of customary law; but if the evidence is contradictory or unusually complex, the loskor may exert considerable influence toward the settlement of the dispute in one way or another. Today the loskors are powerful men. Any decision of the loskor may be appealed to the higher courts of the district, but the procedure of appeal is lengthy and expensive, and it is certainly more convenient to settle a case at the local level if that is possible. Decisions of both the District Council court and the Deputy Commissioner’s court can be appealed to the high court of Assam, though for most Garos the procedure is prohibitively expensive.' <sup id="cite_ref-888" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-888">[888]</a></sup> 'The loskor, or whoever presides at the hearing of a case, must act within the limits of customary law since he usually has to rely upon the kinship groups of the principals in the case for enforcing his decisions. This obliges him to find a solution [Page 250] which both sides can accept. One of the most important obligations of members of a kinship group is to support each other in legal cases and to punish each other when guilty. In any serious quarrel which arises out of misbehaviour-such as divorce, theft, or false accusation-the two principals, each with their relatives, come together at a formal meeting such as that which considered Mingcheng’s behavior. This assembly constitutes the lowest Garo court, and its sessions are always described by the Garos as consisting of a meeting between two opposing groups of relatives who are seen as representing the principals. They defend and look out for the interests of their protégé if his rights have been infringed upon, and they are considered to be collectively responsible for any improper act of which he may be guilty. Specifically they are responsible for cash contributions toward the compensation that is given to redress any injury. Conversely, the relatives have the right, or even the duty, to punish him, by either a physical beating or a verbal denunciation or both. If a man behaves so badly that his relatives have to contribute their money to pay his compensation, he deserves to be punished by them. Relatives also share in any compensation that is received by an injured party, and thus gain recognition of the support which they have given. The money required for compensation is neither collected nor distributed in a systematic fashion, and sometimes after a trial in which compensation is given, different participants in a case give quite different guesses as to how much the various relatives gave or received. Garos were amused at my curiosity about these amounts, since even the closest relatives did not feel this was important enough to remember. One contributes in order to uphold his own and his family’s honor. It would be uncouth to calculate such a contribution too closely, but the contribution is the most explicit act of support that one can give to one’s kinsmen, and it certainly does a man’s reputation no harm to be known as a vigorous supporter of his relatives at trials.' <sup id="cite_ref-889" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-889">[889]</a></sup> 'The loskors have always been Garos, and their job has always been explicitly defined as the administration of customary law according to traditional practice. Even in the district courts, which have generally been presided over by non-Garos, an attempt has been made to [Page 301] apply traditional law. Old men, who were presumed to be knowledgeable in Garo tradition, have been called in to give their opinion, and in the records of cases in the District Council, references have occasionally been made to a published ethnological article on Garo law. However sincere the attempt to follow traditional laws, the imposition of neutral judicial officers, the guarantee of settlement by the district government, and the reservation of force by the government authorities, could not help but bring changes. The office of loskor appears gradually to have accumulated power, probably at the expense both of the nokmas and of the matrilineal descent groups. This does not mean that the latter are no longer significant institutions, but only that their relative importance has probably declined somewhat as that of the loskor has risen. Today the loskors and their courts, and the administration above them are so much a part of the Garo social organization that it is quite inaccurate to describe the Garos as forming anything but a dependent non-sovereign unit in a much larger society. Significant power over the Garos was for eighty years concentrated in London; with Indian independence, this power has been inherited by New Delhi.' <sup id="cite_ref-890" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-890">[890]</a></sup> 'Today the courts of the loskors are formally established under regulations passed by the District Council and approved by the governor of Assam; however, in 1956 Indian independence and the shift in jurisdiction over the loskors’ courts from the Deputy Commissioner’s office to the District Council were only beginning to have any effect on the villages in the district. Disputes were still settled in the same manner as during the period of British rule.' <sup id="cite_ref-891" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-891">[891]</a></sup> The introduction of appointed officials introduced a power shift away from elders and headmen, although they remained prominent: 'The older men in the Garo Hills proper remember the time when “speakers” played a more important role in legal disputes than they do now. Speakers are said generally to have been older ‘brothers’ ( ada) or ‘uncles’ ( mama) of the principals. To be a “speaker” is described as a skilled job, requiring intimate knowledge of the fine points of law in addition to the ability to speak well. Most people were unable to handle it. Today, older members of the kinship groups still state their opinions at trials, but with less formality than seems to have been the case formerly. Today much of the power has shifted away from kinship groups and their speakers to the ideally neutral loskors. Of course even in Mymensingh disputes can be taken to the government courts, but recourse to the courts seems to come at a later stage in the proceedings. Before the assumption of administration by the British, the only appeal from disagreement at such a meeting was presumably violence.' <sup id="cite_ref-892" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-892">[892]</a></sup> The colonial authorities introduced formal legal codes that applied to different administrative levels: ‘The application of the Rules for the Administration of Justice vested in the village headman and  laskars with judicial authority created some formal stereotypes for the administration which affected the traditional set-up, based on unwritten customary laws. The Codes of Civil and Criminal Procedure were not applied but only the spirit of the Penal Code was followed. A villager can no longer avenge a death by killing. The sanction of tribal law does not lie in custom alone but in the principles on which their society is based. ‘ <sup id="cite_ref-893" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-893">[893]</a></sup> ‘At present, there are atleast three major sets of statutory instruments relevant to the judicial administration which are applicable in the Garo Hills District. They are: (a) Rules for the Administration of Justice and Police in the Garo Hills, 1937, issued on the 29th March, 1937 to the extent to which some portions of these Rules still survive. (This is a matter of considerable obscurity), (b) Rules for the Administration of Justice in the Garo Hills Autonomous District, 1953, issued on the 18th December, 1953 and (c) The Assam High Court Order, 1954 dealing with the jurisdiction of the High Court in relation to various District Council Courts in the tribal area in question.’ <sup id="cite_ref-894" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-894">[894]</a></sup> The highest judicial authorities operated as judges on the district level: ‘The Judicial Officer appointed to preside over the District Council Court, exercises original jurisdiction to try cases and suits and exercises such powers as defined in Chapter III of the Code of the Criminal Procedure, 1898, and such other powers conferred by or under these rules, as he is invested with by the Executive Member of the District Council with the approval of the Governor for the disposal of the case and suits arising within the territorial jurisdiction of the said court.’ <sup id="cite_ref-895" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-895">[895]</a></sup> They may be assited by appointed elders: ‘The District Council may, whenever it deems necessary, also nominate two or more local elders well conversant with the tribal usages and customary laws, to sit with the judicial officer of the court as a bench and may, by order, invest such bench with any of the powers conferred or conferrable by or under the rules for the trial of suits and cases based on the tribal usages and the tribal customary laws only.’ <sup id="cite_ref-896" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-896">[896]</a></sup> The result was a dual system in which local and colonial patterns of dispute resolution coexisted to an extent, given the British system of indirect rule: 'If peace was to be maintained, some method of settling disputes other than a resort to violence had to be established, and the new British administration was forced to guarantee the settlement of all legal cases, even petty ones. A dispute that could not be settled by traditional methods could not be allowed to lead to inter-village warfare. Inevitably the British government had to give some supervision to the settlement of trouble cases, and they had to provide a system of higher courts to which decisions that could not be settled at the village level could be appealed. They also, of course, had an interest in collecting taxes, and in building roads to allow for the development of the district. The solution to these needs was found in the system of loskorships with their petty courts at the lowest level, and the district courts above them to which their decisions could be appealed.' <sup id="cite_ref-897" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-897">[897]</a></sup> ‘Among the Garos most disputes arise over the issues of property, inheritance, and domestic quarrels within the family. Such problems are to a large extent settled by the MAHARI (lineage) of the offended and the offender. A new situation develops when someone's cattle cause damage to another's crops. Under such situation the NOKMA (village headman) acts as an intermediary only. If he fails to settle the dispute, the matter can go to the civil court of the district council.’ <sup id="cite_ref-898" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-898">[898]</a></sup> ‘Many of the disputes of the Garos decided in their village  Panchayats. When a man has some complaints against another he reports them to the Nokma or the village-head. If the nature of the complaints is simple, the Nokma in a meeting of the few leading persons of the village, decides the dispute; but if the nature of the complaints is complicated and not easy of solution the Nokma reports the matter to the Laskar. The Laskar is a very important and influential man in the Garo Hills District. The hills areas are divided into some elekas and each of such elekas is placed under a Laskar for convenient collection of the house tax as well as for deciding the disputes of small nature locally. The Laskar need not essentially be a literate man, worldly prudence is enough for the management of his eleka. In practice a Laskar wields immense influence in his eleka.’ <sup id="cite_ref-899" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-899">[899]</a></sup> ‘The cases which are brought to the courts are serious and quite entangled ones, otherwise these could be decided amicably at the  mahari or  chra level in the village. When one does have a dispute involving an alien village, one does not get any support from any member of that village since they do not belong to the same clan. The village authority decides the case and gives judgement according to the customary law.’ <sup id="cite_ref-900" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-900">[900]</a></sup> Burling provides a short summary of the post-colonial situation: 'For almost one hundred years there has existed in Assam a political division known as the Garo Hills District. Today its relation to the State of Assam and to the Indian nation are defined by the Indian constitution. The Deputy Commissioner’s office established by the British continues as the chief local arm of the state administration, supervising state schools, roads, and [Page 244] forests. Certain legal problems, including such major crimes as murder and treason, remain under the jurisdiction of its court. In the time of British rule the Deputy Commissioner was always British; since then he has been a plains Indian, usually a member of the Indian Civil Service. The constitution, however, provided for the establishment of a new District Council, to be composed of about twenty members elected from several constituencies into which the district was divided. This council elects from among its members a “chief executive member” just as the parliament in New Delhi chooses the national prime minister. Jurisdiction of Garo customary law was transferred to the District Council, and courts were established to judge disputes covered by this law. The collection of various taxes, including the important house tax, was likewise transferred, and the District Council began to build roads, to open schools, and to administer forests. In 1956, the jurisdictional boundaries between it and the Deputy Commissioner’s office had not yet become completely clear.' <sup id="cite_ref-901" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-901">[901]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Religious judiciary ♣ absent ♥</b> The duties of village headmen were connected to collective ritual (see also material on 'ritual' above). ‘Traditionally, the  nokma’s position was connected with the indigeneous customary rites. His temporal and ritual powers in a traditional society were linked with his position. The conversion of a  nokma to Christianity automatically led to the loss of his ritualistic role. When the  nokma’s were endowed with real temporal power, the resistance was great as  Nokmas were non-Christians. But when the  Nokma accepted Christianity,  nokmaship passed to another person who could act as a  nokma in performing rites and rituals. However, the Government still recognized the converted persons as  nokmas. This created dislocation in the traditional system, one looking after the customary right and other ritual responsibilities. As the author has tried to show that in the traditional system the two roles cannot be separated, the two roles are enmeshed into each other.’ <sup id="cite_ref-902" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-902">[902]</a></sup> 'Traditionally, the Garos were not a politically organized society, and even today there exists no clear-cut political structure. Chieftainship involves religious functions only.' <sup id="cite_ref-903" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-903">[903]</a></sup> However, this does not seem to fulfill the criteria of an independent 'religious judiciary'.

<p><b>♠ Private property (land) ♣ present ♥</b> Land was traditionally owned by matrilineal clans and allotted to individual households: 'Land for shifting cultivation is owned by the clan. Each village has a traditionally demarcated area of its own termed ADOK. This area is subdivided into plots that are used for cultivation in a cyclic order. The plots are distributed to the families. Allotment of the general plots is done by common consensus of the village elders.' <sup id="cite_ref-904" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-904">[904]</a></sup> 'The two-year agricultural cycle begins when the section that has been fallow the longest is apportioned into household plots. Like the choice of the fields as a whole, the apportionment is made largely on the basis of tradition, since most households expect to use again the plot they used the last time around. This does not imply permanent land ownership, since readjustments always have to be made to allow for any increase or decrease in the size of families since the fields were last used. It does a family no good to claim more land than its available labor can cultivate, but families which have increased are always free to take an additional plot out at the edge of the fields, if they cannot take over parts of plots which smaller families no longer need. Occasionally people take more land than they are able to handle adequately, with the result that after a year of cultivation, abandoned patches, scattered here and there in the fields, mark the places where the weeds have gotten out of control. The steady increase in population has meant that land has been left fallow for ever shorter periods, and presumably it is becoming less capable of continued cultivation. This may result in a crisis in the future, but the crisis has not yet come. So far limitation in the available labor has prevented extreme competition for land.' <sup id="cite_ref-905" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-905">[905]</a></sup> Burling describes the process of demarcating boundaries between plots: 'The fire is generally held late in the afternoon or evening, when dusk allows stray sparks to be caught more easily; and early the next morning people must rise and prepare for sowing the crops and for the day’s ceremonies. Each woman cooks a supply of food in her house, but instead of serving it there she [Page 33] wraps it in banana leaves and carries it to the field. The men’s first job is to circle the borders of their individual plots, and in cooperation with their neighbors to define the boundaries. These have, of course, been agreed upon since the plots were first distributed, but burning alters the character of the land and permits a more final demarcation. Wherever possible they place boundaries either along stream beds or along the ridges of small hills; when the division is not marked by some clear natural line, the neighbors lay a series of poles, salvaged from the refuse of the fire, along the boundary that will separate their fields. After this, to move the sticks is said to cause blindness.' <sup id="cite_ref-906" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-906">[906]</a></sup> Families were entitled to the harvest they generated from the plots allotted to them: 'The fields are the other important family asset, though these are not permanent possessions since fields are used for only two years at a time. Moreover, a family cannot be limited economically by a shortage of fields, since any family is free to open up as much land as it can use. Nevertheless, during the years any fields are in use, they are unambiguously assigned to a particular household, and in spite of the considerable amount of labor exchanged in agricultural work (see Chapter VIII) each household retains primary responsibility for its own plots. It must do all of the planning and organizing for its own fields, and most of the actual work as well. The members of the family have exclusive rights to the products of their own plots. This fact strengthens the ties within the household and de-emphasizes more extended kinship relations. Everybody has a strong obligation to work for and to support the members of his own household, but owes little of an economic or material nature (as opposed to legal responsibility) to more distant kinsmen.' <sup id="cite_ref-907" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-907">[907]</a></sup> Individuals who had planted fruit trees were entitled to first fruits: 'Fruit trees are more important. In some villages oranges ( kumila, narang) or areca nuts ( gui) have become important cash crops, overshadowing even cotton. Oranges have not been grown successfully in Rengsanggri, and areca palms are recently introduced and still scarce, but other fruit is grown for local use in considerable quantity. Whoever plants a tree always has a special claim to its fruit, but no one denies to others the right of picking it for immediate use. Generally when a fruit is in season there is an ample supply for everyone, and since there is little cash market for most kinds, no one is proprietary about the crop. Jackfruit ( tebrong) is the commonest, and almost every man owns a few jackfruit trees. When the fruits ripen, everyone gorges himself for two or three happy if occasionally dyspeptic weeks. Other fruit trees-among them pomelo ( jambura), lemon ( temachu), papaya ( modipol), guava ( kompiram) and tamarind ( cheng)-are found in smaller numbers, and are often eaten mainly by the children.' lds. After this, to move the sticks is said to cause blindness.' <sup id="cite_ref-908" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-908">[908]</a></sup> Land was passed on to one daughter only: 'In Garo society the most important social group is the clan known as MACHONG. A machong is an exogamous matrilineal descent group wherein a Garo is automatically assigned by birth to the unilineal group of his mother. A CHATCHI (moiety) is divided into many machong. Each married couple chooses one daughter--or, if they have none, they adopt a close relative of the mother--to be heiress (NAKNA DONQIPIKA MECHIK) of the family. Her husband traditionally is selected from the lineage group of the father and is accepted as the NOKROM of the house. He resides with his wife in her parents' house. He has to take on the responsibility of looking after his parents-in-law during their old age, and his wife inherits the property.' <sup id="cite_ref-909" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-909">[909]</a></sup> Accordingly, heir-households differed from non-heir households. But according to Majumdar, the prosperity of a household ultimately depended more on the abilities of the father/husband: 'In the matter of possession of property we have to draw a line of difference between an old household (which is termed nok gitcham) in which the present owners inherited an already existing household from an older generation and a new household (which is termed agate nok), in which the present owners had to establish a new household of their own. In both the villages the old households get a good footing with the property accumulated in previous generations. In Wajadagiri an agate household may be given a small portion of land from the possessions of the household of origin, but other property, such as traditional heirlooms, cattle, etc. are to be acquired by the new household. However, the wealth of a household ultimately depends upon the efficiency of the head of the household. A lazy nokrom of a wealthy household may ruin the household by selling property one after another on some pretext or other. On the other hand, the diligent head of an agate household may make the new household prosperous by acquiring land and other stable property. Such a man gets much esteem from covillagers. The mahari of his wife also considers him to be a good ga’chi and he gets praise as nokdangko dakgipa (a man who have made his household). On the contrary a man who ruins an already existing household is considered to be a man of no integrity and he is reproached as nokdangko rugipa (one who has broken the household). It is not necessary that an old household will always be a wealthy household. In Matchakolgiri among the 9 old households the total valuation of property is Rs. 4,812 and among the 6 new households the total valuation is Rs. 2,850; thus the average valuation of property of one old household is Rs. 534.66 and one new household is Rs. 475. Whereas in Wajadagiri the total valuation of 10 old households is Rs. 19,152 and that of 13 new households Rs. 15,361. Thus the average values are Rs. 1,915.20 and Rs. 1,180.84 respectively. In Matchakolgiri, due to the general absence of landed property and decreasing value of traditional heirlooms a new household stands on the same level as an old household after a few years of getting itself established. For this reason the difference between the new and old households is very little. On the other hand, the difference between the old and new households is very great in Wajadagiri. It is expectable, because, here, where landed property forms the major part of the possessions of a household, new households get only a little share of land, if at all, from their households of origin. Those new households which did not get any share of land from their original households, had to find land for themselves, and land had already become scarce. Old households migrating to Wajadagiri in recent years had to face the same difficulty; as a consequence, many households which have been classed as old households (because those were old households in their original villages) possess very little land. In the figures presented above such old households have also been included, and thus the total for all old households combined has been much lowered. Otherwise, the difference between [Page 130] the old and the new households of Wajadagiri would have been still greater.' <sup id="cite_ref-910" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-910">[910]</a></sup> Village headmen, i.e. husbands of heiresses from senior households, formally held titles to land: 'Perhaps the most important single characteristic of a nokma is the possession of titles to land. The land which surrounds a village is divided into numerous patches, and titles to these patches are typically distributed among a few of the richest households of the village, including those of the nokmas. A plot of land to which a man holds title is known as a’king, and a nokma who holds a title is known as an a’king nokma. Titles to a’king can be bought and sold among members of the village; [Page 226] however, at the present time sale is unusual, and land titles often stay in the same family for generations, always being inherited intact by the heir and heiress of the last title-holders. Prices in the past have varied from 25 to 75 rupees for the amount of land suitable for one family’s cultivation; on the other hand, titles even today are sometimes purchased with brass gongs instead of money.' <sup id="cite_ref-911" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-911">[911]</a></sup> ‘In a Garo village very little difference of status is seen. A particular clan holds right of ownership of the village homestead and shifting cultivation lands, and the title of ownership is inherited by a particular household. The head of the land-owning household is known as the  nokma, and the particular area under which he holds ownership right is known as   a’king. He also acts as the religious head of the village, and he is to perform the ceremonies for the general well-being of the village. He is called upon to settle disputes between villagers. But in all his decisions he is guided by the elders of the village. He is not entitled to any tribute from the villagers, and he has no special paraphernalia to indicate himself as the  nokma. However, in the village a rich man gets respect, because in times of need people have to seek help from him. But in a Garo village it is usually very rare to find an extremely rich man. To a Garo wealth consists of a number of brass gongs called  rang and some ornaments made of silver or some such metal. Now-a-days a gun is also regarded as the status symbol of a wealthy man.’ <sup id="cite_ref-912" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-912">[912]</a></sup> The above information indicates that, while individual families were allotted plots for shifting cultivation, the land itself was owned by the matrilineage, attached to heiresses and managed by the latters' husbands. The rights retained by individual families are therefore best described as usufruct rights rather than entitlements to private property. It appears that private property in land was introduced in the colonial and post-colonial periods together with the introduction of wet cultivation: 'Once land has been prepared for wet cultivation it can, of course, be cultivated year after year and need no longer be retired periodically like dry fields. The district government has recognized the right of the man who clears land to use it continuously, but has demanded the payment of an annual land tax. Within a few years after preparation, the clearer can expect his lands to be surveyed by the district government, and thereafter to be taxed. This arrangement is not entirely unwelcome, since his name is recorded at the same time and he is thus officially recognized as having the right to cultivate the land. However, the clearer does not immediately have full ownership. Rather, his rights first amount only to what is locally known as “temporary patta,” which is a grant of rights of usufruct. Normally such land can be inherited in the usual fashion but cannot be sold, and if timber should be standing on the land, the government reserves the right to prevent its being cut. [Page 306] Moreover, if the government should require the use of the land for such purposes as road-building, the cultivator must surrender his plot without compensation. After a good many years the land may be converted to “permanent patta.” The cultivator then has full ownership rights, including the right of sale and the right to compensation if the land is needed for government purposes. He continues to pay a tax to the district government in proportion to the amount of land registered in his name. Tax on wet rice land is collected by a number of special tax officials called mausidars, each of whom has jurisdiction over a certain area. Under the mausidars are lesser officials in charge of the land records of the smaller “circles.” Villagers in plains areas may pay a land tax but no house tax. House tax alone is collected in villages with no wet rice, but some villages have to pay both. House tax, unlike land tax, however, is channeled through the loskor. Land held under “permanent patta” is bought and sold from time to time. The price paid for the land is agreed to by buyer and seller. Such prices have not been exorbitant in terms of the value of the crop which it can produce; they rarely amount to more than three times the value of the annual crop, and are sometimes even less. New land potentially usable for wet cultivation has been available readily enough to prevent serious bidding up of the land values, and Garos have not been cultivating in this manner long enough to have come to place great faith in land as an investment. Even so, this type of private land ownership has helped to alter the distribution of wealth quite sharply in villages where it has become important. Inevitably some people show more foresight than others in opening wet plots, and in many areas of long-established wet rice cultivation a few large proprietors own more land than they are able to cultivate by their own labor. They therefore either hire labor or, more often, let their land out on shares to others who have failed to acquire wet fields. When land is thus worked on shares, the owner generally provides the seed, but the harvest is split equally between the [Page 307] owner and the cultivator. The owner may also advance rice for the cultivator and his family to eat, without changing any interest; but the rice must be paid back at the time of the harvest. Such a loan is looked upon as a distinct advantage for the cultivator, since only in this way can he avoid heavy interest on a rice loan. Working on shares has not yet led to a serious problem of absentee land ownership, for even the largest proprietor usually lets out only part of his land, and retains enough for his family to work themselves. He and his tenant continue to do the same kind of labor, to live in the same village, and to treat each other as social equals, the contractual relationship not giving rise to any marked status differences. Nevertheless, such an agreement gives a pronounced economic advantage to the owner, for he gets half his tenant’s harvest in return for very little work or responsibility. Since many villages with large areas of wet rice land include a number of families who own no wet fields at all, while there are other families who control three or four times as much land as they require for their own use, these villages are often marked by a greater disparity in income than are those which depend entirely upon traditional methods of cultivation. In wet rice areas this variation in wealth is often immediately apparent to the most casual visitor. Such a village may have two or three large plank houses with corrugated iron roofs-structures more solid, permanent, and elegant than the traditional bamboo houses, if not much more comfortable. At the same time, other villagers are likely to live in small bamboo shacks which the people of Rengsanggri would hardly consider decent.' <sup id="cite_ref-913" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-913">[913]</a></sup> Roy describes a patchwork of collective and individual ownership and cultivation patterns: 'Traditionally, the Garos living in the hills subsist by slash-and-burn cultivation. The iron hoe, chopper, and wooden digging stick are essential appliances. Human labor continue to be the principal source of energy. Very often in some areas a plot allotted to a family remains under-used because of an insufficient number of workers and the low level of technology. To survive the erratic nature of monsoons, mixed crops--both wet and dry varieties--are planted. A shifting cultivator plants a wide assortment of crops consisting of rice (mainly dry varieties), millet, maize and many root crops, vegetables, etc. In addition to these, cotton, ginger, and chili peppers are commonly raised as cash crops. All crops are harvested in October. At present the available strips of low and flat land lying between the hillocks or hills are used for permanent wet cultivation. The variety of crops cultivated is like that of the neighboring plains peoples. Such lands are owned individually. Additional production from such plots places the villagers in a better economic condition. The expansion of the modern economy and the steady increase of population are causing constant pressure on traditionally-worked plots. The same plot is used almost continuously in some areas thus leading to the decline in annual production. This trend is evident from the 1981 census report, which estimates that about 50 percent of the Garo people are now solely dependent on shifting cultivation and the rest use a part of a jhum plot permanently for areca nut, oranges, tea (on a small scale), pineapples, etc. In this changing situation a producer may not always be a consumer; and reciprocity and cooperation do not exist as a dominant force in the socioeconomic life of this population.' <sup id="cite_ref-914" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-914">[914]</a></sup> 'Land for shifting cultivation is owned by the clan. Each village has a traditionally demarcated area of its own termed ADOK. This area is subdivided into plots that are used for cultivation in a cyclic order. The plots are distributed to the families. Allotment of the general plots is done by common consensus of the village elders. But the flat area for permanent wet cultivation is owned by individuals.' <sup id="cite_ref-915" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-915">[915]</a></sup> This affected labour exchange patterns: 'There would appear to be somewhat less mutuality in labor exchange in areas of intensive wet rice agriculture. Not only can land be loaned to others on a sharecropping basis, but agricultural labor can sometimes be hired, especially at transplanting and harvest, when the demands of labor are particularly heavy. Labor is also sometimes hired for house-building, a practice unknown in Rengsanggri. Even when labor is given without payment, it is more often calculated and paid back in closely equivalent amounts, and less often given freely, than in the more traditional areas. In some plains areas, unlike Rengsanggri, money is also loaned at interest. Perhaps the relatively diverse origins of the people of wet rice areas makes traditional free labor exchange more difficult. One cannot so easily rely on the ancient bonds of kinship to supply the help that may be needed.' <sup id="cite_ref-916" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-916">[916]</a></sup> 'The household is the working unit in permanent cultivation also. Some of the households of Wajadagiri engage agricultural labourers for the whole agricultural season, whose day to day expenditures are borne by the household concerned and a remuneration of 12 to 15 maunds of paddy (the rate prevailing in 1965) is to be given at the end of the winter harvest. This remuneration is paid even though the person engaged is related to the husband or to the wife. The person who is thus engaged is known as chaparikgipa, and he is expected to help in all agricultural activities. Additional labour required at the time of transplantation is procured by the system of ajak and this happens to be the only feature which we find common in shifting cultivation of Matchakolgiri and permanent cultivation of Wajadagiri. However, in Matchakolgiri the system of ajak is not confined to agricultural activities only. It is used for getting labour for other purposes also, such as in constructing a house, in cutting of thatching grass, etc. But in non-agricultural activities usually only a meal is provided and no remuneration in cash or kind is given. Harvesting and thrashing are done with the help of annual agricultural labourers. At the time of winnowing, neighbouring villages help each other and the owner has to feed the helpers and sometimes provides one or two pitchers of beer.' <sup id="cite_ref-917" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-917">[917]</a></sup> We are unsure when precisely this change occurred. We have provisionally coded 'present', but this is open to review.

This arrangement is not entirely unwelcome, since his name is recorded at the same time and he is thus officially recognized as having the right to cultivate the land. However, the clearer does not immediately have full ownership. Rather, his rights first amount only to what is locally known as “temporary patta,” which is a grant of rights of usufruct. Normally such land can be inherited in the usual fashion but cannot be sold, and if timber should be standing on the land, the government reserves the right to prevent its being cut. [Page 306] Moreover, if the government should require the use of the land for such purposes as road-building, the cultivator must surrender his plot without compensation. After a good many years the land may be converted to “permanent patta.” The cultivator then has full ownership rights, including the right of sale and the right to compensation if the land is needed for government purposes. He continues to pay a tax to the district government in proportion to the amount of land registered in his name. Tax on wet rice land is collected by a number of special tax officials called mausidars, each of whom has jurisdiction over a certain area. Under the mausidars are lesser officials in charge of the land records of the smaller “circles.” Villagers in plains areas may pay a land tax but no house tax. House tax alone is collected in villages with no wet rice, but some villages have to pay both. House tax, unlike land tax, however, is channeled through the loskor. Land held under “permanent patta” is bought and sold from time to time. The price paid for the land is agreed to by buyer and seller. Such prices have not been exorbitant in terms of the value of the crop which it can produce; they rarely amount to more than three times the value of the annual crop, and are sometimes even less. New land potentially usable for wet cultivation has been available readily enough to prevent serious bidding up of the land values, and Garos have not been cultivating in this manner long enough to have come to place great faith in land as an investment. Even so, this type of private land ownership has helped to alter the distribution of wealth quite sharply in villages where it has become important. Inevitably some people show more foresight than others in opening wet plots, and in many areas of long-established wet rice cultivation a few large proprietors own more land than they are able to cultivate by their own labor. They therefore either hire labor or, more often, let their land out on shares to others who have failed to acquire wet fields. When land is thus worked on shares, the owner generally provides the seed, but the harvest is split equally between the [Page 307] owner and the cultivator. The owner may also advance rice for the cultivator and his family to eat, without changing any interest; but the rice must be paid back at the time of the harvest. Such a loan is looked upon as a distinct advantage for the cultivator, since only in this way can he avoid heavy interest on a rice loan. Working on shares has not yet led to a serious problem of absentee land ownership, for even the largest proprietor usually lets out only part of his land, and retains enough for his family to work themselves. He and his tenant continue to do the same kind of labor, to live in the same village, and to treat each other as social equals, the contractual relationship not giving rise to any marked status differences. Nevertheless, such an agreement gives a pronounced economic advantage to the owner, for he gets half his tenant’s harvest in return for very little work or responsibility. Since many villages with large areas of wet rice land include a number of families who own no wet fields at all, while there are other families who control three or four times as much land as they require for their own use, these villages are often marked by a greater disparity in income than are those which depend entirely upon traditional methods of cultivation. In wet rice areas this variation in wealth is often immediately apparent to the most casual visitor. Such a village may have two or three large plank houses with corrugated iron roofs-structures more solid, permanent, and elegant than the traditional bamboo houses, if not much more comfortable. At the same time, other villagers are likely to live in small bamboo shacks which the people of Rengsanggri would hardly consider decent.' <sup id="cite_ref-927" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-927">[927]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Exclusivity ♣ present ♥</b> Individual families retained usufruct rights over the plots allotted to them and were entitled to the produce fromt their harvest; however, the land ultimately belonged to the clan (see above).

We have provisionally assumed so. Personal property was introduced in the colonial and post-colonial periods; we have presumed exclusivity here once usufruct rights in government lands were converted to individual rights in land: 'Land for shifting cultivation is owned by the clan.

<dd><b>♠ Partibility ♣ present ♥</b> We have found no indication for partibility in inheritance. Land was passed on to one daughter only (see above and below). Exchange and trading of titles among households under male stewardship remain in need of further elaboration.

<dd><b>♠ Lease ♣ present ♥</b> Burling describes a number of asymmetrical transactions: 'The relationships that have been considered so far are, at least in the long run, roughly symmetrical, since both parties give and receive approximately the same thing. The initial contribution may not be paid back for many years and the amounts may be hardly counted, let alone balanced; or, on the other hand, labor may be repaid the next day in closely measured quantities. Ultimately, however, the amounts given and received should be more or less equal. Other transactions take place between the various households of a village which are not even in the long run symmetrical, but in which the goods or services exchanged are quite different. Inevitably some households do slightly better than others in agriculture. Some have a larger percentage of able-bodied workers, more industrious or ambitious members, or less sickness; or by good fortune they acquire better land one year. These fortunate households obtain the larger crops. This advantage can, by skillful manipulation, be translated into reasonably enduring differences in wealth and prestige. It is the purpose of the following pages to show how this comes about.' <sup id="cite_ref-931" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-931">[931]</a></sup> 'Meat Payment for Services. The man who carves a memorial post to be erected before the house of a dead man receives the leg of a cow in return for his labors. The midwife and the priest who sacrifices at a birth may also each be compensated with a leg of a cow. These legs are the closest approach to a wage in the traditional village exchange system, but they involve only a relatively small resource and are regarded more as a traditional gift than as a real payment. The other asymmetrical transactions are more important in their over-all effect on the distribution of wealth.' <sup id="cite_ref-932" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-932">[932]</a></sup> 'A’jak. When people find themselves short of food before the harvest, they may be forced to ask a richer neighbor to advance some grain in return for the promise of labor. In the usual arrangement, one full winnowing basket of paddy is given in return for the promise of the work of six people for a day in the fields. The debt may be repaid soon after the paddy is given, but it may be delayed for a month or more until the man who advances the grain requires the labor. The workers are given their midday meal of rice and curry, but they are not otherwise compensated, since they have received the paddy earlier. Since most households are unable to supply six workers from their own numbers, they must often obtain the assistance of friends from other households, and the friends must then be repaid by baraa, as described above. Thus if household A can supply four workers, it may get two more people from household B to join them on the appropriate day when they work together on the land of the man who had advanced paddy to A. Then, on the next day or soon afterward, two people from household A will go to work on B’s land to return their help.' <sup id="cite_ref-933" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-933">[933]</a></sup> 'Garos realize that a’jak brings a profit to the lender. The amount of labor he receives is worth more than the cost of the paddy he gives, and indeed wage labor when it is available brings pay two or three times as high as a’jak; but wage labor is not widely available. The only justification for the small amount of grain given in a’jak is that it is the borrower who comes to ask [Page 202] for it rather than the supplier who looks for labor. The poor man, of course, is hungry and hardly in a position to bargain. A’jak enables a man who one year has large stocks of paddy in his possession to clear a large amount of land, counting on requests for a’jak to furnish labor to keep it cultivated and even to help at planting and harvesting. This enables him to reap a better harvest the following year, and thus to maintain his wealth. Poor people, on the other hand, are forced to accept a’jak from others, so that during the season when they should be attending to their own fields they may have to spend an inconvenient number of days working in other men’s fields; thus they in turn get a small crop of their own and once again, the next year, are in the awkward situation of having to accept a’jak. In this way differences in wealth, once established, can be perpetuated over many years, and even over generations, regardless of the absence of permanent land ownership. The inequality should not be exaggerated. Poor families who tighten their belts and work hard in their fields can and sometimes do extricate themselves, and rich people can lose their wealth if they do not manage their crops carefully. Wealth differentials are not as marked or as permanent as they can be where land is permanently and privately owned. Gajang, the ‘headman’ of Rengsanggri, is reputed to have given about twenty winnowing baskets of paddy before the 1956 harvest, and eight other households were said to have given amounts ranging from this down to as little as a basket or two. The total amount given was somewhat less than usual that year because the availability of wage labor on a new road that was being built near by cut down the demand for a’jak.' <sup id="cite_ref-934" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-934">[934]</a></sup> 'Dena. Some people with large supplies of grain loan it to others with the agreement that instead of being paid back in labor, they will be paid back double the amount of grain at the time of the harvest. This is not as common as a’jak, but its effect is much the same, since it allows differences in wealth to be perpetuated. Occasionally rice is loaned, but in much smaller [Page 203] amounts and with the agreement only to pay back the same amount. Such a loan is called srua, and is made only where claims such as kinship can be invoked. It is a friendly helping gesture, not a business deal like a’jak or dena. Grain in Rengsanggri is never loaned at intermediate rates; the interest charge is 100 per cent or nothing. In other parts of the Garo Hills repayment at the rate of one and one-half times the original amount is sometimes agreed upon.' <sup id="cite_ref-935" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-935">[935]</a></sup> However, none of these asymmetrical transactions seem to constitute lease arrangements. But it appears that in the colonial and post-colonial periods, owners of land suitable for permanent cultivation loaned land to sharecroppers: 'Once land has been prepared for wet cultivation it can, of course, be cultivated year after year and need no longer be retired periodically like dry fields.

Not only can land be loaned to others on a sharecropping basis, but agricultural labor can sometimes be hired, especially at transplanting and harvest, when the demands of labor are particularly heavy. Labor is also sometimes hired for house-building, a practice unknown in Rengsanggri. Even when labor is given without payment, it is more often calculated and paid back in closely equivalent amounts, and less often given freely, than in the more traditional areas. In some plains areas, unlike Rengsanggri, money is also loaned at interest. Perhaps the relatively diverse origins of the people of wet rice areas makes traditional free labor exchange more difficult. One cannot so easily rely on the ancient bonds of kinship to supply the help that may be needed.' <sup id="cite_ref-937" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-937">[937]</a></sup> 'The household is the working unit in permanent cultivation also. Some of the households of Wajadagiri engage agricultural labourers for the whole agricultural season, whose day to day expenditures are borne by the household concerned and a remuneration of 12 to 15 maunds of paddy (the rate prevailing in 1965) is to be given at the end of the winter harvest. This remuneration is paid even though the person engaged is related to the husband or to the wife. The person who is thus engaged is known as chaparikgipa, and he is expected to help in all agricultural activities. Additional labour required at the time of transplantation is procured by the system of ajak and this happens to be the only feature which we find common in shifting cultivation of Matchakolgiri and permanent cultivation of Wajadagiri. However, in Matchakolgiri the system of ajak is not confined to agricultural activities only. It is used for getting labour for other purposes also, such as in constructing a house, in cutting of thatching grass, etc. But in non-agricultural activities usually only a meal is provided and no remuneration in cash or kind is given. Harvesting and thrashing are done with the help of annual agricultural labourers. At the time of winnowing, neighbouring villages help each other and the owner has to feed the helpers and sometimes provides one or two pitchers of beer.' <sup id="cite_ref-938" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-938">[938]</a></sup>

But the flat area for permanent wet cultivation is owned by individuals.' <sup id="cite_ref-940" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-940">[940]</a></sup> Land was passed on to one daughter only: 'In Garo society the most important social group is the clan known as MACHONG. A machong is an exogamous matrilineal descent group wherein a Garo is automatically assigned by birth to the unilineal group of his mother. A CHATCHI (moiety) is divided into many machong. Each married couple chooses one daughter--or, if they have none, they adopt a close relative of the mother--to be heiress (NAKNA DONQIPIKA MECHIK) of the family. Her husband traditionally is selected from the lineage group of the father and is accepted as the NOKROM of the house. He resides with his wife in her parents' house. He has to take on the responsibility of looking after his parents-in-law during their old age, and his wife inherits the property.' <sup id="cite_ref-941" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-941">[941]</a></sup> 'Property among the Garos is inherited in the female line. One of the daughters is selected by the parents to be the heiress. If the couple have no female child, a girl belonging to the machong of the wife (preferably the daughter of her sister, whether real or classificatory) is adopted to be an heiress. She is not considered to be the absolute owner of the property. Decision about the disposal of property is taken by her husband, who is considered to be the household authority (NOKNI SKOTONG). After the death of the father-in-law responsibility transfers to the son-in-law. If a dead man is survived by a widow, she stays in the family of her daughter and is sometimes referred to as an additional wife (JIK) of her daughter's husband.' <sup id="cite_ref-942" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-942">[942]</a></sup> Burling describes the process of selecting an heiress: 'The first step in arranging a marriage of heirs is the choice by the parents of one of their daughters as heiress. Because they need a girl to perform these duties, Garo parents welcome a [Page 78] daughter more than a son, though if they have many children, they say that they like best to have some of each. However, even if a couple should have no daughters, they can adopt a close relative who will come into their home and assume the duties of an actual daughter.' <sup id="cite_ref-943" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-943">[943]</a></sup> 'Most women have at least one daughter of their own so they do not have to adopt another. A single daughter automatically becomes the heiress, but if a woman has more than one, a choice must be made. Garos simply say that they choose whichever girl loves her mother the most, or whichever is the hardest worker; but age also has a bearing upon the decision. The oldest of several girls is rarely chosen since she is likely to be too near the age of her mother, who will have no need of support until she is older. Most people prefer to wait until they draw near the age when they grow feeble before filling the house with a son-in-law and grandchildren. But if the parents so desire, even the oldest daughter may become heiress. Aling had a slightly withered leg, which made it difficult for him to do [Page 80] the heaviest labor. He and his wife, therefore, chose the oldest of their several daughters as heiress so that their household would acquire another adult man as soon as possible. Under more normal circumstances the youngest daughter is a more likely choice than the oldest, but there is no fixed rule either way. Rather, it is a matter for the personal decision of the family members. Since the choice is often made while the girls are still small, they have less to say about it than their parents, though their desires are taken into account if they are old enough. The decision is largely the parents’, and especially the mother’s.' <sup id="cite_ref-944" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-944">[944]</a></sup> Choudhury describes some conditions that apply to the status of heiress: 'Selection of the Nokna from amongst the daughters of a family and the Nokrom as well is a very important matter for a Garo family. After the selection of the Nokna she alone becomes the heiress of the property of the family and it is she who can exercise all rights over it; her sisters lose all claims over it. But if the Nokna does not reside with her parents and likes to live separately with her husband elsewhere she, as of course loses the noknaship and a different daughter is taken as the Nokna of the house. Even if the lady becomes unfaithful to her husband either by committing adultery or by some other reasons then also she loses the claim over the property. If she is divorced by her husband she loses the noknaship, the husband also having no claim either over the property. The man is provided with a wife by the machong of his divorced wife and he enjoys the property of the second wife till he lives with her. After the death of the man the new wife gets the property and after her her daughter gets it. If the husband becomes unfaithful to his legally married wife and is divorced by the latter he forfeits all the rights which he used to exercise over the property; he is to get out of the house leaving his wife, the children and the property. The lady is provided with a husband from her divorced husband’s clan. In case a lady becomes a widow having any daughter from her husband she is entitled to take a man as her spouse from the machong to which her deceased husband belonged.

<p><b>♠ Other property ownership ♣ present ♥</b> Movables and clothing were treated as personal possessions: 'Clothing, personal ornaments (excepting, however, valuable ornaments, such as siliting, senki etc., which are regarded as family heirlooms), luxury articles purchased by young people (such as flash lights, cigarette-lighters, fountain pens, knives, etc.) are regarded as personal possessions. These can be sold or transferred at the discretion of the possessors.' <sup id="cite_ref-949" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-949">[949]</a></sup> 'The Garos used to make the following items: carved wooden shields (SPEE); baskets of different types; different varieties of drum--GAMBIL, KRAM, and NAKIK; pipes (ADIL) made of buffalo horn; flutes of bamboo; GONOGINA (Jew's harp) made of bamboo.' <sup id="cite_ref-950" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-950">[950]</a></sup> In practice, sharing of goods between husband and wife was common: 'Material goods owned by a couple are essentially family property, though some of them are of course used more by the husband and some more by the wife. Only their separate clothing is really personal property. Since widowed people generally remain in the family of the heir after the spouse’s death, such demise does not lead to division of the goods. The question of division of the goods arises only in the case of divorce, and even then the husband usually simply departs with a few items of personal clothing, while everything else is left to the wife. Ordinarily a husband and wife expect to stay married, and their property and resources are completely merged.' <sup id="cite_ref-951" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-951">[951]</a></sup> Wealth was mostly stored in the form of valuable objects, such as gongs: ‘Gongs vary according to metal and workmanship, and range in price from cheap ones worth only a few rupees to elegant ones worth several hundred. Garos recognize more than a dozen kinds, measuring anywhere from perhaps a yard in diameter down to no more than a few inches, and variously made of iron, brass, or bell metal. Some of the finest gongs are decorated with engraved outlines of elephants, tigers, snakes, and other animals. No one seems to know the origin of these gongs, and the Garos consider them to have been handed down from antiquity. Most of them, including the ordinary ones that are beaten at festivals, are more or less basin-shaped and can be held by one rim and struck on the bottom. The most valuable gongs are never beaten but only displayed at the  Wangala festival. A gong worth several hundred rupees is an extremely valuable piece of property to a Garo, who can hardly hope by wage labor to earn more than two rupees in one day. Like other heirlooms they can be sold for money, and so they represent a saving which can be cashed in if the family runs into difficulties, but heirlooms are sold only at infrequent intervals and with great reluctance. Garos reckon the rise and fall of families by the number of gongs they are able to buy or are forced to sell.’ <sup id="cite_ref-952" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-952">[952]</a></sup> A’chik attended markets in order to barter goods: 'A few centuries ago the Garos were famous for headhunting. That practice constrained the neighboring population of the plains from entering the hills. But people must exchange their produce to meet their requirements, and both hill and plains Garos needed such trade. Hence some trade started at border points on a very limited scale. Over time, these contacts grew into organized HUTTA (weekly markets) under the initiative of the Zamindars, who were subjects of the Muslim ruler. Initially cotton was exchanged in silent barter for pigs, cattle, goat, tobacco and metallic tools.' <sup id="cite_ref-953" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-953">[953]</a></sup> Some A’chik heirlooms may be derived from this practice: 'Though after getting themselves settled in the hills they had no close and constant contact with the inhabitants of the adjoining plains we cannot assume a period when they had no contact of some kind or other with their neighbours. Batches of Garo villagers going to markets situated far away in the plains is a common theme in Garo folklore. From very early times the Garo had to come to the markets situated in the plains for selling their produce, such as, cotton, betel leaves, chilli, etc. and for purchasing commodities of their daily necessity which they not produce themselves, such as salt, dry fish, iron implements, ornaments, etc. I found that some very old cloths, known as ba’ra marang, which are treated as family heirlooms and held in high esteem, are really silk cloth commonly used in the plains. Further, names of some types of very old heirlooms of the Garo are associated with the names of places in the adjoining plains where those things were manufactured. Such heirlooms are, Millam Singimari (a type of iron sword manufactured at Singimari, a place adjoining the northwestern tip of the district), Rang Asamkata, (a brass gong manufactured at Asamkata, a village in the Goalpara district adjoining the western border of the district). But such contacts were not very effective to change their way of life, because only a few able bodied men could travel to the plains and their visits were very casual.' <sup id="cite_ref-954" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-954">[954]</a></sup> Majumdar provides a general description of heirlooms: 'Traditional heirlooms include mainly three items: (1) Ornaments such as senki (which is a girdle made of beads used by the women) and silining (which is a silver chain worn round the neck by the women). Of these the first is no longer in use, and people keep these only, as valuable [Page 125] possessions, not for any use. (2) Ba’ra marang (which is a ceremonial cloth probably bought from the plains in very ancient times). (3) Brass gongs (known as rang), which are beaten with small bamboo sticks on different ceremonial occasions. The mode of attributing value to these articles is peculiar. Each article has its value fixed (in terms of money) traditionally and this traditional value has nothing to do with the face value. Thus a rang, the traditional value of which is Rs. 500 or Rs. 600 may really worth Rs. 30 or so, or may be even less than that. This traditional value has practically nothing to do with workmanship or material, provided the article conforms to the general specifications. Certain articles of particular origin were considered to be more valuable. For instasce, a rang bought from a place called Asamkata (a place in the plains of Goalpara, not very far from the western border of the Garo Hills) was considered more valuable than others. In olden days people used to invest money in heirlooms, because these increased the prestige of the household. On the second day of the Wangala festival the collection of gongs of a household used to be brought out and exhibited publicly. Villagers discussed about their prices, and the history of the acquirement of each, and it used to be a matter of pride for the members of the household. But nowadays the traditional value of such heirlooms has come down to a great extent. Conversion has greatly affected the value of traditional heirlooms, though it cannot be said that conversion is solely responsible for this phenomenon. Christian converts no longer accept the traditional value of such heirlooms. After conversion a household usually disposes of such articles. However, among the songsarek these have not yet entirely lost their value, as even now they purchase such articles, though at very low prices.' <sup id="cite_ref-955" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-955">[955]</a></sup> Gift-giving mostly involved movables, especially gongs: 'Kokam. The final long-term but symmetrical exchange between households is more carefully measured than those mentioned previously. It also differs from the rest in that it frequently takes place between households in different villages rather than those in the same village, and it is always between kinsmen. One category of gifts which the household of the dead person distributes at funerals is called kokam. (The other category, magual, was considered in Chapter VI.) Kokam is a payment given to those who slaughter a cow in honor of the deceased. Slaughtering may be done by a son, but also by a more distant relative, whether a member of the same lineage or not, and it is frequently done by the man who leads a party from another village to attend a funeral. Killing a cow brings honor both to the deceased and to the man who organizes the killing, and the occasion provides a fine meal to the friends and relatives who help. The organizer receives the kokam from the household of the dead man, and like magual this is most appropriately a brass heirloom gong, though something else may be substituted if no gongs are available. The gong is carried back to the organizer’s village, where the cow is killed and a slender wooden post erected to advertise the event. The gong thus acquired can be used for nothing other than to be returned to the original family when somebody in the acquiring family dies. At that time the original family must sacrifice a cow in return. In other words, the kokam gifts form a symbolic record of the obligations that are set up for returning the honor of killing a [Page 200] cow, and in this way households bestow honor upon one another. One man may be followed in death by several cows. A rich man who has many gongs which can be distributed, and who in the past has collected gongs in return for having killed cows in other people’s honor, will have more killed for him than a poor man; and, moreover, people are more likely to want to give honor to a rich man. When Tuak, the father-in-law of Anat, died, ten cows were killed in his honor; but Tuak was a very wealthy and respected man in Rengsanggri. Others die in humbler circumstances, and a few have no cow killed for them at all. Kokam may be distributed and cows slaughtered for both men and women, but the amounts tend to be a good deal larger for men.' <sup id="cite_ref-956" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-956">[956]</a></sup> Concerning the colonial and post-colonial periods, Roy mentions commercial pottery and weaving: 'Each family in a traditional context acts as a self-contained economic unit. Modernization has brought some changes in the socioeconomic sphere of this population. The Garos residing in the hills did not weave cloth a few decades back; they used to procure thick cloth known as KANCHA from the plains Garos. Now that the loom has been introduced in the hill areas, they weave DOKMANDE (a kind of cloth) for commercial purposes as well as for their personal use. Previously each family used to make pottery for its domestic use, nowadays the art is confined to a few families only who either sell or barter it.' <sup id="cite_ref-957" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-957">[957]</a></sup> Trade was monetized in the colonial and post-colonial periods: 'A few centuries ago the Garos were famous for headhunting.

Over time, these contacts grew into organized HUTTA (weekly markets) under the initiative of the Zamindars, who were subjects of the Muslim ruler. Initially cotton was exchanged in silent barter for pigs, cattle, goat, tobacco and metallic tools. This trade has continued to the present, with increasing involvement of peoples from the neighboring areas, and has now become fully monetized. Cotton, ginger and, dried chilies produced by the Garos are sold to the traders. The Garos in turn purchase pottery, metallic tools, and other industrial goods such as cloth from the traders.' <sup id="cite_ref-958" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-958">[958]</a></sup>

But the flat area for permanent wet cultivation is owned by individuals.' <sup id="cite_ref-960" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-960">[960]</a></sup> Land was passed on to one daughter only: 'In Garo society the most important social group is the clan known as MACHONG. A machong is an exogamous matrilineal descent group wherein a Garo is automatically assigned by birth to the unilineal group of his mother. A CHATCHI (moiety) is divided into many machong. Each married couple chooses one daughter--or, if they have none, they adopt a close relative of the mother--to be heiress (NAKNA DONQIPIKA MECHIK) of the family. Her husband traditionally is selected from the lineage group of the father and is accepted as the NOKROM of the house. He resides with his wife in her parents' house.

One of the daughters is selected by the parents to be the heiress.

She is not considered to be the absolute owner of the property. Decision about the disposal of property is taken by her husband, who is considered to be the household authority (NOKNI SKOTONG). After the death of the father-in-law responsibility transfers to the son-in-law. If a dead man is survived by a widow, she stays in the family of her daughter and is sometimes referred to as an additional wife (JIK) of her daughter's husband.' <sup id="cite_ref-962" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-962">[962]</a></sup> Burling describes the process of selecting an heiress: 'The first step in arranging a marriage of heirs is the choice by the parents of one of their daughters as heiress. Because they need a girl to perform these duties, Garo parents welcome a [Page 78] daughter more than a son, though if they have many children, they say that they like best to have some of each. However, even if a couple should have no daughters, they can adopt a close relative who will come into their home and assume the duties of an actual daughter.' <sup id="cite_ref-963" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-963">[963]</a></sup> 'Most women have at least one daughter of their own so they do not have to adopt another. A single daughter automatically becomes the heiress, but if a woman has more than one, a choice must be made. Garos simply say that they choose whichever girl loves her mother the most, or whichever is the hardest worker; but age also has a bearing upon the decision. The oldest of several girls is rarely chosen since she is likely to be too near the age of her mother, who will have no need of support until she is older. Most people prefer to wait until they draw near the age when they grow feeble before filling the house with a son-in-law and grandchildren. But if the parents so desire, even the oldest daughter may become heiress. Aling had a slightly withered leg, which made it difficult for him to do [Page 80] the heaviest labor. He and his wife, therefore, chose the oldest of their several daughters as heiress so that their household would acquire another adult man as soon as possible. Under more normal circumstances the youngest daughter is a more likely choice than the oldest, but there is no fixed rule either way. Rather, it is a matter for the personal decision of the family members. Since the choice is often made while the girls are still small, they have less to say about it than their parents, though their desires are taken into account if they are old enough. The decision is largely the parents’, and especially the mother’s.' <sup id="cite_ref-964" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-964">[964]</a></sup> Accordingly, the A’chik practiced primogeniture inheritance by only females.</dd>

If a dead man is survived by a widow, she stays in the family of her daughter and is sometimes referred to as an additional wife (JIK) of her daughter's husband.' <sup id="cite_ref-968" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-968">[968]</a></sup> Burling describes the process of selecting an heiress: 'The first step in arranging a marriage of heirs is the choice by the parents of one of their daughters as heiress. Because they need a girl to perform these duties, Garo parents welcome a [Page 78] daughter more than a son, though if they have many children, they say that they like best to have some of each. However, even if a couple should have no daughters, they can adopt a close relative who will come into their home and assume the duties of an actual daughter.' <sup id="cite_ref-969" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-969">[969]</a></sup> 'Most women have at least one daughter of their own so they do not have to adopt another. A single daughter automatically becomes the heiress, but if a woman has more than one, a choice must be made. Garos simply say that they choose whichever girl loves her mother the most, or whichever is the hardest worker; but age also has a bearing upon the decision. The oldest of several girls is rarely chosen since she is likely to be too near the age of her mother, who will have no need of support until she is older. Most people prefer to wait until they draw near the age when they grow feeble before filling the house with a son-in-law and grandchildren. But if the parents so desire, even the oldest daughter may become heiress. Aling had a slightly withered leg, which made it difficult for him to do [Page 80] the heaviest labor. He and his wife, therefore, chose the oldest of their several daughters as heiress so that their household would acquire another adult man as soon as possible. Under more normal circumstances the youngest daughter is a more likely choice than the oldest, but there is no fixed rule either way. Rather, it is a matter for the personal decision of the family members. Since the choice is often made while the girls are still small, they have less to say about it than their parents, though their desires are taken into account if they are old enough. The decision is largely the parents’, and especially the mother’s.' <sup id="cite_ref-970" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-970">[970]</a></sup> Choudhury describes some conditions that apply to the status of heiress: 'Selection of the Nokna from amongst the daughters of a family and the Nokrom as well is a very important matter for a Garo family. After the selection of the Nokna she alone becomes the heiress of the property of the family and it is she who can exercise all rights over it; her sisters lose all claims over it. But if the Nokna does not reside with her parents and likes to live separately with her husband elsewhere she, as of course loses the noknaship and a different daughter is taken as the Nokna of the house. Even if the lady becomes unfaithful to her husband either by committing adultery or by some other reasons then also she loses the claim over the property. If she is divorced by her husband she loses the noknaship, the husband also having no claim either over the property. The man is provided with a wife by the machong of his divorced wife and he enjoys the property of the second wife till he lives with her. After the death of the man the new wife gets the property and after her her daughter gets it. If the husband becomes unfaithful to his legally married wife and is divorced by the latter he forfeits all the rights which he used to exercise over the property; he is to get out of the house leaving his wife, the children and the property. The lady is provided with a husband from her divorced husband’s clan. In case a lady becomes a widow having any daughter from her husband she is entitled to take a man as her spouse from the machong to which her deceased husband belonged. If a widower or a widow cannot be provided with a suitable man or a woman within a reasonable time, either of them can marry persons from amongst the eligible clans.' <sup id="cite_ref-971" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-971">[971]</a></sup> Husbands of heiresses played a special role and had obligations towards their in-laws: 'Just as there are conflicting pressures for and against being married at all, advantages and disadvantages are likewise seen in regard to becoming an heir.

The land which surrounds a village is divided into numerous patches, and titles to these patches are typically distributed among a few of the richest households of the village, including those of the nokmas. A plot of land to which a man holds title is known as a’king, and a nokma who holds a title is known as an a’king nokma. Titles to a’king can be bought and sold among members of the village; [Page 226] however, at the present time sale is unusual, and land titles often stay in the same family for generations, always being inherited intact by the heir and heiress of the last title-holders. Prices in the past have varied from 25 to 75 rupees for the amount of land suitable for one family’s cultivation; on the other hand, titles even today are sometimes purchased with brass gongs instead of money.' <sup id="cite_ref-976" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-976">[976]</a></sup> ‘In a Garo village very little difference of status is seen.

The head of the land-owning household is known as the  nokma, and the particular area under which he holds ownership right is known as   a’king. He also acts as the religious head of the village, and he is to perform the ceremonies for the general well-being of the village. He is called upon to settle disputes between villagers. But in all his decisions he is guided by the elders of the village. He is not entitled to any tribute from the villagers, and he has no special paraphernalia to indicate himself as the  nokma. However, in the village a rich man gets respect, because in times of need people have to seek help from him. But in a Garo village it is usually very rare to find an extremely rich man.

<dd><b>♠ Trusts ♣ absent ♥</b></dd>
<dd><b>♠ State expropriation ♣ present ♥</b> The colonial and post-colonial governments occasionally expropriated land granted to A’chik villagers: 'Once land has been prepared for wet cultivation it can, of course, be cultivated year after year and need no longer be retired periodically like dry fields. The district government has recognized the right of the man who clears land to use it continuously, but has demanded the payment of an annual land tax. Within a few years after preparation, the clearer can expect his lands to be surveyed by the district government, and thereafter to be taxed. This arrangement is not entirely unwelcome, since his name is recorded at the same time and he is thus officially recognized as having the right to cultivate the land. However, the clearer does not immediately have full ownership. Rather, his rights first amount only to what is locally known as “temporary patta,” which is a grant of rights of usufruct. Normally such land can be inherited in the usual fashion but cannot be sold, and if timber should be standing on the land, the government reserves the right to prevent its being cut. [Page 306] Moreover, if the government should require the use of the land for such purposes as road-building, the cultivator must surrender his plot without compensation. After a good many years the land may be converted to “permanent patta.” The cultivator then has full ownership rights, including the right of sale and the right to compensation if the land is needed for government purposes. He continues to pay a tax to the district government in proportion to the amount of land registered in his name. Tax on wet rice land is collected by a number of special tax officials called mausidars, each of whom has jurisdiction over a certain area. Under the mausidars are lesser officials in charge of the land records of the smaller “circles.” Villagers in plains areas may pay a land tax but no house tax. House tax alone is collected in villages with no wet rice, but some villages have to pay both. House tax, unlike land tax, however, is channeled through the loskor. Land held under “permanent patta” is bought and sold from time to time. The price paid for the land is agreed to by buyer and seller. Such prices have not been exorbitant in terms of the value of the crop which it can produce; they rarely amount to more than three times the value of the annual crop, and are sometimes even less. New land potentially usable for wet cultivation has been available readily enough to prevent serious bidding up of the land values, and Garos have not been cultivating in this manner long enough to have come to place great faith in land as an investment. Even so, this type of private land ownership has helped to alter the distribution of wealth quite sharply in villages where it has become important. Inevitably some people show more foresight than others in opening wet plots, and in many areas of long-established wet rice cultivation a few large proprietors own more land than they are able to cultivate by their own labor. They therefore either hire labor or, more often, let their land out on shares to others who have failed to acquire wet fields. When land is thus worked on shares, the owner generally provides the seed, but the harvest is split equally between the [Page 307] owner and the cultivator. The owner may also advance rice for the cultivator and his family to eat, without changing any interest; but the rice must be paid back at the time of the harvest. Such a loan is looked upon as a distinct advantage for the cultivator, since only in this way can he avoid heavy interest on a rice loan. Working on shares has not yet led to a serious problem of absentee land ownership, for even the largest proprietor usually lets out only part of his land, and retains enough for his family to work themselves. He and his tenant continue to do the same kind of labor, to live in the same village, and to treat each other as social equals, the contractual relationship not giving rise to any marked status differences. Nevertheless, such an agreement gives a pronounced economic advantage to the owner, for he gets half his tenant’s harvest in return for very little work or responsibility. Since many villages with large areas of wet rice land include a number of families who own no wet fields at all, while there are other families who control three or four times as much land as they require for their own use, these villages are often marked by a greater disparity in income than are those which depend entirely upon traditional methods of cultivation. In wet rice areas this variation in wealth is often immediately apparent to the most casual visitor. Such a village may have two or three large plank houses with corrugated iron roofs-structures more solid, permanent, and elegant than the traditional bamboo houses, if not much more comfortable. At the same time, other villagers are likely to live in small bamboo shacks which the people of Rengsanggri would hardly consider decent.' <sup id="cite_ref-978" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-978">[978]</a></sup></dd>

<p><b>Marriage</b>
</p>
<dl><dd> <b>♠ Monogamy ♣ present ♥</b> Roy provides a general description of the marriage system: 'The household is the primary production and consumption unit. A Garo household comprises parents, unmarried sons and daughters, a married daughter (heiress) with her husband and their children. In principle a married granddaughter and her children should be included, but in reality grandparents hardly exist to see their grandchildren married. Some households may--for short periods only--include distant relatives or non-related persons for various reasons.' <sup id="cite_ref-979" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-979">[979]</a></sup> 'Descent is matrilineal, residence uxonilocal. The mother's brother's daughter type of cross-cousin marriage is the most widely accepted and prevalent among the people. It is a rigid custom that a man must marry a woman from the opposite CHATCHI (moiety). The rule of chatchi exogamy stipulates that a man's mother's father will be in the opposite chatchi and a man's wife's potential husbands will be in his own chatchi. After marriage a man keeps up his relation with his MACHONG (clan). His relation with reference to wife's machong is designated as QACHI. Marriage establishes a permanent relation between two machong, known as AKIM. After marriage, a male moves to the residence of his wife. In the case of a NOKROM (husband of the heiress of property), marriage does not create a new household, but rather adds a new lease of life to an old household. Even after the death or divorce of a spouse the akim relation continues. It is the responsibility of the deceased's machong to provide a replacement spouse to the surv iving partner.' <sup id="cite_ref-980" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-980">[980]</a></sup> Heiresses and their husbands remained in the wife's parents' household, while other daughters typically set up new households: 'Marriage leads to one or another of two contrasting economic and family arrangements, and much that is distinctive about Garo social and kinship organization stems from the differences between them. The contrast is based upon the desire of all middle-aged Garos to arrange their families so that one young couple will live with them in their old age-a couple who will support them and who will eventually inherit their property and assume much of their social position. To achieve this result each Garo couple chooses just one of their daughters to be their ‘heiress’ ( nokna), and she alone of the children will stay in the parental home with her husband and their children. All boys and all other daughters move away at marriage or shortly thereafter, often to a different village. The family members always have a firm understanding before a marriage as to whether or not the couple will act as heirs to the girl’s parents and whether or not they will support the parents in their old age. Only rarely are such understandings revised after marriage. The implications [Page 77] of the distinction between these two marriage arrangements will pervade the description of Garo social organization. The differences start from the very beginning of negotiations for a marriage.' <sup id="cite_ref-981" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-981">[981]</a></sup> 'The alternatives that face a girl are not unlike those facing a boy, except that personal sentiments are apt to be much more important to her. She will either stay in her home and care for her own parents or move out and set up a new household. Only rarely is there any real problem in persuading a girl to accept either responsibility, but the choice must be made one way or another before she can be married, and it is usually made many years beforehand.' <sup id="cite_ref-982" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-982">[982]</a></sup> Heir-marriages were typically between (classificatory) matrilateral cross-cousins: 'The marriages of heirs are examples of classificatory matrilateral cross-cousin marriage, since a man marries the daughter of his classificatory mother’s brother. Because of the importance of cross-cousin marriage in various current anthropological theories as well as in the society of the Garos themselves, it seems necessary to digress long enough to give a statistical summary based on a sampling of actual Garo marriages. As soon as this is attempted it becomes clear that the situation is far too complex to be indicated by anything like simple percentages of various types of marriages. The only meaningful way to define ‘cross-cousin’ is to accept the Garo definition and regard as ‘cross-cousins’ not only the actual daughters of a mother’s brothers and a father’s sisters, but also various distant classificatory relatives. This means that, for instance, two people may be simultaneously “close matrilateral cross-cousins” and “distant patrilateral cross-cousins.” Clearly, it becomes essential to define various degrees of the cross-cousin relationship.' <sup id="cite_ref-983" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-983">[983]</a></sup> 'The relationship between matrilateral cross-cousins (a man and the daughter of his mother’s ‘brother’) is easily regarded as a function (in the mathematical sense) of the relationship of the boy to the girl’s father. If these two are actual mother’s brother and sister’s son, then the boy and girl are first cross-cousins. If first cross-cousins are considered as type (1), it is possible when considering Garo society to define five other increasingly distant degrees of the classificatory ‘cross-cousin’ relationship; (2) the boy and girl’s father are closely related members of the same [Page 94] minimal lineage (see Chapter VII) though not direct uncle and nephew; (3) the boy and girl’s father come from the same village lineage but are not particularly closely related to each other within it; (4) they come from closely allied lineages of different villages; (5) they are members of the same named sib though they do not belong to closely related lineages within that sib; (6) they belong to entirely different sibs. If moiety exogamy is consistently practiced, the girl’s father and the prospective husband must always belong to the same moiety, and so in the most extended sense the spouses are still ‘cross-cousins.’ That is, the spouses are members of the opposite moiety, and so marriage between them is not forbidden.' <sup id="cite_ref-984" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-984">[984]</a></sup> Burling describes the process of choosing an heiress and arranging her marriage as follows: 'The first step in arranging a marriage of heirs is the choice by the parents of one of their daughters as heiress. Because they need a girl to perform these duties, Garo parents welcome a [Page 78] daughter more than a son, though if they have many children, they say that they like best to have some of each. However, even if a couple should have no daughters, they can adopt a close relative who will come into their home and assume the duties of an actual daughter.' <sup id="cite_ref-985" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-985">[985]</a></sup> 'Most women have at least one daughter of their own so they do not have to adopt another. A single daughter automatically becomes the heiress, but if a woman has more than one, a choice must be made. Garos simply say that they choose whichever girl loves her mother the most, or whichever is the hardest worker; but age also has a bearing upon the decision. The oldest of several girls is rarely chosen since she is likely to be too near the age of her mother, who will have no need of support until she is older. Most people prefer to wait until they draw near the age when they grow feeble before filling the house with a son-in-law and grandchildren. But if the parents so desire, even the oldest daughter may become heiress. Aling had a slightly withered leg, which made it difficult for him to do [Page 80] the heaviest labor. He and his wife, therefore, chose the oldest of their several daughters as heiress so that their household would acquire another adult man as soon as possible. Under more normal circumstances the youngest daughter is a more likely choice than the oldest, but there is no fixed rule either way. Rather, it is a matter for the personal decision of the family members. Since the choice is often made while the girls are still small, they have less to say about it than their parents, though their desires are taken into account if they are old enough. The decision is largely the parents’, and especially the mother’s.' <sup id="cite_ref-986" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-986">[986]</a></sup> 'Once the heiress is chosen, and once she has grown old enough to marry, the family can start to look for a husband. The initiative in obtaining the heiress’s husband rests most directly with the girl’s father. The Garos express the situation by saying that “a man always wants to get his own ‘nephew’ (i.e., gritang ‘classificatory sister’s son’) to come in to be his heir, the husband of his heiress daughter.” A man searches among the younger men of his own lineage and chooses one whom he would like to bring into his home. His search, then, is like that of a woman with no daughters who must find a girl of her own lineage to adopt. He too must look for a person of his own sex a generation younger and in the same matrilineal lineage as himself. However, since most women have daughters of their own, they do not usually have to look so far. This has been particularly true in the last generation or two, during which the population has been rapidly expanding, and families are somewhat larger than would be expected in a static population. Every [Page 81] man, on the other hand, once he reaches the age when he must worry about his future support, must look about among the members of his own lineage for a son-in-law, heir, and replacement. An ideal choice is an actual sister’s son, but many men have no sister, or if they have a sister she may have no sons, and even if there are sons of the right age, the preferences and happiness of the daughter, the nephew, and the nephew’s parents must all be taken into account. No marriage can be arranged simply because the partners are in the correct genealogical relationship to each other. All concerned must be at least reasonably happy with the choice. This makes it necessary to accept a somewhat elastic definition of ‘nephew’ ( gritang) and to look among wider and wider circles of lineage kin until a ‘nephew’ is found whom both father and daughter like, and whose parents can be persuaded to agree to the match. In actual practice almost all men are able to find fairly close relatives, and so long as arrangements are made and worked out satisfactorily, it does not really matter much whether the ‘nephew’ is his own sister’s son, or a somewhat more remote kinsman.' <sup id="cite_ref-987" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-987">[987]</a></sup> 'If a man is acquainted with his own sister’s son and likes him, he and the boy’s parents may be able to settle the matter with little reference to other members of the lineage, but if he has no suitable near ‘nephew’, he will investigate ever more distant collateral lines. For this he may require the cooperation of other men of his lineage.' <sup id="cite_ref-988" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-988">[988]</a></sup> Non-heiresses could not rely on the support of their matrilineage in the selection of a husband: 'Girls other than those destined to become heiresses cannot rely on their fathers to choose a husband for them, but must make their own selection. The initiative should properly come from the girl herself, and her only formal restriction is that she must not ignore moiety exogamy. Unlike her sister who is chosen as heiress, she need not marry into her father’s lineage, though this is not forbidden. It is simply a matter of indifference. As a girl moves about her own village, and makes trips to neighboring villages and to market, she sees and hears about eligible bachelors. She goes to dances, not only in her own village but in neighboring ones as well, and has some chance to [Page 83] meet and flirt with boys. Eventually, she should suggest to her father and ‘brothers’ that she fancies a certain boy, but neither the boy nor the boy’s parents need be consulted.' <sup id="cite_ref-989" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-989">[989]</a></sup> Weddings were formalized through bridegroom capture: 'Once a boy is decided upon, the method of bringing him to the girl, and the marriage ceremony itself, are both the same for ‘heirs’ and ‘non-heirs’, though no one ever forgets which type of marriage is being undertaken.' <sup id="cite_ref-990" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-990">[990]</a></sup> 'I had just witnessed one of the most exciting events in the life of every Garo man, the bridegroom capture, which is [Page 84] considered the only decent way to invite a man to become a husband. The boy should know nothing about it beforehand, though his family must be consulted if he is being asked to marry an heiress.' <sup id="cite_ref-991" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-991">[991]</a></sup> 'To begin a bridegroom capture, the father of the girl tells some of the youths of the village that he wants to get a certain boy as his son-in-law. Boys never seem to tire of chasing through the jungle in pursuit of a bridegroom, and will always cooperate by attempting to capture him for the girl. These boys are sometimes loosely referred to as the ‘brothers’ of the bride, and it is suitable for them to belong to her moiety and thus to the opposite one from that of the bridegroom, though this rule is occasionally broken. Married men occasionally take part, but more often they leave the chase to their unmarried and more adventurous juniors.' <sup id="cite_ref-992" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-992">[992]</a></sup> 'A single foray need not lead to a marriage, however, for nobody can be confident of having acquired a husband just because a boy is captured. In fact, most boys put up an elaborate display of reluctance to have anything to do with the proposed marriage. They may be accosted at almost any place-along the road, in the market, or in their own village-but they generally struggle to get away, and once captured use every stratagem to escape. This can lead to chases through the jungle, and to considerable excitement, which is thoroughly enjoyed by everyone except, perhaps, the bridegroom. A boy must usually be seized two, three, or even more times before he is finally willing to admit capture and to settle down as a husband. As much as several years occasionally pass, during which an heir is periodically brought to the girl only to escape again, though a non-heir seldom takes so long. This gives the boy time to consider his prospects, and nobody can be sure of a permanent marriage until he finally surrenders and stays with the girl. Simply running away is clearly no indication that the boy is really turning the marriage down, and in fact, neither the boy nor the girl is free to contract another marriage until he has [Page 85] stated his disinclination in other ways. If a boy is genuinely opposed to the marriage, he will go along quietly, while earnestly explaining to his captors that he is unwilling to undertake the match. In the case of a prospective heir, particularly, considerable family pressure may be brought to bear to persuade him to accept. His duty to his ‘uncle’ will be pointed out, and the propriety of the match explained. But he, like the girl, does have veto power, and if he insists that he does not want the marriage, the girl’s family must eventually accept his refusal and look for someone else. The Garos are convinced that it is nonsense to force unwilling people into a marriage, as this can only be a prelude to future trouble and family quarrels.' <sup id="cite_ref-993" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-993">[993]</a></sup> 'Boys will do almost anything to appear reluctant to marry an heiress and thus become the son-in-law of their maternal ‘uncle.’ Boys shy away from romantic involvement with a daughter of their ‘uncle’ because of fear of the ‘uncle’s’ authority and of the ridicule which they will receive about this relationship. Those taken as non-heirs are less likely to put on such an extreme show of displeasure. If they wish to be married they run away less often before settling down, and if they are genuinely against the marriage, they can make this clear from the beginning and end the matter promptly. Far too many boys run away and decline a marriage, to allow the conclusion that even non-heir marriages are always or generally preceded by private understandings between the boy and girl. Many men maintain that they had no idea they were about to be captured until their captors actually set upon them, though certainly the news must leak to some men beforehand. In principle neither the parents of a prospective non-heir nor the boy himself need be informed of the coming bridegroom capture, though every boy of the proper age is of course well aware of his eligibility.' <sup id="cite_ref-994" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-994">[994]</a></sup> 'Whenever a boy is successfully captured and brought to the house of a girl, the marriage ceremony is performed, though even this does not ensure a real marriage. A boy may frequently run away, sometimes temporarily, but sometimes permanently, [Page 86] even after the ceremony; in fact, he is likely to be guarded much too closely to escape any earlier. As a result some people go through several ceremonies before they finally marry permanently. Panjak had seven boys captured for her before the eighth one, Tanggeng, agreed to become her husband, and some boys are similarly taken to several girls before settling down. Seven refusals is certainly extreme, but no refusal can be considered a divorce simply because the marriage ceremony has been performed. Only after the boy has expressed his willingness to stay and become a husband can it be considered a breach of marriage to leave, but if the boy runs away and is captured again for the same girl, there is no need to repeat the ceremony.' <sup id="cite_ref-995" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-995">[995]</a></sup> According to Burling, monogamy was the norm, but polygyny was also practiced: 'In Rengsanggri there were 70 married men with 78 wives, eight men having two wives. (This does not include widowed mothers-in-law whom the Garos call ‘wives’ but with whom sexual relations are not maintained.) The marriages of these people included 52 “new marriages.” Most of these “new marriages” were first marriages in which neither spouse had been married previously. However, a divorced man, unlike a divorced woman or at least a woman who has borne a child, can enter into a new marriage without any change in the rules, so the two cases of remarried divorced men are included as “new marriages.” of these 52, 28 of the couples were married as heirs and the other 24 as non-heirs.' <sup id="cite_ref-996" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-996">[996]</a></sup> Widowers were typically provided with a new wife: 'If a woman dies before her husband, the arrangements may be slightly different. Not even the logic of the situation can lead the Garos to suggest that a man should marry his heiress (i.e. his daughter) when his wife dies, in the way that a widow should ‘marry’ her heir. Even rather old men dislike being without a wife, however, and Garos feel that widowers, whatever their age, have a legal right to demand a new wife. It becomes the responsibility of the dead wife’s lineage to supply one. The search for a new or “replacement” wife for a man is much like the search for an adoptive heiress, except that since the person to be replaced (the former wife) is dead, the search must be carried out entirely by other family members. In this case the male members of the woman’s lineage take the responsibility, and they are expected to find among the women of their lineage one who is free to marry the widower and to take the place of his former wife. As in all such cases the closest relatives take the first responsibility, looking among their ‘sisters’ and ‘nieces,’ but if no suitable person can be found near at hand, wider circles of kinsmen are consulted. For elderly men there is one additional possibility. Sometimes young unwed mothers are given to them, thus simultaneously disposing of the difficulty of finding husbands for such girls.' <sup id="cite_ref-997" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-997">[997]</a></sup> The practice of providing 'replacement wives' and husbands to widowed persons is explained by the lasting bond that a marriage established between two lineages: 'Death does not destroy a’kim; thus the family of a dead person has the obligation to provide a replacement, and the widowed person has the obligation to accept. If a widowed person unilaterally marries somebody of his own choice, then the family of the widow or widower will owe the a’kim compensation of 60 rupees to the family of the dead person; but if on the other hand the family of the dead person do not provide a replacement, they must compensate the family of the surviving spouse. Failure to provide a replacement is not common, and I [Page 264] had to search for some time before I discovered anyone who could remember an unambiguous example. Furthermore, it is possible for the families in such a situation to agree to end the a’kim without the payment of a compensation, but as always the agreement must be a formal one accepted by all sides. Such an agreement usually occurs only when the family of the dead person are unable to find a suitable replacement. In such a case they may, as the Garos say, “set the widow (or widower) free.” This means that the surviving spouse is released by agreement from the restriction of a’kim and is then free to marry whomever he wishes, if he can find anybody. Kinship groups dislike setting people free, for it is an admission that the family are unable to fulfill their obligations; and widows and widowers want to be given a new spouse. “Setting free” is really a misnomer, then, since one of the most explicit reasons for maintaining the law of a’kim is to make sure that a person will not be left alone after the death of his spouse but will be taken care of by being given a replacement. Nevertheless, if the lineage of the dead person is genuinely unable to find a suitable person, both sides will usually agree that the a’kim restrictions are to be abrogated and that no compensation need be paid. Such agreements reduce the frequency with which a’kim compensation is paid as a result of failure to provide a replacement, and most often replacements are arranged according to the formal rules.' <sup id="cite_ref-998" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-998">[998]</a></sup> 'In each of these cases-divorce, breaking of engagements, and failure to provide replacements-compensation is paid only upon unilateral action by one of the parties. In each case the relationship can be ended by mutual agreement if all concerned are willing.' <sup id="cite_ref-999" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-999">[999]</a></sup> Alternatively, widows and widowers could be remarried in the following manner: 'There is one other way of providing for widows and widowers. It happens frequently, though not in accordance with any formal requirement, that lineages in the same area are united to each other by several marriages, so that several a’kim bonds join [Page 152] them. It can easily happen that two men of one lineage (it may be a fairly large lineage in which the two men are not closely related) are married to two women of a second lineage (again not necessarily close relatives). If the woman of one marriage and the man of the other should both be widowed, then it can be arranged to have the surviving spouses marry each other. This is a recognized procedure, and the resulting marriage is spoken of as one in which the two former houses have merged to become one. The a’kim relationship is preserved, but after this consists of a single marriage bond where there had formerly been two. The real requirements of the system are met, in that everybody is living in a family which includes both men and women and everybody belongs to a functioning and complete household. The marriage of Kaljing to Jiring was of this sort. Kaljing, who was a member of the Manda sib from Misimagri, had earlier been married to Chimchim, who was a Chambigong of the village of Rengsanggri. When Chimchim died, the Chambigongs had to find a replacement for her to give to Kaljing. It happened that there was a widow, Jiring, of a closely related lineage of the proper sib (Chambigong) living in Misimagri. She had formerly been married to a man of the Manda sib, also of that village and therefore of the same village lineage that Kaljing had come from, but he had died about three years earlier. The family had brought in one young man in the hope that he would marry Jiring if they promised him a younger wife as well, but this young man had declined the match, and so she was still without a husband when Kaljing’s wife died. It therefore became possible to bring Jiring to Rengsanggri; she moved into Kaljing’s house as his wife, and the two houses were thereby merged into one.' <sup id="cite_ref-1000" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1000">[1,000]</a></sup> Polygyny was often the result of younger men being given as new husbands to older widows or divorcees. In this case, the former could expect to be married to his wife's (real or adoptive) daughter as well: 'In order to get a widow remarried, special arrangements must be made. The first move is similar to obtaining a usual heir, except that the man’s surviving male lineage mates must assume the entire responsibility now that the man himself is dead. Just as the relatives of a woman must find a replacement to marry her widower, the relatives of a man must find somebody to marry the surviving widow. The younger brother of the dead man is an appropriate replacement, but the younger brother is only the closest of possible relatives and any younger member of the dead man’s lineage will do. When a likely candidate is found, he is captured and brought in just like any other prospective husband, and with the same uncertainty of outcome. This man is married to the widow and, if he decides to stay, will form a real marriage with her, in which they will maintain sexual relations. Though replacement husbands are frequently a good deal younger than the widows they marry, and though they are admittedly somewhat similar to ‘heirs’ of the first husbands, it is still possible for them to become the real husbands of the widow, since they had not previously established a conflicting type of relationship that is difficult to overcome. The unique feature of this marriage stems from the feeling of Garos that it is unfair to expect a young man to marry a widow unless he is also given a younger wife who has never been married, or at least promised another wife at some time in the future. Every Garo man, that is, deserves one new wife, so a widow alone is not enough. If the widow has a daughter, however young, it is usual for the man to be married to both mother and daughter simultaneously. If the daughter is imnature at the time, he may have to wait many years for her maturation before initiating sexual relations with her, but in the meantime he can maintain them with the older woman. If a widow does not have a daughter, then she, like a woman who passes the child-bearing age without a daughter, must adopt a [Page 149] girl. Like other adopted daughters, these girls sometimes move into the houses of their adoptive mothers when still very young, while others shift residence only when mature. A young wife of this sort, whether the adopted or true daughter, is called jikgite rather than jik, which is the term used for other wives. She is destined to become the wife of her mother’s husband when she matures, though the only evidence villagers can give for the initiation of sexual relations is the girl’s pregnancy. The jikgite should be considerably younger than the older wife. They say the two women are likely to quarrel if they are too close to the same age. If a jikgite must be adopted owing to the first wife’s having no daughters, it is best to make the adoption while the girl is still young. To adopt a mature girl as jikgite is to invite quarreling between her and the older woman. Cases are readily cited where this was attempted, only to be followed by one or the other woman’s having to leave. The best combination is certainly mother and daughter, since they will quarrel least of all. The older wife has a senior position, and villagers say that a man will not have sexual relations with the jikgite until the older wife specifically permits him to do so, but that she knows that she must eventually give permission or lose the support of the jikgite, who cares for the older wife just as an heiress does. However, as the first wife grows older, some men are reported to cease having sexual relations with her, and to shift entirely to the jikgite.' <sup id="cite_ref-1001" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1001">[1,001]</a></sup> 'In Rengsanggri nine men were married to women who had previously had another husband. Three of these women had been divorced rather than widowed, but the same requirements hold for providing a jikgite to a man who marries a divorcee as for one who marries a widow. All but one had been assigned younger wives, though in two cases the girls were still immature. This left six men who had two potential sexual partners.' <sup id="cite_ref-1002" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1002">[1,002]</a></sup> 'In some of these families there was no doubt that men simultaneously maintained sexual relations with both women. Jingnang had children of about the same age by both a mother and [Page 150] her daughter from a previous marriage. In those cases where the younger wife grows up in the household where her future husband is already living, it would appear that there might be a very real difficulty in shifting from a relation that must inevitably be similar to that of father and daughter to that of husband and wife. That the shift in relationship can be made is evident from the case of Singgat. Singgat married Wilwil, who had divorced her previous husband. Both her children had died, so a young girl, Rangsi, the daughter of Wajang, was brought into her house as future jikgite for Singgat, and Wilwil raised her as her own child. Wilwil had no more children, but Rangsi grew up and recently she had a baby of whose paternity there seems to be no doubt. Families such as those of Singgat and Jingnang are pointed out by the villagers with approval, since everybody is carrying out his duty peacefully and without quarreling. Unfortunately people are not always so well-behaved. A case in point is that of Kam, who married Chan’mi after her previous husband had abandoned her. It was agreed that Chan’mi’s daughter Dijak would become the jikgite of Kam when she matured. When I knew them, Dijak was a girl of about eighteen, clearly mature but not yet pregnant, and in the opinion of the people of Rengsanggri, who presumably knew, not yet engaging in sexual relations with her mother’s husband as she should have been by that time. This was a matter of considerable worry to the people, since they felt that unless Kam did his duty by her, she would sooner or later commit adultery and manage to get pregnant by somebody else, or even run off with some other man. Either of these results would cause complications, and if Kam should lose his young wife, it would be his own fault. The blame of this situation was placed by the villagers on Kam, who was not having sexual relations with his first wife’s daughter. Kam had been married to Chan’mi for about ten years and must have regarded his wife’s daughter much as though she were his own. Apparently he found it difficult to transform his relations with her into those of a husband.' <sup id="cite_ref-1003" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1003">[1,003]</a></sup> 'While the logic of the system which requires a man to marry both a mother and daughter does entail certain practical difficulties, it is carried out some of the time, and many men, both those living today and those who show up in genealogical histories, have managed to have children by both women. Families in which a man is married in this way to both mother and daughter at once look superficially like those other households, in which an heir and his wife continue to live with the wife’s mother after the father-in-law dies. The composition of the families is the same: mother and daughter and one man. In both cases the man is called ‘husband’ of both women and the women are the man’s ‘wives.’ This has probably helped to perpetuate the idea both in the minds of Garos and in the writing of earlier observers of their customs that Garos actually “marry” their widowed mothers-in-law. In actual fact, all cases of real marriage to both mother and daughter are those in which a man marries the mother first, after her former husband dies or after she is divorced, and then a second wife is given to the husband in addition. Terminology does distinguish the cases, since when a man marries a girl before her father dies, she is never called jikgite but simply jik, and she is always considered the main wife.' <sup id="cite_ref-1004" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1004">[1,004]</a></sup> Widowed mothers-in-law became classificatory 'wives' to their daughter's husband, although no sexual relations were maintained: 'Besides objects and wealth, social status is also inherited by the heir and heiress. When an older member of a household dies, the Garos view his heir as stepping into the social position of the dead person-a woman into the position of her mother and a man into the position of his ‘uncle’ and father-in-law. The clearest symbolic expression of this is the assumption by the heir of kinship terms formerly appropriate to his father-in-law. After the old man’s death, other sons-in-law call the heir by the term which is more generally used for “father-in-law,” and are in turn called “son-in-law” by the heir. It has been pointed out that Garos also speak as if the son-in-law inherited his mother-in-law when her husband dies, since after this she is regarded as a ‘wife’ of the younger man. Moreover, the wife’s siblings call him by a term that otherwise means father’s younger brother. This terminology is analyzed more fully in Appendix C. Beyond this somewhat superficial terminological matter, the occupants of the family house are considered to be the living incumbents in the role of man and woman of that particular house. Households continue, though their members come and go. The most striking example of this is the title of nokma or ‘headman’ which, as will be explained in Chapter IX, adheres to the senior household of the village. The man who happens to be married to the heiress of that household is considered to be the ‘headman’ of the village.' <sup id="cite_ref-1005" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1005">[1,005]</a></sup> 'Garos sometimes say that this shyness comes from fear of the father-in-law’s jealousy, but that one must also avoid anything that might make the jokes of which he will be the object have any basis of truth. Everyone gets teased about his mother-in-law. So long as one knows that he has been perfectly wellbehaved it is possible to laugh these things off, but one always tries to avoid giving grounds for teasing. The Garo theory that the heir becomes the ‘husband’ of his mother-in-law when his father-in-law dies-even though this relationship includes only the economic aspects of the husband-and-wife relationship and not the sexual-is never far from the consciousness of the parties involved. It makes the son-in-law particularly anxious to demonstrate that even if he may in the future be considered the old lady’s husband, at least that time has not yet come.' <sup id="cite_ref-1006" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1006">[1,006]</a></sup> Husbands willing to add secondary wives to an existing marriage needed their first wife's consent and were usually required to choose a woman from the wife's lineage: 'On considering the vital institution of marriage in the Garo society we find that every Garo is entitled to marry since marriage is recognised as one of the important social institutions in Garo society. Their society is devoid of widow and widower since the Garo customary practices make provision for on’songa i.e., remarriage of the widow and widower. However, sororate form of marriage is not customary. Instead on the death of the wife it is the duty of the wife’s mahari to provide an alternative wife to the widower; if the alternative wife happens to be his wife’s sister it would amount to sororate marriage. In addition a man cannot marry again or acquire a wife, without the express consent of a living wife and her chras since the first wife’s mahari would never tolerate the loss of their right over the property ownership to heiress of another mahari. Eventually if the man desires to marry a second time, with a woman belonging to another mahari, he is expected to seek separation from his heiress wife; thus renouncing the right of retaining the managerial authority over his principal wife’s properties. [Page 156] Thus a man can obtain his subsidiary wives only from the wife’s lineage with due consent from the first wife and the chras. In case the principal wife and chras do not agree to provide him another wife and if he is adamant to marry again, a divorce becomes inevitable. In such a case where there are more than one wife living under the same roof, the principal wife ( jik ma’mong or jik mongma) occupies a superior position and her advice in all family matters is binding. When a man marries his widowed mother-in-law or his deceased uncle’s widow she is always treated as jik ma’mong as long as she survives although her marriage is subsequent to the man’s first marriage. The underlying ’akim’ principle of such marriages is that no one should remain without a mate for a long time, since such bonds also unite two ma’chong or mahari through a unit of family i.e., nok. Once a family comes into existence after the marriage of a man and woman of appropriate lineages and in conformity with the existing rules of exogamy, the nok must continue till the contracting ma’chong or mahari decides to sever their ’akim’ bonds which are considered to be sacred according to the Garo traditions. It is important to note here that the married couple shares the responsibility of aged and incapacitated parents in old age. Here it should be added that while the heir designate must marry someone from her father’s lineage and preferably her father’s sisters’ son, the other girls or a’gate are not morally bound to marry a kin of their father. They can exercise their choice.' <sup id="cite_ref-1007" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1007">[1,007]</a></sup> Adulterers were liable to punishment. The Garo definition of adultery included all extramarital sexual relations that breached existing agreements between kin groups: 'The penalties for adultery apply not only to married people but to the other classes of people who are also bound by a’kim, those who are engaged and those who are widowed but who remain obligated to the kinship group of the deceased spouse. Tijak was considered to have infringed upon Menjak’s rights by committing adultery with Menjak’s prospective husband, although Menjak was not yet fully married to him. [Page 266] although Menjak was not yet fully married to him. In a parallel way, if a widow or widower commits adultery, then the partner is considered to have infringed upon the rights of the deceased spouse’s family just as he would have if the spouse were still living. Such cases are somewhat unusual. Widows, and especially widowers, often marry too promptly for much danger of such adultery, and if the kinship groups cannot find a replacement spouse, then the widow or widower is usually released from his or her obligation under a’kim. The rule, however, is clear, namely that compensation for adultery is owed by all people bound by a’kim, and not only married people.' <sup id="cite_ref-1008" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1008">[1,008]</a></sup> Accordingly, while polygyny was practiced, monogamy appears to have been more common and adultery was punished. Converts were subject to Christian regulations in principle, but some 'traditional' attitudes persisted: 'Christian divorce is encumbered with more serious problems than the relatively simple divorce of non-Christians. Christian marriages are governed by the Indian Christian Marriage Act, under which obtaining a divorce requires court proceedings beyond the competence of any court within the district. In effect, this makes legal divorce impossible for any but the most wealthy Garos, however legitimate the grievance may be. The old Garo attitude that it is better for a man and woman to separate than to continue living unhappily together hardly disappears with Christianity, and the result is that separation, if not legal divorce, is not uncommon among Christians, and is not looked upon with great disapproval. Serious difficulties arise only when one of the separated individuals starts living with someone else, a procedure that is by no means unknown. In the eyes of the law this is, of course, adultery, and it may lead to expulsion from the church. To many Garos, however, it is somewhat less sinful than is implied by the rules of the church or the laws of the country. Garos speak of these people as husband and wife, and generally accept them as such. There is some sentiment among Christian Garos for the easing of the divorce laws, so that divorces could be handled within the district, and the impossible position of separated spouses be mitigated.' <sup id="cite_ref-1009" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1009">[1,009]</a></sup></dd>

These youths, it is said, “cannot sit still,” and are always thinking about girls. Girls are seldom quite so irrepressible as boys, but they too grow a little wild at the same age. Everybody expects this to lead to occasional problems, and no one is greatly surprised when a girl becomes pregnant, though neither does [Page 72] anyone really approve. Adults told me that they thought it would be better if young people would stay quiet and behave themselves properly, but, they said, “After all they are young, so what can you do?” While recognizing that premarital sexual relations can lead to personal difficulties, and even to legal disputes and monetary fines, Garos are tolerant of human weaknesses.' <sup id="cite_ref-1010" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1010">[1,010]</a></sup> According to Burling, premarital pregnancy was quite common as well: 'Girls are kept more closely under the eyes of the parents than their brothers in the period between puberty and marriage. They work with their mothers and sisters, learning to cook, to pound rice, to make rice beer, and to exercise all the feminine skills of the society, but they do not have the opportunity to spend as great an amount of time with other girls or in the houses of other people. This does not mean that girls are in any way secluded. They dance in the village ceremonies, they go to market, where they can look the boys over and be looked over in turn, and with a fair frequency they get pregnant before they are formally married.' <sup id="cite_ref-1011" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1011">[1,011]</a></sup> Burling describes flirting among teenagers: 'In talking with a girl, particularly at dances but also on ordinary days, when duties require or allow a conversation, a boy can make some judgment of whether a girl is attracted to him by the way she replies. They say that if she replies “sweetly,” he may feel that she is pleased with him. Boys always come to village dances equipped with the leaves, nut, and lime out of which the betel mixture commonly chewed by Garos is prepared, as well as with biris, little commercial Indian cigarettes. They offer these to the girls to “soften them up.” If the girl accepts and acts in a friendly way, it may give the boy courage to go on to suggest sexual relations. A boy seldom initiates negotiations toward marriage, since even if he wants to the culture does not provide him with accepted channels, but he does have recognised ways of suggesting sexual relations. A boy may touch the girl rapidly and briefly on the leg or arm or, less ambiguously, on the breast. This last is risky since if the girl is really offended by the suggestion, she may go to her father or village authorities, and she has the right to demand and receive a compensation from the boy of about five rupees. This happens rarely, probably only when a boy is grossly forward with a girl who has given him no sign of friendliness at all, but the possibility does add excitement to a flirtation. Even a girl who is favorably disposed, or at least not irritated, is likely to feign displeasure at first and to say “ Hut!” to the boy-a term used, among other things, to chase dogs away-but if she is really favorably inclined, they may eventually agree to meet later, or the boy may simply go off and afterward the girl will follow him to a private spot. Sexual relations may occur at any time of the day or night and at any place, in the village, fields, or jungle, where privacy is possible.' <sup id="cite_ref-1012" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1012">[1,012]</a></sup> Premarital sexual relations could culminate in marriage: 'A premarital affair occasionally serves as a prelude to marriage, though since marriage is first proposed by the girl, or by her family, rather than by the boy, it is not considered the proper or desirable way. The girl may suggest whom she wants as a husband, and her family will try to obtain him. Undoubtedly some girls, being satisfied with a lover, simply suggest to their fathers that so-and-so would be a fine boy to obtain as a son-in-law, and the fact of an earlier sexual relationship might never become known. Even after a girl becomes pregnant it is often possible to arrange a formal marriage, and this is a satisfactory arrangement involving little disgrace. Occasionally a boy and girl who engage in frequent sexual relations start living together publicly without any ceremony, and are henceforth considered husband and wife; however, the people of Rengsanggri, who are conservative in these matters, frown upon such a “stolen” marriage. When I first went to Rengsanggri, every couple in the village had undergone the traditional ceremony, though there were couples living in near-by villages who had never had a formal wedding. However, most marriages both in Rengsanggri and in the neighboring villages still begin with arrangements and negotiations by the families, and a ceremony which formalizes the union.' <sup id="cite_ref-1013" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1013">[1,013]</a></sup> Burling also describes extramarital affairs: 'Boys, and men too, frequently make some gift, often a few rupees in cash, to their lovers. They hardly think of this as a real payment, but rather as a gift showing gratitude for her favors. If the affair lasts over a long period the number and value of such gifts should be correspondingly increased. Girls, and [Page 74] even married women, have enough control over money to make such gifts worth their while. A married woman can manage to buy things, perhaps saying that she earned the money by selling something-rice beer, for instance-or else juggling the prices of things she buys, saying that they cost less than they really did, if the question of money should ever come up.' <sup id="cite_ref-1014" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1014">[1,014]</a></sup> Adulterers and others accused of sexual offences were liable to punishment: 'Garos do not make a terminological distinction between adultery and other varieties of extra-marital intercourse, all of which are called teleka and all of which are considered improper. They do not react to premarital intercourse as consistently as to adultery; but even improper advance on the part of a boy to a girl is considered a punishable offense, and in theory a girl can claim a small monetary compensation from a boy who suggests sexual relations, though this compensation is rarely demanded. Even sexual relations between unmarried people rarely lead to litigation unless pregnancy results, although Garos readily cite formal rules which state that fines should be paid by the boy’s family to the girl’s family even if there is no pregnancy. Of course, if it is conducted with discretion, no one else need learn of an extramarital affair, though Garos are not given to consistent secrecy in these matters. If an affair lasts for any length of time a pregnancy is likely to result, but even this leads more often to a marriage than to trial and compensation. Only if the boy and girl are members of the same moiety and are therefore not appropriate marriage partners does a pregnancy have some likelihood of precipitating negotiations for the payment of compensation. Sexual relations between members of the same moiety or even sib are less strongly disapproved than is marriage, and unless the two people are closely related cousins, they cause hardly more alarm than such relations [Page 267] between any two unmarried people. However, they raise one extremely unpleasant problem, since if the girl becomes pregnant the couple will be unable to marry. Sa’jak, the daughter of Kaljing, had an illegitimate baby whose father was Tamring, the son of Aduma of Singgat’s house. Both Sa’jak and Tamring were members of the Chambigong sib of Rengsanggri and could not marry, or at least they were unwilling to face down their relatives and live together. A trial was held, and both of them were scolded and beaten and told to be good. They promised henceforth to keep away from each other; and Tamring and his relatives had to pay a compensation of 60 rupees to Sa’jak.' <sup id="cite_ref-1015" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1015">[1,015]</a></sup> The A’chik definition of adultery included all extramarital sexual relations that breached existing agreements between kin groups: 'The penalties for adultery apply not only to married people but to the other classes of people who are also bound by a’kim, those who are engaged and those who are widowed but who remain obligated to the kinship group of the deceased spouse. Tijak was considered to have infringed upon Menjak’s rights by committing adultery with Menjak’s prospective husband, although Menjak was not yet fully married to him. [Page 266] although Menjak was not yet fully married to him. In a parallel way, if a widow or widower commits adultery, then the partner is considered to have infringed upon the rights of the deceased spouse’s family just as he would have if the spouse were still living. Such cases are somewhat unusual. Widows, and especially widowers, often marry too promptly for much danger of such adultery, and if the kinship groups cannot find a replacement spouse, then the widow or widower is usually released from his or her obligation under a’kim. The rule, however, is clear, namely that compensation for adultery is owed by all people bound by a’kim, and not only married people.' <sup id="cite_ref-1016" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1016">[1,016]</a></sup> Converts were subject to Christian regulations in principle, but some 'traditional' attitudes persisted: 'Christian divorce is encumbered with more serious problems than the relatively simple divorce of non-Christians. Christian marriages are governed by the Indian Christian Marriage Act, under which obtaining a divorce requires court proceedings beyond the competence of any court within the district. In effect, this makes legal divorce impossible for any but the most wealthy Garos, however legitimate the grievance may be. The old Garo attitude that it is better for a man and woman to separate than to continue living unhappily together hardly disappears with Christianity, and the result is that separation, if not legal divorce, is not uncommon among Christians, and is not looked upon with great disapproval. Serious difficulties arise only when one of the separated individuals starts living with someone else, a procedure that is by no means unknown. In the eyes of the law this is, of course, adultery, and it may lead to expulsion from the church. To many Garos, however, it is somewhat less sinful than is implied by the rules of the church or the laws of the country. Garos speak of these people as husband and wife, and generally accept them as such. There is some sentiment among Christian Garos for the easing of the divorce laws, so that divorces could be handled within the district, and the impossible position of separated spouses be mitigated.' <sup id="cite_ref-1017" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1017">[1,017]</a></sup> We have found no precise figures on the frequency of adultery and premaritcl sexual relations: 'I cannot make any reliable estimate of the frequency of either premarital intercourse or adultery. Neither is fully condoned. The societal ideal of desirable behavior is certainly to confine sexual relations within the limits of marriage, and a girl who has been pregnant is markedly less desirable as a wife than one who has not. Virginity itself, however, is not prized, and most people have had some sexual experience before marriage.' <sup id="cite_ref-1018" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1018">[1,018]</a></sup> Accordingly, we cannot provide a numerical value.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Gender ♣ present ♥</b> The A’chik adhered to a gendered division of labour: 'The division of labor between members of the household is as follows: the males are responsible for clearing jungle and setting fire to the debris for shifting cultivation, while women are responsible for planting, weeding and harvesting. During the peak agricultural operations the men sometimes help the women. Construction and repair of the house are male duties. Men make baskets, while women carry crops from the field and firewood from the jungle. Women look after the kitchen and prepare beer, and men serve the beer to guests. Women rear the children and keep the domestic animals. Both men and women sell firewood and vegetables in the marketplace.' <sup id="cite_ref-1019" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1019">[1,019]</a></sup> Roy provides a general description of the marriage system: 'Descent is matrilineal, residence uxonilocal. The mother's brother's daughter type of cross-cousin marriage is the most widely accepted and prevalent among the people. It is a rigid custom that a man must marry a woman from the opposite CHATCHI (moiety). The rule of chatchi exogamy stipulates that a man's mother's father will be in the opposite chatchi and a man's wife's potential husbands will be in his own chatchi. After marriage a man keeps up his relation with his MACHONG (clan). His relation with reference to wife's machong is designated as QACHI. Marriage establishes a permanent relation between two machong, known as AKIM. After marriage, a male moves to the residence of his wife. In the case of a NOKROM (husband of the heiress of property), marriage does not create a new household, but rather adds a new lease of life to an old household. Even after the death or divorce of a spouse the akim relation continues. It is the responsibility of the deceased's machong to provide a replacement spouse to the surv iving partner.' <sup id="cite_ref-1020" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1020">[1,020]</a></sup> Property was transmitted matrilineally (see also 'property' and 'inheritance'): 'Property among the Garos is inherited in the female line. One of the daughters is selected by the parents to be the heiress. If the couple have no female child, a girl belonging to the machong of the wife (preferably the daughter of her sister, whether real or classificatory) is adopted to be an heiress. She is not considered to be the absolute owner of the property. Decision about the disposal of property is taken by her husband, who is considered to be the household authority (NOKNI SKOTONG). After the death of the father-in-law responsibility transfers to the son-in-law. If a dead man is survived by a widow, she stays in the family of her daughter and is sometimes referred to as an additional wife (JIK) of her daughter's husband.' <sup id="cite_ref-1021" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1021">[1,021]</a></sup> Accordingly, property attached to the household of a married couple was considered to be the property of the wife or the wife's lineage: 'No Garo man may possess property apart from his wife unless he has acquired it by his own exertion before his marriage and it is independent of his connection with his wife. In a dispute, a wife had filed a petition against her husband, alleging that he had deserted her and claimed maintenance. She prayed for return of the property which the husband had taken away from the matrimonial home. The lower court made a maintenance order and ordered the return of property. A Garo husband has no exclusive right over the property jointly earned with his wife, and as such when he leaves the house, he cannot take it with him without wife’s permission. If he does so, it amounts to theft according to the Garo custom (Criminal Revision No. 1 of 1963).' <sup id="cite_ref-1022" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1022">[1,022]</a></sup> However, fathers rather than mothers acted as heads of households: 'Generally, in the matri-lineal family, the mother is the head of the family. But in Garo Society, the father is the head of the family and it is obligatory for him to maintain his wife, minor children, unmarried daughter and his widower Nokkrom and widowed Nokna daughter, till a substitute is provided for by the clan members. After the death of father, mother is responsible for maintenance of the family. In case of her remarriage, step-father should maintain the family. But if the mother remarries outside the clan, she loses the right to her ancestral property and she can not live in the ancestral household. In her place one of her daughters will succeed as an heiress, and then it is her duty to maintain the minor members of the family jointly with her Nokkrom.' <sup id="cite_ref-1023" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1023">[1,023]</a></sup> 'In respect of exercising authority over the household possessions as well as the landed property, the male member’s word is final, although a woman’s approving consent is sought for by the loving husband. She cannot, albeit, wield exclusive right over any material possession. Women have no accession to incorporeal property.' <sup id="cite_ref-1024" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1024">[1,024]</a></sup> Heads of senior households, i.e. the husbands of lineage heiresses, typically acted as village headmen: 'I have referred in a number of places to ‘headmanship,’ and it is at last possible to explain the nature, duties, and privileges of a ‘headman.’ In any village at least one man-and often two, three, or occasionally even more-is referred to by the term nokma, which is generally-though badly-translated as ‘headman.’ These nokmas wear no symbol of their position which would permit a stranger to recognize them, but any villager can name and point out the individuals in his village who rate this title.' <sup id="cite_ref-1025" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1025">[1,025]</a></sup> 'To explain how a man becomes nokma, it is first necessary to refer once more to the lineage structure of the village. It is simplest to consider villages with a single main lineage first. Just as one household of each cooperating group is considered to be senior by virtue of the fact that all the other households have “come out” from it, one household is the most senior of the whole village, since all of the houses ultimately “came out” from it. The process may, of course, have involved many stages, but the senior household is ordinarily considered to be that of the first nokma. Normally the nokma, like any other man, looks for a ‘nephew,’ that is, a younger man from his own lineage, to come and be his son-in-law and heir. In this case, the ‘nephew’ not only becomes the heir to the house and property but also [Page 224] succeeds to the ‘headmanship’ when his father-in-law dies. Inevitably the nokmas of many villages have grown up in a different village, and belong to a different sib and to the opposite moiety from the people of the main village lineage. A nokma should, however, be a member of the same lineage and from the same village as the previous nokma, so generally a succession of ‘headmen’ are members of one village and lineage by descent but hold the status of ‘headman’ in another village by virtue of being married to the women who are successively chosen as heiress in the senior house of the village.' <sup id="cite_ref-1026" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1026">[1,026]</a></sup> Accordingly, women could not act as Nokmas or village headmen: 'Women are quite excluded from village administration. A woman can never be a village headman ( nokma), because a village nokma has certain ceremonial functions, and such ceremonial rites cannot be performed by a woman. The position occupied by women in village affairs is considered to be the lowest and equivalent to that of children. The Garo classify women, as regards their position in village affairs, with children by the use of the phrase mechik bisa-disa (literally, women-children). In areas where there are bachelors’ houses, women, excepting the nokma’s wife, are not allowed to enter the bachelors’ house by the front door. In village feasts and ceremonials, women are not allowed to occupy the positions reserved for persons of honour. They enjoy their meals outside in the open courtyard in front.' <sup id="cite_ref-1027" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1027">[1,027]</a></sup> Women were also excluded from the men's house: 'Indigenous system of education in the broadest sense, was in vogue in the villages of Garo Hills prior to the establishment of schools for formal education. The Nokpante or the bachelors dormitory was the only traditional institution which could be regarded as the centre of learning among the Garos. The word Nokpante literally means “a house of bachelors”. The Nokpantes [Page 188] were constructed at the centre of the village, opposite to the Nokma’s or Chief’s house. In certain big villages, each clan had its own Nokpante for the unmarried young men.' <sup id="cite_ref-1028" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1028">[1,028]</a></sup> 'From the age of seven or eight to the date of marriage, all the males were expected to sleep in the Nokpante. The old and experienced men of the village taught the young boys the knowledge and the skills necessary for their traditional life. Besides the practical training in different arts and culture, the Nokpante boys were also given practical lessons on discipline and on high sense of duty. The younger boys were trained rigorously to obey the orders and carry out the work assigned by their seniors. The Nokpante boys also served as the guards of the village. They had to defend the village from attack and do the social welfare activities for the families there. Besides, Nokpante was used as the court room of the Nokma, the Community Hall and an inn for the male visitors to the village to spend the night. The female visitors to the village had to sleep with other women in the village houses. The women were not allowed to enter the Nokpante. The education of girls was considered as the responsibility of the adult women in the family-mother or aunties or grandmother.' <sup id="cite_ref-1029" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1029">[1,029]</a></sup> We have assumed that in Christianized communities that abandoned men's houses, women had access to prayer meetings and other Christian rituals. However, it appears that even in villages with a larger number of converts headmanship was only available to men. Growing up, girls and boys were treated differently: 'Girls are kept more closely under the eyes of the parents than their brothers in the period between puberty and marriage. They work with their mothers and sisters, learning to cook, to pound rice, to make rice beer, and to exercise all the feminine skills of the society, but they do not have the opportunity to spend as great an amount of time with other girls or in the houses of other people. This does not mean that girls are in any way secluded. They dance in the village ceremonies, they go to market, where they can look the boys over and be looked over in turn, and with a fair frequency they get pregnant before they are formally married.' <sup id="cite_ref-1030" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1030">[1,030]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Social class ♣ absent ♥</b> The A’chik were stratified along the lines of clan, matrilineage, and moiety membership rather than social class: 'In Garo society the most important social group is the clan known as MACHONG. A machong is an exogamous matrilineal descent group wherein a Garo is automatically assigned by birth to the unilineal group of his mother. A CHATCHI (moiety) is divided into many machong. Each married couple chooses one daughter--or, if they have none, they adopt a close relative of the mother--to be heiress (NAKNA DONQIPIKA MECHIK) of the family. Her husband traditionally is selected from the lineage group of the father and is accepted as the NOKROM of the house. He resides with his wife in her parents' house. He has to take on the responsibility of looking after his parents-in-law during their old age, and his wife inherits the property.' <sup id="cite_ref-1031" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1031">[1,031]</a></sup> 'The Garos reckon their kinship through the mother. Individuals measure the degree of their relationship to one another by the distance of their matrilineages. For men, children of their sister or sister's daughters are very important kin. For women, children of their sister's daughters are equivalent to the children of their own daughters.' <sup id="cite_ref-1032" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1032">[1,032]</a></sup> 'Land for shifting cultivation is owned by the clan. Each village has a traditionally demarcated area of its own termed ADOK. This area is subdivided into plots that are used for cultivation in a cyclic order. The plots are distributed to the families. Allotment of the general plots is done by common consensus of the village elders. But the flat area for permanent wet cultivation is owned by individuals.' <sup id="cite_ref-1033" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1033">[1,033]</a></sup> 'Property among the Garos is inherited in the female line. One of the daughters is selected by the parents to be the heiress.

She is not considered to be the absolute owner of the property. Decision about the disposal of property is taken by her husband, who is considered to be the household authority (NOKNI SKOTONG). After the death of the father-in-law responsibility transfers to the son-in-law. If a dead man is survived by a widow, she stays in the family of her daughter and is sometimes referred to as an additional wife (JIK) of her daughter's husband.' <sup id="cite_ref-1034" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1034">[1,034]</a></sup> Lineage heiresses and their husbands played a special role: 'Besides objects and wealth, social status is also inherited by the heir and heiress. When an older member of a household dies, the Garos view his heir as stepping into the social position of the dead person-a woman into the position of her mother and a man into the position of his ‘uncle’ and father-in-law. The clearest symbolic expression of this is the assumption by the heir of kinship terms formerly appropriate to his father-in-law. After the old man’s death, other sons-in-law call the heir by the term which is more generally used for “father-in-law,” and are in turn called “son-in-law” by the heir. It has been pointed out that Garos also speak as if the son-in-law inherited his mother-in-law when her husband dies, since after this she is regarded as a ‘wife’ of the younger man. Moreover, the wife’s siblings call him by a term that otherwise means father’s younger brother. This terminology is analyzed more fully in Appendix C. Beyond this somewhat superficial terminological matter, the occupants of the family house are considered to be the living incumbents in the role of man and woman of that particular house. Households continue, though their members come and go. The most striking example of this is the title of nokma or ‘headman’ which, as will be explained in Chapter IX, adheres to the senior household of the village. The man who happens to be married to the heiress of that household is considered to be the ‘headman’ of the village.' <sup id="cite_ref-1035" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1035">[1,035]</a></sup> Prestige could be acquired through hospitality: 'A’jak and dena seem to be weighted in a lop-sided manner to the advantage of the rich members of the community, but the wealth they bring has only limited uses. Wealthy people can buy a few better clothes, eat a little more meat, command larger work parties, and therefore build bigger houses; but all this does not set them off in any sharp way from the poorer people. Rich people spend most of their time working in the fields like everyone else. The main use of wealth is to entertain on a comparatively lavish scale. This converts wealth into prestige and power, while materially the wealth is again distributed throughout the community, since everyone shares in the consumption of the goods that rich men accumulate. Feasts are not given in the Rengsanggri area on occasions designed specifically to validate or establish prestige, though such feasts do occur in some parts of the hills. The Rengsanggri custom is for ambitious men to seize as times for particularly lavish entertainment those numerous occasions when hospitality is appropriate. During the ceremonies, when the villagers are entertained in every house in turn, the richer houses entertain abundantly. The poorest houses seldom fail to offer something; but fewer people visit them, partly to avoid embarassing the householders and partly because there is less expectation of a bountiful spread. It is hardly reasonable for any single person to visit every one of the sixty households in the village, but most do assemble at the richer houses, where they can confidently expect to be greeted with copious amounts of rice beer and liberal quantities of rice and curry.' <sup id="cite_ref-1036" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1036">[1,036]</a></sup> 'Entertaining is appropriate on many other occasions. When a death occurs in the community, the wealthy villagers invite others in for a consolation drink. A few relatives may kill a cow, which they say they do to honor the dead person, but which actually brings as much honor to the man who offers the cow. At the post-funeral ceremony the dead man’s household has the opportunity to kill a cow and entertain. Beer and sometimes food are distributed by participants in legal disputes. Lunch may be served to house-builders, while thatchers in particular are supposed to be rewarded with food and beer. A few households offer feasts to others out in the fields at the Asiroka ceremony, before rice planting. Even the sacrifices to banish disease may be more liberal if the family is wealthy, and thus may provide a larger feast for the helpers. A son or a daughter who has moved away from his or her parents to marry, and who is wealthy enough, may slaughter a cow, ostensibly to honor the parents. Usually the time of one of the major village festivals is chosen for this, and most of the animal is sent to the parents’ home. One leg is retained by the son’s or daughter’s family, however, and there is meat enough for two feasts, one at each house. The feast is described as one of giving thanks to the parents for their help to the child, but honor comes not only to the parents but to the child as well. The greatest hospitality and greatest prestige derive from killing a cow, and a record of the number killed is made public by decorating the front of the killer’s house with the horns and frontal bones of the animals. Wealthy houses may be hung with two or three dozen sets.' <sup id="cite_ref-1037" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1037">[1,037]</a></sup> Ceremonial gongs were also important: 'One of these feasts may serve simultaneously to validate the right of a household to use its own gongs for beating at village festivals. A house must have about fifteen gongs before it is considered decent to use them, and houses which do not own enough must borrow them from a richer neighbor when they are needed. But just to accumulate and own enough gongs is not sufficient; the household must kill a cow for some occasion, such [Page 205] as to honor a parent, before the gongs can be used. After this the household will be expected to entertain regularly and on a larger than average scale, and so to maintain its prestigeful position. In Rengsanggri eight households owned enough gongs to be used in festivals: those of Gajang, Jengnon, Nanggan, Anat, Kakan, Chondu, Rongsin, and Gurang. Many other households had a few gongs but used those from one of these eight households and carried them to their houses when it was their turn to entertain during village festivals. Feasts are frequent enough for poor people to eat significantly better than they would if they relied entirely on their own gardens. Wealth differences lead to greater differences in prestige than in standards of consumption. Prestige and social standing go to the industrious and skillful.' <sup id="cite_ref-1038" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1038">[1,038]</a></sup> Wealthy men tended to be more influential than poor ones: 'People admire the rich men, but they do not defer to them in any formal manner, and an observer could not possibly tell from watching a group of men in ordinary daily pursuits which of them were rich and which poor. If one looked at the size of their houses or measured the size of their fields, however, the relative position of the men would become fairly clear, and the more one observed the details of personal relations, the clearer it would become. Village life is so organized that few important village-wide decisions must be made, but when problems do arise people are usually willing to go along with the decisions of [Page 208] the elite. The nokma must formally designate the day for ceremonies, but before doing so he informally samples the opinions of other wealthy men. If disagreements arise about the distribution of plots for cultivation, the wealthy men can usually carry along public opinion toward some solution. I once watched villagers buying a cow for a ceremony. Every household had contributed money toward the price of the cow, but it was four or five wealthy men who put their heads together and decided whether or not to try to make the seller come down in price. These are not profound questions; but somebody must decide them, and most villagers are happy to leave them to the wealthy men. After all, they “feed” the poorer people, and their very wealth is evidence of their ability. My own judgment of the ability of the various men in the village was close to the consensus of the villagers. I agreed with them that the wealthy people were often more able and intelligent than the others. It does take more than ordinary ability to accumulate or hold on to wealth.' <sup id="cite_ref-1039" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1039">[1,039]</a></sup> But overall there was little status differentiation: ‘In a Garo village very little difference of status is seen. A particular clan holds right of ownership of the village homestead and shifting cultivation lands, and the title of ownership is inherited by a particular household. The head of the land-owning household is known as the  nokma, and the particular area under which he holds ownership right is known as   a’king. He also acts as the religious head of the village, and he is to perform the ceremonies for the general well-being of the village. He is called upon to settle disputes between villagers. But in all his decisions he is guided by the elders of the village. He is not entitled to any tribute from the villagers, and he has no special paraphernalia to indicate himself as the  nokma. However, in the village a rich man gets respect, because in times of need people have to seek help from him. But in a Garo village it is usually very rare to find an extremely rich man. To a Garo wealth consists of a number of brass gongs called  rang and some ornaments made of silver or some such metal. Now-a-days a gun is also regarded as the status symbol of a wealthy man.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1040" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1040">[1,040]</a></sup> Accordingly, we cannot speak of social classes among rural A’chik, apart from a slowly emerging urban intelligentsia.</dd>

Clans and lineages exercised social control on the village and local levels: ‘In Garo society the most important social group is the clan known as MACHONG. A machong is an exogamous matrilineal descent group wherein a Garo is automatically assigned by birth to the unilineal group of his mother. A CHATCHI (moiety) is divided into many machong.

The age differences are otherwise symbolized  in only one way-the order in which rice beer is served. When beer is first passed out at a gathering, the people should be served in order of formal seniority. A maternal uncle should be served before his nephew, and an older brother before a younger one. Even an older sister may precede a younger brother, though generally men and women do not drink together. [...] In spite of this formal deference, older people do not monopolize positions of power, and an old person cannot exercise authority outside his lineage simply because of his age. One defers to one’s lineage seniors, but not to old people in general.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1042" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1042">[1,042]</a></sup> Village headmen acted as intermediaries in local disputes: ‘Among the Garos most disputes arise over the issues of property, inheritance, and domestic quarrels within the family. Such problems are to a large extent settled by the MAHARI (lineage) of the offended and the offender. A new situation develops when someone's cattle cause damage to another's crops. Under such situation the NOKMA (village headman) acts as an intermediary only. If he fails to settle the dispute, the matter can go to the civil court of the district council.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1043" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1043">[1,043]</a></sup>  ‘Traditionally, the  nokma’s position was connected with the indigeneous customary rites. His temporal and ritual powers in a traditional society were linked with his position. The conversion of a  nokma to Christianity automatically led to the loss of his ritualistic role. When the  nokma’s were endowed with real temporal power, the resistance was great as  Nokmas were non-Christians. But when the  Nokma accepted Christianity,  nokmaship passed to another person who could act as a  nokma in performing rites and rituals. However, the Government still recognized the converted persons as  nokmas. This created dislocation in the traditional system, one looking after the customary right and other ritual responsibilities. As the author has tried to show that in the traditional system the two roles cannot be separated, the two roles are enmeshed into each other.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1044" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1044">[1,044]</a></sup> Nokmas also formally held titles to land: ‘In a Garo village very little difference of status is seen.

Now-a-days a gun is also regarded as the status symbol of a wealthy man.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1045" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1045">[1,045]</a></sup> Formalization was largely absent from village councils and trials: ‘The Rules require the village court to “try all suits and cases in accordance with the customary laws of the village.” Village courts are supposed to be non-professional bodies and decide [minor, village-level] cases in an informal atmosphere without procedural technicalities and formalities.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1046" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1046">[1,046]</a></sup> During colonial rule, supralocal executive offices were superimposed onto village- and lineage-based A’chik structures: ‘When the Britishers took over the administration of this district, one witnessed an imposition of hierarchy of new political and administrative units in the district over the traditional democratic village set-up. The British Government, being actuated with the desire to have effective control over the villages and to facilitate the collection of revenues and house tax introduced the office of  laskar with limited police, civil and criminal powers. Accordingly there was a  laskar over a circle of villages; each having jurisdiction covering ten or twelve of villages. Although, the villagers were left to settle all disputes through the  nokma and the village courts, they had right to appeal to the court of  laskars against the decisions of the village councils.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1047" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1047">[1,047]</a></sup> ’In the same way the introduction of offices of  sardar, hill  mandal and hill  mauzadar curtailed the powers and authorities of the  nokmas and their village councils. The new offices were created for the effective administration over the Garo with  the idea of village self-government under the direct control of Deputy Commissioner at the centre.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1048" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1048">[1,048]</a></sup> Village headmen and elders were not bureaucrats, but mediated between village self-governance and colonial authorities: ‘Many of the disputes of the Garos were decided in their village  Panchayats. When a man has some complaints against another he reports them to the Nokma or the village-head. If the nature of the complaints is simple, the Nokma in a meeting of the few leading persons of the village, decides the dispute; but if the nature of the complaints is complicated and not easy of solution the Nokma reports the matter to the Laskar. The Laskar is a very important and influential man in the Garo Hills District. The hills areas are divided into some elekas and each of such elekas is placed under a Laskar for convenient collection of the house tax as well as for deciding the disputes of small nature locally. The Laskar need not essentially be a literate man, worldly prudence is enough for the management of his eleka. In practice a Laskar wields immense influence in his eleka.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1049" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1049">[1,049]</a></sup> The degree of professionalization differs according to administrative level, with full-time bureaucrats restricted to the higher ones. Judges employed at government courts and other top officials functioned on a higher administrative level than the native village councils and were solely dependent on the colonial or independent Indian district executive: ‘During the first few years of the British rule in Assam the district of Garo Hills was treated as a part of the Goalpara district. The whole tract was placed under a Civil Commissioner. This officer took into his hands the collection of rents claimed by the Zaminders from the Garos, and abolished the duties levied by them on the hill producers. For some years a policy of  non-interference was followed but without the desired success; so it was decided to appoint an officer-in-charge of the hills and in 1869 a.d. the Garo Hills were formed into a separate district with Tura as its headquarters. It is said in some parts of the district even now that the British administrators had to get away with many of the influential chiefs and other men of the tribe by killing them for, they could not easily bow down to the foreigners. Once this hills area was completely brouht undegr the control of the government, the Garos lived peacefully.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1050" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1050">[1,050]</a></sup> ‘The judicial officers (who preside over those courts) are appointed by, or with the approval of the Governor. The rules as to administration of justice do not contain specific provisions as to their tenure and salary, or as to their full time or part time character. But most of these matters will be regulated as rules or orders issued under Rule 15 of the Assam Autonomous Districts (Constitution of District Councils) Rules, 1951. It may be of interest to note that there is a specific prohibition against a member of the Executive Committee being appointed to these courts. To this extent, their independence is protected. A legal practitioner can appear before these courts. But in cases where an accused is not arrested, the legal practitioner takes the permission of the District Council Court for such appearance.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1051" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1051">[1,051]</a></sup> Positions given to native petty officials were less formalized: ‘The  loskor has several duties. He collects the house tax within his district, keeping a fixed portion of this as his own payment, and he organizes work parties to keep the roads open. His most important duty, however, is to supervise and try to settle legal disputes. The  loskor sometimes appoints one or more assistants called  sordars, to whom the District Council pays an annual stipend of 100 Rupees, together with a shirt and a pair of short pants. Saljing, who lived in Rengsanggri, was a  sordar; but not every village had one, and a  sordar does not have jurisdiction over a particular village. As a general assistant to the  loskor he may assist in collecting information about a dispute, and in petty matters a  sordar may sit as representative of the  loskor and preside at a trial. The  loskorship demands a large part of a man’s time, but a  sordar spends most of his time working in his fields like his neighbors.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1052" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1052">[1,052]</a></sup> The material seems to indicate that native officials performed their duties on a part-time basis only. Appointed officials on the lower, less professionalized level received stipends or drew their wages from tax income. Lineage elders were appointed to colonial courts on a temporary basis, but only as advisers: ‘The District Council may, whenever it deems necessary, also nominate two or more local elders well conversant with the tribal usages and customary laws, to sit with the judicial officer of the court as a bench and may, by order, invest such bench with any of the powers conferred or conferrable by or under the rules for the trial of suits and cases based on the tribal usages and the tribal customary laws only.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1053" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1053">[1,053]</a></sup> While village headmen were acknowledged by the British administration, the imposition of appointed officials led to a loss of political power among Nokmas: ’In the same way the introduction of offices of  sardar, hill  mandal and hill  mauzadar curtailed the powers and authorities of the  nokmas and their village councils. The new offices were created for the effective administration over the Garo with  the idea of village self-government under the direct control of Deputy Commissioner at the centre.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1054" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1054">[1,054]</a></sup> ‘There was a move for retention of the old institution of  nokmaship which could not function with authority since the British administration had appointed the  laskars and  sardars for the smooth running of their administration from 1824 onwards. The  nokmas became only the clan chief and custodian of the clan land  a’king. The  nokma could not administer effectively as he used to do prior to the British administration in the district. The  nokmas were supposed to be well versed with their functions and duties in the villages. The British administration enforced the Rules of Administration of Justice in the Garo Hills both Civil and Police in 1937. These rules have been renewed again and again. They are in use till the present day. The head of the district administration was the Deputy Commissioner and his Assistants and it has never been changed.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1055" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1055">[1,055]</a></sup> The result was a complex system made up of colonial administrators, native headmen, and petty officials who mediated between formal and informal forms of authority. We have found no evidence of women being employed in any of the roles open to A’chik.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Promotion in administrative positions is open to both males and females ♣ absent ♥</b> See above.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Education is available to both males and females ♣ present ♥</b> There was no system of formal education prior to the colonial period. Young men and boys were educated at the men's house: 'Indigenous system of education in the broadest sense, was in vogue in the villages of Garo Hills prior to the establishment of schools for formal education. The Nokpante or the bachelors dormitory was the only traditional institution which could be regarded as the centre of learning among the Garos. The word Nokpante literally means “a house of bachelors”. The Nokpantes [Page 188] were constructed at the centre of the village, opposite to the Nokma’s or Chief’s house. In certain big villages, each clan had its own Nokpante for the unmarried young men.' <sup id="cite_ref-1056" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1056">[1,056]</a></sup> 'From the age of seven or eight to the date of marriage, all the males were expected to sleep in the Nokpante. The old and experienced men of the village taught the young boys the knowledge and the skills necessary for their traditional life. Besides the practical training in different arts and culture, the Nokpante boys were also given practical lessons on discipline and on high sense of duty. The younger boys were trained rigorously to obey the orders and carry out the work assigned by their seniors. The Nokpante boys also served as the guards of the village. They had to defend the village from attack and do the social welfare activities for the families there. Besides, Nokpante was used as the court room of the Nokma, the Community Hall and an inn for the male visitors to the village to spend the night. The female visitors to the village had to sleep with other women in the village houses. The women were not allowed to enter the Nokpante. The education of girls was considered as the responsibility of the adult women in the family-mother or aunties or grandmother.' <sup id="cite_ref-1057" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1057">[1,057]</a></sup> Missionaries introduced schools: 'The third major influence on the Garos, and in some ways the most important, has been that of Christianity. American Baptist missionaries began to have a few peripheral contacts with the Garos even before their hills were occupied by the British. Missionaries were stationed in Goalpara, a town on the Brahmaputra just north of the Garo Hills, and some of their work was with Garos. However, intensive Christianization began only after the occupation of the hills. American missionaries followed the government officers into the hills and like them set up their headquarters in the town of Tura, which remains the center of Garo Christian activities today. The missionaries not only evangelized, but from the beginning carried out extensive medical and educational work. They established a hospital in Tura, and set up dispensaries at various other points in the district. At first almost all of the education in the district was in the hands of the missionaries. They first used the Bengali alphabet for writing the language, on the principle that this was the alphabet used by the people surrounding the Garos; but they later switched to the Roman alphabet, and today the latter is used exclusively. Today, although the largest part of Garo education is actually administered and paid for by the district or state governments, the [Page 313] legacy of missionary work continues to permeate the educational system. It apparently became established very early that an essential ingredient of all education was the teaching of Christianity. Mission teachers have been expected to teach Christianity as well as reading and arithmetic, and today Garos accept without question that becoming educated is an adequate reason for becoming a Christian. Non-Christian Garos, or Songsareks, as the adherents of the older religion are called, have little opposition to Christianity. Parents of children who have become Christian never express sorrow over the fact but simply point out that after all the child went to school, and so naturally he became a Christian. So completely has this attitude been accepted that the change to government-supported schools has made little difference. Village teachers, whether paid by a missionary society or by the government, are certain to be Christians, since they themselves have had some education, and they almost always see it as part of their job to teach Christianity, even though the government may not require them to do so.' <sup id="cite_ref-1058" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1058">[1,058]</a></sup> Matthew provides a summary of the process. While the very first schools were boys-only, girls' schools were opened soon after: 'THE development of education in Garo Hills is a fascinating field of inquiry. It unfolds their indigenous system of education, growth and development of school and college education in Garo Hills. It is an interesting story of series of forward failures, intermittent progress and slow but steady success, that one comes across when there is transition from savage state to civilization. The missionary spirit that propelled a number of eminent men and women to overcome all sorts of imaginable difficulties in a strange land with wonderful culture of head hunting deserves appreciation. The lessons that we learn from their experiments with the Herculean task will be immensely useful for all those who are engaged directly or indirectly in National Literacy Mission, and formal or non-formal education.' <sup id="cite_ref-1059" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1059">[1,059]</a></sup> 'It was David Scott who first conceived the idea of educating the Garos. He took keen interest to teach some smart Garo boys reading and writing. When it was found difficult to educate the savages, the help of Christian Missionaries was sought. The idea of David Scott was to win over the Garos through the spiritual force of the principles of Christianity applied through the medium of schools. His years of continuous effort led to the establishment of a Government Missionary school at Singimari (1826-29). Mr. Valentine William Hurley was appointed as School Master in July 1828. However, the school had to be discontinued with the death of James Formis, the next School Master, in 1828. The Bengali medium school could not make significant influence on the life of Garos. Towards the end of 1829, James Rae, an young man from Scotland, opened a school at Gauhati for the tribals of the north-eastern region and there were nine Garo youths in that school.' <sup id="cite_ref-1060" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1060">[1,060]</a></sup> 'In 1837, after the arrival of Rev. Nathan Brown, the first American Baptist Missionary to Assam, Captain Francis Jenkins tried his best to establish Bengali medium schools for the Garos by meeting the maintenance expense of the boys and the salary of the teachers by the Government. Thus a school was started at Goalpara in 1847, under the care of Captain Jenkins. But the school could not attract Garo boys in the beginning. However, one day in 1847, news was spread at the Rongjuli market that the Government wanted Garo boys for a school at Goalpara, and would feed, clothe and teach them. The news spread to the villages [Page 190] located above the market. Soon Omed W. Momin and two others Ramsing and Jongrin started from their village, travelled through the jungles and arrived at Goalpara. Omed was over twenty years of age then and others were about 12 or 13. There were already six Garos from other villages in that school. Two other boys joined them a little later. The twelve Garo boys were accommodated in a separate building at the outskirts of the town, away from the Hindu boys in the school. A number of peons were engaged to keep the Garo boys out of mischief. Six months later, Ramke W. Momin, nephew of Omed, also got admitted to the school. Thus there were 13 Garo boys in the school.' <sup id="cite_ref-1061" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1061">[1,061]</a></sup> 'In 1856, near to the Goalpara school, another school was opened at Rongjuli. Ramke was sent as a teacher to instruct in that school for one year.' <sup id="cite_ref-1062" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1062">[1,062]</a></sup> 'In 1864, the Damra school was founded by Ramke W. Momin with the purpose of teaching reading and writing. Fokira W. Momin, younger brother of Ramke and two other boys served as nucleus for the school. Omed and Ramke returned to Garo Hills to share their experiences with their kith and kin.' <sup id="cite_ref-1063" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1063">[1,063]</a></sup> 'In April 1867, Dr. Miles Bronson visited the school at Damra which had 15 boys by then. The school was then placed on a higher footing as a training or Normal school for teachers and preachers. In February 1868, when Dr. Bronson came again with Dr. Stoddard, there were 30 boys in that school. A grant of Rs. 250/- was sanctioned by the Government for the preparation and printing of Garo books and also a monthly grant of Rs. 50/- was made for the Damra Normal school and Rs. 52/- for village schools. During rainy season, the Normal school started functioning at Goalpara for four months from 1870. The Damra Normal school was shifted to Goalpara in 1875 and then finally to Tura in 1878.' <sup id="cite_ref-1064" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1064">[1,064]</a></sup> 'In April 1867, Dr. Bronson founded a school at Rajasimla with Fokira W. Momin, brother of Ramke as its teacher. In 1868, there were 20 Garo girls studying with the boys in that school. In 1872, there was a separate girls school with 34 girls. The American Baptist Missionaries opened their own school at Goalpara.' <sup id="cite_ref-1065" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1065">[1,065]</a></sup> 'In 1874, Mrs. Keith opened a school for Garo girls at Goalpara and called it the Boarding school. They taught both Bengali and Garo in that school, in addition to other subjects. It [Page 191] was closed after a year. There were 14 village schools and one Normal school in 1874. Captain W.J. Williamson, the first Deputy Commissioner of Garo Hills, personally visited those schools. The boys were taught through Bengali medium including simple Garo texts. The need for strengthening Normal school was felt since the products of that school could spread education to all the villages in Garo Hills. As the missionaries concentrated their school work mainly in the northern part, in 1873 a few government schools were established in the south. Thus two types of schools, grant-in-aid schools under the Baptist Mission and the Government schools, came into existence.' <sup id="cite_ref-1066" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1066">[1,066]</a></sup> 'Ramke, the product of Goalpara school, was one of the moving spirits behind the revolution in education in Garo Hills by establishing new schools in the villages, by writing Garo books and by encouraging Missionary grant-in-aid schools. In 1874-75, there were 9 schools under the Deputy Commissioner and nine schools under the Baptist Mission. Step by step, the responsibility of establishing the school, its management and the appointment of teachers, etc. fell on the shoulders of the people of each village, and the teachers often acted as preachers too. The schools established by the Mission were effective instruments in converting people to Christianity. Gradually, Tura became the Mission Headquarters and teacher training centre. The American Baptist Mission accepted the responsibility of running the schools with the grants-in-aid. In 1877, 78 and 79, the Mission opened a few schools and side by side the Government also opened schools on their own. In 1880-81, there were only 458 pupils attending schools and most of them were boys. Mr. Burdette and Thankan Sagma helped teachers training in the Normal school and the trained teachers were then sent to the villages to open new schools. The number of pupils attending the schools in 1890-91 was 593.' <sup id="cite_ref-1067" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1067">[1,067]</a></sup> 'In 1895, the Government had instituted six L.P. scholarships for Garo pupils below 14. The number of pupils attending schools in 1900-01 was 1538 and the percentage of literacy was 0.8, for males 1.5 and for females 0.2. In 1902-03, there were 3 upper primary and 86 lower primary schools and one Normal school in Garo Hills. In 1903-04, there were 94 primary schools and the number of girls attending those schools was 276. In 1905, there were 109 schools and the Teachers’ Training school was raised to the grade of Middle English school. From the beginning of this century, Garos began to take keen interest in the education of their [Page 192] children and as a result, the demands for teachers were far in excess of the supply.' <sup id="cite_ref-1068" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1068">[1,068]</a></sup> 'In 1907-08, the Baptist Mission maintained a Middle English school at Tura itself, two upper primary and 77 lower primary schools.

In pursuance of this policy, the Government took over 29 Mission schools in 1940 and stopped the monthly grant to these schools.' <sup id="cite_ref-1071" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1071">[1,071]</a></sup> Secondary schools and colleges were established in the 1950s: 'With the growth and development of school education, the elite of Tura town felt the need for a college in Tura and formed a local committee from among themselves and collected funds from the public. The first college was opened by the public at Tura in 1955 with evening class in the First Year class of Intermediate Arts Course, where 20 students were admitted. It was closed after one year due to paucity of funds. However, it was revived in 1958. In 1962, it produced the first batch of Arts graduates. In 1958, a Higher Secondary school and a Multipurpose school were opened at Tura. To satisfy the demand for colleges in Garo Hills, the following colleges were established in the year noted against each.' <sup id="cite_ref-1072" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1072">[1,072]</a></sup> Writing in the post-independence period, Marak also provides a short historical overview of the relationship between mission and schooling: 'In 1902 all mission schools were converted into Garo medium schools. The pupils were sent to different schools as teachers as well as pastors to preach in the church in villages. The church activities were conducted in the school buildings and thus they managed to bring all school going pupils into the fold of Christianity. The education and conversion went hand in hand. Thus the dreams of David Scott had come true by ‘making the savage and rude Garos into better human beings.’ Those converted Garos were taught to abandon their traditional religion, feasts, festivals, music, dancing and stop all kinds of sacrifices for invoking the spirits and natural forces. Men cropped off their long hair and stopped wearing jewellery and started covering their naked bodies with the clothes available in the market or wore the clothes the missionaries gave them particularly during the winter months.' <sup id="cite_ref-1073" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1073">[1,073]</a></sup> 'The Christian villages had remarkably changed their set-up by discarding the famous institution of nokpante which was an institution for the young boys specially to educate them in their indigenous ways in the village activities. On the other hand the nokma of the village could not perform the duties of the village teacher and pastor in the churches. Thus the authority of nokma had been completely usurped by these teachers and church leaders in the village. The cultural and socio-political life of the Garos had changed by these foreign forces within a few years of time. They started building their dwelling houses according to designs adopted from the plain areas. Some Garos imitated the life style of Westerners. With the introduction of education and Christianity all the marriages were conducted in accordance with the Christian custom and were called church marriages. Though most of the rural areas had not received education and were free from the impact of Christianity, the parents did not prevent their children to go to school and become Christians. Some of the Garo boys were sent to America to [Page 170] allow them to learn about other cultures and study them. When the missionaries were not given permission to carry on with the evangelization work in India after Independence, the people became deprived of their teaching and guidance with the result that they are neither good Christians nor totally songsarek. Older persons always remember and miss the missionaries; their teaching and guidance had changed ‘the rude and savage tribe’ into one of the sophisticated tribes of India. However, the young enthusiasts do not suffer from this nostalgia and look forward to a healthy revival of traditional norms.' <sup id="cite_ref-1074" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1074">[1,074]</a></sup> Only few A’chik received university degrees (at institutions outside the Garo Hills district): 'The last hundred years have seen the incorporation of the Garos into a larger political and economic unit than they had belonged to before. In the process many Garos have had their range of vision widened from the village to the entire Garo district, but few Garos today have yet acquired any deep realization that for better or worse, the Garo Hills District has become and will remain politically and economically a part of India. There is simply no other place for it to go. More and more Garos are becoming educated. A number have received the B.A. degree and more are attending Gauhati and Calcutta Universities; but almost all Garos think of themselves as Garos only and not at all as Indians. Rural development is being pushed by the government. This will hasten changes in Garo agriculture and perhaps in other aspects of their culture. Economic and political developments will inevitably bring Garos into an ever closer relationship with the rest of the country, but adjustments will be necessary on both sides before the Garos can achieve a secure place within the nation. It is not yet clear how many of the essentials of their culture can be retained in the face of ever-increasing contact with the rest of India.' <sup id="cite_ref-1075" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1075">[1,075]</a></sup> While there was an emerging intelligentsia, most A’chik had little to no access to education. [There was precious little such infrastructure in the mid 50's, so I suppose there was not much earlier. There were no schools in my area in the 50's--There were missionary schools in some areas, and a high school in Tura.  Where there were schools, I think they were run by, supervised by, the Baptist Mission.]</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Property can be owned by both males and females ♣ present ♥</b> Both men and women attended markets in order to barter goods: 'The division of labor between members of the household is as follows: the males are responsible for clearing jungle and setting fire to the debris for shifting cultivation, while women are responsible for planting, weeding and harvesting. During the peak agricultural operations the men sometimes help the women. Construction and repair of the house are male duties. Men make baskets, while women carry crops from the field and firewood from the jungle. Women look after the kitchen and prepare beer, and men serve the beer to guests. Women rear the children and keep the domestic animals. Both men and women sell firewood and vegetables in the marketplace.' <sup id="cite_ref-1076" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1076">[1,076]</a></sup> Property was transmitted matrilineally: 'Descent is matrilineal, residence uxonilocal. The mother's brother's daughter type of cross-cousin marriage is the most widely accepted and prevalent among the people. It is a rigid custom that a man must marry a woman from the opposite CHATCHI (moiety). The rule of chatchi exogamy stipulates that a man's mother's father will be in the opposite chatchi and a man's wife's potential husbands will be in his own chatchi. After marriage a man keeps up his relation with his MACHONG (clan). His relation with reference to wife's machong is designated as QACHI. Marriage establishes a permanent relation between two machong, known as AKIM. After marriage, a male moves to the residence of his wife. In the case of a NOKROM (husband of the heiress of property), marriage does not create a new household, but rather adds a new lease of life to an old household. Even after the death or divorce of a spouse the akim relation continues. It is the responsibility of the deceased's machong to provide a replacement spouse to the surv iving partner.' <sup id="cite_ref-1077" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1077">[1,077]</a></sup> 'Property among the Garos is inherited in the female line. One of the daughters is selected by the parents to be the heiress. If the couple have no female child, a girl belonging to the machong of the wife (preferably the daughter of her sister, whether real or classificatory) is adopted to be an heiress. She is not considered to be the absolute owner of the property. Decision about the disposal of property is taken by her husband, who is considered to be the household authority (NOKNI SKOTONG). After the death of the father-in-law responsibility transfers to the son-in-law. If a dead man is survived by a widow, she stays in the family of her daughter and is sometimes referred to as an additional wife (JIK) of her daughter's husband.' <sup id="cite_ref-1078" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1078">[1,078]</a></sup> Household property was attached to married couples as a unit and was thus not separable from the wife. But property acquired prior to marriage belonged to husbands exclusively:  'No Garo man may possess property apart from his wife unless he has acquired it by his own exertion before his marriage and it is independent of his connection with his wife. In a dispute, a wife had filed a petition against her husband, alleging that he had deserted her and claimed maintenance. She prayed for return of the property which the husband had taken away from the matrimonial home. The lower court made a maintenance order and ordered the return of property. A Garo husband has no exclusive right over the property jointly earned with his wife, and as such when he leaves the house, he cannot take it with him without wife’s permission. If he does so, it amounts to theft according to the Garo custom (Criminal Revision No. 1 of 1963).' <sup id="cite_ref-1079" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1079">[1,079]</a></sup> However, male heads of households managed household property: 'In respect of exercising authority over the household possessions as well as the landed property, the male member’s word is final, although a woman’s approving consent is sought for by the loving husband. She cannot, albeit, wield exclusive right over any material possession. Women have no accession to incorporeal property.' <sup id="cite_ref-1080" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1080">[1,080]</a></sup> Accordingly, male headmen (typically husbands of heiresses from senior households) formally held titles to village land: 'Perhaps the most important single characteristic of a nokma is the possession of titles to land. The land which surrounds a village is divided into numerous patches, and titles to these patches are typically distributed among a few of the richest households of the village, including those of the nokmas. A plot of land to which a man holds title is known as a’king, and a nokma who holds a title is known as an a’king nokma. Titles to a’king can be bought and sold among members of the village; [Page 226] however, at the present time sale is unusual, and land titles often stay in the same family for generations, always being inherited intact by the heir and heiress of the last title-holders. Prices in the past have varied from 25 to 75 rupees for the amount of land suitable for one family’s cultivation; on the other hand, titles even today are sometimes purchased with brass gongs instead of money.' <sup id="cite_ref-1081" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1081">[1,081]</a></sup> 'Holding a title brings almost no direct benefit, for the titleholder has no more right to use the land than anyone else in the village. Nevertheless it confers great prestige, and titles like, heirlooms and jewelry, can be an important repository of savings. They can be converted into other forms of wealth and used to tide the household over poor years, as well as to give stability to its position of wealth in the village. Titles are considered even safer than ownership of heirlooms, since heirlooms can be stolen or destroyed. Moreover, title to some land is a necessary prerequisite for being considered a nokma, though land title alone is not enough. Four men in Rengsanggri had title to some land: Gajang, Jengnon, Nanggan, and Bano; but the first two of these held the most, and only they were considered nokmas. Bano was not a wealthy man, though the household he inherited had formerly been much wealthier. He performed no ceremonies appropriate to nokmaship, and people suggested that he might soon be forced to sell some of his land titles. Nanggan was much richer. He held title to more land than Bano, but still not as much as either Jengnon or Gajang. Nanggan did not perform the ceremonies of a nokma or possess any of the symbols of one; but the main obstacle to his being considered a nokma was that his household had such little genealogical depth. Nanggan purchased some of his title from one Rojang, who was from a family that had formerly been very wealthy, but who was gradually forced to sell some of his land to fellow villagers, and eventually moved away from Rengsanggri. Nanggan himself was an heir, but his father-in-law had been a non-heir who had married a girl from what is now Jengnon’s household and lived [Page 227] separately. In another generation or two, if Nanggan’s heir and his heir’s heir continue to maintain the wealth of the household, they will be obvious candidates for nokmaship, and may assume the symbols and obligations of the office.' <sup id="cite_ref-1082" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1082">[1,082]</a></sup> See also, 'property' and 'inheritance' as well as 'monogamy' and 'recruitment of chief executive' for further information on the matter. Given the above information, this system of property ownership and transmission (matrilineal inheritance by singular heiresses plus male stewardship) somewhat defies the categorization implied in our variables.

</p>
<dl><dd><b>♠ Bureaucratic positions are open to people from all social classes ♣ inferred present ♥</b> Prior to colonization, the A’chik were not governed by a state structure. Clans and lineages exercised social control on the village and local levels: ‘In Garo society the most important social group is the clan known as MACHONG. A machong is an exogamous matrilineal descent group wherein a Garo is automatically assigned by birth to the unilineal group of his mother. A CHATCHI (moiety) is divided into many machong. Each married couple chooses one daughter--or, if they have none, they adopt a close relative of the mother--to be heiress (NAKNA DONQIPIKA MECHIK) of the family. Her husband traditionally is selected from the lineage group of the father and is accepted as the NOKROM of the house. He resides with his wife in her parents' house. He has to take on the responsibility of looking after his parents-in-law during their old age, and his wife inherits the property.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1083" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1083">[1,083]</a></sup> Local authority was exercised by lineage elders: ‘The authority within a lineage is exercised according to age, the older member always being allowed to direct and punish the younger members. The age differences are otherwise symbolized  in only one way-the order in which rice beer is served. When beer is first passed out at a gathering, the people should be served in order of formal seniority. A maternal uncle should be served before his nephew, and an older brother before a younger one. Even an older sister may precede a younger brother, though generally men and women do not drink together. [...] In spite of this formal deference, older people do not monopolize positions of power, and an old person cannot exercise authority outside his lineage simply because of his age. One defers to one’s lineage seniors, but not to old people in general.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1084" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1084">[1,084]</a></sup> Village headmen acted as intermediaries in local disputes: ‘Among the Garos most disputes arise over the issues of property, inheritance, and domestic quarrels within the family. Such problems are to a large extent settled by the MAHARI (lineage) of the offended and the offender. A new situation develops when someone's cattle cause damage to another's crops. Under such situation the NOKMA (village headman) acts as an intermediary only. If he fails to settle the dispute, the matter can go to the civil court of the district council.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1085" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1085">[1,085]</a></sup>  ‘Traditionally, the  nokma’s position was connected with the indigeneous customary rites. His temporal and ritual powers in a traditional society were linked with his position. The conversion of a  nokma to Christianity automatically led to the loss of his ritualistic role. When the  nokma’s were endowed with real temporal power, the resistance was great as  Nokmas were non-Christians. But when the  Nokma accepted Christianity,  nokmaship passed to another person who could act as a  nokma in performing rites and rituals. However, the Government still recognized the converted persons as  nokmas. This created dislocation in the traditional system, one looking after the customary right and other ritual responsibilities. As the author has tried to show that in the traditional system the two roles cannot be separated, the two roles are enmeshed into each other.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1086" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1086">[1,086]</a></sup> Nokmas also formally held titles to land: ‘In a Garo village very little difference of status is seen. A particular clan holds right of ownership of the village homestead and shifting cultivation lands, and the title of ownership is inherited by a particular household. The head of the land-owning household is known as the  nokma, and the particular area under which he holds ownership right is known as   a’king. He also acts as the religious head of the village, and he is to perform the ceremonies for the general well-being of the village. He is called upon to settle disputes between villagers. But in all his decisions he is guided by the elders of the village. He is not entitled to any tribute from the villagers, and he has no special paraphernalia to indicate himself as the  nokma. However, in the village a rich man gets respect, because in times of need people have to seek help from him. But in a Garo village it is usually very rare to find an extremely rich man. To a Garo wealth consists of a number of brass gongs called  rang and some ornaments made of silver or some such metal. Now-a-days a gun is also regarded as the status symbol of a wealthy man.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1087" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1087">[1,087]</a></sup> Formalization was largely absent from village councils and trials: ‘The Rules require the village court to “try all suits and cases in accordance with the customary laws of the village.” Village courts are supposed to be non-professional bodies and decide [minor, village-level] cases in an informal atmosphere without procedural technicalities and formalities.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1088" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1088">[1,088]</a></sup> During colonial rule, supralocal executive offices were superimposed onto village- and lineage-based A’chik structures: ‘When the Britishers took over the administration of this district, one witnessed an imposition of hierarchy of new political and administrative units in the district over the traditional democratic village set-up. The British Government, being actuated with the desire to have effective control over the villages and to facilitate the collection of revenues and house tax introduced the office of  laskar with limited police, civil and criminal powers. Accordingly there was a  laskar over a circle of villages; each having jurisdiction covering ten or twelve of villages. Although, the villagers were left to settle all disputes through the  nokma and the village courts, they had right to appeal to the court of  laskars against the decisions of the village councils.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1089" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1089">[1,089]</a></sup> ’In the same way the introduction of offices of  sardar, hill  mandal and hill  mauzadar curtailed the powers and authorities of the  nokmas and their village councils. The new offices were created for the effective administration over the Garo with  the idea of village self-government under the direct control of Deputy Commissioner at the centre.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1090" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1090">[1,090]</a></sup> Village headmen and elders were not bureaucrats, but mediated between village self-governance and colonial authorities: ‘Many of the disputes of the Garos were decided in their village  Panchayats. When a man has some complaints against another he reports them to the Nokma or the village-head. If the nature of the complaints is simple, the Nokma in a meeting of the few leading persons of the village, decides the dispute; but if the nature of the complaints is complicated and not easy of solution the Nokma reports the matter to the Laskar. The Laskar is a very important and influential man in the Garo Hills District. The hills areas are divided into some elekas and each of such elekas is placed under a Laskar for convenient collection of the house tax as well as for deciding the disputes of small nature locally. The Laskar need not essentially be a literate man, worldly prudence is enough for the management of his eleka. In practice a Laskar wields immense influence in his eleka.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1091" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1091">[1,091]</a></sup> The degree of professionalization differs according to administrative level, with full-time bureaucrats restricted to the higher ones. Judges employed at government courts and other top officials functioned on a higher administrative level than the native village councils and were solely dependent on the colonial or independent Indian district executive: ‘During the first few years of the British rule in Assam the district of Garo Hills was treated as a part of the Goalpara district. The whole tract was placed under a Civil Commissioner. This officer took into his hands the collection of rents claimed by the Zaminders from the Garos, and abolished the duties levied by them on the hill producers. For some years a policy of  non-interference was followed but without the desired success; so it was decided to appoint an officer-in-charge of the hills and in 1869 a.d. the Garo Hills were formed into a separate district with Tura as its headquarters. It is said in some parts of the district even now that the British administrators had to get away with many of the influential chiefs and other men of the tribe by killing them for, they could not easily bow down to the foreigners. Once this hills area was completely brouht undegr the control of the government, the Garos lived peacefully.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1092" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1092">[1,092]</a></sup> ‘The judicial officers (who preside over those courts) are appointed by, or with the approval of the Governor. The rules as to administration of justice do not contain specific provisions as to their tenure and salary, or as to their full time or part time character. But most of these matters will be regulated as rules or orders issued under Rule 15 of the Assam Autonomous Districts (Constitution of District Councils) Rules, 1951. It may be of interest to note that there is a specific prohibition against a member of the Executive Committee being appointed to these courts. To this extent, their independence is protected. A legal practitioner can appear before these courts. But in cases where an accused is not arrested, the legal practitioner takes the permission of the District Council Court for such appearance.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1093" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1093">[1,093]</a></sup> Positions given to native petty officials were less formalized: ‘The  loskor has several duties. He collects the house tax within his district, keeping a fixed portion of this as his own payment, and he organizes work parties to keep the roads open. His most important duty, however, is to supervise and try to settle legal disputes. The  loskor sometimes appoints one or more assistants called  sordars, to whom the District Council pays an annual stipend of 100 Rupees, together with a shirt and a pair of short pants. Saljing, who lived in Rengsanggri, was a  sordar; but not every village had one, and a  sordar does not have jurisdiction over a particular village. As a general assistant to the  loskor he may assist in collecting information about a dispute, and in petty matters a  sordar may sit as representative of the  loskor and preside at a trial. The  loskorship demands a large part of a man’s time, but a  sordar spends most of his time working in his fields like his neighbors.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1094" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1094">[1,094]</a></sup> The material seems to indicate that native officials performed their duties on a part-time basis only. Appointed officials on the lower, less professionalized level received stipends or drew their wages from tax income. Lineage elders were appointed to colonial courts on a temporary basis, but only as advisers: ‘The District Council may, whenever it deems necessary, also nominate two or more local elders well conversant with the tribal usages and customary laws, to sit with the judicial officer of the court as a bench and may, by order, invest such bench with any of the powers conferred or conferrable by or under the rules for the trial of suits and cases based on the tribal usages and the tribal customary laws only.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1095" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1095">[1,095]</a></sup> While village headmen were acknowledged by the British administration, the imposition of appointed officials led to a loss of political power among Nokmas: ’In the same way the introduction of offices of  sardar, hill  mandal and hill  mauzadar curtailed the powers and authorities of the  nokmas and their village councils. The new offices were created for the effective administration over the Garo with  the idea of village self-government under the direct control of Deputy Commissioner at the centre.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1096" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1096">[1,096]</a></sup> ‘There was a move for retention of the old institution of  nokmaship which could not function with authority since the British administration had appointed the  laskars and  sardars for the smooth running of their administration from 1824 onwards. The  nokmas became only the clan chief and custodian of the clan land  a’king. The  nokma could not administer effectively as he used to do prior to the British administration in the district. The  nokmas were supposed to be well versed with their functions and duties in the villages. The British administration enforced the Rules of Administration of Justice in the Garo Hills both Civil and Police in 1937. These rules have been renewed again and again. They are in use till the present day. The head of the district administration was the Deputy Commissioner and his Assistants and it has never been changed.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1097" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1097">[1,097]</a></sup> The result was a complex system made up of colonial administrators, native headmen, and petty officials who mediated between formal and informal forms of authority. We have assumed that men could be employed as laskars and sordars regardless of lineage membership. This remains in need of confirmation. The absence of clearly defined social classes in A’chik society somewhat defies the categorization implied in this variable.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Promotion in administrative positions is open to people from all social classes ♣ inferred present ♥</b> See above.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Education is available to people from all social classes ♣ inferred present ♥</b> There was no system of formal education prior to the colonial period. Young men and boys were educated at the men's house: 'Indigenous system of education in the broadest sense, was in vogue in the villages of Garo Hills prior to the establishment of schools for formal education. The Nokpante or the bachelors dormitory was the only traditional institution which could be regarded as the centre of learning among the Garos. The word Nokpante literally means “a house of bachelors”. The Nokpantes [Page 188] were constructed at the centre of the village, opposite to the Nokma’s or Chief’s house. In certain big villages, each clan had its own Nokpante for the unmarried young men.' <sup id="cite_ref-1098" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1098">[1,098]</a></sup> 'From the age of seven or eight to the date of marriage, all the males were expected to sleep in the Nokpante. The old and experienced men of the village taught the young boys the knowledge and the skills necessary for their traditional life. Besides the practical training in different arts and culture, the Nokpante boys were also given practical lessons on discipline and on high sense of duty. The younger boys were trained rigorously to obey the orders and carry out the work assigned by their seniors. The Nokpante boys also served as the guards of the village. They had to defend the village from attack and do the social welfare activities for the families there. Besides, Nokpante was used as the court room of the Nokma, the Community Hall and an inn for the male visitors to the village to spend the night. The female visitors to the village had to sleep with other women in the village houses. The women were not allowed to enter the Nokpante. The education of girls was considered as the responsibility of the adult women in the family-mother or aunties or grandmother.' <sup id="cite_ref-1099" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1099">[1,099]</a></sup> Missionaries introduced schools: 'The third major influence on the Garos, and in some ways the most important, has been that of Christianity. American Baptist missionaries began to have a few peripheral contacts with the Garos even before their hills were occupied by the British. Missionaries were stationed in Goalpara, a town on the Brahmaputra just north of the Garo Hills, and some of their work was with Garos. However, intensive Christianization began only after the occupation of the hills. American missionaries followed the government officers into the hills and like them set up their headquarters in the town of Tura, which remains the center of Garo Christian activities today. The missionaries not only evangelized, but from the beginning carried out extensive medical and educational work. They established a hospital in Tura, and set up dispensaries at various other points in the district. At first almost all of the education in the district was in the hands of the missionaries. They first used the Bengali alphabet for writing the language, on the principle that this was the alphabet used by the people surrounding the Garos; but they later switched to the Roman alphabet, and today the latter is used exclusively. Today, although the largest part of Garo education is actually administered and paid for by the district or state governments, the [Page 313] legacy of missionary work continues to permeate the educational system. It apparently became established very early that an essential ingredient of all education was the teaching of Christianity. Mission teachers have been expected to teach Christianity as well as reading and arithmetic, and today Garos accept without question that becoming educated is an adequate reason for becoming a Christian. Non-Christian Garos, or Songsareks, as the adherents of the older religion are called, have little opposition to Christianity. Parents of children who have become Christian never express sorrow over the fact but simply point out that after all the child went to school, and so naturally he became a Christian. So completely has this attitude been accepted that the change to government-supported schools has made little difference. Village teachers, whether paid by a missionary society or by the government, are certain to be Christians, since they themselves have had some education, and they almost always see it as part of their job to teach Christianity, even though the government may not require them to do so.' <sup id="cite_ref-1100" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1100">[1,100]</a></sup> Matthew provides a summary of the process: 'THE development of education in Garo Hills is a fascinating field of inquiry. It unfolds their indigenous system of education, growth and development of school and college education in Garo Hills. It is an interesting story of series of forward failures, intermittent progress and slow but steady success, that one comes across when there is transition from savage state to civilization. The missionary spirit that propelled a number of eminent men and women to overcome all sorts of imaginable difficulties in a strange land with wonderful culture of head hunting deserves appreciation. The lessons that we learn from their experiments with the Herculean task will be immensely useful for all those who are engaged directly or indirectly in National Literacy Mission, and formal or non-formal education.' <sup id="cite_ref-1101" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1101">[1,101]</a></sup> 'It was David Scott who first conceived the idea of educating the Garos. He took keen interest to teach some smart Garo boys reading and writing. When it was found difficult to educate the savages, the help of Christian Missionaries was sought. The idea of David Scott was to win over the Garos through the spiritual force of the principles of Christianity applied through the medium of schools. His years of continuous effort led to the establishment of a Government Missionary school at Singimari (1826-29). Mr. Valentine William Hurley was appointed as School Master in July 1828. However, the school had to be discontinued with the death of James Formis, the next School Master, in 1828. The Bengali medium school could not make significant influence on the life of Garos. Towards the end of 1829, James Rae, an young man from Scotland, opened a school at Gauhati for the tribals of the north-eastern region and there were nine Garo youths in that school.' <sup id="cite_ref-1102" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1102">[1,102]</a></sup> 'In 1837, after the arrival of Rev. Nathan Brown, the first American Baptist Missionary to Assam, Captain Francis Jenkins tried his best to establish Bengali medium schools for the Garos by meeting the maintenance expense of the boys and the salary of the teachers by the Government. Thus a school was started at Goalpara in 1847, under the care of Captain Jenkins. But the school could not attract Garo boys in the beginning. However, one day in 1847, news was spread at the Rongjuli market that the Government wanted Garo boys for a school at Goalpara, and would feed, clothe and teach them. The news spread to the villages [Page 190] located above the market. Soon Omed W. Momin and two others Ramsing and Jongrin started from their village, travelled through the jungles and arrived at Goalpara. Omed was over twenty years of age then and others were about 12 or 13. There were already six Garos from other villages in that school. Two other boys joined them a little later. The twelve Garo boys were accommodated in a separate building at the outskirts of the town, away from the Hindu boys in the school. A number of peons were engaged to keep the Garo boys out of mischief. Six months later, Ramke W. Momin, nephew of Omed, also got admitted to the school. Thus there were 13 Garo boys in the school.' <sup id="cite_ref-1103" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1103">[1,103]</a></sup> 'In 1856, near to the Goalpara school, another school was opened at Rongjuli.

In February 1868, when Dr. Bronson came again with Dr. Stoddard, there were 30 boys in that school. A grant of Rs. 250/- was sanctioned by the Government for the preparation and printing of Garo books and also a monthly grant of Rs. 50/- was made for the Damra Normal school and Rs. 52/- for village schools. During rainy season, the Normal school started functioning at Goalpara for four months from 1870.

The American Baptist Missionaries opened their own school at Goalpara.' <sup id="cite_ref-1107" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1107">[1,107]</a></sup> 'In 1874, Mrs. Keith opened a school for Garo girls at Goalpara and called it the Boarding school. They taught both Bengali and Garo in that school, in addition to other subjects. It [Page 191] was closed after a year. There were 14 village schools and one Normal school in 1874. Captain W.J. Williamson, the first Deputy Commissioner of Garo Hills, personally visited those schools. The boys were taught through Bengali medium including simple Garo texts. The need for strengthening Normal school was felt since the products of that school could spread education to all the villages in Garo Hills. As the missionaries concentrated their school work mainly in the northern part, in 1873 a few government schools were established in the south. Thus two types of schools, grant-in-aid schools under the Baptist Mission and the Government schools, came into existence.' <sup id="cite_ref-1108" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1108">[1,108]</a></sup> 'Ramke, the product of Goalpara school, was one of the moving spirits behind the revolution in education in Garo Hills by establishing new schools in the villages, by writing Garo books and by encouraging Missionary grant-in-aid schools. In 1874-75, there were 9 schools under the Deputy Commissioner and nine schools under the Baptist Mission. Step by step, the responsibility of establishing the school, its management and the appointment of teachers, etc. fell on the shoulders of the people of each village, and the teachers often acted as preachers too. The schools established by the Mission were effective instruments in converting people to Christianity. Gradually, Tura became the Mission Headquarters and teacher training centre. The American Baptist Mission accepted the responsibility of running the schools with the grants-in-aid. In 1877, 78 and 79, the Mission opened a few schools and side by side the Government also opened schools on their own. In 1880-81, there were only 458 pupils attending schools and most of them were boys. Mr. Burdette and Thankan Sagma helped teachers training in the Normal school and the trained teachers were then sent to the villages to open new schools.

In 1903-04, there were 94 primary schools and the number of girls attending those schools was 276. In 1905, there were 109 schools and the Teachers’ Training school was raised to the grade of Middle English school.

The pupils were sent to different schools as teachers as well as pastors to preach in the church in villages. The church activities were conducted in the school buildings and thus they managed to bring all school going pupils into the fold of Christianity. The education and conversion went hand in hand. Thus the dreams of David Scott had come true by ‘making the savage and rude Garos into better human beings.’ Those converted Garos were taught to abandon their traditional religion, feasts, festivals, music, dancing and stop all kinds of sacrifices for invoking the spirits and natural forces. Men cropped off their long hair and stopped wearing jewellery and started covering their naked bodies with the clothes available in the market or wore the clothes the missionaries gave them particularly during the winter months.' <sup id="cite_ref-1115" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1115">[1,115]</a></sup> 'The Christian villages had remarkably changed their set-up by discarding the famous institution of nokpante which was an institution for the young boys specially to educate them in their indigenous ways in the village activities. On the other hand the nokma of the village could not perform the duties of the village teacher and pastor in the churches. Thus the authority of nokma had been completely usurped by these teachers and church leaders in the village. The cultural and socio-political life of the Garos had changed by these foreign forces within a few years of time. They started building their dwelling houses according to designs adopted from the plain areas. Some Garos imitated the life style of Westerners. With the introduction of education and Christianity all the marriages were conducted in accordance with the Christian custom and were called church marriages. Though most of the rural areas had not received education and were free from the impact of Christianity, the parents did not prevent their children to go to school and become Christians. Some of the Garo boys were sent to America to [Page 170] allow them to learn about other cultures and study them. When the missionaries were not given permission to carry on with the evangelization work in India after Independence, the people became deprived of their teaching and guidance with the result that they are neither good Christians nor totally songsarek. Older persons always remember and miss the missionaries; their teaching and guidance had changed ‘the rude and savage tribe’ into one of the sophisticated tribes of India. However, the young enthusiasts do not suffer from this nostalgia and look forward to a healthy revival of traditional norms.' <sup id="cite_ref-1116" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1116">[1,116]</a></sup> Only few A’chik received university degrees (at institutions outside the A’chik Hills district): 'The last hundred years have seen the incorporation of the Garos into a larger political and economic unit than they had belonged to before. In the process many Garos have had their range of vision widened from the village to the entire Garo district, but few Garos today have yet acquired any deep realization that for better or worse, the Garo Hills District has become and will remain politically and economically a part of India. There is simply no other place for it to go. More and more Garos are becoming educated. A number have received the B.A. degree and more are attending Gauhati and Calcutta Universities; but almost all Garos think of themselves as Garos only and not at all as Indians. Rural development is being pushed by the government. This will hasten changes in Garo agriculture and perhaps in other aspects of their culture. Economic and political developments will inevitably bring Garos into an ever closer relationship with the rest of the country, but adjustments will be necessary on both sides before the Garos can achieve a secure place within the nation. It is not yet clear how many of the essentials of their culture can be retained in the face of ever-increasing contact with the rest of India.' <sup id="cite_ref-1117" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1117">[1,117]</a></sup> While there was an emerging intelligentsia, most A’chik  had little to no access to education. [There was precious little such infrastructure in the mid 50's, so I suppose there was not much earlier. There were no schools in my area in the 50's--There were missionary schools in some areas, and a high school in Tura.  Where there were schools, I think they were run by, supervised by, the Baptist Mission.] We are unsure how the first pupils for mission schools were selected. We have provisionally assumed that this was regardless of lineage membership, but this is open to review. The absence of clearly defined social classes in A’chik society somewhat defies the categorization implied in this variable.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Property can be owned by people from all social classes ♣ present ♥</b> The A’chik were stratified along the lines of clan, matrilineage, and moiety membership rather than social class: 'In Garo society the most important social group is the clan known as MACHONG. A machong is an exogamous matrilineal descent group wherein a Garo is automatically assigned by birth to the unilineal group of his mother. A CHATCHI (moiety) is divided into many machong. Each married couple chooses one daughter--or, if they have none, they adopt a close relative of the mother--to be heiress (NAKNA DONQIPIKA MECHIK) of the family. Her husband traditionally is selected from the lineage group of the father and is accepted as the NOKROM of the house. He resides with his wife in her parents' house. He has to take on the responsibility of looking after his parents-in-law during their old age, and his wife inherits the property.' <sup id="cite_ref-1118" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1118">[1,118]</a></sup> 'The Garos reckon their kinship through the mother.

For women, children of their sister's daughters are equivalent to the children of their own daughters.' <sup id="cite_ref-1119" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1119">[1,119]</a></sup> 'Land for shifting cultivation is owned by the clan.

She is not considered to be the absolute owner of the property. Decision about the disposal of property is taken by her husband, who is considered to be the household authority (NOKNI SKOTONG). After the death of the father-in-law responsibility transfers to the son-in-law. If a dead man is survived by a widow, she stays in the family of her daughter and is sometimes referred to as an additional wife (JIK) of her daughter's husband.' <sup id="cite_ref-1121" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1121">[1,121]</a></sup> Lineage heiresses and their husbands played a special role in the transmission and management of property: 'Besides objects and wealth, social status is also inherited by the heir and heiress. When an older member of a household dies, the Garos view his heir as stepping into the social position of the dead person-a woman into the position of her mother and a man into the position of his ‘uncle’ and father-in-law. The clearest symbolic expression of this is the assumption by the heir of kinship terms formerly appropriate to his father-in-law. After the old man’s death, other sons-in-law call the heir by the term which is more generally used for “father-in-law,” and are in turn called “son-in-law” by the heir. It has been pointed out that Garos also speak as if the son-in-law inherited his mother-in-law when her husband dies, since after this she is regarded as a ‘wife’ of the younger man. Moreover, the wife’s siblings call him by a term that otherwise means father’s younger brother. This terminology is analyzed more fully in Appendix C. Beyond this somewhat superficial terminological matter, the occupants of the family house are considered to be the living incumbents in the role of man and woman of that particular house. Households continue, though their members come and go. The most striking example of this is the title of nokma or ‘headman’ which, as will be explained in Chapter IX, adheres to the senior household of the village. The man who happens to be married to the heiress of that household is considered to be the ‘headman’ of the village.' <sup id="cite_ref-1122" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1122">[1,122]</a></sup> Prestige could be acquired through hospitality and other displays of wealth: 'A’jak and dena seem to be weighted in a lop-sided manner to the advantage of the rich members of the community, but the wealth they bring has only limited uses. Wealthy people can buy a few better clothes, eat a little more meat, command larger work parties, and therefore build bigger houses; but all this does not set them off in any sharp way from the poorer people. Rich people spend most of their time working in the fields like everyone else. The main use of wealth is to entertain on a comparatively lavish scale. This converts wealth into prestige and power, while materially the wealth is again distributed throughout the community, since everyone shares in the consumption of the goods that rich men accumulate. Feasts are not given in the Rengsanggri area on occasions designed specifically to validate or establish prestige, though such feasts do occur in some parts of the hills. The Rengsanggri custom is for ambitious men to seize as times for particularly lavish entertainment those numerous occasions when hospitality is appropriate. During the ceremonies, when the villagers are entertained in every house in turn, the richer houses entertain abundantly. The poorest houses seldom fail to offer something; but fewer people visit them, partly to avoid embarassing the householders and partly because there is less expectation of a bountiful spread. It is hardly reasonable for any single person to visit every one of the sixty households in the village, but most do assemble at the richer houses, where they can confidently expect to be greeted with copious amounts of rice beer and liberal quantities of rice and curry.' <sup id="cite_ref-1123" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1123">[1,123]</a></sup> 'Entertaining is appropriate on many other occasions. When a death occurs in the community, the wealthy villagers invite others in for a consolation drink. A few relatives may kill a cow, which they say they do to honor the dead person, but which actually brings as much honor to the man who offers the cow. At the post-funeral ceremony the dead man’s household has the opportunity to kill a cow and entertain. Beer and sometimes food are distributed by participants in legal disputes. Lunch may be served to house-builders, while thatchers in particular are supposed to be rewarded with food and beer. A few households offer feasts to others out in the fields at the Asiroka ceremony, before rice planting. Even the sacrifices to banish disease may be more liberal if the family is wealthy, and thus may provide a larger feast for the helpers. A son or a daughter who has moved away from his or her parents to marry, and who is wealthy enough, may slaughter a cow, ostensibly to honor the parents. Usually the time of one of the major village festivals is chosen for this, and most of the animal is sent to the parents’ home. One leg is retained by the son’s or daughter’s family, however, and there is meat enough for two feasts, one at each house. The feast is described as one of giving thanks to the parents for their help to the child, but honor comes not only to the parents but to the child as well. The greatest hospitality and greatest prestige derive from killing a cow, and a record of the number killed is made public by decorating the front of the killer’s house with the horns and frontal bones of the animals. Wealthy houses may be hung with two or three dozen sets.' <sup id="cite_ref-1124" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1124">[1,124]</a></sup> Ownership of ceremonial gongs was also important: 'One of these feasts may serve simultaneously to validate the right of a household to use its own gongs for beating at village festivals. A house must have about fifteen gongs before it is considered decent to use them, and houses which do not own enough must borrow them from a richer neighbor when they are needed. But just to accumulate and own enough gongs is not sufficient; the household must kill a cow for some occasion, such [Page 205] as to honor a parent, before the gongs can be used. After this the household will be expected to entertain regularly and on a larger than average scale, and so to maintain its prestigeful position. In Rengsanggri eight households owned enough gongs to be used in festivals: those of Gajang, Jengnon, Nanggan, Anat, Kakan, Chondu, Rongsin, and Gurang. Many other households had a few gongs but used those from one of these eight households and carried them to their houses when it was their turn to entertain during village festivals. Feasts are frequent enough for poor people to eat significantly better than they would if they relied entirely on their own gardens. Wealth differences lead to greater differences in prestige than in standards of consumption. Prestige and social standing go to the industrious and skillful.' <sup id="cite_ref-1125" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1125">[1,125]</a></sup> Wealthy men tended to be more influential than poor ones: 'People admire the rich men, but they do not defer to them in any formal manner, and an observer could not possibly tell from watching a group of men in ordinary daily pursuits which of them were rich and which poor. If one looked at the size of their houses or measured the size of their fields, however, the relative position of the men would become fairly clear, and the more one observed the details of personal relations, the clearer it would become. Village life is so organized that few important village-wide decisions must be made, but when problems do arise people are usually willing to go along with the decisions of [Page 208] the elite. The nokma must formally designate the day for ceremonies, but before doing so he informally samples the opinions of other wealthy men. If disagreements arise about the distribution of plots for cultivation, the wealthy men can usually carry along public opinion toward some solution. I once watched villagers buying a cow for a ceremony. Every household had contributed money toward the price of the cow, but it was four or five wealthy men who put their heads together and decided whether or not to try to make the seller come down in price. These are not profound questions; but somebody must decide them, and most villagers are happy to leave them to the wealthy men. After all, they “feed” the poorer people, and their very wealth is evidence of their ability. My own judgment of the ability of the various men in the village was close to the consensus of the villagers. I agreed with them that the wealthy people were often more able and intelligent than the others. It does take more than ordinary ability to accumulate or hold on to wealth.' <sup id="cite_ref-1126" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1126">[1,126]</a></sup> But overall there was little status differentiation: ‘In a Garo village very little difference of status is seen. A particular clan holds right of ownership of the village homestead and shifting cultivation lands, and the title of ownership is inherited by a particular household. The head of the land-owning household is known as the  nokma, and the particular area under which he holds ownership right is known as   a’king. He also acts as the religious head of the village, and he is to perform the ceremonies for the general well-being of the village. He is called upon to settle disputes between villagers. But in all his decisions he is guided by the elders of the village. He is not entitled to any tribute from the villagers, and he has no special paraphernalia to indicate himself as the  nokma. However, in the village a rich man gets respect, because in times of need people have to seek help from him. But in a Garo village it is usually very rare to find an extremely rich man. To a Garo wealth consists of a number of brass gongs called  rang and some ornaments made of silver or some such metal. Now-a-days a gun is also regarded as the status symbol of a wealthy man.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1127" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1127">[1,127]</a></sup> Accordingly, we cannot speak of social classes in the case of the pre-colonial A’chik. But while wealth was unevenly distributed, all households had access to plots of land owned by their lineage. Accordingly, we have provisionally coded 'present'.</dd></dl>

Her husband traditionally is selected from the lineage group of the father and is accepted as the NOKROM of the house. He resides with his wife in her parents' house. He has to take on the responsibility of looking after his parents-in-law during their old age, and his wife inherits the property.' <sup id="cite_ref-1141" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1141">[1,141]</a></sup> Land was owned and transmitted by clans and lineages: 'Land for shifting cultivation is owned by the clan. Each village has a traditionally demarcated area of its own termed ADOK. This area is subdivided into plots that are used for cultivation in a cyclic order. The plots are distributed to the families. Allotment of the general plots is done by common consensus of the village elders. But the flat area for permanent wet cultivation is owned by individuals.' <sup id="cite_ref-1142" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1142">[1,142]</a></sup> 'Property among the Garos is inherited in the female line. One of the daughters is selected by the parents to be the heiress. If the couple have no female child, a girl belonging to the machong of the wife (preferably the daughter of her sister, whether real or classificatory) is adopted to be an heiress. She is not considered to be the absolute owner of the property. Decision about the disposal of property is taken by her husband, who is considered to be the household authority (NOKNI SKOTONG). After the death of the father-in-law responsibility transfers to the son-in-law. If a dead man is survived by a widow, she stays in the family of her daughter and is sometimes referred to as an additional wife (JIK) of her daughter's husband.' <sup id="cite_ref-1143" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1143">[1,143]</a></sup> Due to primogeniture conventions in the transmission of property within the matrilineage, heiresses and their husbands had a special role within the extended family (see also 'property rights' and 'inheritance' variables above): 'Besides objects and wealth, social status is also inherited by the heir and heiress. When an older member of a household dies, the Garos view his heir as stepping into the social position of the dead person-a woman into the position of her mother and a man into the position of his ‘uncle’ and father-in-law. The clearest symbolic expression of this is the assumption by the heir of kinship terms formerly appropriate to his father-in-law. After the old man’s death, other sons-in-law call the heir by the term which is more generally used for “father-in-law,” and are in turn called “son-in-law” by the heir. It has been pointed out that Garos also speak as if the son-in-law inherited his mother-in-law when her husband dies, since after this she is regarded as a ‘wife’ of the younger man. Moreover, the wife’s siblings call him by a term that otherwise means father’s younger brother. This terminology is analyzed more fully in Appendix C. Beyond this somewhat superficial terminological matter, the occupants of the family house are considered to be the living incumbents in the role of man and woman of that particular house. Households continue, though their members come and go. The most striking example of this is the title of nokma or ‘headman’ which, as will be explained in Chapter IX, adheres to the senior household of the village. The man who happens to be married to the heiress of that household is considered to be the ‘headman’ of the village.' <sup id="cite_ref-1144" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1144">[1,144]</a></sup> Prestige could be acquired through hospitality: 'A’jak and dena seem to be weighted in a lop-sided manner to the advantage of the rich members of the community, but the wealth they bring has only limited uses. Wealthy people can buy a few better clothes, eat a little more meat, command larger work parties, and therefore build bigger houses; but all this does not set them off in any sharp way from the poorer people. Rich people spend most of their time working in the fields like everyone else. The main use of wealth is to entertain on a comparatively lavish scale. This converts wealth into prestige and power, while materially the wealth is again distributed throughout the community, since everyone shares in the consumption of the goods that rich men accumulate. Feasts are not given in the Rengsanggri area on occasions designed specifically to validate or establish prestige, though such feasts do occur in some parts of the hills. The Rengsanggri custom is for ambitious men to seize as times for particularly lavish entertainment those numerous occasions when hospitality is appropriate. During the ceremonies, when the villagers are entertained in every house in turn, the richer houses entertain abundantly. The poorest houses seldom fail to offer something; but fewer people visit them, partly to avoid embarassing the householders and partly because there is less expectation of a bountiful spread. It is hardly reasonable for any single person to visit every one of the sixty households in the village, but most do assemble at the richer houses, where they can confidently expect to be greeted with copious amounts of rice beer and liberal quantities of rice and curry.' <sup id="cite_ref-1145" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1145">[1,145]</a></sup> 'Entertaining is appropriate on many other occasions. When a death occurs in the community, the wealthy villagers invite others in for a consolation drink. A few relatives may kill a cow, which they say they do to honor the dead person, but which actually brings as much honor to the man who offers the cow. At the post-funeral ceremony the dead man’s household has the opportunity to kill a cow and entertain. Beer and sometimes food are distributed by participants in legal disputes. Lunch may be served to house-builders, while thatchers in particular are supposed to be rewarded with food and beer. A few households offer feasts to others out in the fields at the Asiroka ceremony, before rice planting. Even the sacrifices to banish disease may be more liberal if the family is wealthy, and thus may provide a larger feast for the helpers. A son or a daughter who has moved away from his or her parents to marry, and who is wealthy enough, may slaughter a cow, ostensibly to honor the parents. Usually the time of one of the major village festivals is chosen for this, and most of the animal is sent to the parents’ home. One leg is retained by the son’s or daughter’s family, however, and there is meat enough for two feasts, one at each house. The feast is described as one of giving thanks to the parents for their help to the child, but honor comes not only to the parents but to the child as well. The greatest hospitality and greatest prestige derive from killing a cow, and a record of the number killed is made public by decorating the front of the killer’s house with the horns and frontal bones of the animals. Wealthy houses may be hung with two or three dozen sets.' <sup id="cite_ref-1146" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1146">[1,146]</a></sup> The provision and playing of gongs was also important: 'One of these feasts may serve simultaneously to validate the right of a household to use its own gongs for beating at village festivals. A house must have about fifteen gongs before it is considered decent to use them, and houses which do not own enough must borrow them from a richer neighbor when they are needed. But just to accumulate and own enough gongs is not sufficient; the household must kill a cow for some occasion, such [Page 205] as to honor a parent, before the gongs can be used. After this the household will be expected to entertain regularly and on a larger than average scale, and so to maintain its prestigeful position. In Rengsanggri eight households owned enough gongs to be used in festivals: those of Gajang, Jengnon, Nanggan, Anat, Kakan, Chondu, Rongsin, and Gurang. Many other households had a few gongs but used those from one of these eight households and carried them to their houses when it was their turn to entertain during village festivals. Feasts are frequent enough for poor people to eat significantly better than they would if they relied entirely on their own gardens. Wealth differences lead to greater differences in prestige than in standards of consumption. Prestige and social standing go to the industrious and skillful.' <sup id="cite_ref-1147" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1147">[1,147]</a></sup> Wealthy men had more influence in the community than poor men: 'People admire the rich men, but they do not defer to them in any formal manner, and an observer could not possibly tell from watching a group of men in ordinary daily pursuits which of them were rich and which poor. If one looked at the size of their houses or measured the size of their fields, however, the relative position of the men would become fairly clear, and the more one observed the details of personal relations, the clearer it would become. Village life is so organized that few important village-wide decisions must be made, but when problems do arise people are usually willing to go along with the decisions of [Page 208] the elite. The nokma must formally designate the day for ceremonies, but before doing so he informally samples the opinions of other wealthy men. If disagreements arise about the distribution of plots for cultivation, the wealthy men can usually carry along public opinion toward some solution. I once watched villagers buying a cow for a ceremony. Every household had contributed money toward the price of the cow, but it was four or five wealthy men who put their heads together and decided whether or not to try to make the seller come down in price. These are not profound questions; but somebody must decide them, and most villagers are happy to leave them to the wealthy men. After all, they “feed” the poorer people, and their very wealth is evidence of their ability. My own judgment of the ability of the various men in the village was close to the consensus of the villagers. I agreed with them that the wealthy people were often more able and intelligent than the others. It does take more than ordinary ability to accumulate or hold on to wealth.' <sup id="cite_ref-1148" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1148">[1,148]</a></sup> But overall there was little status differentiation within A’chik communities: ‘In a Garo village very little difference of status is seen. A particular clan holds right of ownership of the village homestead and shifting cultivation lands, and the title of ownership is inherited by a particular household. The head of the land-owning household is known as the  nokma, and the particular area under which he holds ownership right is known as   a’king. He also acts as the religious head of the village, and he is to perform the ceremonies for the general well-being of the village. He is called upon to settle disputes between villagers. But in all his decisions he is guided by the elders of the village. He is not entitled to any tribute from the villagers, and he has no special paraphernalia to indicate himself as the  nokma. However, in the village a rich man gets respect, because in times of need people have to seek help from him. But in a Garo village it is usually very rare to find an extremely rich man. To a Garo wealth consists of a number of brass gongs called  rang and some ornaments made of silver or some such metal. Now-a-days a gun is also regarded as the status symbol of a wealthy man.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1149" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1149">[1,149]</a></sup> Accordingly, variables intended to measure social mobility may be irrelevant here.</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ recruitment of chief executive ♣ ♥</b> Clans and lineages exercised social control on the village and local levels: ‘In Garo society the most important social group is the clan known as MACHONG. A machong is an exogamous matrilineal descent group wherein a Garo is automatically assigned by birth to the unilineal group of his mother. A CHATCHI (moiety) is divided into many machong. Each married couple chooses one daughter--or, if they have none, they adopt a close relative of the mother--to be heiress (NAKNA DONQIPIKA MECHIK) of the family. Her husband traditionally is selected from the lineage group of the father and is accepted as the NOKROM of the house. He resides with his wife in her parents' house. He has to take on the responsibility of looking after his parents-in-law during their old age, and his wife inherits the property.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1150" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1150">[1,150]</a></sup> Local authority was exercised by lineage elders: ‘The authority within a lineage is exercised according to age, the older member always being allowed to direct and punish the younger members. The age differences are otherwise symbolized  in only one way-the order in which rice beer is served. When beer is first passed out at a gathering, the people should be served in order of formal seniority. A maternal uncle should be served before his nephew, and an older brother before a younger one. Even an older sister may precede a younger brother, though generally men and women do not drink together. [...] In spite of this formal deference, older people do not monopolize positions of power, and an old person cannot exercise authority outside his lineage simply because of his age. One defers to one’s lineage seniors, but not to old people in general.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1151" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1151">[1,151]</a></sup> Headmanship was attached to senior households: 'The ‘headmanship’ is thought of as adhering more closely to the house than to any individual person. All the symbols of office go with the house and not with the man. The most important of the symbols is a particular kind of drum so heavily endowed with supernatural power that no one else in the village dares to keep it in his house. It is not necessarily dangerous to use, for at village festivals the drum is carried from house to house and then anybody may beat it. Funeral parties will even carry it to another village if they should go to pay condolences after a death in that village, but it can only be kept permanently in the nokma’s house. The house itself is constructed with specially carved posts which are flattened on two sides instead of being left round as in all other houses; and when a house of a nokma is thatched, special little straw animals decorate the roof. Even the term nokma is etymologically related to that for ‘house’ or ‘household’-i.e. nok; while - ma is a suffix which in some contexts means ‘big’ or ‘large’; thus nokma literally means the ‘big house,’ though it is used to refer to the man of that house.' <sup id="cite_ref-1152" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1152">[1,152]</a></sup> Heads of senior households, i.e. the husbands of lineage heiresses, typically acted as village headmen: 'I have referred in a number of places to ‘headmanship,’ and it is at last possible to explain the nature, duties, and privileges of a ‘headman.’ In any village at least one man-and often two, three, or occasionally even more-is referred to by the term nokma, which is generally-though badly-translated as ‘headman.’ These nokmas wear no symbol of their position which would permit a stranger to recognize them, but any villager can name and point out the individuals in his village who rate this title.' <sup id="cite_ref-1153" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1153">[1,153]</a></sup> 'To explain how a man becomes nokma, it is first necessary to refer once more to the lineage structure of the village. It is simplest to consider villages with a single main lineage first. Just as one household of each cooperating group is considered to be senior by virtue of the fact that all the other households have “come out” from it, one household is the most senior of the whole village, since all of the houses ultimately “came out” from it. The process may, of course, have involved many stages, but the senior household is ordinarily considered to be that of the first nokma. Normally the nokma, like any other man, looks for a ‘nephew,’ that is, a younger man from his own lineage, to come and be his son-in-law and heir. In this case, the ‘nephew’ not only becomes the heir to the house and property but also [Page 224] succeeds to the ‘headmanship’ when his father-in-law dies. Inevitably the nokmas of many villages have grown up in a different village, and belong to a different sib and to the opposite moiety from the people of the main village lineage. A nokma should, however, be a member of the same lineage and from the same village as the previous nokma, so generally a succession of ‘headmen’ are members of one village and lineage by descent but hold the status of ‘headman’ in another village by virtue of being married to the women who are successively chosen as heiress in the senior house of the village.' <sup id="cite_ref-1154" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1154">[1,154]</a></sup> The presence of multiple headmen within one village was fairly common: 'It has already been pointed out that a single village often has more than one nokma. If so, one of them is always considered to be the “first” nokma and the others are considered to be secondary to him. The ranking of nokmas may conceivably have been encouraged by the government’s custom of recording only a single nokma’s name for certain official purposes. But while in some doubtful cases two nokmas of about equal stature may have been [Page 225] given inequality in this way, it seems more likely that the inequality of nokmas and the requirement that one be considered senior has been inherent in Garo social organization and is not simply a response to foreign rule. If two lineages are found in the same village, each always has its own nokma, the man of its senior house. Since the nokmaship is acquired by marrying into a lineage, the nokma can never belong to the lineage of which he is nokma. So in Songmagri, where there are two lineages, the first nokma is the Chambigong nokma and is himself a Manda Sangma, but like his father-in-law he comes from another village. The Manda nokma, on the other hand, is a Chambigong of the Songmagri lineage of Chambigong. Even if a nokma comes from the opposite lineage of a two-lineage village, he is nokma only because of his marriage and never simply because of his own lineage affiliation.' <sup id="cite_ref-1155" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1155">[1,155]</a></sup> 'Even villages with only one lineage may have two or more nokmas. In Rengsanggri the second nokma is Jengnon, who is himself an Agidok from Waramgri, as were his father-in-law and his grandfather-in-law before him. He is married to the woman who is heiress in the house that is considered the second oldest in the village. Jengnon is explicitly considered a nokma, but he is unquestionably second to Gajang, the first nokma, who is himself a Manda from Songmagri. Jengnon’s house does not happen to have all the symbols of nokmaship, such as the specially carved house posts or the special drum, though in other villages more than one house is sometimes equipped with these things.' <sup id="cite_ref-1156" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1156">[1,156]</a></sup> Village headmen acted as intermediaries in local disputes: ‘Among the Garos most disputes arise over the issues of property, inheritance, and domestic quarrels within the family. Such problems are to a large extent settled by the MAHARI (lineage) of the offended and the offender. A new situation develops when someone's cattle cause damage to another's crops. Under such situation the NOKMA (village headman) acts as an intermediary only. If he fails to settle the dispute, the matter can go to the civil court of the district council.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1157" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1157">[1,157]</a></sup>  ‘Traditionally, the  nokma’s position was connected with the indigeneous customary rites. His temporal and ritual powers in a traditional society were linked with his position. The conversion of a  nokma to Christianity automatically led to the loss of his ritualistic role. When the  nokma’s were endowed with real temporal power, the resistance was great as  Nokmas were non-Christians. But when the  Nokma accepted Christianity,  nokmaship passed to another person who could act as a  nokma in performing rites and rituals. However, the Government still recognized the converted persons as  nokmas. This created dislocation in the traditional system, one looking after the customary right and other ritual responsibilities. As the author has tried to show that in the traditional system the two roles cannot be separated, the two roles are enmeshed into each other.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1158" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1158">[1,158]</a></sup> Nokmas also formally held titles to land: 'Perhaps the most important single characteristic of a nokma is the possession of titles to land. The land which surrounds a village is divided into numerous patches, and titles to these patches are typically distributed among a few of the richest households of the village, including those of the nokmas. A plot of land to which a man holds title is known as a’king, and a nokma who holds a title is known as an a’king nokma. Titles to a’king can be bought and sold among members of the village; [Page 226] however, at the present time sale is unusual, and land titles often stay in the same family for generations, always being inherited intact by the heir and heiress of the last title-holders. Prices in the past have varied from 25 to 75 rupees for the amount of land suitable for one family’s cultivation; on the other hand, titles even today are sometimes purchased with brass gongs instead of money.' <sup id="cite_ref-1159" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1159">[1,159]</a></sup> 'Holding a title brings almost no direct benefit, for the titleholder has no more right to use the land than anyone else in the village. Nevertheless it confers great prestige, and titles like, heirlooms and jewelry, can be an important repository of savings. They can be converted into other forms of wealth and used to tide the household over poor years, as well as to give stability to its position of wealth in the village. Titles are considered even safer than ownership of heirlooms, since heirlooms can be stolen or destroyed. Moreover, title to some land is a necessary prerequisite for being considered a nokma, though land title alone is not enough. Four men in Rengsanggri had title to some land: Gajang, Jengnon, Nanggan, and Bano; but the first two of these held the most, and only they were considered nokmas. Bano was not a wealthy man, though the household he inherited had formerly been much wealthier. He performed no ceremonies appropriate to nokmaship, and people suggested that he might soon be forced to sell some of his land titles. Nanggan was much richer. He held title to more land than Bano, but still not as much as either Jengnon or Gajang. Nanggan did not perform the ceremonies of a nokma or possess any of the symbols of one; but the main obstacle to his being considered a nokma was that his household had such little genealogical depth. Nanggan purchased some of his title from one Rojang, who was from a family that had formerly been very wealthy, but who was gradually forced to sell some of his land to fellow villagers, and eventually moved away from Rengsanggri. Nanggan himself was an heir, but his father-in-law had been a non-heir who had married a girl from what is now Jengnon’s household and lived [Page 227] separately. In another generation or two, if Nanggan’s heir and his heir’s heir continue to maintain the wealth of the household, they will be obvious candidates for nokmaship, and may assume the symbols and obligations of the office.' <sup id="cite_ref-1160" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1160">[1,160]</a></sup> Wealthy men were more influential than poor ones, but overall there was little status differentiation:  ‘In a Garo village very little difference of status is seen.

Burling provides a short description of the system of indirect rule as practiced in the Garo Hills: ‘Many of the disputes of the Garos were decided in their village  Panchayats. When a man has some complaints against another he reports them to the Nokma or the village-head. If the nature of the complaints is simple, the Nokma in a meeting of the few leading persons of the village, decides the dispute; but if the nature of the complaints is complicated and not easy of solution the Nokma reports the matter to the Laskar. The Laskar is a very important and influential man in the Garo Hills District. The hills areas are divided into some elekas and each of such elekas is placed under a Laskar for convenient collection of the house tax as well as for deciding the disputes of small nature locally. The Laskar need not essentially be a literate man, worldly prudence is enough for the management of his eleka. In practice a Laskar wields immense influence in his eleka.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1163" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1163">[1,163]</a></sup> ‘The  loskor has several duties. He collects the house tax within his district, keeping a fixed portion of this as his own payment, and he organizes work parties to keep the roads open. His most important duty, however, is to supervise and try to settle legal disputes. The  loskor sometimes appoints one or more assistants called  sordars, to whom the District Council pays an annual stipend of 100 Rupees, together with a shirt and a pair of short pants. Saljing, who lived in Rengsanggri, was a  sordar; but not every village had one, and a  sordar does not have jurisdiction over a particular village. As a general assistant to the  loskor he may assist in collecting information about a dispute, and in petty matters a  sordar may sit as representative of the  loskor and preside at a trial. The  loskorship demands a large part of a man’s time, but a  sordar spends most of his time working in his fields like his neighbors.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1164" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1164">[1,164]</a></sup> Officials employed at government courts functioned on a higher administrative level than the native village councils and were solely dependent on the colonial or independent Indian district executive: ‘The judicial officers (who preside over those courts) are appointed by, or with the approval of the Governor. The rules as to administration of justice do not contain specific provisions as to their tenure and salary, or as to their full time or part time character. But most of these matters will be regulated as rules or orders issued under Rule 15 of the Assam Autonomous Districts (Constitution of District Councils) Rules, 1951. It may be of interest to note that there is a specific prohibition against a member of the Executive Committee being appointed to these courts. To this extent, their independence is protected. A legal practitioner can appear before these courts. But in cases where an accused is not arrested, the legal practitioner takes the permission of the District Council Court for such appearance.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1165" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1165">[1,165]</a></sup> Choudhury also provides some general information: ‘During the first few years of the British rule in Assam the district of Garo Hills was treated as a part of the Goalpara district. The whole tract was placed under a Civil Commissioner. This officer took into his hands the collection of rents claimed by the Zaminders from the Garos, and abolished the duties levied by them on the hill producers. For some years a policy of  non-interference was followed but without the desired success; so it was decided to appoint an officer-in-charge of the hills and in 1869 a.d. the Garo Hills were formed into a separate district with Tura as its headquarters. It is said in some parts of the district even now that the British administrators had to get away with many of the influential chiefs and other men of the tribe by killing them for, they could not easily bow down to the foreigners. Once this hills area was completely brouht undegr the control of the government, the Garos lived peacefully.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1166" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1166">[1,166]</a></sup> While village headmen were acknowledged later by the British administration, the imposition of appointed officials led to a loss of political power among Nokmas: 'In the same way the introduction of offices of  sardar, hill  mandal and hill  mauzadar curtailed the powers and authorities of the  nokmas and their village councils. The new offices were created for the effective administration over the Garo with  the idea of village self-government under the direct control of Deputy Commissioner at the centre.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1167" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1167">[1,167]</a></sup> ‘There was a move for retention of the old institution of  nokmaship which could not function with authority since the British administration had appointed the  laskars and  sardars for the smooth running of their administration from 1824 onwards. The  nokmas became only the clan chief and custodian of the clan land  a’king. The  nokma could not administer effectively as he used to do prior to the British administration in the district. The  nokmas were supposed to be well versed with their functions and duties in the villages. The British administration enforced the Rules of Administration of Justice in the Garo Hills both Civil and Police in 1937. These rules have been renewed again and again. They are in use till the present day. The head of the district administration was the Deputy Commissioner and his Assistants and it has never been changed.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1168" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1168">[1,168]</a></sup> Most local and lower regional offices were staffed by appointment rather than a formal system of merit promotion: ‘After Playfair, we get some accounts on the institution of nokma by Robbins Burling (1963), D.N. Majumdar (1966), C. Nakane (1967). Burling mentioned about the mode of succession to the office of a  nokma who looks for a nephew, a young man from his own lineage and preferably from his own village, who will become his son-in-law and an official heir. Burling also pointed out, the lands of the  nokma is identifiable in  terms of his possession of title to village land  (a’King). When a  nokma owns such a piece of land, he is referred to as  a’King nokma. The  nokmas were not supposed to sell  a’King land without consulting the villagers and that too never to an outsider. Burling also mentioned about the  laskar who is selected by the  nokmas. The  laskar collects the house tax and tries to settle disputes within the jurisdiction of his operation following the customary rules of the community. Majumdar (1966) mentioned that about 60  laskarships were found in the whole area of his study. He mentioned that the  nokmas and the  sirdars were under the  laskars.  A’King nokma is the man who identifies the woman for inheriting the land. This land belongs to a particular clan ( machong). According to Majumdar, a  nokma was also expected to report about the unnatural death to a  laskar in addition to his role for deciding minor disputes within his  a’King.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1169" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1169">[1,169]</a></sup> Lineage elders may be appointed temporarily, but only as advisers: ‘The District Council may, whenever it deems necessary, also nominate two or more local elders well conversant with the tribal usages and customary laws, to sit with the judicial officer of the court as a bench and may, by order, invest such bench with any of the powers conferred or conferrable by or under the rules for the trial of suits and cases based on the tribal usages and the tribal customary laws only.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1170" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1170">[1,170]</a></sup> But given the absence of social classes among the A’chik during most of the colonial period, the variable may not be applicable here.</dd>

<p><b>♠ occupational mobility ♣ absent ♥</b> Most of the population relied on subsistence agriculture: ‘Traditionally, the Garos living in the hills subsist by slash-and-burn cultivation. The iron hoe, chopper, and wooden digging stick are essential appliances. Human labor continue to be the principal source of energy. Very often in some areas a plot allotted to a family remains under-used because of an insufficient number of workers and the low level of technology. To survive the erratic nature of monsoons, mixed crops--both wet and dry varieties--are planted. A shifting cultivator plants a wide assortment of crops consisting of rice (mainly dry varieties), millet, maize and many root crops, vegetables, etc. In addition to these, cotton, ginger, and chili peppers are commonly raised as cash crops. All crops are harvested in October. At present the available strips of low and flat land lying between the hillocks or hills are used for permanent wet cultivation. The variety of crops cultivated is like that of the neighboring plains peoples. Such lands are owned individually. Additional production from such plots places the villagers in a better economic condition. The expansion of the modern economy and the steady increase of population are causing constant pressure on traditionally-worked plots. The same plot is used almost continuously in some areas thus leading to the decline in annual production. This trend is evident from the 1981 census report, which estimates that about 50 percent of the Garo people are now solely dependent on shifting cultivation and the rest use a part of a jhum plot permanently for areca nut, oranges, tea (on a small scale), pineapples, etc. In this changing situation a producer may not always be a consumer; and reciprocity and cooperation do not exist as a dominant force in the socioeconomic life of this population.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1171" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1171">[1,171]</a></sup> ‘The division of labor between members of the household is as follows: the males are responsible for clearing jungle and setting fire to the debris for shifting cultivation, while women are responsible for planting, weeding and harvesting.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1172" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1172">[1,172]</a></sup> There was some trade based on cash crops: 'A few centuries ago the Garos were famous for headhunting. That practice constrained the neighboring population of the plains from entering the hills. But people must exchange their produce to meet their requirements, and both hill and plains Garos needed such trade. Hence some trade started at border points on a very limited scale. Over time, these contacts grew into organized HUTTA (weekly markets) under the initiative of the Zamindars, who were subjects of the Muslim ruler. Initially cotton was exchanged in silent barter for pigs, cattle, goat, tobacco and metallic tools. This trade has continued to the present, with increasing involvement of peoples from the neighboring areas, and has now become fully monetized. Cotton, ginger and, dried chilies produced by the Garos are sold to the traders. The Garos in turn purchase pottery, metallic tools, and other industrial goods such as cloth from the traders.' <sup id="cite_ref-1173" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1173">[1,173]</a></sup>  Roy mentions commercial pottery and weaving: 'Each family in a traditional context acts as a self-contained economic unit. Modernization has brought some changes in the socioeconomic sphere of this population. The Garos residing in the hills did not weave cloth a few decades back; they used to procure thick cloth known as KANCHA from the plains Garos. Now that the loom has been introduced in the hill areas, they weave DOKMANDE (a kind of cloth) for commercial purposes as well as for their personal use. Previously each family used to make pottery for its domestic use, nowadays the art is confined to a few families only who either sell or barter it.' <sup id="cite_ref-1174" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1174">[1,174]</a></sup> Writing in the post-independence period, Majumdar describes agricultural labour in permanent cultivation: 'The household is the working unit in permanent cultivation also. Some of the households of Wajadagiri engage agricultural labourers for the whole agricultural season, whose day to day expenditures are borne by the household concerned and a remuneration of 12 to 15 maunds of paddy (the rate prevailing in 1965) is to be given at the end of the winter harvest. This remuneration is paid even though the person engaged is related to the husband or to the wife. The person who is thus engaged is known as chaparikgipa, and he is expected to help in all agricultural activities. Additional labour required at the time of transplantation is procured by the system of ajak and this happens to be the only feature which we find common in shifting cultivation of Matchakolgiri and permanent cultivation of Wajadagiri. However, in Matchakolgiri the system of ajak is not confined to agricultural activities only. It is used for getting labour for other purposes also, such as in constructing a house, in cutting of thatching grass, etc. But in non-agricultural activities usually only a meal is provided and no remuneration in cash or kind is given. Harvesting and thrashing are done with the help of annual agricultural labourers. At the time of winnowing, neighbouring villages help each other and the owner has to feed the helpers and sometimes provides one or two pitchers of beer.' <sup id="cite_ref-1175" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1175">[1,175]</a></sup> His report also suggests the absence of occupational classes: ‘All the households of Wajadagiri are subsistence cultivators. Though some of the households can sell a part of their produce just after the harvest, there is no large scale farmer selling major portion of their produce for cash. There are no occupational groups in the village. Nor do they borrow the services of occupational groups from the plains. In this respect the contrast with the non-Garo population in the surrounding villages is interesting. The Koch and the Hajong of the neighbouring areas utilize the services of barbers from the plains, who are annualy remunerated  by giving a fixed quantity of paddy by each household. However, some of the Wajadagiri people, who can manage a small sum of money, occasionally do a little prospective business of cash crops. But nobody has yet taken up trading as a wholetime occupation.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1176" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1176">[1,176]</a></sup> ‘No occupational classes have developed in the village. Individuals and households change over from one occupation to another. One household occasionally deals in dry fish. Three of the households possess some permanent agricultural lands in the plains areas. Though the owners do not cultivate these lands themselves, they get their lands cultivated on share-crop basis and bring the owner’s half of the yield to the village for consumption.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1177" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1177">[1,177]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Proportion of population enslaved ♣ unknown: 1867-1873 CE; 0%: 1874-1956 CE ♥</b> It appears that the A’chik occasionally took slaves during head-hunting raids: ‘They visited markets at bordering plains with their produce from the hills like raw cotton, chillies, ginger, wax, rubber, lac and other things to barter for essential items such as salt, dried fish and jewellery of all kinds and most important metal implements and weapons which they needed so desperately. In other words, to generate surplus they needed slaves. To get slaves they had to attack the plains or neighbouring villages. To win and capture slaves they needed to be strong and alert. Obviously in a situation like this economic strength promoted the physical strength.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1178" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1178">[1,178]</a></sup> ‘Hunting, raiding, beheading and attacking were the way of life for the Garo. In those days, people collected human skulls and decorated the roof of their houses with them. Head hunting was considered an act of chivalry, a symbol of higher status and social distinction. We may speculate that this practice might have originated owing to mutual suspicions, which led to attack and counter-attack. But it is clear that this was not a senseless activity because the institution of slavery was closely associated with it. During the raids the people who were caught were kept as  ‘nokkol’ (slaves). These slaves were expected to work in the fields and households of their masters. Keeping slaves was not merely a status symbol but enhanced the economy and position of their masters. Some of the prosperous families had as many as sixty slaves. More slaves meant more prosperity of their owners. As their economic status went up they engaged themselves in trade. They could not tolerate the sight of an outsider anywhere as a result of which a lot of mutual suspicion was generated. They often raided the villages in the neighbourhood, as well as in the plains (Pianazzi Fr. 1934, p. 3).’ <sup id="cite_ref-1179" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1179">[1,179]</a></sup> Playfair claims that slaves played a special role in funerary rites: ‘I have referred to the human sacrifice which was customary in olden times. Another and more merciful form of celebrating  this part of the funeral rites was to keep a living slave tied to the leg of the corpse from the day of the decease to the hour of cremation. He or she was then released from further servitude. When a human sacrifice was considered necessary, but a victim could not be found, the bamboo tray with which the flames were fanned was suspended from a long pole close to the place of cremation. This remained hanging until that part of the funeral rites had been performed.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1180" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1180">[1,180]</a></sup> It is unclear from these descriptions how many slaves resided in a 'typical' Garo village during the pre-colonial period. The practice must have ended at some point during the early colonial period. We have therefore provisionally coded '0%' for much of the colonial period, choosing 1873 as a provisional date of transition (see 'consequences of warfare' variables above).

They not only carried on organised raids on the villages in the neighbouring districts, i.e., the villages in the districts of Mymensingh, now in East Pakistan, and Goalpara in Assam to collect the human heads but also carried on such raids on enemy villages within the districts of Garo Hills. I have mentioned in connection with the death ceremony that they used to consider it necessary to kill a human being on the occasion of the cremation of the dead body. For this purpose, they used to organise raids on the villages in the plains or on an enemy village in the hills to catch hold of a man who may be brought for the purpose of sacrifice, to be performed, near the funeral pyre. The Mimang (spirit of the dead) of this sacrificed man becomes a  nokol, i.e., a servant of the Mimang of the dead person and accompanies the latter to the Mimang land at Balpakram. If a Mimang goes there without a nokol or a cow or some good presents, he is to live there as a nokol of the Mimangs who are well off there.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1199" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1199">[1,199]</a></sup> Head-hunting persisted until the late 19th century: ‘It was not until 1876 that the last trace of the head-hunting proclivities of the Garos disappeared. In the resolution on the annual report for that year I find it stated that the Deputy Commissioner was able while in camp at Rongrengiri, to settle a number of blood-feuds, and no less than 200 skulls, the remains of victims killed in former raids, or murdered in various ways, were surrendered and publicly burnt.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1200" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1200">[1,200]</a></sup> Accordingly, we have selected 1876 as a provisonal date of transition.</dd></dl>

</p><p><b>♠ Description of the Normative Ideology ♣ ♥</b> The following general description was extracted from the eHRAF Culture Summary for the A’chik: 'There are two faiths prevalent among the Garos: native and Christian. People who follow the traditional faith are known as Songsarek. Difference in religion has not brought any split in the population. The traditional world of the Garos includes a number of spirits who behave like human beings but have no shape. They are SALJONG, the spirit of sun and fertility; GAERA, the spirit of strength and the thunderbolt; SUSIME, the spirit of wealth. Propitiation for each is followed by the sacrifice of an animal and an offering of beer. A Christian Garo is supposed to avoid such practices. There are also ogres and biting spirits, called MITES.' <sup id="cite_ref-1201" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1201">[1,201]</a></sup> 'A Garo religious practitioner is known as KAMAL.

A kamal has neither special privilege nor prestige from his service to the society.' <sup id="cite_ref-1202" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1202">[1,202]</a></sup> 'All traditional annual festivals were connected with the different stages of shifting cultivation: AGALMAKA, MAIMUQ, RENACHUGALA, AHAIA, WANGALA, etc. Wangala is considered to be the national festival among the Garos, taking place during October-December. When a member of a family becomes Christian, he refuses to participate in Songsarek festivals.' <sup id="cite_ref-1203" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1203">[1,203]</a></sup> 'They believe that after death human beings and animals turn into spirits known as MEMANG ('ghosts'). Memang are considered counterparts of the human beings.' <sup id="cite_ref-1204" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1204">[1,204]</a></sup> Missionaries introduced Christianity in the colonial period: 'There are two faiths prevalent among the Garos: native and Christian. People who follow the traditional faith are known as Songsarek. Difference in religion has not brought any split in the population. The traditional world of the Garos includes a number of spirits who behave like human beings but have no shape.

There are also ogres and biting spirits, called MITES.' <sup id="cite_ref-1205" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1205">[1,205]</a></sup> 'The cultural changes that come with a switch to Christianity do not all seem to be very intimately associated with the new religion, but any aspects of the culture that either the early missionaries or the Garos themselves considered to be somehow connected with the traditional religion have been replaced. These include almost all of the traditional arts of the Garos-their music, their dancing, and their wood-carving where that was important. Christians do not build bachelors’ houses and they are not supposed to drink rice beer. The traditional village festivals always have a ceremonial aspect. The climax is usually a sacrifice, and a supplication of the spirits or gods. Christianity can hardly coexist with sacrifices to the spirits, and as a result the whole festival-music, dancing, feasting, and merrymaking-is abandoned. Of course, Christians substitute new activities for those that are lost. They have church services on Sundays, and sometimes prayer meetings on other days. They observe [Page 314] Sunday as a day of rest, just as non-Christians sometimes take days of rest in connection with their village festivals. Christians have their own feast days, and on Christmas especially all Christians of a village usually participate in a communal feast to which they all contribute. The delight taken in such feasts is no different from that of Songsarek festivals, except that no rice beer stimulates the Christian’s gaiety. The variety of Protestantism which has influenced the Garos has been rigid in its disapproval of alcohol, and perhaps the Garos have exaggerated the ideas of their teachers more dogmatically than was intended. Today, Christians and Songsareks alike often cite the shunning of rice beer as the primary sign of Christianity, and in answer to the question “Is he a Christian?” the answer is often “No, he is a rice-beer drinker.” If a Christian drinks today, and some of them do, he does it surreptitiously. Christians substitute tea, very milky and sugary, for rice beer, and the two drinks are clearly equivalent. Tea has become a hospitality symbol among the Christians. If one visits six Christian houses in the course of an afternoon, he will almost surely drink six cups of tea; and in some areas at least, tea is served to large parties of visitors at the Christian holidays, just as visitors during Songsarek festivals are served rice beer.' <sup id="cite_ref-1206" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1206">[1,206]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Rulers are legitimated by gods ♣ absent ♥</b> Village headmen acted as intermediaries in local disputes: ‘Among the Garos most disputes arise over the issues of property, inheritance, and domestic quarrels within the family. Such problems are to a large extent settled by the MAHARI (lineage) of the offended and the offender. A new situation develops when someone's cattle cause damage to another's crops. Under such situation the NOKMA (village headman) acts as an intermediary only. If he fails to settle the dispute, the matter can go to the civil court of the district council.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1207" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1207">[1,207]</a></sup> Nokmas also formally held titles to land: 'Perhaps the most important single characteristic of a nokma is the possession of titles to land. The land which surrounds a village is divided into numerous patches, and titles to these patches are typically distributed among a few of the richest households of the village, including those of the nokmas. A plot of land to which a man holds title is known as a’king, and a nokma who holds a title is known as an a’king nokma. Titles to a’king can be bought and sold among members of the village; [Page 226] however, at the present time sale is unusual, and land titles often stay in the same family for generations, always being inherited intact by the heir and heiress of the last title-holders. Prices in the past have varied from 25 to 75 rupees for the amount of land suitable for one family’s cultivation; on the other hand, titles even today are sometimes purchased with brass gongs instead of money.' <sup id="cite_ref-1208" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1208">[1,208]</a></sup> 'Holding a title brings almost no direct benefit, for the titleholder has no more right to use the land than anyone else in the village. Nevertheless it confers great prestige, and titles like, heirlooms and jewelry, can be an important repository of savings. They can be converted into other forms of wealth and used to tide the household over poor years, as well as to give stability to its position of wealth in the village. Titles are considered even safer than ownership of heirlooms, since heirlooms can be stolen or destroyed. Moreover, title to some land is a necessary prerequisite for being considered a nokma, though land title alone is not enough. Four men in Rengsanggri had title to some land: Gajang, Jengnon, Nanggan, and Bano; but the first two of these held the most, and only they were considered nokmas. Bano was not a wealthy man, though the household he inherited had formerly been much wealthier. He performed no ceremonies appropriate to nokmaship, and people suggested that he might soon be forced to sell some of his land titles. Nanggan was much richer. He held title to more land than Bano, but still not as much as either Jengnon or Gajang. Nanggan did not perform the ceremonies of a nokma or possess any of the symbols of one; but the main obstacle to his being considered a nokma was that his household had such little genealogical depth. Nanggan purchased some of his title from one Rojang, who was from a family that had formerly been very wealthy, but who was gradually forced to sell some of his land to fellow villagers, and eventually moved away from Rengsanggri. Nanggan himself was an heir, but his father-in-law had been a non-heir who had married a girl from what is now Jengnon’s household and lived [Page 227] separately. In another generation or two, if Nanggan’s heir and his heir’s heir continue to maintain the wealth of the household, they will be obvious candidates for nokmaship, and may assume the symbols and obligations of the office.' <sup id="cite_ref-1209" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1209">[1,209]</a></sup> However, there was little status differentiation overall: ‘In a Garo village very little difference of status is seen. A particular clan holds right of ownership of the village homestead and shifting cultivation lands, and the title of ownership is inherited by a particular household. The head of the land-owning household is known as the  nokma, and the particular area under which he holds ownership right is known as   a’king. He also acts as the religious head of the village, and he is to perform the ceremonies for the general well-being of the village. He is called upon to settle disputes between villagers. But in all his decisions he is guided by the elders of the village. He is not entitled to any tribute from the villagers, and he has no special paraphernalia to indicate himself as the  nokma. However, in the village a rich man gets respect, because in times of need people have to seek help from him. But in a Garo village it is usually very rare to find an extremely rich man. To a Garo wealth consists of a number of brass gongs called  rang and some ornaments made of silver or some such metal. Now-a-days a gun is also regarded as the status symbol of a wealthy man.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1210" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1210">[1,210]</a></sup> People admire the rich men, but they do not defer to them in any formal manner, and an observer could not possibly tell from watching a group of men in ordinary daily pursuits which of them were rich and which poor. If one looked at the size of their houses or measured the size of their fields, however, the relative position of the men would become fairly clear, and the more one observed the details of personal relations, the clearer it would become. Village life is so organized that few important village-wide decisions must be made, but when problems do arise people are usually willing to go along with the decisions of [Page 208] the elite. The nokma must formally designate the day for ceremonies, but before doing so he informally samples the opinions of other wealthy men. If disagreements arise about the distribution of plots for cultivation, the wealthy men can usually carry along public opinion toward some solution. I once watched villagers buying a cow for a ceremony. Every household had contributed money toward the price of the cow, but it was four or five wealthy men who put their heads together and decided whether or not to try to make the seller come down in price. These are not profound questions; but somebody must decide them, and most villagers are happy to leave them to the wealthy men. After all, they “feed” the poorer people, and their very wealth is evidence of their ability. My own judgment of the ability of the various men in the village was close to the consensus of the villagers. I agreed with them that the wealthy people were often more able and intelligent than the others. It does take more than ordinary ability to accumulate or hold on to wealth.' <sup id="cite_ref-1211" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1211">[1,211]</a></sup> Headmen were typically husbands of heiresses from senior households (see also material on equity and social mobility above): 'I have referred in a number of places to ‘headmanship,’ and it is at last possible to explain the nature, duties, and privileges of a ‘headman.’ In any village at least one man-and often two, three, or occasionally even more-is referred to by the term nokma, which is generally-though badly-translated as ‘headman.’ These nokmas wear no symbol of their position which would permit a stranger to recognize them, but any villager can name and point out the individuals in his village who rate this title.' <sup id="cite_ref-1212" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1212">[1,212]</a></sup> 'To explain how a man becomes nokma, it is first necessary to refer once more to the lineage structure of the village. It is simplest to consider villages with a single main lineage first. Just as one household of each cooperating group is considered to be senior by virtue of the fact that all the other households have “come out” from it, one household is the most senior of the whole village, since all of the houses ultimately “came out” from it. The process may, of course, have involved many stages, but the senior household is ordinarily considered to be that of the first nokma. Normally the nokma, like any other man, looks for a ‘nephew,’ that is, a younger man from his own lineage, to come and be his son-in-law and heir. In this case, the ‘nephew’ not only becomes the heir to the house and property but also [Page 224] succeeds to the ‘headmanship’ when his father-in-law dies. Inevitably the nokmas of many villages have grown up in a different village, and belong to a different sib and to the opposite moiety from the people of the main village lineage. A nokma should, however, be a member of the same lineage and from the same village as the previous nokma, so generally a succession of ‘headmen’ are members of one village and lineage by descent but hold the status of ‘headman’ in another village by virtue of being married to the women who are successively chosen as heiress in the senior house of the village.' <sup id="cite_ref-1213" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1213">[1,213]</a></sup> 'The ‘headmanship’ is thought of as adhering more closely to the house than to any individual person. All the symbols of office go with the house and not with the man. The most important of the symbols is a particular kind of drum so heavily endowed with supernatural power that no one else in the village dares to keep it in his house. It is not necessarily dangerous to use, for at village festivals the drum is carried from house to house and then anybody may beat it. Funeral parties will even carry it to another village if they should go to pay condolences after a death in that village, but it can only be kept permanently in the nokma’s house. The house itself is constructed with specially carved posts which are flattened on two sides instead of being left round as in all other houses; and when a house of a nokma is thatched, special little straw animals decorate the roof. Even the term nokma is etymologically related to that for ‘house’ or ‘household’-i.e. nok; while - ma is a suffix which in some contexts means ‘big’ or ‘large’; thus nokma literally means the ‘big house,’ though it is used to refer to the man of that house.' <sup id="cite_ref-1214" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1214">[1,214]</a></sup> There could be more than on Nokma: 'It has already been pointed out that a single village often has more than one nokma. If so, one of them is always considered to be the “first” nokma and the others are considered to be secondary to him. The ranking of nokmas may conceivably have been encouraged by the government’s custom of recording only a single nokma’s name for certain official purposes. But while in some doubtful cases two nokmas of about equal stature may have been [Page 225] given inequality in this way, it seems more likely that the inequality of nokmas and the requirement that one be considered senior has been inherent in Garo social organization and is not simply a response to foreign rule. If two lineages are found in the same village, each always has its own nokma, the man of its senior house. Since the nokmaship is acquired by marrying into a lineage, the nokma can never belong to the lineage of which he is nokma. So in Songmagri, where there are two lineages, the first nokma is the Chambigong nokma and is himself a Manda Sangma, but like his father-in-law he comes from another village. The Manda nokma, on the other hand, is a Chambigong of the Songmagri lineage of Chambigong. Even if a nokma comes from the opposite lineage of a two-lineage village, he is nokma only because of his marriage and never simply because of his own lineage affiliation.' <sup id="cite_ref-1215" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1215">[1,215]</a></sup> 'Even villages with only one lineage may have two or more nokmas. In Rengsanggri the second nokma is Jengnon, who is himself an Agidok from Waramgri, as were his father-in-law and his grandfather-in-law before him. He is married to the woman who is heiress in the house that is considered the second oldest in the village. Jengnon is explicitly considered a nokma, but he is unquestionably second to Gajang, the first nokma, who is himself a Manda from Songmagri. Jengnon’s house does not happen to have all the symbols of nokmaship, such as the specially carved house posts or the special drum, though in other villages more than one house is sometimes equipped with these things.' <sup id="cite_ref-1216" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1216">[1,216]</a></sup> Nokmas traditionally had a number of ritual duties: 'Traditionally, the Garos were not a politically organized society, and even today there exists no clear-cut political structure. Chieftainship involves religious functions only.' <sup id="cite_ref-1217" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1217">[1,217]</a></sup> ‘Traditionally, the  nokma’s position was connected with the indigeneous customary rites. His temporal and ritual powers in a traditional society were linked with his position. The conversion of a  nokma to Christianity automatically led to the loss of his ritualistic role. When the  nokma’s were endowed with real temporal power, the resistance was great as  Nokmas were non-Christians. But when the  Nokma accepted Christianity,  nokmaship passed to another person who could act as a  nokma in performing rites and rituals. However, the Government still recognized the converted persons as  nokmas. This created dislocation in the traditional system, one looking after the customary right and other ritual responsibilities. As the author has tried to show that in the traditional system the two roles cannot be separated, the two roles are enmeshed into each other.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1218" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1218">[1,218]</a></sup> Accordingly, there was a connection between the roles of Nokma and Kamal: ‘A Garo religious practitioner is known as KAMAL. The word is used to mean 'specialist'; thus a midwife may be a kamal. A kamal has neither special privilege nor prestige from his service to the society.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1219" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1219">[1,219]</a></sup> The village priest or healer dealt with misfortune caused by malicious sprites: ‘These  mite live in many places. Some dwell in the village, others in the jungle, near a tree, or by a stream or waterfall. A fork in a road is a favorite place, and powerful  mite are said to live on mountain tops. All are dealt with in the same general fashion, though the details of the sacrifices differ. Several men usually spend about two hours building an altar. Most altars  are built of bamboo and leaves, but the precise form depends upon the particular spirit to whom the sacrifice is to be directed. Once the altar is built, a ritually skilled man must offer an egg, a chicken, a pig, or even a cow, depending upon the seriousness of the disease and the demands of the  mite. This priest kills the animal in a ritually prescribed manner, and smears the blood on to the altar. He recites a number of chants while standing or squatting before the altar, and usually pours a bit of rice beer on to the ground as an additional offering. At a sacrifice to cure disease, as on other occasions when animals are ceremoniously killed, the priest inspects their viscera for omens. If the proper portion of a chicken’s intestines prove to be filled, for instance, the prognosis is good; otherwise it is bad. While the priest is performing the ritual, the men who have helped build the altar sit around, chatting and joking, with no outward signs of respect or attention. There is no ecstasy and no sleight of hand, and the sick person is not even necessarily present. When the formalities are completed, the helpers prepare the animal and cook it into a curry. Rice is boiled, and all of the helpers share in the ensuing meal. Typically, the entire sacrifice, from the time the participants first assemble to the time they finish the feast, takes three or four hours. Afterward the participants go to their own houses. They are not supposed to go to their fields for the whole day, though they may do chores about the house. Sacrifices of this sort are the commonest kind of ceremony performed by the people of Rengsanggri. They involve only a half dozen or so neighbors and relatives, and they are held whenever the need arises. Occasionally two or three may even be held on the same day if several people in the village are sick. Altogether several hundred sacrifices are likely to be performed in the village of Rengsanggri in a single year.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1220" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1220">[1,220]</a></sup> They also officiated at village festivals: ‘Wangala is one of the three festivals at which group dancing takes place. This occurs in the courtyards in front of the houses, where people like to keep a sizable cleared space for this very purpose. Both married and unmarried people take part, though dancing is generally felt to be most appropriate for the young, especially those who are unmarried. Group dancing is almost exclusively a night pastime, and may continue intermittently until dawn.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1221" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1221">[1,221]</a></sup> During the pre-colonial period, some missionary contact took place, but Christianization itself only accelerated after the British occupation: ‘The third major influence on the Garos, and in some ways the most important, has been that of Christianity. American Baptist missionaries began to have a few peripheral contacts with the Garos even before their hills were occupied by the British. Missionaries were stationed in Goalpara, a town on the Brahmaputra just north of the Garo Hills, and some of their work was with Garos. However, intensive Christianization began only after the occupation of the hills. American missionaries followed the government officers into the hills and like them set up their headquarters in the town of Tura, which remains the center of Garo Christian activities today. The missionaries not only evangelized, but from the beginning carried out extensive medical and educational work.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1222" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1222">[1,222]</a></sup> Despite the ritual aspects of a Nokma's duties, we have found no evidence of headmen being directly legitimated by spirits. And as indicated above, Nokmas who converted to Christianity typically passed on headmanship to another man.

<p><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of equality ♣ present ♥</b> The A’chik were stratified along the lines of clan, matrilineage, and moiety membership rather than social class: 'In Garo society the most important social group is the clan known as MACHONG. A machong is an exogamous matrilineal descent group wherein a Garo is automatically assigned by birth to the unilineal group of his mother. A CHATCHI (moiety) is divided into many machong. Each married couple chooses one daughter--or, if they have none, they adopt a close relative of the mother--to be heiress (NAKNA DONQIPIKA MECHIK) of the family. Her husband traditionally is selected from the lineage group of the father and is accepted as the NOKROM of the house. He resides with his wife in her parents' house. He has to take on the responsibility of looking after his parents-in-law during their old age, and his wife inherits the property.' <sup id="cite_ref-1223" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1223">[1,223]</a></sup> 'The Garos reckon their kinship through the mother. Individuals measure the degree of their relationship to one another by the distance of their matrilineages. For men, children of their sister or sister's daughters are very important kin. For women, children of their sister's daughters are equivalent to the children of their own daughters.' <sup id="cite_ref-1224" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1224">[1,224]</a></sup> 'Land for shifting cultivation is owned by the clan. Each village has a traditionally demarcated area of its own termed ADOK. This area is subdivided into plots that are used for cultivation in a cyclic order. The plots are distributed to the families. Allotment of the general plots is done by common consensus of the village elders. But the flat area for permanent wet cultivation is owned by individuals.' <sup id="cite_ref-1225" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1225">[1,225]</a></sup> 'Property among the Garos is inherited in the female line. One of the daughters is selected by the parents to be the heiress. If the couple have no female child, a girl belonging to the machong of the wife (preferably the daughter of her sister, whether real or classificatory) is adopted to be an heiress. She is not considered to be the absolute owner of the property. Decision about the disposal of property is taken by her husband, who is considered to be the household authority (NOKNI SKOTONG). After the death of the father-in-law responsibility transfers to the son-in-law. If a dead man is survived by a widow, she stays in the family of her daughter and is sometimes referred to as an additional wife (JIK) of her daughter's husband.' <sup id="cite_ref-1226" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1226">[1,226]</a></sup> Lineage heiresses and their husbands played a special role: 'Besides objects and wealth, social status is also inherited by the heir and heiress. When an older member of a household dies, the Garos view his heir as stepping into the social position of the dead person-a woman into the position of her mother and a man into the position of his ‘uncle’ and father-in-law. The clearest symbolic expression of this is the assumption by the heir of kinship terms formerly appropriate to his father-in-law. After the old man’s death, other sons-in-law call the heir by the term which is more generally used for “father-in-law,” and are in turn called “son-in-law” by the heir. It has been pointed out that Garos also speak as if the son-in-law inherited his mother-in-law when her husband dies, since after this she is regarded as a ‘wife’ of the younger man. Moreover, the wife’s siblings call him by a term that otherwise means father’s younger brother. This terminology is analyzed more fully in Appendix C. Beyond this somewhat superficial terminological matter, the occupants of the family house are considered to be the living incumbents in the role of man and woman of that particular house. Households continue, though their members come and go. The most striking example of this is the title of nokma or ‘headman’ which, as will be explained in Chapter IX, adheres to the senior household of the village. The man who happens to be married to the heiress of that household is considered to be the ‘headman’ of the village.' <sup id="cite_ref-1227" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1227">[1,227]</a></sup> Prestige could be acquired through hospitality: 'A’jak and dena seem to be weighted in a lop-sided manner to the advantage of the rich members of the community, but the wealth they bring has only limited uses. Wealthy people can buy a few better clothes, eat a little more meat, command larger work parties, and therefore build bigger houses; but all this does not set them off in any sharp way from the poorer people. Rich people spend most of their time working in the fields like everyone else. The main use of wealth is to entertain on a comparatively lavish scale. This converts wealth into prestige and power, while materially the wealth is again distributed throughout the community, since everyone shares in the consumption of the goods that rich men accumulate. Feasts are not given in the Rengsanggri area on occasions designed specifically to validate or establish prestige, though such feasts do occur in some parts of the hills. The Rengsanggri custom is for ambitious men to seize as times for particularly lavish entertainment those numerous occasions when hospitality is appropriate. During the ceremonies, when the villagers are entertained in every house in turn, the richer houses entertain abundantly. The poorest houses seldom fail to offer something; but fewer people visit them, partly to avoid embarassing the householders and partly because there is less expectation of a bountiful spread. It is hardly reasonable for any single person to visit every one of the sixty households in the village, but most do assemble at the richer houses, where they can confidently expect to be greeted with copious amounts of rice beer and liberal quantities of rice and curry.' <sup id="cite_ref-1228" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1228">[1,228]</a></sup> 'Entertaining is appropriate on many other occasions. When a death occurs in the community, the wealthy villagers invite others in for a consolation drink. A few relatives may kill a cow, which they say they do to honor the dead person, but which actually brings as much honor to the man who offers the cow. At the post-funeral ceremony the dead man’s household has the opportunity to kill a cow and entertain. Beer and sometimes food are distributed by participants in legal disputes. Lunch may be served to house-builders, while thatchers in particular are supposed to be rewarded with food and beer. A few households offer feasts to others out in the fields at the Asiroka ceremony, before rice planting. Even the sacrifices to banish disease may be more liberal if the family is wealthy, and thus may provide a larger feast for the helpers. A son or a daughter who has moved away from his or her parents to marry, and who is wealthy enough, may slaughter a cow, ostensibly to honor the parents. Usually the time of one of the major village festivals is chosen for this, and most of the animal is sent to the parents’ home. One leg is retained by the son’s or daughter’s family, however, and there is meat enough for two feasts, one at each house. The feast is described as one of giving thanks to the parents for their help to the child, but honor comes not only to the parents but to the child as well. The greatest hospitality and greatest prestige derive from killing a cow, and a record of the number killed is made public by decorating the front of the killer’s house with the horns and frontal bones of the animals. Wealthy houses may be hung with two or three dozen sets.' <sup id="cite_ref-1229" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1229">[1,229]</a></sup> Ceremonial gongs were also important: 'One of these feasts may serve simultaneously to validate the right of a household to use its own gongs for beating at village festivals. A house must have about fifteen gongs before it is considered decent to use them, and houses which do not own enough must borrow them from a richer neighbor when they are needed. But just to accumulate and own enough gongs is not sufficient; the household must kill a cow for some occasion, such [Page 205] as to honor a parent, before the gongs can be used. After this the household will be expected to entertain regularly and on a larger than average scale, and so to maintain its prestigeful position. In Rengsanggri eight households owned enough gongs to be used in festivals: those of Gajang, Jengnon, Nanggan, Anat, Kakan, Chondu, Rongsin, and Gurang. Many other households had a few gongs but used those from one of these eight households and carried them to their houses when it was their turn to entertain during village festivals. Feasts are frequent enough for poor people to eat significantly better than they would if they relied entirely on their own gardens. Wealth differences lead to greater differences in prestige than in standards of consumption. Prestige and social standing go to the industrious and skillful.' <sup id="cite_ref-1230" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1230">[1,230]</a></sup> Wealthy men tended to be more influential than poor ones: 'People admire the rich men, but they do not defer to them in any formal manner, and an observer could not possibly tell from watching a group of men in ordinary daily pursuits which of them were rich and which poor. If one looked at the size of their houses or measured the size of their fields, however, the relative position of the men would become fairly clear, and the more one observed the details of personal relations, the clearer it would become. Village life is so organized that few important village-wide decisions must be made, but when problems do arise people are usually willing to go along with the decisions of [Page 208] the elite. The nokma must formally designate the day for ceremonies, but before doing so he informally samples the opinions of other wealthy men. If disagreements arise about the distribution of plots for cultivation, the wealthy men can usually carry along public opinion toward some solution. I once watched villagers buying a cow for a ceremony. Every household had contributed money toward the price of the cow, but it was four or five wealthy men who put their heads together and decided whether or not to try to make the seller come down in price. These are not profound questions; but somebody must decide them, and most villagers are happy to leave them to the wealthy men. After all, they “feed” the poorer people, and their very wealth is evidence of their ability. My own judgment of the ability of the various men in the village was close to the consensus of the villagers. I agreed with them that the wealthy people were often more able and intelligent than the others. It does take more than ordinary ability to accumulate or hold on to wealth.' <sup id="cite_ref-1231" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1231">[1,231]</a></sup> But overall there was little status differentiation: ‘In a Garo village very little difference of status is seen. A particular clan holds right of ownership of the village homestead and shifting cultivation lands, and the title of ownership is inherited by a particular household. The head of the land-owning household is known as the  nokma, and the particular area under which he holds ownership right is known as   a’king. He also acts as the religious head of the village, and he is to perform the ceremonies for the general well-being of the village. He is called upon to settle disputes between villagers. But in all his decisions he is guided by the elders of the village. He is not entitled to any tribute from the villagers, and he has no special paraphernalia to indicate himself as the  nokma. However, in the village a rich man gets respect, because in times of need people have to seek help from him. But in a Garo village it is usually very rare to find an extremely rich man. To a Garo wealth consists of a number of brass gongs called  rang and some ornaments made of silver or some such metal. Now-a-days a gun is also regarded as the status symbol of a wealthy man.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1232" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1232">[1,232]</a></sup> Accordingly, we cannot speak of social classes or an elite/commoner divide in the case of the pre-colonial A’chik. We have assumed this to be true of the colonial period as well.

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Ideological thought equates rulers and commoners ♣ present ♥</b> Clans and lineages exercised social control on the village and local levels: ‘In Garo society the most important social group is the clan known as MACHONG. A machong is an exogamous matrilineal descent group wherein a Garo is automatically assigned by birth to the unilineal group of his mother. A CHATCHI (moiety) is divided into many machong. Each married couple chooses one daughter--or, if they have none, they adopt a close relative of the mother--to be heiress (NAKNA DONQIPIKA MECHIK) of the family. Her husband traditionally is selected from the lineage group of the father and is accepted as the NOKROM of the house. He resides with his wife in her parents' house. He has to take on the responsibility of looking after his parents-in-law during their old age, and his wife inherits the property.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1233" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1233">[1,233]</a></sup> Local authority was exercised by lineage elders: ‘The authority within a lineage is exercised according to age, the older member always being allowed to direct and punish the younger members. The age differences are otherwise symbolized  in only one way-the order in which rice beer is served. When beer is first passed out at a gathering, the people should be served in order of formal seniority. A maternal uncle should be served before his nephew, and an older brother before a younger one. Even an older sister may precede a younger brother, though generally men and women do not drink together. [...] In spite of this formal deference, older people do not monopolize positions of power, and an old person cannot exercise authority outside his lineage simply because of his age. One defers to one’s lineage seniors, but not to old people in general.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1234" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1234">[1,234]</a></sup> Headmanship was attached to senior households: 'The ‘headmanship’ is thought of as adhering more closely to the house than to any individual person. All the symbols of office go with the house and not with the man. The most important of the symbols is a particular kind of drum so heavily endowed with supernatural power that no one else in the village dares to keep it in his house. It is not necessarily dangerous to use, for at village festivals the drum is carried from house to house and then anybody may beat it. Funeral parties will even carry it to another village if they should go to pay condolences after a death in that village, but it can only be kept permanently in the nokma’s house. The house itself is constructed with specially carved posts which are flattened on two sides instead of being left round as in all other houses; and when a house of a nokma is thatched, special little straw animals decorate the roof. Even the term nokma is etymologically related to that for ‘house’ or ‘household’-i.e. nok; while - ma is a suffix which in some contexts means ‘big’ or ‘large’; thus nokma literally means the ‘big house,’ though it is used to refer to the man of that house.' <sup id="cite_ref-1235" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1235">[1,235]</a></sup> Heads of senior households, i.e. the husbands of lineage heiresses, typically acted as village headmen: 'I have referred in a number of places to ‘headmanship,’ and it is at last possible to explain the nature, duties, and privileges of a ‘headman.’ In any village at least one man-and often two, three, or occasionally even more-is referred to by the term nokma, which is generally-though badly-translated as ‘headman.’ These nokmas wear no symbol of their position which would permit a stranger to recognize them, but any villager can name and point out the individuals in his village who rate this title.' <sup id="cite_ref-1236" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1236">[1,236]</a></sup> 'To explain how a man becomes nokma, it is first necessary to refer once more to the lineage structure of the village. It is simplest to consider villages with a single main lineage first. Just as one household of each cooperating group is considered to be senior by virtue of the fact that all the other households have “come out” from it, one household is the most senior of the whole village, since all of the houses ultimately “came out” from it. The process may, of course, have involved many stages, but the senior household is ordinarily considered to be that of the first nokma. Normally the nokma, like any other man, looks for a ‘nephew,’ that is, a younger man from his own lineage, to come and be his son-in-law and heir. In this case, the ‘nephew’ not only becomes the heir to the house and property but also [Page 224] succeeds to the ‘headmanship’ when his father-in-law dies. Inevitably the nokmas of many villages have grown up in a different village, and belong to a different sib and to the opposite moiety from the people of the main village lineage. A nokma should, however, be a member of the same lineage and from the same village as the previous nokma, so generally a succession of ‘headmen’ are members of one village and lineage by descent but hold the status of ‘headman’ in another village by virtue of being married to the women who are successively chosen as heiress in the senior house of the village.' <sup id="cite_ref-1237" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1237">[1,237]</a></sup> The presence of multiple headmen within one village was fairly common: 'It has already been pointed out that a single village often has more than one nokma. If so, one of them is always considered to be the “first” nokma and the others are considered to be secondary to him. The ranking of nokmas may conceivably have been encouraged by the government’s custom of recording only a single nokma’s name for certain official purposes. But while in some doubtful cases two nokmas of about equal stature may have been [Page 225] given inequality in this way, it seems more likely that the inequality of nokmas and the requirement that one be considered senior has been inherent in Garo social organization and is not simply a response to foreign rule. If two lineages are found in the same village, each always has its own nokma, the man of its senior house. Since the nokmaship is acquired by marrying into a lineage, the nokma can never belong to the lineage of which he is nokma. So in Songmagri, where there are two lineages, the first nokma is the Chambigong nokma and is himself a Manda Sangma, but like his father-in-law he comes from another village. The Manda nokma, on the other hand, is a Chambigong of the Songmagri lineage of Chambigong. Even if a nokma comes from the opposite lineage of a two-lineage village, he is nokma only because of his marriage and never simply because of his own lineage affiliation.' <sup id="cite_ref-1238" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1238">[1,238]</a></sup> 'Even villages with only one lineage may have two or more nokmas. In Rengsanggri the second nokma is Jengnon, who is himself an Agidok from Waramgri, as were his father-in-law and his grandfather-in-law before him. He is married to the woman who is heiress in the house that is considered the second oldest in the village. Jengnon is explicitly considered a nokma, but he is unquestionably second to Gajang, the first nokma, who is himself a Manda from Songmagri. Jengnon’s house does not happen to have all the symbols of nokmaship, such as the specially carved house posts or the special drum, though in other villages more than one house is sometimes equipped with these things.' <sup id="cite_ref-1239" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1239">[1,239]</a></sup> Village headmen acted as intermediaries in local disputes: ‘Among the Garos most disputes arise over the issues of property, inheritance, and domestic quarrels within the family. Such problems are to a large extent settled by the MAHARI (lineage) of the offended and the offender. A new situation develops when someone's cattle cause damage to another's crops. Under such situation the NOKMA (village headman) acts as an intermediary only. If he fails to settle the dispute, the matter can go to the civil court of the district council.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1240" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1240">[1,240]</a></sup>  ‘Traditionally, the  nokma’s position was connected with the indigeneous customary rites. His temporal and ritual powers in a traditional society were linked with his position. The conversion of a  nokma to Christianity automatically led to the loss of his ritualistic role. When the  nokma’s were endowed with real temporal power, the resistance was great as  Nokmas were non-Christians. But when the  Nokma accepted Christianity,  nokmaship passed to another person who could act as a  nokma in performing rites and rituals. However, the Government still recognized the converted persons as  nokmas. This created dislocation in the traditional system, one looking after the customary right and other ritual responsibilities. As the author has tried to show that in the traditional system the two roles cannot be separated, the two roles are enmeshed into each other.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1241" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1241">[1,241]</a></sup> Nokmas also formally held titles to land: 'Perhaps the most important single characteristic of a nokma is the possession of titles to land. The land which surrounds a village is divided into numerous patches, and titles to these patches are typically distributed among a few of the richest households of the village, including those of the nokmas. A plot of land to which a man holds title is known as a’king, and a nokma who holds a title is known as an a’king nokma. Titles to a’king can be bought and sold among members of the village; [Page 226] however, at the present time sale is unusual, and land titles often stay in the same family for generations, always being inherited intact by the heir and heiress of the last title-holders. Prices in the past have varied from 25 to 75 rupees for the amount of land suitable for one family’s cultivation; on the other hand, titles even today are sometimes purchased with brass gongs instead of money.' <sup id="cite_ref-1242" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1242">[1,242]</a></sup> 'Holding a title brings almost no direct benefit, for the titleholder has no more right to use the land than anyone else in the village. Nevertheless it confers great prestige, and titles like, heirlooms and jewelry, can be an important repository of savings. They can be converted into other forms of wealth and used to tide the household over poor years, as well as to give stability to its position of wealth in the village. Titles are considered even safer than ownership of heirlooms, since heirlooms can be stolen or destroyed. Moreover, title to some land is a necessary prerequisite for being considered a nokma, though land title alone is not enough. Four men in Rengsanggri had title to some land: Gajang, Jengnon, Nanggan, and Bano; but the first two of these held the most, and only they were considered nokmas. Bano was not a wealthy man, though the household he inherited had formerly been much wealthier. He performed no ceremonies appropriate to nokmaship, and people suggested that he might soon be forced to sell some of his land titles. Nanggan was much richer. He held title to more land than Bano, but still not as much as either Jengnon or Gajang. Nanggan did not perform the ceremonies of a nokma or possess any of the symbols of one; but the main obstacle to his being considered a nokma was that his household had such little genealogical depth. Nanggan purchased some of his title from one Rojang, who was from a family that had formerly been very wealthy, but who was gradually forced to sell some of his land to fellow villagers, and eventually moved away from Rengsanggri. Nanggan himself was an heir, but his father-in-law had been a non-heir who had married a girl from what is now Jengnon’s household and lived [Page 227] separately. In another generation or two, if Nanggan’s heir and his heir’s heir continue to maintain the wealth of the household, they will be obvious candidates for nokmaship, and may assume the symbols and obligations of the office.' <sup id="cite_ref-1243" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1243">[1,243]</a></sup> Wealthy men were more influential than poor ones, but overall there was little status differentiation:  ‘In a Garo village very little difference of status is seen.

Individuals measure the degree of their relationship to one another by the distance of their matrilineages. For men, children of their sister or sister's daughters are very important kin. For women, children of their sister's daughters are equivalent to the children of their own daughters.' <sup id="cite_ref-1247" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1247">[1,247]</a></sup> 'Land for shifting cultivation is owned by the clan. Each village has a traditionally demarcated area of its own termed ADOK. This area is subdivided into plots that are used for cultivation in a cyclic order. The plots are distributed to the families. Allotment of the general plots is done by common consensus of the village elders. But the flat area for permanent wet cultivation is owned by individuals.' <sup id="cite_ref-1248" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1248">[1,248]</a></sup> 'Property among the Garos is inherited in the female line. One of the daughters is selected by the parents to be the heiress. If the couple have no female child, a girl belonging to the machong of the wife (preferably the daughter of her sister, whether real or classificatory) is adopted to be an heiress. She is not considered to be the absolute owner of the property. Decision about the disposal of property is taken by her husband, who is considered to be the household authority (NOKNI SKOTONG). After the death of the father-in-law responsibility transfers to the son-in-law. If a dead man is survived by a widow, she stays in the family of her daughter and is sometimes referred to as an additional wife (JIK) of her daughter's husband.' <sup id="cite_ref-1249" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1249">[1,249]</a></sup> Lineage heiresses and their husbands played a special role: 'Besides objects and wealth, social status is also inherited by the heir and heiress. When an older member of a household dies, the Garos view his heir as stepping into the social position of the dead person-a woman into the position of her mother and a man into the position of his ‘uncle’ and father-in-law. The clearest symbolic expression of this is the assumption by the heir of kinship terms formerly appropriate to his father-in-law. After the old man’s death, other sons-in-law call the heir by the term which is more generally used for “father-in-law,” and are in turn called “son-in-law” by the heir. It has been pointed out that Garos also speak as if the son-in-law inherited his mother-in-law when her husband dies, since after this she is regarded as a ‘wife’ of the younger man. Moreover, the wife’s siblings call him by a term that otherwise means father’s younger brother. This terminology is analyzed more fully in Appendix C. Beyond this somewhat superficial terminological matter, the occupants of the family house are considered to be the living incumbents in the role of man and woman of that particular house. Households continue, though their members come and go. The most striking example of this is the title of nokma or ‘headman’ which, as will be explained in Chapter IX, adheres to the senior household of the village. The man who happens to be married to the heiress of that household is considered to be the ‘headman’ of the village.' <sup id="cite_ref-1250" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1250">[1,250]</a></sup> Prestige could be acquired through hospitality: 'A’jak and dena seem to be weighted in a lop-sided manner to the advantage of the rich members of the community, but the wealth they bring has only limited uses. Wealthy people can buy a few better clothes, eat a little more meat, command larger work parties, and therefore build bigger houses; but all this does not set them off in any sharp way from the poorer people. Rich people spend most of their time working in the fields like everyone else. The main use of wealth is to entertain on a comparatively lavish scale. This converts wealth into prestige and power, while materially the wealth is again distributed throughout the community, since everyone shares in the consumption of the goods that rich men accumulate. Feasts are not given in the Rengsanggri area on occasions designed specifically to validate or establish prestige, though such feasts do occur in some parts of the hills. The Rengsanggri custom is for ambitious men to seize as times for particularly lavish entertainment those numerous occasions when hospitality is appropriate. During the ceremonies, when the villagers are entertained in every house in turn, the richer houses entertain abundantly. The poorest houses seldom fail to offer something; but fewer people visit them, partly to avoid embarassing the householders and partly because there is less expectation of a bountiful spread.

But in all his decisions he is guided by the elders of the village. He is not entitled to any tribute from the villagers, and he has no special paraphernalia to indicate himself as the  nokma. However, in the village a rich man gets respect, because in times of need people have to seek help from him. But in a Garo village it is usually very rare to find an extremely rich man. To a Garo wealth consists of a number of brass gongs called  rang and some ornaments made of silver or some such metal. Now-a-days a gun is also regarded as the status symbol of a wealthy man.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1255" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1255">[1,255]</a></sup> Accordingly, we cannot speak of social classes or an elite/commoner divide in the case of the pre-colonial A’chik. We have assumed this to be true of the colonial period as well.</dd>

<dd> <b>♠ Ideological thought distinguishes men and women ♣ present ♥</b> It appears that menstruation and pregnancy were not subject to strict taboos or associated with notions of impurity: ‘Within a year or so after marriage most women become pregnant, but the Garos recognize some necessary preliminaries: “As a tree must bloom before it bears its fruit, so a woman must have her menses before she can bear her child.” Women sometimes have pain and discomfort at this time. An unmarried girl is expected to get over this by herself, and even her first menses are not ceremonially marked, but an attentive husband may perform a small sacrifice to appease the spirits who plague his wife if she is in pain or if the period lasts too long. A menstruating woman is under no formal restrictions, but sexual relations are avoided, and she often wears dark clothes and is likely to spend at least one or two days fairly close to the house so as not to be embarrassed before her neighbors. She has to wash extra clothes, and when these hang out to dry, the women of the village take notice and know that she is not yet pregnant. I was told that the men are seldom so observant.' <sup id="cite_ref-1256" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1256">[1,256]</a></sup> 'When the pregnancy becomes obvious by the enlargement of the abdomen or when the movement of the baby is first felt, several sacrifices are performed at intervals of a few days or a week. These insure the health of both the fetus and the mother. The woman’s husband most often performs the sacrifices himself, but he may call in another man if he prefers. Young husbands particularly feel some shyness in offering sacrifices, and any other person, even the girl’s father, can do them for him. It is expected that the father will perform the sacrifices for an unmarried daughter who becomes pregnant, but if a husband does not at least make certain that somebody attends to them, the relatives would surely blame him for any complications that should arise. Four sacrifices are usual at this time, though a sickly woman will warrant more. Each sacrifice is designed to appease a different spirit and as in sacrifices performed to cure disease, an animal must be killed at each, and its blood smeared on a specially built altar. Ideally a goat should be sacrificed at [Page 100] one of these and a baby pig at another, but poverty may force the substitution of a fowl. If the sacrifices are all properly performed the woman should be healthy and have no difficulty with giving birth, but otherwise the baby or even the mother may die.' <sup id="cite_ref-1257" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1257">[1,257]</a></sup> 'Predictions of the date of birth are often wide of the mark, but as nearly as possible to the time the parents should brew rice beer, pound rice, and obtain chickens and a pig to be used for the occasion. When a woman notices signs of imminent delivery, such as pain or rupture of the fetal membrane, she returns immediately to her house. If other villagers hear of her labor, they also come back to the village from their fields, and they are expected to be particularly careful to refrain from cutting banana leaves or bamboo leaves from their fields until she has given birth. The woman retires to the back room of the house for the delivery. In most villages a few women are recognized as skillful at midwifery, and one of these generally comes to assist at a birth. A second and unskilled woman, often a sister or some other female relative, assists the midwife. Other relatives gather in the main room of the house, some of the men help with the sacrifice, and the women help with the cooking. If the labor is protracted, chickens, a pig, or sometimes, if the family is wealthy enough, even a cow, may be sacrificed to assure the woman’s health. If labor goes so rapidly that there is no time for a sacrifice, then both the opportunity and the necessity for assuring ease to the mother are past, and the sacrifice can be safely omitted. Rapid delivery is considered to be easier for the mother. It allows her to get back to work promptly. The baby, on the other hand, is less likely to be healthy if the delivery goes quickly. For this purpose the husband, or another man, cuts two bamboo knives from a large rafter of the house. Bamboo knives are not otherwise used today, but Garos feel that iron tools are used in too many other ways to be appropriate for cutting the umbilical cord. New bamboo would be less sharp, and the rafters, which are made from the most suitable type of [Page 101] bamboo, provide an accessible source. One of these knives is used to cut the cord, and the other is later taken to the jungle with the afterbirth and left there for the spirits.' <sup id="cite_ref-1258" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1258">[1,258]</a></sup> Some dances were restricted to men: 'Except on the occasions of Miamua and Rongchugala, dancing was an integral part of Garo village festivals. In general it was the menfolk - especially the young ones - who would dance, with the women and older men sitting around as spectators. But on the occasion of the Wangala festival all the villagers, young and old, men and women, would join in the dance. Sometimes men and women danced together and sometimes separately. Moreover, there were certain dances restricted to members of a particular sex.' <sup id="cite_ref-1259" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1259">[1,259]</a></sup> 'A common dance performed exclusively by men was known as the grikka. This was a war dance. The participants, wearing cloth headdresses decorated with cock feathers, held a sword in their right hand and a shield in their left. Loudly shouting out the names of their respective moieties, the dancers would engage one another in mock combat. Another single-sex dance, this time for women, involved several participants who imitated the plucking of fruit from trees.' <sup id="cite_ref-1260" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1260">[1,260]</a></sup> 'Apart from these special dances with particular themes, all the others were of a generalized character in which much improvisation of hand and body movements was permitted and expected. For most of them, the participants danced in a circle, moving forwards while raising the hands towards their shoulders and then, following the rhythm of the drums, lowering their hands again.' <sup id="cite_ref-1261" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1261">[1,261]</a></sup> The A’chik adhered to a gendered division of labour: 'The division of labor between members of the household is as follows: the males are responsible for clearing jungle and setting fire to the debris for shifting cultivation, while women are responsible for planting, weeding and harvesting. During the peak agricultural operations the men sometimes help the women. Construction and repair of the house are male duties. Men make baskets, while women carry crops from the field and firewood from the jungle. Women look after the kitchen and prepare beer, and men serve the beer to guests. Women rear the children and keep the domestic animals. Both men and women sell firewood and vegetables in the marketplace.' <sup id="cite_ref-1262" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1262">[1,262]</a></sup> Roy provides a general description of the marriage system: 'Descent is matrilineal, residence uxonilocal. The mother's brother's daughter type of cross-cousin marriage is the most widely accepted and prevalent among the people. It is a rigid custom that a man must marry a woman from the opposite CHATCHI (moiety). The rule of chatchi exogamy stipulates that a man's mother's father will be in the opposite chatchi and a man's wife's potential husbands will be in his own chatchi. After marriage a man keeps up his relation with his MACHONG (clan). His relation with reference to wife's machong is designated as QACHI. Marriage establishes a permanent relation between two machong, known as AKIM. After marriage, a male moves to the residence of his wife. In the case of a NOKROM (husband of the heiress of property), marriage does not create a new household, but rather adds a new lease of life to an old household. Even after the death or divorce of a spouse the akim relation continues. It is the responsibility of the deceased's machong to provide a replacement spouse to the surv iving partner.' <sup id="cite_ref-1263" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1263">[1,263]</a></sup> Property was transmitted matrilineally (see also 'property' and 'inheritance'): 'Property among the Garos is inherited in the female line. One of the daughters is selected by the parents to be the heiress. If the couple have no female child, a girl belonging to the machong of the wife (preferably the daughter of her sister, whether real or classificatory) is adopted to be an heiress. She is not considered to be the absolute owner of the property. Decision about the disposal of property is taken by her husband, who is considered to be the household authority (NOKNI SKOTONG). After the death of the father-in-law responsibility transfers to the son-in-law. If a dead man is survived by a widow, she stays in the family of her daughter and is sometimes referred to as an additional wife (JIK) of her daughter's husband.' <sup id="cite_ref-1264" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1264">[1,264]</a></sup> Accordingly, property attached to the household of a married couple was considered to be the property of the wife or the wife's lineage: 'No Garo man may possess property apart from his wife unless he has acquired it by his own exertion before his marriage and it is independent of his connection with his wife. In a dispute, a wife had filed a petition against her husband, alleging that he had deserted her and claimed maintenance. She prayed for return of the property which the husband had taken away from the matrimonial home. The lower court made a maintenance order and ordered the return of property. A Garo husband has no exclusive right over the property jointly earned with his wife, and as such when he leaves the house, he cannot take it with him without wife’s permission. If he does so, it amounts to theft according to the Garo custom (Criminal Revision No. 1 of 1963).' <sup id="cite_ref-1265" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1265">[1,265]</a></sup> However, fathers rather than mothers acted as heads of households: 'Generally, in the matri-lineal family, the mother is the head of the family. But in Garo Society, the father is the head of the family and it is obligatory for him to maintain his wife, minor children, unmarried daughter and his widower Nokkrom and widowed Nokna daughter, till a substitute is provided for by the clan members. After the death of father, mother is responsible for maintenance of the family. In case of her remarriage, step-father should maintain the family. But if the mother remarries outside the clan, she loses the right to her ancestral property and she can not live in the ancestral household. In her place one of her daughters will succeed as an heiress, and then it is her duty to maintain the minor members of the family jointly with her Nokkrom.' <sup id="cite_ref-1266" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1266">[1,266]</a></sup> 'In respect of exercising authority over the household possessions as well as the landed property, the male member’s word is final, although a woman’s approving consent is sought for by the loving husband. She cannot, albeit, wield exclusive right over any material possession. Women have no accession to incorporeal property.' <sup id="cite_ref-1267" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1267">[1,267]</a></sup> Heads of senior households, i.e. the husbands of lineage heiresses, typically acted as village headmen: 'I have referred in a number of places to ‘headmanship,’ and it is at last possible to explain the nature, duties, and privileges of a ‘headman.’ In any village at least one man-and often two, three, or occasionally even more-is referred to by the term nokma, which is generally-though badly-translated as ‘headman.’ These nokmas wear no symbol of their position which would permit a stranger to recognize them, but any villager can name and point out the individuals in his village who rate this title.' <sup id="cite_ref-1268" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1268">[1,268]</a></sup> 'To explain how a man becomes nokma, it is first necessary to refer once more to the lineage structure of the village. It is simplest to consider villages with a single main lineage first. Just as one household of each cooperating group is considered to be senior by virtue of the fact that all the other households have “come out” from it, one household is the most senior of the whole village, since all of the houses ultimately “came out” from it. The process may, of course, have involved many stages, but the senior household is ordinarily considered to be that of the first nokma. Normally the nokma, like any other man, looks for a ‘nephew,’ that is, a younger man from his own lineage, to come and be his son-in-law and heir. In this case, the ‘nephew’ not only becomes the heir to the house and property but also [Page 224] succeeds to the ‘headmanship’ when his father-in-law dies. Inevitably the nokmas of many villages have grown up in a different village, and belong to a different sib and to the opposite moiety from the people of the main village lineage. A nokma should, however, be a member of the same lineage and from the same village as the previous nokma, so generally a succession of ‘headmen’ are members of one village and lineage by descent but hold the status of ‘headman’ in another village by virtue of being married to the women who are successively chosen as heiress in the senior house of the village.' <sup id="cite_ref-1269" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1269">[1,269]</a></sup> Accordingly, women could not act as Nokmas or village headmen: 'Women are quite excluded from village administration. A woman can never be a village headman ( nokma), because a village nokma has certain ceremonial functions, and such ceremonial rites cannot be performed by a woman. The position occupied by women in village affairs is considered to be the lowest and equivalent to that of children. The Garo classify women, as regards their position in village affairs, with children by the use of the phrase mechik bisa-disa (literally, women-children). In areas where there are bachelors’ houses, women, excepting the nokma’s wife, are not allowed to enter the bachelors’ house by the front door. In village feasts and ceremonials, women are not allowed to occupy the positions reserved for persons of honour. They enjoy their meals outside in the open courtyard in front.' <sup id="cite_ref-1270" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1270">[1,270]</a></sup> Women were also excluded from the men's house: 'Indigenous system of education in the broadest sense, was in vogue in the villages of Garo Hills prior to the establishment of schools for formal education. The Nokpante or the bachelors dormitory was the only traditional institution which could be regarded as the centre of learning among the Garos. The word Nokpante literally means “a house of bachelors”. The Nokpantes [Page 188] were constructed at the centre of the village, opposite to the Nokma’s or Chief’s house. In certain big villages, each clan had its own Nokpante for the unmarried young men.' <sup id="cite_ref-1271" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1271">[1,271]</a></sup> 'From the age of seven or eight to the date of marriage, all the males were expected to sleep in the Nokpante. The old and experienced men of the village taught the young boys the knowledge and the skills necessary for their traditional life. Besides the practical training in different arts and culture, the Nokpante boys were also given practical lessons on discipline and on high sense of duty. The younger boys were trained rigorously to obey the orders and carry out the work assigned by their seniors. The Nokpante boys also served as the guards of the village. They had to defend the village from attack and do the social welfare activities for the families there. Besides, Nokpante was used as the court room of the Nokma, the Community Hall and an inn for the male visitors to the village to spend the night. The female visitors to the village had to sleep with other women in the village houses. The women were not allowed to enter the Nokpante. The education of girls was considered as the responsibility of the adult women in the family-mother or aunties or grandmother.' <sup id="cite_ref-1272" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1272">[1,272]</a></sup> Growing up, girls and boys were treated differently: 'Girls are kept more closely under the eyes of the parents than their brothers in the period between puberty and marriage. They work with their mothers and sisters, learning to cook, to pound rice, to make rice beer, and to exercise all the feminine skills of the society, but they do not have the opportunity to spend as great an amount of time with other girls or in the houses of other people. This does not mean that girls are in any way secluded. They dance in the village ceremonies, they go to market, where they can look the boys over and be looked over in turn, and with a fair frequency they get pregnant before they are formally married.' <sup id="cite_ref-1273" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1273">[1,273]</a></sup> Some of the practices mentioned above (men's houses, dancing at festivals) were abandoned in Christianized communities. However, it appears that Christian communities continued to exclude women from headmanship.</dd>

A Garo household comprises parents, unmarried sons and daughters, a married daughter (heiress) with her husband and their children. In principle a married granddaughter and her children should be included, but in reality grandparents hardly exist to see their grandchildren married. Some households may--for short periods only--include distant relatives or non-related persons for various reasons.' <sup id="cite_ref-1274" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1274">[1,274]</a></sup> 'Descent is matrilineal, residence uxonilocal.

The contrast is based upon the desire of all middle-aged Garos to arrange their families so that one young couple will live with them in their old age-a couple who will support them and who will eventually inherit their property and assume much of their social position. To achieve this result each Garo couple chooses just one of their daughters to be their ‘heiress’ ( nokna), and she alone of the children will stay in the parental home with her husband and their children. All boys and all other daughters move away at marriage or shortly thereafter, often to a different village. The family members always have a firm understanding before a marriage as to whether or not the couple will act as heirs to the girl’s parents and whether or not they will support the parents in their old age. Only rarely are such understandings revised after marriage. The implications [Page 77] of the distinction between these two marriage arrangements will pervade the description of Garo social organization. The differences start from the very beginning of negotiations for a marriage.' <sup id="cite_ref-1276" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1276">[1,276]</a></sup> 'The alternatives that face a girl are not unlike those facing a boy, except that personal sentiments are apt to be much more important to her. She will either stay in her home and care for her own parents or move out and set up a new household. Only rarely is there any real problem in persuading a girl to accept either responsibility, but the choice must be made one way or another before she can be married, and it is usually made many years beforehand.' <sup id="cite_ref-1277" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1277">[1,277]</a></sup> Heir-marriages were typically between (classificatory) matrilateral cross-cousins: 'The marriages of heirs are examples of classificatory matrilateral cross-cousin marriage, since a man marries the daughter of his classificatory mother’s brother. Because of the importance of cross-cousin marriage in various current anthropological theories as well as in the society of the Garos themselves, it seems necessary to digress long enough to give a statistical summary based on a sampling of actual Garo marriages. As soon as this is attempted it becomes clear that the situation is far too complex to be indicated by anything like simple percentages of various types of marriages. The only meaningful way to define ‘cross-cousin’ is to accept the Garo definition and regard as ‘cross-cousins’ not only the actual daughters of a mother’s brothers and a father’s sisters, but also various distant classificatory relatives. This means that, for instance, two people may be simultaneously “close matrilateral cross-cousins” and “distant patrilateral cross-cousins.” Clearly, it becomes essential to define various degrees of the cross-cousin relationship.' <sup id="cite_ref-1278" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1278">[1,278]</a></sup> 'The relationship between matrilateral cross-cousins (a man and the daughter of his mother’s ‘brother’) is easily regarded as a function (in the mathematical sense) of the relationship of the boy to the girl’s father. If these two are actual mother’s brother and sister’s son, then the boy and girl are first cross-cousins. If first cross-cousins are considered as type (1), it is possible when considering Garo society to define five other increasingly distant degrees of the classificatory ‘cross-cousin’ relationship; (2) the boy and girl’s father are closely related members of the same [Page 94] minimal lineage (see Chapter VII) though not direct uncle and nephew; (3) the boy and girl’s father come from the same village lineage but are not particularly closely related to each other within it; (4) they come from closely allied lineages of different villages; (5) they are members of the same named sib though they do not belong to closely related lineages within that sib; (6) they belong to entirely different sibs. If moiety exogamy is consistently practiced, the girl’s father and the prospective husband must always belong to the same moiety, and so in the most extended sense the spouses are still ‘cross-cousins.’ That is, the spouses are members of the opposite moiety, and so marriage between them is not forbidden.' <sup id="cite_ref-1279" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1279">[1,279]</a></sup> Burling describes the process of choosing an heiress and arranging her marriage as follows: 'The first step in arranging a marriage of heirs is the choice by the parents of one of their daughters as heiress. Because they need a girl to perform these duties, Garo parents welcome a [Page 78] daughter more than a son, though if they have many children, they say that they like best to have some of each. However, even if a couple should have no daughters, they can adopt a close relative who will come into their home and assume the duties of an actual daughter.' <sup id="cite_ref-1280" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1280">[1,280]</a></sup> 'Most women have at least one daughter of their own so they do not have to adopt another. A single daughter automatically becomes the heiress, but if a woman has more than one, a choice must be made. Garos simply say that they choose whichever girl loves her mother the most, or whichever is the hardest worker; but age also has a bearing upon the decision. The oldest of several girls is rarely chosen since she is likely to be too near the age of her mother, who will have no need of support until she is older. Most people prefer to wait until they draw near the age when they grow feeble before filling the house with a son-in-law and grandchildren. But if the parents so desire, even the oldest daughter may become heiress. Aling had a slightly withered leg, which made it difficult for him to do [Page 80] the heaviest labor. He and his wife, therefore, chose the oldest of their several daughters as heiress so that their household would acquire another adult man as soon as possible. Under more normal circumstances the youngest daughter is a more likely choice than the oldest, but there is no fixed rule either way. Rather, it is a matter for the personal decision of the family members. Since the choice is often made while the girls are still small, they have less to say about it than their parents, though their desires are taken into account if they are old enough. The decision is largely the parents’, and especially the mother’s.' <sup id="cite_ref-1281" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1281">[1,281]</a></sup> 'Once the heiress is chosen, and once she has grown old enough to marry, the family can start to look for a husband. The initiative in obtaining the heiress’s husband rests most directly with the girl’s father. The Garos express the situation by saying that “a man always wants to get his own ‘nephew’ (i.e., gritang ‘classificatory sister’s son’) to come in to be his heir, the husband of his heiress daughter.” A man searches among the younger men of his own lineage and chooses one whom he would like to bring into his home. His search, then, is like that of a woman with no daughters who must find a girl of her own lineage to adopt. He too must look for a person of his own sex a generation younger and in the same matrilineal lineage as himself. However, since most women have daughters of their own, they do not usually have to look so far. This has been particularly true in the last generation or two, during which the population has been rapidly expanding, and families are somewhat larger than would be expected in a static population. Every [Page 81] man, on the other hand, once he reaches the age when he must worry about his future support, must look about among the members of his own lineage for a son-in-law, heir, and replacement. An ideal choice is an actual sister’s son, but many men have no sister, or if they have a sister she may have no sons, and even if there are sons of the right age, the preferences and happiness of the daughter, the nephew, and the nephew’s parents must all be taken into account. No marriage can be arranged simply because the partners are in the correct genealogical relationship to each other. All concerned must be at least reasonably happy with the choice. This makes it necessary to accept a somewhat elastic definition of ‘nephew’ ( gritang) and to look among wider and wider circles of lineage kin until a ‘nephew’ is found whom both father and daughter like, and whose parents can be persuaded to agree to the match. In actual practice almost all men are able to find fairly close relatives, and so long as arrangements are made and worked out satisfactorily, it does not really matter much whether the ‘nephew’ is his own sister’s son, or a somewhat more remote kinsman.' <sup id="cite_ref-1282" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1282">[1,282]</a></sup> 'If a man is acquainted with his own sister’s son and likes him, he and the boy’s parents may be able to settle the matter with little reference to other members of the lineage, but if he has no suitable near ‘nephew’, he will investigate ever more distant collateral lines. For this he may require the cooperation of other men of his lineage.' <sup id="cite_ref-1283" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1283">[1,283]</a></sup> Non-heiresses could not rely on the support of their matrilineage in the selection of a husband: 'Girls other than those destined to become heiresses cannot rely on their fathers to choose a husband for them, but must make their own selection. The initiative should properly come from the girl herself, and her only formal restriction is that she must not ignore moiety exogamy. Unlike her sister who is chosen as heiress, she need not marry into her father’s lineage, though this is not forbidden. It is simply a matter of indifference. As a girl moves about her own village, and makes trips to neighboring villages and to market, she sees and hears about eligible bachelors. She goes to dances, not only in her own village but in neighboring ones as well, and has some chance to [Page 83] meet and flirt with boys. Eventually, she should suggest to her father and ‘brothers’ that she fancies a certain boy, but neither the boy nor the boy’s parents need be consulted.' <sup id="cite_ref-1284" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1284">[1,284]</a></sup> Weddings were formalized through bridegroom capture: 'Once a boy is decided upon, the method of bringing him to the girl, and the marriage ceremony itself, are both the same for ‘heirs’ and ‘non-heirs’, though no one ever forgets which type of marriage is being undertaken.' <sup id="cite_ref-1285" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1285">[1,285]</a></sup> 'I had just witnessed one of the most exciting events in the life of every Garo man, the bridegroom capture, which is [Page 84] considered the only decent way to invite a man to become a husband. The boy should know nothing about it beforehand, though his family must be consulted if he is being asked to marry an heiress.' <sup id="cite_ref-1286" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1286">[1,286]</a></sup> 'To begin a bridegroom capture, the father of the girl tells some of the youths of the village that he wants to get a certain boy as his son-in-law. Boys never seem to tire of chasing through the jungle in pursuit of a bridegroom, and will always cooperate by attempting to capture him for the girl. These boys are sometimes loosely referred to as the ‘brothers’ of the bride, and it is suitable for them to belong to her moiety and thus to the opposite one from that of the bridegroom, though this rule is occasionally broken. Married men occasionally take part, but more often they leave the chase to their unmarried and more adventurous juniors.' <sup id="cite_ref-1287" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1287">[1,287]</a></sup> 'A single foray need not lead to a marriage, however, for nobody can be confident of having acquired a husband just because a boy is captured. In fact, most boys put up an elaborate display of reluctance to have anything to do with the proposed marriage. They may be accosted at almost any place-along the road, in the market, or in their own village-but they generally struggle to get away, and once captured use every stratagem to escape. This can lead to chases through the jungle, and to considerable excitement, which is thoroughly enjoyed by everyone except, perhaps, the bridegroom. A boy must usually be seized two, three, or even more times before he is finally willing to admit capture and to settle down as a husband. As much as several years occasionally pass, during which an heir is periodically brought to the girl only to escape again, though a non-heir seldom takes so long. This gives the boy time to consider his prospects, and nobody can be sure of a permanent marriage until he finally surrenders and stays with the girl. Simply running away is clearly no indication that the boy is really turning the marriage down, and in fact, neither the boy nor the girl is free to contract another marriage until he has [Page 85] stated his disinclination in other ways. If a boy is genuinely opposed to the marriage, he will go along quietly, while earnestly explaining to his captors that he is unwilling to undertake the match. In the case of a prospective heir, particularly, considerable family pressure may be brought to bear to persuade him to accept. His duty to his ‘uncle’ will be pointed out, and the propriety of the match explained. But he, like the girl, does have veto power, and if he insists that he does not want the marriage, the girl’s family must eventually accept his refusal and look for someone else. The Garos are convinced that it is nonsense to force unwilling people into a marriage, as this can only be a prelude to future trouble and family quarrels.' <sup id="cite_ref-1288" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1288">[1,288]</a></sup> 'Boys will do almost anything to appear reluctant to marry an heiress and thus become the son-in-law of their maternal ‘uncle.’ Boys shy away from romantic involvement with a daughter of their ‘uncle’ because of fear of the ‘uncle’s’ authority and of the ridicule which they will receive about this relationship. Those taken as non-heirs are less likely to put on such an extreme show of displeasure. If they wish to be married they run away less often before settling down, and if they are genuinely against the marriage, they can make this clear from the beginning and end the matter promptly. Far too many boys run away and decline a marriage, to allow the conclusion that even non-heir marriages are always or generally preceded by private understandings between the boy and girl. Many men maintain that they had no idea they were about to be captured until their captors actually set upon them, though certainly the news must leak to some men beforehand. In principle neither the parents of a prospective non-heir nor the boy himself need be informed of the coming bridegroom capture, though every boy of the proper age is of course well aware of his eligibility.' <sup id="cite_ref-1289" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1289">[1,289]</a></sup> 'Whenever a boy is successfully captured and brought to the house of a girl, the marriage ceremony is performed, though even this does not ensure a real marriage. A boy may frequently run away, sometimes temporarily, but sometimes permanently, [Page 86] even after the ceremony; in fact, he is likely to be guarded much too closely to escape any earlier. As a result some people go through several ceremonies before they finally marry permanently. Panjak had seven boys captured for her before the eighth one, Tanggeng, agreed to become her husband, and some boys are similarly taken to several girls before settling down. Seven refusals is certainly extreme, but no refusal can be considered a divorce simply because the marriage ceremony has been performed. Only after the boy has expressed his willingness to stay and become a husband can it be considered a breach of marriage to leave, but if the boy runs away and is captured again for the same girl, there is no need to repeat the ceremony.' <sup id="cite_ref-1290" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1290">[1,290]</a></sup> According to Burling, monogamy was the norm, but polygyny was also practiced: 'In Rengsanggri there were 70 married men with 78 wives, eight men having two wives. (This does not include widowed mothers-in-law whom the Garos call ‘wives’ but with whom sexual relations are not maintained.) The marriages of these people included 52 “new marriages.” Most of these “new marriages” were first marriages in which neither spouse had been married previously. However, a divorced man, unlike a divorced woman or at least a woman who has borne a child, can enter into a new marriage without any change in the rules, so the two cases of remarried divorced men are included as “new marriages.” of these 52, 28 of the couples were married as heirs and the other 24 as non-heirs.' <sup id="cite_ref-1291" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1291">[1,291]</a></sup> Widowers were typically provided with a new wife: 'If a woman dies before her husband, the arrangements may be slightly different. Not even the logic of the situation can lead the Garos to suggest that a man should marry his heiress (i.e. his daughter) when his wife dies, in the way that a widow should ‘marry’ her heir. Even rather old men dislike being without a wife, however, and Garos feel that widowers, whatever their age, have a legal right to demand a new wife. It becomes the responsibility of the dead wife’s lineage to supply one. The search for a new or “replacement” wife for a man is much like the search for an adoptive heiress, except that since the person to be replaced (the former wife) is dead, the search must be carried out entirely by other family members. In this case the male members of the woman’s lineage take the responsibility, and they are expected to find among the women of their lineage one who is free to marry the widower and to take the place of his former wife. As in all such cases the closest relatives take the first responsibility, looking among their ‘sisters’ and ‘nieces,’ but if no suitable person can be found near at hand, wider circles of kinsmen are consulted. For elderly men there is one additional possibility. Sometimes young unwed mothers are given to them, thus simultaneously disposing of the difficulty of finding husbands for such girls.' <sup id="cite_ref-1292" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1292">[1,292]</a></sup> The practice of providing 'replacement wives' and husbands to widowed persons is explained by the lasting bond that a marriage established between two lineages: 'Death does not destroy a’kim; thus the family of a dead person has the obligation to provide a replacement, and the widowed person has the obligation to accept. If a widowed person unilaterally marries somebody of his own choice, then the family of the widow or widower will owe the a’kim compensation of 60 rupees to the family of the dead person; but if on the other hand the family of the dead person do not provide a replacement, they must compensate the family of the surviving spouse. Failure to provide a replacement is not common, and I [Page 264] had to search for some time before I discovered anyone who could remember an unambiguous example. Furthermore, it is possible for the families in such a situation to agree to end the a’kim without the payment of a compensation, but as always the agreement must be a formal one accepted by all sides. Such an agreement usually occurs only when the family of the dead person are unable to find a suitable replacement. In such a case they may, as the Garos say, “set the widow (or widower) free.” This means that the surviving spouse is released by agreement from the restriction of a’kim and is then free to marry whomever he wishes, if he can find anybody. Kinship groups dislike setting people free, for it is an admission that the family are unable to fulfill their obligations; and widows and widowers want to be given a new spouse. “Setting free” is really a misnomer, then, since one of the most explicit reasons for maintaining the law of a’kim is to make sure that a person will not be left alone after the death of his spouse but will be taken care of by being given a replacement. Nevertheless, if the lineage of the dead person is genuinely unable to find a suitable person, both sides will usually agree that the a’kim restrictions are to be abrogated and that no compensation need be paid. Such agreements reduce the frequency with which a’kim compensation is paid as a result of failure to provide a replacement, and most often replacements are arranged according to the formal rules.' <sup id="cite_ref-1293" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1293">[1,293]</a></sup> 'In each of these cases-divorce, breaking of engagements, and failure to provide replacements-compensation is paid only upon unilateral action by one of the parties. In each case the relationship can be ended by mutual agreement if all concerned are willing.' <sup id="cite_ref-1294" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1294">[1,294]</a></sup> Alternatively, widows and widowers could be remarried in the following manner: 'There is one other way of providing for widows and widowers. It happens frequently, though not in accordance with any formal requirement, that lineages in the same area are united to each other by several marriages, so that several a’kim bonds join [Page 152] them. It can easily happen that two men of one lineage (it may be a fairly large lineage in which the two men are not closely related) are married to two women of a second lineage (again not necessarily close relatives). If the woman of one marriage and the man of the other should both be widowed, then it can be arranged to have the surviving spouses marry each other. This is a recognized procedure, and the resulting marriage is spoken of as one in which the two former houses have merged to become one. The a’kim relationship is preserved, but after this consists of a single marriage bond where there had formerly been two. The real requirements of the system are met, in that everybody is living in a family which includes both men and women and everybody belongs to a functioning and complete household. The marriage of Kaljing to Jiring was of this sort. Kaljing, who was a member of the Manda sib from Misimagri, had earlier been married to Chimchim, who was a Chambigong of the village of Rengsanggri. When Chimchim died, the Chambigongs had to find a replacement for her to give to Kaljing. It happened that there was a widow, Jiring, of a closely related lineage of the proper sib (Chambigong) living in Misimagri. She had formerly been married to a man of the Manda sib, also of that village and therefore of the same village lineage that Kaljing had come from, but he had died about three years earlier. The family had brought in one young man in the hope that he would marry Jiring if they promised him a younger wife as well, but this young man had declined the match, and so she was still without a husband when Kaljing’s wife died. It therefore became possible to bring Jiring to Rengsanggri; she moved into Kaljing’s house as his wife, and the two houses were thereby merged into one.' <sup id="cite_ref-1295" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1295">[1,295]</a></sup> Polygyny was often the result of younger men being given as new husbands to older widows or divorcees. In this case, the former could expect to be married to his wife's (real or adoptive) daughter as well: 'In order to get a widow remarried, special arrangements must be made. The first move is similar to obtaining a usual heir, except that the man’s surviving male lineage mates must assume the entire responsibility now that the man himself is dead. Just as the relatives of a woman must find a replacement to marry her widower, the relatives of a man must find somebody to marry the surviving widow. The younger brother of the dead man is an appropriate replacement, but the younger brother is only the closest of possible relatives and any younger member of the dead man’s lineage will do. When a likely candidate is found, he is captured and brought in just like any other prospective husband, and with the same uncertainty of outcome. This man is married to the widow and, if he decides to stay, will form a real marriage with her, in which they will maintain sexual relations. Though replacement husbands are frequently a good deal younger than the widows they marry, and though they are admittedly somewhat similar to ‘heirs’ of the first husbands, it is still possible for them to become the real husbands of the widow, since they had not previously established a conflicting type of relationship that is difficult to overcome. The unique feature of this marriage stems from the feeling of Garos that it is unfair to expect a young man to marry a widow unless he is also given a younger wife who has never been married, or at least promised another wife at some time in the future. Every Garo man, that is, deserves one new wife, so a widow alone is not enough. If the widow has a daughter, however young, it is usual for the man to be married to both mother and daughter simultaneously. If the daughter is imnature at the time, he may have to wait many years for her maturation before initiating sexual relations with her, but in the meantime he can maintain them with the older woman. If a widow does not have a daughter, then she, like a woman who passes the child-bearing age without a daughter, must adopt a [Page 149] girl. Like other adopted daughters, these girls sometimes move into the houses of their adoptive mothers when still very young, while others shift residence only when mature. A young wife of this sort, whether the adopted or true daughter, is called jikgite rather than jik, which is the term used for other wives. She is destined to become the wife of her mother’s husband when she matures, though the only evidence villagers can give for the initiation of sexual relations is the girl’s pregnancy. The jikgite should be considerably younger than the older wife. They say the two women are likely to quarrel if they are too close to the same age. If a jikgite must be adopted owing to the first wife’s having no daughters, it is best to make the adoption while the girl is still young. To adopt a mature girl as jikgite is to invite quarreling between her and the older woman. Cases are readily cited where this was attempted, only to be followed by one or the other woman’s having to leave. The best combination is certainly mother and daughter, since they will quarrel least of all. The older wife has a senior position, and villagers say that a man will not have sexual relations with the jikgite until the older wife specifically permits him to do so, but that she knows that she must eventually give permission or lose the support of the jikgite, who cares for the older wife just as an heiress does. However, as the first wife grows older, some men are reported to cease having sexual relations with her, and to shift entirely to the jikgite.' <sup id="cite_ref-1296" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1296">[1,296]</a></sup> 'In Rengsanggri nine men were married to women who had previously had another husband. Three of these women had been divorced rather than widowed, but the same requirements hold for providing a jikgite to a man who marries a divorcee as for one who marries a widow. All but one had been assigned younger wives, though in two cases the girls were still immature. This left six men who had two potential sexual partners.' <sup id="cite_ref-1297" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1297">[1,297]</a></sup> 'In some of these families there was no doubt that men simultaneously maintained sexual relations with both women. Jingnang had children of about the same age by both a mother and [Page 150] her daughter from a previous marriage. In those cases where the younger wife grows up in the household where her future husband is already living, it would appear that there might be a very real difficulty in shifting from a relation that must inevitably be similar to that of father and daughter to that of husband and wife. That the shift in relationship can be made is evident from the case of Singgat. Singgat married Wilwil, who had divorced her previous husband. Both her children had died, so a young girl, Rangsi, the daughter of Wajang, was brought into her house as future jikgite for Singgat, and Wilwil raised her as her own child. Wilwil had no more children, but Rangsi grew up and recently she had a baby of whose paternity there seems to be no doubt. Families such as those of Singgat and Jingnang are pointed out by the villagers with approval, since everybody is carrying out his duty peacefully and without quarreling. Unfortunately people are not always so well-behaved. A case in point is that of Kam, who married Chan’mi after her previous husband had abandoned her. It was agreed that Chan’mi’s daughter Dijak would become the jikgite of Kam when she matured. When I knew them, Dijak was a girl of about eighteen, clearly mature but not yet pregnant, and in the opinion of the people of Rengsanggri, who presumably knew, not yet engaging in sexual relations with her mother’s husband as she should have been by that time. This was a matter of considerable worry to the people, since they felt that unless Kam did his duty by her, she would sooner or later commit adultery and manage to get pregnant by somebody else, or even run off with some other man. Either of these results would cause complications, and if Kam should lose his young wife, it would be his own fault. The blame of this situation was placed by the villagers on Kam, who was not having sexual relations with his first wife’s daughter. Kam had been married to Chan’mi for about ten years and must have regarded his wife’s daughter much as though she were his own. Apparently he found it difficult to transform his relations with her into those of a husband.' <sup id="cite_ref-1298" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1298">[1,298]</a></sup> 'While the logic of the system which requires a man to marry both a mother and daughter does entail certain practical difficulties, it is carried out some of the time, and many men, both those living today and those who show up in genealogical histories, have managed to have children by both women. Families in which a man is married in this way to both mother and daughter at once look superficially like those other households, in which an heir and his wife continue to live with the wife’s mother after the father-in-law dies. The composition of the families is the same: mother and daughter and one man. In both cases the man is called ‘husband’ of both women and the women are the man’s ‘wives.’ This has probably helped to perpetuate the idea both in the minds of Garos and in the writing of earlier observers of their customs that Garos actually “marry” their widowed mothers-in-law. In actual fact, all cases of real marriage to both mother and daughter are those in which a man marries the mother first, after her former husband dies or after she is divorced, and then a second wife is given to the husband in addition. Terminology does distinguish the cases, since when a man marries a girl before her father dies, she is never called jikgite but simply jik, and she is always considered the main wife.' <sup id="cite_ref-1299" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1299">[1,299]</a></sup> Widowed mothers-in-law became classificatory 'wives' to their daughter's husband, although no sexual relations were maintained: 'Besides objects and wealth, social status is also inherited by the heir and heiress. When an older member of a household dies, the Garos view his heir as stepping into the social position of the dead person-a woman into the position of her mother and a man into the position of his ‘uncle’ and father-in-law. The clearest symbolic expression of this is the assumption by the heir of kinship terms formerly appropriate to his father-in-law. After the old man’s death, other sons-in-law call the heir by the term which is more generally used for “father-in-law,” and are in turn called “son-in-law” by the heir. It has been pointed out that Garos also speak as if the son-in-law inherited his mother-in-law when her husband dies, since after this she is regarded as a ‘wife’ of the younger man. Moreover, the wife’s siblings call him by a term that otherwise means father’s younger brother. This terminology is analyzed more fully in Appendix C. Beyond this somewhat superficial terminological matter, the occupants of the family house are considered to be the living incumbents in the role of man and woman of that particular house. Households continue, though their members come and go. The most striking example of this is the title of nokma or ‘headman’ which, as will be explained in Chapter IX, adheres to the senior household of the village. The man who happens to be married to the heiress of that household is considered to be the ‘headman’ of the village.' <sup id="cite_ref-1300" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1300">[1,300]</a></sup> 'Garos sometimes say that this shyness comes from fear of the father-in-law’s jealousy, but that one must also avoid anything that might make the jokes of which he will be the object have any basis of truth. Everyone gets teased about his mother-in-law. So long as one knows that he has been perfectly wellbehaved it is possible to laugh these things off, but one always tries to avoid giving grounds for teasing. The Garo theory that the heir becomes the ‘husband’ of his mother-in-law when his father-in-law dies-even though this relationship includes only the economic aspects of the husband-and-wife relationship and not the sexual-is never far from the consciousness of the parties involved. It makes the son-in-law particularly anxious to demonstrate that even if he may in the future be considered the old lady’s husband, at least that time has not yet come.' <sup id="cite_ref-1301" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1301">[1,301]</a></sup> Husbands willing to add secondary wives to an existing marriage needed their first wife's consent and were usually required to choose a woman from the wife's lineage: 'On considering the vital institution of marriage in the Garo society we find that every Garo is entitled to marry since marriage is recognised as one of the important social institutions in Garo society. Their society is devoid of widow and widower since the Garo customary practices make provision for on’songa i.e., remarriage of the widow and widower. However, sororate form of marriage is not customary. Instead on the death of the wife it is the duty of the wife’s mahari to provide an alternative wife to the widower; if the alternative wife happens to be his wife’s sister it would amount to sororate marriage. In addition a man cannot marry again or acquire a wife, without the express consent of a living wife and her chras since the first wife’s mahari would never tolerate the loss of their right over the property ownership to heiress of another mahari. Eventually if the man desires to marry a second time, with a woman belonging to another mahari, he is expected to seek separation from his heiress wife; thus renouncing the right of retaining the managerial authority over his principal wife’s properties. [Page 156] Thus a man can obtain his subsidiary wives only from the wife’s lineage with due consent from the first wife and the chras. In case the principal wife and chras do not agree to provide him another wife and if he is adamant to marry again, a divorce becomes inevitable. In such a case where there are more than one wife living under the same roof, the principal wife ( jik ma’mong or jik mongma) occupies a superior position and her advice in all family matters is binding. When a man marries his widowed mother-in-law or his deceased uncle’s widow she is always treated as jik ma’mong as long as she survives although her marriage is subsequent to the man’s first marriage. The underlying ’akim’ principle of such marriages is that no one should remain without a mate for a long time, since such bonds also unite two ma’chong or mahari through a unit of family i.e., nok. Once a family comes into existence after the marriage of a man and woman of appropriate lineages and in conformity with the existing rules of exogamy, the nok must continue till the contracting ma’chong or mahari decides to sever their ’akim’ bonds which are considered to be sacred according to the Garo traditions. It is important to note here that the married couple shares the responsibility of aged and incapacitated parents in old age. Here it should be added that while the heir designate must marry someone from her father’s lineage and preferably her father’s sisters’ son, the other girls or a’gate are not morally bound to marry a kin of their father. They can exercise their choice.' <sup id="cite_ref-1302" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1302">[1,302]</a></sup> Burling also describes extramarital affairs: 'Boys, and men too, frequently make some gift, often a few rupees in cash, to their lovers. They hardly think of this as a real payment, but rather as a gift showing gratitude for her favors. If the affair lasts over a long period the number and value of such gifts should be correspondingly increased. Girls, and [Page 74] even married women, have enough control over money to make such gifts worth their while. A married woman can manage to buy things, perhaps saying that she earned the money by selling something-rice beer, for instance-or else juggling the prices of things she buys, saying that they cost less than they really did, if the question of money should ever come up.' <sup id="cite_ref-1303" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1303">[1,303]</a></sup> Adulterers and others accused of sexual offences were liable to punishment: 'Garos do not make a terminological distinction between adultery and other varieties of extra-marital intercourse, all of which are called teleka and all of which are considered improper. They do not react to premarital intercourse as consistently as to adultery; but even improper advance on the part of a boy to a girl is considered a punishable offense, and in theory a girl can claim a small monetary compensation from a boy who suggests sexual relations, though this compensation is rarely demanded. Even sexual relations between unmarried people rarely lead to litigation unless pregnancy results, although Garos readily cite formal rules which state that fines should be paid by the boy’s family to the girl’s family even if there is no pregnancy. Of course, if it is conducted with discretion, no one else need learn of an extramarital affair, though Garos are not given to consistent secrecy in these matters. If an affair lasts for any length of time a pregnancy is likely to result, but even this leads more often to a marriage than to trial and compensation. Only if the boy and girl are members of the same moiety and are therefore not appropriate marriage partners does a pregnancy have some likelihood of precipitating negotiations for the payment of compensation. Sexual relations between members of the same moiety or even sib are less strongly disapproved than is marriage, and unless the two people are closely related cousins, they cause hardly more alarm than such relations [Page 267] between any two unmarried people. However, they raise one extremely unpleasant problem, since if the girl becomes pregnant the couple will be unable to marry. Sa’jak, the daughter of Kaljing, had an illegitimate baby whose father was Tamring, the son of Aduma of Singgat’s house. Both Sa’jak and Tamring were members of the Chambigong sib of Rengsanggri and could not marry, or at least they were unwilling to face down their relatives and live together. A trial was held, and both of them were scolded and beaten and told to be good. They promised henceforth to keep away from each other; and Tamring and his relatives had to pay a compensation of 60 rupees to Sa’jak.' <sup id="cite_ref-1304" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1304">[1,304]</a></sup> The A’chik definition of adultery included all extramarital sexual relations that breached existing agreements between kin groups: 'The penalties for adultery apply not only to married people but to the other classes of people who are also bound by a’kim, those who are engaged and those who are widowed but who remain obligated to the kinship group of the deceased spouse. Tijak was considered to have infringed upon Menjak’s rights by committing adultery with Menjak’s prospective husband, although Menjak was not yet fully married to him. [Page 266] although Menjak was not yet fully married to him. In a parallel way, if a widow or widower commits adultery, then the partner is considered to have infringed upon the rights of the deceased spouse’s family just as he would have if the spouse were still living. Such cases are somewhat unusual. Widows, and especially widowers, often marry too promptly for much danger of such adultery, and if the kinship groups cannot find a replacement spouse, then the widow or widower is usually released from his or her obligation under a’kim. The rule, however, is clear, namely that compensation for adultery is owed by all people bound by a’kim, and not only married people.' <sup id="cite_ref-1305" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1305">[1,305]</a></sup> Accordingly, while polygyny was practiced, monogramy appears to have been more common and adultery was punished. Converts to Christianity were subject to Christian regulations, but 'traditional' attitudes persisted: 'Christian divorce is encumbered with more serious problems than the relatively simple divorce of non-Christians. Christian marriages are governed by the Indian Christian Marriage Act, under which obtaining a divorce requires court proceedings beyond the competence of any court within the district. In effect, this makes legal divorce impossible for any but the most wealthy Garos, however legitimate the grievance may be. The old Garo attitude that it is better for a man and woman to separate than to continue living unhappily together hardly disappears with Christianity, and the result is that separation, if not legal divorce, is not uncommon among Christians, and is not looked upon with great disapproval. Serious difficulties arise only when one of the separated individuals starts living with someone else, a procedure that is by no means unknown. In the eyes of the law this is, of course, adultery, and it may lead to expulsion from the church. To many Garos, however, it is somewhat less sinful than is implied by the rules of the church or the laws of the country. Garos speak of these people as husband and wife, and generally accept them as such. There is some sentiment among Christian Garos for the easing of the divorce laws, so that divorces could be handled within the district, and the impossible position of separated spouses be mitigated.' <sup id="cite_ref-1306" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1306">[1,306]</a></sup> More material on Christian marriage practices may be needed.

Prior to colonization, support within the extended family and the village was the norm: 'The household is the primary production and consumption unit. A Garo household comprises parents, unmarried sons and daughters, a married daughter (heiress) with her husband and their children. In principle a married granddaughter and her children should be included, but in reality grandparents hardly exist to see their grandchildren married. Some households may--for short periods only--include distant relatives or non-related persons for various reasons.' <sup id="cite_ref-1307" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1307">[1,307]</a></sup> Matrilineages owned and distributed resources: 'The Garos reckon their kinship through the mother. Individuals measure the degree of their relationship to one another by the distance of their matrilineages. For men, children of their sister or sister's daughters are very important kin. For women, children of their sister's daughters are equivalent to the children of their own daughters.' <sup id="cite_ref-1308" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1308">[1,308]</a></sup> 'In Garo society the most important social group is the clan known as MACHONG. A machong is an exogamous matrilineal descent group wherein a Garo is automatically assigned by birth to the unilineal group of his mother. A CHATCHI (moiety) is divided into many machong. Each married couple chooses one daughter--or, if they have none, they adopt a close relative of the mother--to be heiress (NAKNA DONQIPIKA MECHIK) of the family. Her husband traditionally is selected from the lineage group of the father and is accepted as the NOKROM of the house. He resides with his wife in her parents' house. He has to take on the responsibility of looking after his parents-in-law during their old age, and his wife inherits the property.' <sup id="cite_ref-1309" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1309">[1,309]</a></sup> 'Property among the Garos is inherited in the female line. One of the daughters is selected by the parents to be the heiress. If the couple have no female child, a girl belonging to the machong of the wife (preferably the daughter of her sister, whether real or classificatory) is adopted to be an heiress. She is not considered to be the absolute owner of the property. Decision about the disposal of property is taken by her husband, who is considered to be the household authority (NOKNI SKOTONG). After the death of the father-in-law responsibility transfers to the son-in-law. If a dead man is survived by a widow, she stays in the family of her daughter and is sometimes referred to as an additional wife (JIK) of her daughter's husband.' <sup id="cite_ref-1310" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1310">[1,310]</a></sup> Accordingly, individuals could expect support from their maternal relatives: 'Unlike the males, the role of a female centres round her own ‘mahari’ only. Her position in the ‘mahari’ is indicated by the term ‘ma-no’, which signifies that she is either a ‘ma’ (mother) or a ‘no’ (sister) to her ‘mahari’ people. In Garo language there is a proverb: “mana nona ok, jikna dena kok,” which signifies that when a man goes to his mother’s or sister’s house, he takes with him his empty stomach to be filled in, and when he goes to his wife and children he takes a basket full of provisions to feed them. This proverb aptly describes the position of the female as ‘ma-no’. Whenever a Garo male visits the house of his female ‘mahari’ (this is not very frequent due to the fact that the Garo follow the rule of matrilocal residence very strictly), he exercises considerable freedom in demanding hospitality; this is known to the Garo as ‘manok chaa’ (enjoying the hospitality of the mother’s house). Moreover, a male always expects help from his mother’s or sister’s household in times of need. When a man is divorced he is to come out of his wife’s house, and in such a case he comes back to his mother’s house, or finds out a sister who would shelter him.' <sup id="cite_ref-1311" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1311">[1,311]</a></sup> Reciprocal obligations were important: 'The principle of reciprocity gets a very high place in the Garo social structure of values. To them all action, whether good or bad, must be reciprocated by similar action. A person receiving a gift must reciprocate with a similar gift as soon as possible. If somebody visits a household and is offered a hearty meal and drinks, he is expected to reciprocate in a similar way. This is why a man who has been given a warm hospitality in a household expresses thus ‘ Gro dalgipa ongjok’, ‘I have incurred a great debt’.' <sup id="cite_ref-1312" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1312">[1,312]</a></sup> According to Burling, surplus food was indirectly redistributed to poor households on the occasion of village feasts: 'One of these feasts may serve simultaneously to validate the right of a household to use its own gongs for beating at village festivals. A house must have about fifteen gongs before it is considered decent to use them, and houses which do not own enough must borrow them from a richer neighbor when they are needed. But just to accumulate and own enough gongs is not sufficient; the household must kill a cow for some occasion, such [Page 205] as to honor a parent, before the gongs can be used. After this the household will be expected to entertain regularly and on a larger than average scale, and so to maintain its prestigeful position. In Rengsanggri eight households owned enough gongs to be used in festivals: those of Gajang, Jengnon, Nanggan, Anat, Kakan, Chondu, Rongsin, and Gurang. Many other households had a few gongs but used those from one of these eight households and carried them to their houses when it was their turn to entertain during village festivals. Feasts are frequent enough for poor people to eat significantly better than they would if they relied entirely on their own gardens. Wealth differences lead to greater differences in prestige than in standards of consumption. Prestige and social standing go to the industrious and skillful.' <sup id="cite_ref-1313" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1313">[1,313]</a></sup> Overall, we have found very little information on philanthropic foundations or sodalities. Shira mentions women's organizations: 'The Mothers’ Union, one of the most powerful women organisations in the north-east, was formed based on moral principles mentioned in the poem Rongtala Cholon Mingnama Bimung. This Union has been instrumental in bringing about a great change in the social life of the Garos. Today, it has expanded its horizon of activities, with Literature Wing, Education Wing, Agriculture Wing and Weaving Wing added to its fold. Currently, this Union actively involves itself in the civic sense awareness campaign within the town of Tura.' <sup id="cite_ref-1314" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1314">[1,314]</a></sup> More material is needed, especially on organizations founded by missionaries.</dd>

<dd><b>♠ communal dining ♣ present ♥</b> Festivals were accompanied by communal feasting: 'All traditional annual festivals were connected with the different stages of shifting cultivation: AGALMAKA, MAIMUQ, RENACHUGALA, AHAIA, WANGALA, etc. Wangala is considered to be the national festival among the Garos, taking place during October-December. When a member of a family becomes Christian, he refuses to participate in Songsarek festivals.' <sup id="cite_ref-1315" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1315">[1,315]</a></sup> 'The first of the annual cycle of village festivals was called Denbilsia and was observed after the completion of the clearing of the new swiddens, generally in January to February. Denbilsia was a one-day festival and was held at the nokma’s house. During the morning of the festival day, all the people gathered in front of the nokma’s house, where a bamboo altar was set up. Around noon, the nokma sacrificed a pig or a goat at this altar. After the sacrifice, the animal’s flesh was cut up and cooked, along with other foodstuffs, such as rice, fish, and other kinds of meat, and these were offered to all the villagers at a feast sponsored by the nokma. The nokma would also provide liberal amounts of rice-beer which the villagers drank all day long. After the feast, in the afternoon, the people would dance, sing and make music, activities which were continued until about midnight, when the villagers would return home to sleep.' <sup id="cite_ref-1316" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1316">[1,316]</a></sup> 'The second festival, Agalmaka, was observed after the swiddens had been fired. The festival began with the nokma sacrificing a cock in his own swidden, after which the head of every household in the village would offer an egg, each in his own field. Although the sacrifice and offerings were accomplished in a single morning, the festival itself lasted for several days. On the first day the nokma sponsored a feast for his villagers. After eating and drinking, the [Page 142] people would make music, dance and sing at the nokma’s house. On the following days people would visit each other’s houses, the arrangements for food, drink, dancing and singing being the responsibility of each individual household.' <sup id="cite_ref-1317" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1317">[1,317]</a></sup> 'Before seeds were sown in the swiddens, the Garo would observe the festival called Asiroka. On this occasion the nokma sacrificed a cock at a bamboo altar erected somewhere within the village itself. Following this sacrifice, the villagers would slaughter a cow, which they had purchased beforehand. This cow was not sacrificed to propitiate any mite, but simply killed for its flesh, which was distributed among the villagers according to the amount of money they had contributed for its purchase in the first place. After this distribution of meat, the villagers returned home to rest for the remainder of the day. The next day, each household head would sacrifice an animal (ox, pig, goat, or at least a cock, the kind of animal depending upon the household’s economic condition) in his own swidden. After the sacrifice the villagers would feast, dance and sing. But the following day was again set aside as a day of rest. After this the villagers began their planting operations.' <sup id="cite_ref-1318" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1318">[1,318]</a></sup> 'Around June to July, when the padi was growing in the swiddens, the Garo would observe a festival called Miamua. This festival lasted only a single day and, during it, the nokma would sacrifice a pig in his own swidden and sponsor a feast for all the villagers. After the feast, which took place around noon, the people used to sing and play music. But they were forbidden on this occasion to beat drums. It was said that the beating of drums at this particular time could attract the attention of some malevolent mite, like Bang, Rakashi or Chual, who might then decide to come to the village to enjoy the sound of the drums and subsequently cause damage to the growing padi plants. And, because there were no drums to accompany them, the villagers would not dance on the occasion of Miamua either.' <sup id="cite_ref-1319" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1319">[1,319]</a></sup> 'Before they harvested their swidden crops, the villagers would observe the festival called Rongchugala. This usually fell in August. On this occasion the nokma would offer the mite a special dish called rongchu, which is rice which has been cooked until dry and crisp. The rongchu was spread out on a banana leaf and kept in the nokma’s house. After the nokma had made this traditional offering, there would be feasting, drinking and music-making. But, for the very same reason as at the Miamua festival, there would be no drumming or dancing on this occasion.' <sup id="cite_ref-1320" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1320">[1,320]</a></sup> 'After the harvest, in September, the Garo villagers observed the festival called Ahaia. On this occasion each household head would prepare a fish for the mite, the offering being made in the farmer’s own swidden. Then, for several days, there would be much feasting, drinking, dancing and music-making. All the households would exchange visits during the course of the Ahaia festival.' <sup id="cite_ref-1321" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1321">[1,321]</a></sup> 'The last festival of the annual cycle was Wangala and this was the greatest celebration of them all. It would be observed about a month after Ahaia, at a time when the Garo villagers were completely free from farm work, having brought in their harvest even before Ahaia. The Wangala festival would last for several days. The first day would find the villagers busy slaughtering cows, which they had purchased earlier for this purpose. These animals were killed [Page 143] solely for their meat, not as a sacrifice to the mite. Several households joined together to purchase an animal and would share the meat among themselves according to the amount of money they had contributed to the purchase price. It was essential for every household to have meat to offer their guests on this great festive occasion. On the second day of Wangala, the nokma made offerings to the mite inside his house. Known as churugala, this ceremony involved the pouring of some chu, or rice-beer, and the placing of other offerings (cooked rice, an onion, a root of ginger, and a squash), all set out on a banana leaf, at an especially sacred place known as the dinsam. This place could be located at any corner of the nokma’s main sleeping room ( din) and it was here that he kept the sacred drums, other musical instruments, his sword, shield, etc. After these offerings had been made, the villagers decorated the posts and beams of the nokma’s house by making handprints on them with a paste of flour and water. Having thus decorated their leader’s house, the villagers helped each other decorate their own buildings in exactly the same fashion. Feasting, drinking, music-making and dancing lasted for several days. First, each household would visit the nokma’s house, after which it would visit every other house in the village. At each establishment, the guests would be honoured with food and drink, music and dance.' <sup id="cite_ref-1322" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1322">[1,322]</a></sup> Hospitality was important: 'The division of labor between members of the household is as follows: the males are responsible for clearing jungle and setting fire to the debris for shifting cultivation, while women are responsible for planting, weeding and harvesting. During the peak agricultural operations the men sometimes help the women. Construction and repair of the house are male duties. Men make baskets, while women carry crops from the field and firewood from the jungle. Women look after the kitchen and prepare beer, and men serve the beer to guests. Women rear the children and keep the domestic animals. Both men and women sell firewood and vegetables in the marketplace.' <sup id="cite_ref-1323" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1323">[1,323]</a></sup> Mutual visitng was common: 'The arrangement of the house emphasizes both the unique organization of the family, and its relationship to the rest of the village. On the one hand, the very form of the house sets off the family from everyone else. A house has no windows and its doors are closed at night; and no one, day or night, enters another’s house without first calling out to announce his presence. On the other hand, houses are built partly in order to entertain, and it is for this reason as much as any other that rich men must have big houses. The central room is designed to accommodate visitors, and the verandas, though used for many other purposes, are most often built with special thought for guests. Garos visit each other’s houses constantly, not only during large festivals, but also on petty errands or simply for casual gossip; but the social boundary between one household and another is never ambiguous, but is as distinct as the physical boundary of the house itself.' <sup id="cite_ref-1324" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1324">[1,324]</a></sup> Hospitality was governed by reciprocal obligations: 'The principle of reciprocity gets a very high place in the Garo social structure of values. To them all action, whether good or bad, must be reciprocated by similar action. A person receiving a gift must reciprocate with a similar gift as soon as possible. If somebody visits a household and is offered a hearty meal and drinks, he is expected to reciprocate in a similar way. This is why a man who has been given a warm hospitality in a household expresses thus ‘ Gro dalgipa ongjok’, ‘I have incurred a great debt’.' <sup id="cite_ref-1325" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1325">[1,325]</a></sup> Men could expect hospitality from their matrilineage: 'Unlike the males, the role of a female centres round her own ‘mahari’ only. Her position in the ‘mahari’ is indicated by the term ‘ma-no’, which signifies that she is either a ‘ma’ (mother) or a ‘no’ (sister) to her ‘mahari’ people. In Garo language there is a proverb: “mana nona ok, jikna dena kok,” which signifies that when a man goes to his mother’s or sister’s house, he takes with him his empty stomach to be filled in, and when he goes to his wife and children he takes a basket full of provisions to feed them. This proverb aptly describes the position of the female as ‘ma-no’. Whenever a Garo male visits the house of his female ‘mahari’ (this is not very frequent due to the fact that the Garo follow the rule of matrilocal residence very strictly), he exercises considerable freedom in demanding hospitality; this is known to the Garo as ‘manok chaa’ (enjoying the hospitality of the mother’s house). Moreover, a male always expects help from his mother’s or sister’s household in times of need. When a man is divorced he is to come out of his wife’s house, and in such a case he comes back to his mother’s house, or finds out a sister who would shelter him.' <sup id="cite_ref-1326" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1326">[1,326]</a></sup> Prestige could be attained through hospitality: 'Entertainment as a Means to Prestige. A’jak and dena seem to be weighted in a lop-sided manner to the advantage of the rich members of the community, but the wealth they bring has only limited uses. Wealthy people can buy a few better clothes, eat a little more meat, command larger work parties, and therefore build bigger houses; but all this does not set them off in any sharp way from the poorer people. Rich people spend most of their time working in the fields like everyone else. The main use of wealth is to entertain on a comparatively lavish scale. This converts wealth into prestige and power, while materially the wealth is again distributed throughout the community, since everyone shares in the consumption of the goods that rich men accumulate. Feasts are not given in the Rengsanggri area on occasions designed specifically to validate or establish prestige, though such feasts do occur in some parts of the hills. The Rengsanggri custom is for ambitious men to seize as times for particularly lavish entertainment those numerous occasions when hospitality is appropriate. During the ceremonies, when the villagers are entertained in every house in turn, the richer houses entertain abundantly. The poorest houses seldom fail to offer something; but fewer people visit them, partly to avoid embarassing the householders and partly because there is less expectation of a bountiful spread. It is hardly reasonable for any single person to visit every one of the sixty households in the village, but most do assemble at the richer houses, where they can confidently expect to be greeted with copious amounts of rice beer and liberal quantities of rice and curry.' <sup id="cite_ref-1327" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1327">[1,327]</a></sup> 'Entertaining is appropriate on many other occasions. When a death occurs in the community, the wealthy villagers invite others in for a consolation drink. A few relatives may kill a cow, which they say they do to honor the dead person, but which actually brings as much honor to the man who offers the cow. At the post-funeral ceremony the dead man’s household has the opportunity to kill a cow and entertain. Beer and sometimes food are distributed by participants in legal disputes. Lunch may be served to house-builders, while thatchers in particular are supposed to be rewarded with food and beer. A few households offer feasts to others out in the fields at the Asiroka ceremony, before rice planting. Even the sacrifices to banish disease may be more liberal if the family is wealthy, and thus may provide a larger feast for the helpers. A son or a daughter who has moved away from his or her parents to marry, and who is wealthy enough, may slaughter a cow, ostensibly to honor the parents. Usually the time of one of the major village festivals is chosen for this, and most of the animal is sent to the parents’ home. One leg is retained by the son’s or daughter’s family, however, and there is meat enough for two feasts, one at each house. The feast is described as one of giving thanks to the parents for their help to the child, but honor comes not only to the parents but to the child as well. The greatest hospitality and greatest prestige derive from killing a cow, and a record of the number killed is made public by decorating the front of the killer’s house with the horns and frontal bones of the animals. Wealthy houses may be hung with two or three dozen sets.' <sup id="cite_ref-1328" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1328">[1,328]</a></sup> Converts to Christianity celebrated Christian holidays and rest days while still participating in hospitality: 'The cultural changes that come with a switch to Christianity do not all seem to be very intimately associated with the new religion, but any aspects of the culture that either the early missionaries or the Garos themselves considered to be somehow connected with the traditional religion have been replaced. These include almost all of the traditional arts of the Garos-their music, their dancing, and their wood-carving where that was important. Christians do not build bachelors’ houses and they are not supposed to drink rice beer. The traditional village festivals always have a ceremonial aspect. The climax is usually a sacrifice, and a supplication of the spirits or gods. Christianity can hardly coexist with sacrifices to the spirits, and as a result the whole festival-music, dancing, feasting, and merrymaking-is abandoned. Of course, Christians substitute new activities for those that are lost. They have church services on Sundays, and sometimes prayer meetings on other days. They observe [Page 314] Sunday as a day of rest, just as non-Christians sometimes take days of rest in connection with their village festivals. Christians have their own feast days, and on Christmas especially all Christians of a village usually participate in a communal feast to which they all contribute. The delight taken in such feasts is no different from that of Songsarek festivals, except that no rice beer stimulates the Christian’s gaiety. The variety of Protestantism which has influenced the Garos has been rigid in its disapproval of alcohol, and perhaps the Garos have exaggerated the ideas of their teachers more dogmatically than was intended. Today, Christians and Songsareks alike often cite the shunning of rice beer as the primary sign of Christianity, and in answer to the question “Is he a Christian?” the answer is often “No, he is a rice-beer drinker.” If a Christian drinks today, and some of them do, he does it surreptitiously. Christians substitute tea, very milky and sugary, for rice beer, and the two drinks are clearly equivalent. Tea has become a hospitality symbol among the Christians. If one visits six Christian houses in the course of an afternoon, he will almost surely drink six cups of tea; and in some areas at least, tea is served to large parties of visitors at the Christian holidays, just as visitors during Songsarek festivals are served rice beer.' <sup id="cite_ref-1329" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1329">[1,329]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b>♠ Ideology forbids slavery universally ♣ ♥</b> It appears that the A’chik traditionally took slaves during head-hunting raids, at least occasionally: ‘They visited markets at bordering plains with their produce from the hills like raw cotton, chillies, ginger, wax, rubber, lac and other things to barter for essential items such as salt, dried fish and jewellery of all kinds and most important metal implements and weapons which they needed so desperately. In other words, to generate surplus they needed slaves. To get slaves they had to attack the plains or neighbouring villages. To win and capture slaves they needed to be strong and alert. Obviously in a situation like this economic strength promoted the physical strength.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1330" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1330">[1,330]</a></sup> ‘Hunting, raiding, beheading and attacking were the way of life for the Garo. In those days, people collected human skulls and decorated the roof of their houses with them. Head hunting was considered an act of chivalry, a symbol of higher status and social distinction. We may speculate that this practice might have originated owing to mutual suspicions, which led to attack and counter-attack. But it is clear that this was not a senseless activity because the institution of slavery was closely associated with it. During the raids the people who were caught were kept as  ‘nokkol’ (slaves). These slaves were expected to work in the fields and households of their masters. Keeping slaves was not merely a status symbol but enhanced the economy and position of their masters. Some of the prosperous families had as many as sixty slaves. More slaves meant more prosperity of their owners. As their economic status went up they engaged themselves in trade. They could not tolerate the sight of an outsider anywhere as a result of which a lot of mutual suspicion was generated. They often raided the villages in the neighbourhood, as well as in the plains (Pianazzi Fr. 1934, p. 3).’ <sup id="cite_ref-1331" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1331">[1,331]</a></sup> Playfair claims that slaves played a special role in funerary rites: ‘I have referred to the human sacrifice which was customary in olden times. Another and more merciful form of celebrating  this part of the funeral rites was to keep a living slave tied to the leg of the corpse from the day of the decease to the hour of cremation. He or she was then released from further servitude. When a human sacrifice was considered necessary, but a victim could not be found, the bamboo tray with which the flames were fanned was suspended from a long pole close to the place of cremation. This remained hanging until that part of the funeral rites had been performed.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1332" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1332">[1,332]</a></sup> The practice must have ended in the early colonial period. Christianized A’chik s probably rejected slavery universally. However, the process of Christianization was patchy and uneven. Accordingly, identifying a reliable date of transition (as above) may not be feasible in this case.</dd></dl>

In the former case it was customary to lay the body on a  ganchi or funeral pyre, round which the people danced. The body was then decapitated, and the hands and feet were cut off. The latter were then taken to the outskirts of the village, and placed in holes in the ground in which  mandal trees ( Erithrina suberosa) were afterwards planted. In some cases, instead of burying the hands, they were fastened to bamboos with the fingers outspread. These bamboos were then stuck into the ground by the side of the path leading to the next village, as if to warn strangers not to approach.

The more the number of skulls the higher was their  position and respectibility. Time has changed. It is not possible now to kill men and go unpunished. So they have given up that practice.

This brings them fame in society and is a subject much spoken of.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1335" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1335">[1,335]</a></sup> Sinha claims that the killing of captured individuals could have a sacrificial character: ‘Ultimately, they were brought under control, and then the government established an administrative headquarters at Tura and appointed a Deputy Commissioner to carry on the administration of the district. Till that time, the Garos were a head hunting tribe. In the records of the district, it is mentioned that from one village alone more than two hundred human skulls were recovered. It was the custom amongst the Garos to preserve the head of the man killed by them as a trophy. More the number of skulls gathered by an individual more honoured was his place in the society. It was considered as an act of valour and won respect and prestige from the members of the society. They not only carried on organised raids on the villages in the neighbouring districts, i.e., the villages in the districts of Mymensingh, now in East Pakistan, and Goalpara in Assam to collect the human heads but also carried on such raids on enemy villages within the districts of Garo Hills. I have mentioned in connection with the death ceremony that they used to consider it necessary to kill a human being on the occasion of the cremation of the dead body. For this purpose, they used to organise raids on the villages in the plains or on an enemy village in the hills to catch hold of a man who may be brought for the purpose of sacrifice, to be performed, near the funeral pyre. The Mimang (spirit of the dead) of this sacrificed man becomes a  nokol, i.e., a servant of the Mimang of the dead person and accompanies the latter to the Mimang land at Balpakram. If a Mimang goes there without a nokol or a cow or some good presents, he is to live there as a nokol of the Mimangs who are well off there.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1336" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1336">[1,336]</a></sup> Head-hunting persisted until the late 19th century: ‘It was not until 1876 that the last trace of the head-hunting proclivities of the Garos disappeared. In the resolution on the annual report for that year I find it stated that the Deputy Commissioner was able while in camp at Rongrengiri, to settle a number of blood-feuds, and no less than 200 skulls, the remains of victims killed in former raids, or murdered in various ways, were surrendered and publicly burnt.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1337" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1337">[1,337]</a></sup> Accordingly, we have adopted 1876 as an official date of transition.

<p><b>Supernatural beings (e.g., gods, spirits, ancestors)</b>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Number of officially sanctioned supernatural beings ♣ polytheistic ♥</b> Native religion contained a number of shapeless spirit beings, some deities, some lesser spirits. These beings could hear and see humans, but not vice versa. ‘They are SALJONG, the spirit of sun and fertility; GAERA, the spirit of strength and the thunderbolt; SUSIME, the spirit of wealth.'<sup id="cite_ref-1377" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1377">[1,377]</a></sup> Malevolent biting spirits were also present. 'These mite live in many places. Some dwell in the village, others in the jungle, near a tree, or by a stream or waterfall. A fork in a road is a favorite place, and powerful mite are said to live on mountain tops.’<sup id="cite_ref-1378" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1378">[1,378]</a></sup> 'Not all supernatural beings are so uniformly malign as the biting mite. Most of the others, the “creating” mite as they are occasionally called, are more or less neutral if not positively friendly. They are a bit more remote from daily life, but harmony between men and these gods, as they can be appropriately called, must be maintained by several annual sacrifices. There is confusion among the Garos as to how many of these gods exist and how many names each one has, and it is quite impossible to decide whether two names stand for two different gods or for two aspects of the same god, since Garos describe them now in one way and now in the other. Rabuga, Ranaga, Tatara or Dakgipa, are used as names for a god who is believed to have made the world and man. Dakgipa, in fact, means quite literally “the one who makes.” These names are called out in the course of sacrifices to ward off disease, but the sacrifices are directed primarily toward the lesser biting spirits, and not toward Rabuga. Saljong is a name referring to a god who presides over crops. Some identify Saljong with Rabuga, but others are inclined to regard him as distinct. At any rate, it is specifically to Saljong that most of the annual sacrifices are dedicated, particularly those that are held in the fields. Saljong controls the water and the rain, and the growing of all things. When the dried fields are burned at the beginning of planting, Saljong sees the smoke of the fire and comes to join the people as they worship him in their fields. He supervises them as they fix the boundaries, and he blinds the people if they later move the markers-the only example of supernatural punishent for immoral behavior that I ever heard of. Saljong is not an ordinary biting spirit, and the blindness which he causes is incurable, but he is more intimately concerned with the daily affairs of the Garos than the somewhat more remote, if abstractly speaking no less powerful Rabuga.'<sup id="cite_ref-1379" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1379">[1,379]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b>♠ High Gods (creator gods) ♣ active ♥</b> A’chik supernatural beings could be considered high gods, in that we define these as "a spiritual being who is believed to have created all reality and/or to be its ultimate governor". However, they did not punish or reward mortals on the basis of morality. 'The Garo believe in supernatural beings whom they call mite. This word may be glossed both as “gods” and as “spirits”. As Robbins Burling (1963:54), who studied the Garo in India, writes, the term mite “covers both beings whom we would call gods and certain lesser, quite different nuisances, which hardly deserve to be known by any term more dignified than spirits.” To some of these mite the Garo attribute the creation of all the creatures of the world, the control of natural phenomena and the granting of health, wealth and happiness to mankind. Other mite, they say, are the cause of illness, disease and other misfortune. Consequently, Garo talk of some mite as being good and friendly, because they can help mankind, and others as being invariably malicious. But, Garo say, friendly mite are also capable of causing sickness and misfortune, if people anger them. But whether beneficent or malicious, Garo do not terminologically differentiate the two kinds of mite. Furthermore they say that all mite, good or bad, need to be propitiated.' <sup id="cite_ref-1380" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1380">[1,380]</a></sup> 'No suggestion is made that a man’s behavior in this world affects his later destiny. Spirits and gods are amoral, and punishment for wrong behavior comes in this world or not at all. One treats the spirits and gods with respect and circumspection because they can cause sickness and crop failure, but they do not send these as punishment for immoral behavior. Morality has a more pragmatic basis. Nothing is wrong unless it hurts someone else, and one may expect that the other person and his family will take action against the wrongdoer.

Some crops must not be eaten before a certain ceremony. One doesn’t beat drums while the rice is ripening, for to do so might offend the spirits or gods and bring suffering to the transgressor. But the Garos are hardly oppressed by fears of the supernatural, and the usages they follow are so taken for granted that they cause little feeling of deprivation. Moreover, one man’s transgressions harm only himself, so no one need keep a watchful eye on other people lest they bring down the fury of the gods on the whole community. This salutary attitude allows each man to conduct his behavior with little fear of moral disapproval from others, and helps to keep the Garos from getting too worried about the horrible effects of some offence to the gods. Most ceremonial behavior is concerned with repairing things that have gone wrong, not with prevention.'<sup id="cite_ref-1401" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1401">[1,401]</a></sup> 'After the agalmaka ceremony, nobody should beat a drum (however, in the case of a death and during the propitiation of certain spirits, the drum is allowed to be beaten even within the prohibited period), utter the ahaia cry or utter the name of goera, the thunder-god. Transgression of these taboos are thought to bring misfortune to the village in general. In none of the villages did I find anybody flouting these taboos (though the belief of the younger generation in such taboos are gradually slackening), not due to any fear of punishment, but due to the feeling of general interest, since transgression of such taboos will mean harm to the whole village, including the household of the trangressor.'<sup id="cite_ref-1402" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1402">[1,402]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b>♠ in-group loyalty ♣ present ♥</b> It appears that the kin group largely coincided with the in-group. The population was organized in land-owning matrilineal kin groups: 'The household is the primary production and consumption unit. A Garo household comprises parents, unmarried sons and daughters, a married daughter (heiress) with her husband and their children. In principle a married granddaughter and her children should be included, but in reality grandparents hardly exist to see their grandchildren married. Some households may--for short periods only--include distant relatives or non-related persons for various reasons.' <sup id="cite_ref-1405" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1405">[1,405]</a></sup> 'The Garos reckon their kinship through the mother. Individuals measure the degree of their relationship to one another by the distance of their matrilineages. For men, children of their sister or sister's daughters are very important kin. For women, children of their sister's daughters are equivalent to the children of their own daughters.' <sup id="cite_ref-1406" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1406">[1,406]</a></sup> 'Land for shifting cultivation is owned by the clan. Each village has a traditionally demarcated area of its own termed ADOK. This area is subdivided into plots that are used for cultivation in a cyclic order. The plots are distributed to the families. Allotment of the general plots is done by common consensus of the village elders. But the flat area for permanent wet cultivation is owned by individuals.' <sup id="cite_ref-1407" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1407">[1,407]</a></sup> 'Property among the Garos is inherited in the female line. One of the daughters is selected by the parents to be the heiress. If the couple have no female child, a girl belonging to the machong of the wife (preferably the daughter of her sister, whether real or classificatory) is adopted to be an heiress. She is not considered to be the absolute owner of the property. Decision about the disposal of property is taken by her husband, who is considered to be the household authority (NOKNI SKOTONG). After the death of the father-in-law responsibility transfers to the son-in-law. If a dead man is survived by a widow, she stays in the family of her daughter and is sometimes referred to as an additional wife (JIK) of her daughter's husband.' <sup id="cite_ref-1408" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1408">[1,408]</a></sup> 'In Garo society the most important social group is the clan known as MACHONG. A machong is an exogamous matrilineal descent group wherein a Garo is automatically assigned by birth to the unilineal group of his mother. A CHATCHI (moiety) is divided into many machong. Each married couple chooses one daughter--or, if they have none, they adopt a close relative of the mother--to be heiress (NAKNA DONQIPIKA MECHIK) of the family. Her husband traditionally is selected from the lineage group of the father and is accepted as the NOKROM of the house. He resides with his wife in her parents' house. He has to take on the responsibility of looking after his parents-in-law during their old age, and his wife inherits the property.' <sup id="cite_ref-1409" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1409">[1,409]</a></sup> Land was transmitted to a single heiress. Some conditions were attached to the status of heiress: 'Selection of the Nokna from amongst the daughters of a family and the Nokrom as well is a very important matter for a Garo family. After the selection of the Nokna she alone becomes the heiress of the property of the family and it is she who can exercise all rights over it; her sisters lose all claims over it. But if the Nokna does not reside with her parents and likes to live separately with her husband elsewhere she, as of course loses the noknaship and a different daughter is taken as the Nokna of the house. Even if the lady becomes unfaithful to her husband either by committing adultery or by some other reasons then also she loses the claim over the property. If she is divorced by her husband she loses the noknaship, the husband also having no claim either over the property. The man is provided with a wife by the machong of his divorced wife and he enjoys the property of the second wife till he lives with her. After the death of the man the new wife gets the property and after her her daughter gets it. If the husband becomes unfaithful to his legally married wife and is divorced by the latter he forfeits all the rights which he used to exercise over the property; he is to get out of the house leaving his wife, the children and the property. The lady is provided with a husband from her divorced husband’s clan. In case a lady becomes a widow having any daughter from her husband she is entitled to take a man as her spouse from the machong to which her deceased husband belonged. If a widower or a widow cannot be provided with a suitable man or a woman within a reasonable time, either of them can marry persons from amongst the eligible clans.' <sup id="cite_ref-1410" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1410">[1,410]</a></sup> Heiresses and their husbands were expected to care for their parents/in-laws: 'Just as there are conflicting pressures for and against being married at all, advantages and disadvantages are likewise seen in regard to becoming an heir. Most young men say that they do not want to become heirs, for the responsibility of caring for one’s parents-in-law in their later years, and of maintaining an old, and perhaps respected household may be an awesome prospect. Furthermore, it is recognized that there are personal complications to be faced in living with one’s parents-in-law. Since the father-in-law is normally a member of the same matrilineal lineage as his heir, he has a general authority over the younger man. This puts the heir in a sometimes uncomfortable position which boys hesitate to enter, in spite of the economic compensations and the approbation of one’s kinsmen which are gained thereby. A boy who agrees to become an heir explains his action by saying that he feels a sense of duty and believes he should help his father-in-law. Older men who have been heirs for many years, however, say that they could not imagine having done differently, and that the advantages of being able to move into an established household and of eventually inheriting all the assets of the household outweigh the responsibilities involved. In fact it would seem that the advantages and disadvantages just about balance each other, so that boys neither compete to become the heir of a rich man nor shrink from the task to the extent that it becomes difficult to find enough boys to assume the responsibility. In practice the system works with remarkable smoothness. Enough boys and girls are found to fulfill the requirements of heirship, while the others do not feel handicapped by their omission.' <sup id="cite_ref-1411" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1411">[1,411]</a></sup> This requirement influenced the process of selecting an heiress: 'The first step in arranging a marriage of heirs is the choice by the parents of one of their daughters as heiress. Because they need a girl to perform these duties, Garo parents welcome a [Page 78] daughter more than a son, though if they have many children, they say that they like best to have some of each. However, even if a couple should have no daughters, they can adopt a close relative who will come into their home and assume the duties of an actual daughter.' <sup id="cite_ref-1412" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1412">[1,412]</a></sup> 'Most women have at least one daughter of their own so they do not have to adopt another. A single daughter automatically becomes the heiress, but if a woman has more than one, a choice must be made. Garos simply say that they choose whichever girl loves her mother the most, or whichever is the hardest worker; but age also has a bearing upon the decision. The oldest of several girls is rarely chosen since she is likely to be too near the age of her mother, who will have no need of support until she is older. Most people prefer to wait until they draw near the age when they grow feeble before filling the house with a son-in-law and grandchildren. But if the parents so desire, even the oldest daughter may become heiress. Aling had a slightly withered leg, which made it difficult for him to do [Page 80] the heaviest labor. He and his wife, therefore, chose the oldest of their several daughters as heiress so that their household would acquire another adult man as soon as possible. Under more normal circumstances the youngest daughter is a more likely choice than the oldest, but there is no fixed rule either way. Rather, it is a matter for the personal decision of the family members. Since the choice is often made while the girls are still small, they have less to say about it than their parents, though their desires are taken into account if they are old enough. The decision is largely the parents’, and especially the mother’s.' <sup id="cite_ref-1413" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1413">[1,413]</a></sup> Lineage members were expected to cooperate in the selection of sons-in-law: 'As in the case of a woman looking for an adoptive daughter, a man who searches for a ‘nephew’ to bring to his home has the advantage of lineage authority on his side. All the members of a lineage cooperate in taking care of each other and being sure that each man is provided with an heir. Though not an obligatory duty, it is at least a proper and worthy act to oblige a ‘brother’ by giving him one’s son, and to oblige an ‘uncle’ by becoming his son-in-law. The ‘uncle’s’ authority over his younger lineage mates, both his ‘sister’ (the mother of his prospective ‘heir’) and the ‘nephew’ himself, makes it somewhat [Page 82] difficult to give him an outright refusal. His ‘sister’ may discourage him if she is opposed to the marriage, and in the final analysis he can never force a marriage against the will of the others. One man told me that one of his ‘uncles’ had tried to get either himself or his brother to come to be his heir. The ‘sister’ the mother of my informant, seemed to go along with him, never refusing outright, but she also quietly advised her sons to avoid the match since she did not like the girls. In this way she prevented the marriage from taking place. Nevertheless, all members of the lineage recognize that each man must find a younger lineage relative to be his heir, and the weight of opinion will aid a man who wants a ‘nephew’. Everyone encourages the ‘nephew’ to undertake the duty and tries to overcome his doubts.' <sup id="cite_ref-1414" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1414">[1,414]</a></sup> Men could expect support and hospitality from their matrilineage: 'Unlike the males, the role of a female centres round her own ‘mahari’ only. Her position in the ‘mahari’ is indicated by the term ‘ma-no’, which signifies that she is either a ‘ma’ (mother) or a ‘no’ (sister) to her ‘mahari’ people. In Garo language there is a proverb: “mana nona ok, jikna dena kok,” which signifies that when a man goes to his mother’s or sister’s house, he takes with him his empty stomach to be filled in, and when he goes to his wife and children he takes a basket full of provisions to feed them. This proverb aptly describes the position of the female as ‘ma-no’. Whenever a Garo male visits the house of his female ‘mahari’ (this is not very frequent due to the fact that the Garo follow the rule of matrilocal residence very strictly), he exercises considerable freedom in demanding hospitality; this is known to the Garo as ‘manok chaa’ (enjoying the hospitality of the mother’s house). Moreover, a male always expects help from his mother’s or sister’s household in times of need. When a man is divorced he is to come out of his wife’s house, and in such a case he comes back to his mother’s house, or finds out a sister who would shelter him.' <sup id="cite_ref-1415" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1415">[1,415]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ respect for authority ♣ present ♥</b> The A’chik were organized in clans and lineages: 'The Garos reckon their kinship through the mother. Individuals measure the degree of their relationship to one another by the distance of their matrilineages. For men, children of their sister or sister's daughters are very important kin. For women, children of their sister's daughters are equivalent to the children of their own daughters.' <sup id="cite_ref-1416" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1416">[1,416]</a></sup> 'In Garo society the most important social group is the clan known as MACHONG. A machong is an exogamous matrilineal descent group wherein a Garo is automatically assigned by birth to the unilineal group of his mother. A CHATCHI (moiety) is divided into many machong. Each married couple chooses one daughter--or, if they have none, they adopt a close relative of the mother--to be heiress (NAKNA DONQIPIKA MECHIK) of the family. Her husband traditionally is selected from the lineage group of the father and is accepted as the NOKROM of the house. He resides with his wife in her parents' house. He has to take on the responsibility of looking after his parents-in-law during their old age, and his wife inherits the property.' <sup id="cite_ref-1417" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1417">[1,417]</a></sup> 'Property among the Garos is inherited in the female line. One of the daughters is selected by the parents to be the heiress. If the couple have no female child, a girl belonging to the machong of the wife (preferably the daughter of her sister, whether real or classificatory) is adopted to be an heiress. She is not considered to be the absolute owner of the property. Decision about the disposal of property is taken by her husband, who is considered to be the household authority (NOKNI SKOTONG). After the death of the father-in-law responsibility transfers to the son-in-law. If a dead man is survived by a widow, she stays in the family of her daughter and is sometimes referred to as an additional wife (JIK) of her daughter's husband.' <sup id="cite_ref-1418" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1418">[1,418]</a></sup> 'Land for shifting cultivation is owned by the clan. Each village has a traditionally demarcated area of its own termed ADOK. This area is subdivided into plots that are used for cultivation in a cyclic order. The plots are distributed to the families. Allotment of the general plots is done by common consensus of the village elders. But the flat area for permanent wet cultivation is owned by individuals.' <sup id="cite_ref-1419" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1419">[1,419]</a></sup> Local authority was exercised by lineage elders: ‘The authority within a lineage is exercised according to age, the older member always being allowed to direct and punish the younger members. The age differences are otherwise symbolized  in only one way-the order in which rice beer is served. When beer is first passed out at a gathering, the people should be served in order of formal seniority. A maternal uncle should be served before his nephew, and an older brother before a younger one. Even an older sister may precede a younger brother, though generally men and women do not drink together. [...] In spite of this formal deference, older people do not monopolize positions of power, and an old person cannot exercise authority outside his lineage simply because of his age. One defers to one’s lineage seniors, but not to old people in general.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1420" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1420">[1,420]</a></sup> Age and seniority impacted patterns of authority and deference within the lineage. Children were expected to obey grandparents: 'Behavior toward the grandparents is complicated by another of the relationships which is regarded with amusement and which draws considerable teasing by the Garos-that of a boy to his mother’s mother. Even small boys are frequently teased about their intimate contact with their mother’s mother. People, for instance, call him by his grandfather’s name, thereby placing him into an improper relation with the grandmother, and the thought of this is hilarious to everybody but the boy himself. From the time the boy begins to understand what this teasing is all about, he becomes shy of his grandmother, and tries to keep away from her and avoid as much teasing as possible. He has no shyness with his mother’s father, but regards him as something of a disciplinarian. Girls and boys must obey their grandparents or expect punishment. There is no amusement found in teasing a girl about her relationship with any of her grandparents, or in teasing a boy about his relationship with his father’s mother, and certainly not with either grandfather. If the father’s parents live close enough to be visited regularly, the children can associate with them freely, though this relationship is not emphasized as being a particularly close one. The grandparent-grandchild relationship, then, while it involves strain only in the case of mother’s mother and daughter’s son, is not the relationship of pronounced freedom and intimacy that it is in so many societies.' <sup id="cite_ref-1421" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1421">[1,421]</a></sup> 'One other relative or set of relatives in the grandparent’s generation may be significant. This is the mother’s mother’s brother, and the other men of one’s own lineage in that generation. A special kin term designates such people: mamaachu, [Page 127] compounded from the terms for mother’s brother ( mama), and grandfather ( achu). Like the ‘grandfathers’ they are old, but like the ‘uncles’ they have the authority of the lineage, and in fact as the oldest male members of the lineage they have particularly great authority, though it does not differ in kind from that of the ‘uncles’.' <sup id="cite_ref-1422" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1422">[1,422]</a></sup> Fathers-in-law had authority over sons-in-law: 'Just as there are conflicting pressures for and against being married at all, advantages and disadvantages are likewise seen in regard to becoming an heir. Most young men say that they do not want to become heirs, for the responsibility of caring for one’s parents-in-law in their later years, and of maintaining an old, and perhaps respected household may be an awesome prospect. Furthermore, it is recognized that there are personal complications to be faced in living with one’s parents-in-law. Since the father-in-law is normally a member of the same matrilineal lineage as his heir, he has a general authority over the younger man. This puts the heir in a sometimes uncomfortable position which boys hesitate to enter, in spite of the economic compensations and the approbation of one’s kinsmen which are gained thereby. A boy who agrees to become an heir explains his action by saying that he feels a sense of duty and believes he should help his father-in-law. Older men who have been heirs for many years, however, say that they could not imagine having done differently, and that the advantages of being able to move into an established household and of eventually inheriting all the assets of the household outweigh the responsibilities involved. In fact it would seem that the advantages and disadvantages just about balance each other, so that boys neither compete to become the heir of a rich man nor shrink from the task to the extent that it becomes difficult to find enough boys to assume the responsibility. In practice the system works with remarkable smoothness. Enough boys and girls are found to fulfill the requirements of heirship, while the others do not feel handicapped by their omission.' <sup id="cite_ref-1423" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1423">[1,423]</a></sup> Heir-households were typically more wealthy and influential than poorer ones: 'Besides objects and wealth, social status is also inherited by the heir and heiress. When an older member of a household dies, the Garos view his heir as stepping into the social position of the dead person-a woman into the position of her mother and a man into the position of his ‘uncle’ and father-in-law. The clearest symbolic expression of this is the assumption by the heir of kinship terms formerly appropriate to his father-in-law. After the old man’s death, other sons-in-law call the heir by the term which is more generally used for “father-in-law,” and are in turn called “son-in-law” by the heir. It has been pointed out that Garos also speak as if the son-in-law inherited his mother-in-law when her husband dies, since after this she is regarded as a ‘wife’ of the younger man. Moreover, the wife’s siblings call him by a term that otherwise means father’s younger brother. This terminology is analyzed more fully in Appendix C. Beyond this somewhat superficial terminological matter, the occupants of the family house are considered to be the living incumbents in the role of man and woman of that particular house. Households continue, though their members come and go. The most striking example of this is the title of nokma or ‘headman’ which, as will be explained in Chapter IX, adheres to the senior household of the village. The man who happens to be married to the heiress of that household is considered to be the ‘headman’ of the village.' <sup id="cite_ref-1424" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1424">[1,424]</a></sup> 'The ‘headmanship’ is thought of as adhering more closely to the house than to any individual person. All the symbols of office go with the house and not with the man. The most important of the symbols is a particular kind of drum so heavily endowed with supernatural power that no one else in the village dares to keep it in his house. It is not necessarily dangerous to use, for at village festivals the drum is carried from house to house and then anybody may beat it. Funeral parties will even carry it to another village if they should go to pay condolences after a death in that village, but it can only be kept permanently in the nokma’s house. The house itself is constructed with specially carved posts which are flattened on two sides instead of being left round as in all other houses; and when a house of a nokma is thatched, special little straw animals decorate the roof. Even the term nokma is etymologically related to that for ‘house’ or ‘household’-i.e. nok; while - ma is a suffix which in some contexts means ‘big’ or ‘large’; thus nokma literally means the ‘big house,’ though it is used to refer to the man of that house.' <sup id="cite_ref-1425" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1425">[1,425]</a></sup> 'To explain how a man becomes nokma, it is first necessary to refer once more to the lineage structure of the village. It is simplest to consider villages with a single main lineage first. Just as one household of each cooperating group is considered to be senior by virtue of the fact that all the other households have “come out” from it, one household is the most senior of the whole village, since all of the houses ultimately “came out” from it. The process may, of course, have involved many stages, but the senior household is ordinarily considered to be that of the first nokma. Normally the nokma, like any other man, looks for a ‘nephew,’ that is, a younger man from his own lineage, to come and be his son-in-law and heir. In this case, the ‘nephew’ not only becomes the heir to the house and property but also [Page 224] succeeds to the ‘headmanship’ when his father-in-law dies. Inevitably the nokmas of many villages have grown up in a different village, and belong to a different sib and to the opposite moiety from the people of the main village lineage. A nokma should, however, be a member of the same lineage and from the same village as the previous nokma, so generally a succession of ‘headmen’ are members of one village and lineage by descent but hold the status of ‘headman’ in another village by virtue of being married to the women who are successively chosen as heiress in the senior house of the village.' <sup id="cite_ref-1426" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1426">[1,426]</a></sup> Headmen formally held titles to land: 'Perhaps the most important single characteristic of a nokma is the possession of titles to land. The land which surrounds a village is divided into numerous patches, and titles to these patches are typically distributed among a few of the richest households of the village, including those of the nokmas. A plot of land to which a man holds title is known as a’king, and a nokma who holds a title is known as an a’king nokma. Titles to a’king can be bought and sold among members of the village; [Page 226] however, at the present time sale is unusual, and land titles often stay in the same family for generations, always being inherited intact by the heir and heiress of the last title-holders. Prices in the past have varied from 25 to 75 rupees for the amount of land suitable for one family’s cultivation; on the other hand, titles even today are sometimes purchased with brass gongs instead of money.' <sup id="cite_ref-1427" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1427">[1,427]</a></sup> 'Holding a title brings almost no direct benefit, for the titleholder has no more right to use the land than anyone else in the village. Nevertheless it confers great prestige, and titles like, heirlooms and jewelry, can be an important repository of savings. They can be converted into other forms of wealth and used to tide the household over poor years, as well as to give stability to its position of wealth in the village. Titles are considered even safer than ownership of heirlooms, since heirlooms can be stolen or destroyed. Moreover, title to some land is a necessary prerequisite for being considered a nokma, though land title alone is not enough. Four men in Rengsanggri had title to some land: Gajang, Jengnon, Nanggan, and Bano; but the first two of these held the most, and only they were considered nokmas. Bano was not a wealthy man, though the household he inherited had formerly been much wealthier. He performed no ceremonies appropriate to nokmaship, and people suggested that he might soon be forced to sell some of his land titles. Nanggan was much richer. He held title to more land than Bano, but still not as much as either Jengnon or Gajang. Nanggan did not perform the ceremonies of a nokma or possess any of the symbols of one; but the main obstacle to his being considered a nokma was that his household had such little genealogical depth. Nanggan purchased some of his title from one Rojang, who was from a family that had formerly been very wealthy, but who was gradually forced to sell some of his land to fellow villagers, and eventually moved away from Rengsanggri. Nanggan himself was an heir, but his father-in-law had been a non-heir who had married a girl from what is now Jengnon’s household and lived [Page 227] separately. In another generation or two, if Nanggan’s heir and his heir’s heir continue to maintain the wealth of the household, they will be obvious candidates for nokmaship, and may assume the symbols and obligations of the office.' <sup id="cite_ref-1428" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1428">[1,428]</a></sup> Headmen also held certain ritual privileges: 'In every big Garo village there are sacrificial stones called kosi at the entrance of the village. These are rough and unhewn stones, set up on the ground without any attempt for keeping in regular position and seldom more than three feet high. The sacrificial stone is cleansed once in a year with the blood of cow, dog, fowl or any other animal. It is important that all the members of the village should participate in this activity. No outsider is allowed to enter or go out of the village at the time of this celebration. If anybody violates this, he or she can be forced to pay any amount of dai. It may be a one-day or two-day affair depending on the size of the feasts they arrange. The nokma of the village has all the rights and obligations in organising the feasts. The blood of the sacrificed animal is offered to the stones and while doing so all the villagers are expected to take part in the worship of their mite. They have to pray to this mite to keep the village safe and sound from the enemies, diseases and also wild animals. The annual celebration of the stone is called as A’songtata. A priest in place of nokma can officiate at this sacrifice but it is for the nokma to provide or sanction it. No person has the right to perform A’songtata without the sanction from the nokma. If anybody does this, it would not only be an usurpation of nokma’s authority but would be tantamount to asserting himself as nokma and such person would be liable to pay heavy dai.' <sup id="cite_ref-1429" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1429">[1,429]</a></sup> Accordingly, converts to Christianity could not act as headmen in non-Christian villages. Prestige could be achieved through hospitality and sponsoring festivals: 'Entertainment as a Means to Prestige. A’jak and dena seem to be weighted in a lop-sided manner to the advantage of the rich members of the community, but the wealth they bring has only limited uses. Wealthy people can buy a few better clothes, eat a little more meat, command larger work parties, and therefore build bigger houses; but all this does not set them off in any sharp way from the poorer people. Rich people spend most of their time working in the fields like everyone else. The main use of wealth is to entertain on a comparatively lavish scale. This converts wealth into prestige and power, while materially the wealth is again distributed throughout the community, since everyone shares in the consumption of the goods that rich men accumulate. Feasts are not given in the Rengsanggri area on occasions designed specifically to validate or establish prestige, though such feasts do occur in some parts of the hills. The Rengsanggri custom is for ambitious men to seize as times for particularly lavish entertainment those numerous occasions when hospitality is appropriate. During the ceremonies, when the villagers are entertained in every house in turn, the richer houses entertain abundantly. The poorest houses seldom fail to offer something; but fewer people visit them, partly to avoid embarassing the householders and partly because there is less expectation of a bountiful spread. It is hardly reasonable for any single person to visit every one of the sixty households in the village, but most do assemble at the richer houses, where they can confidently expect to be greeted with copious amounts of rice beer and liberal quantities of rice and curry.' <sup id="cite_ref-1430" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1430">[1,430]</a></sup> 'Entertaining is appropriate on many other occasions. When a death occurs in the community, the wealthy villagers invite others in for a consolation drink. A few relatives may kill a cow, which they say they do to honor the dead person, but which actually brings as much honor to the man who offers the cow. At the post-funeral ceremony the dead man’s household has the opportunity to kill a cow and entertain. Beer and sometimes food are distributed by participants in legal disputes. Lunch may be served to house-builders, while thatchers in particular are supposed to be rewarded with food and beer. A few households offer feasts to others out in the fields at the Asiroka ceremony, before rice planting. Even the sacrifices to banish disease may be more liberal if the family is wealthy, and thus may provide a larger feast for the helpers. A son or a daughter who has moved away from his or her parents to marry, and who is wealthy enough, may slaughter a cow, ostensibly to honor the parents. Usually the time of one of the major village festivals is chosen for this, and most of the animal is sent to the parents’ home. One leg is retained by the son’s or daughter’s family, however, and there is meat enough for two feasts, one at each house. The feast is described as one of giving thanks to the parents for their help to the child, but honor comes not only to the parents but to the child as well. The greatest hospitality and greatest prestige derive from killing a cow, and a record of the number killed is made public by decorating the front of the killer’s house with the horns and frontal bones of the animals. Wealthy houses may be hung with two or three dozen sets.' <sup id="cite_ref-1431" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1431">[1,431]</a></sup> 'One of these feasts may serve simultaneously to validate the right of a household to use its own gongs for beating at village festivals. A house must have about fifteen gongs before it is considered decent to use them, and houses which do not own enough must borrow them from a richer neighbor when they are needed. But just to accumulate and own enough gongs is not sufficient; the household must kill a cow for some occasion, such [Page 205] as to honor a parent, before the gongs can be used. After this the household will be expected to entertain regularly and on a larger than average scale, and so to maintain its prestigeful position. In Rengsanggri eight households owned enough gongs to be used in festivals: those of Gajang, Jengnon, Nanggan, Anat, Kakan, Chondu, Rongsin, and Gurang. Many other households had a few gongs but used those from one of these eight households and carried them to their houses when it was their turn to entertain during village festivals. Feasts are frequent enough for poor people to eat significantly better than they would if they relied entirely on their own gardens. Wealth differences lead to greater differences in prestige than in standards of consumption. Prestige and social standing go to the industrious and skillful.' <sup id="cite_ref-1432" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1432">[1,432]</a></sup> But overall there was little differentiation of status: ‘In a Garo village very little difference of status is seen. A particular clan holds right of ownership of the village homestead and shifting cultivation lands, and the title of ownership is inherited by a particular household. The head of the land-owning household is known as the  nokma, and the particular area under which he holds ownership right is known as   a’king. He also acts as the religious head of the village, and he is to perform the ceremonies for the general well-being of the village. He is called upon to settle disputes between villagers. But in all his decisions he is guided by the elders of the village. He is not entitled to any tribute from the villagers, and he has no special paraphernalia to indicate himself as the  nokma. However, in the village a rich man gets respect, because in times of need people have to seek help from him. But in a Garo village it is usually very rare to find an extremely rich man. To a Garo wealth consists of a number of brass gongs called  rang and some ornaments made of silver or some such metal. Now-a-days a gun is also regarded as the status symbol of a wealthy man.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1433" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1433">[1,433]</a></sup> 'People admire the rich men, but they do not defer to them in any formal manner, and an observer could not possibly tell from watching a group of men in ordinary daily pursuits which of them were rich and which poor. If one looked at the size of their houses or measured the size of their fields, however, the relative position of the men would become fairly clear, and the more one observed the details of personal relations, the clearer it would become. Village life is so organized that few important village-wide decisions must be made, but when problems do arise people are usually willing to go along with the decisions of [Page 208] the elite. The nokma must formally designate the day for ceremonies, but before doing so he informally samples the opinions of other wealthy men. If disagreements arise about the distribution of plots for cultivation, the wealthy men can usually carry along public opinion toward some solution. I once watched villagers buying a cow for a ceremony. Every household had contributed money toward the price of the cow, but it was four or five wealthy men who put their heads together and decided whether or not to try to make the seller come down in price. These are not profound questions; but somebody must decide them, and most villagers are happy to leave them to the wealthy men. After all, they “feed” the poorer people, and their very wealth is evidence of their ability. My own judgment of the ability of the various men in the village was close to the consensus of the villagers. I agreed with them that the wealthy people were often more able and intelligent than the others. It does take more than ordinary ability to accumulate or hold on to wealth.' <sup id="cite_ref-1434" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1434">[1,434]</a></sup> While seniority mattered within the lineage, there was little differentiation of status in general. We are thus unsure how to best code for this variable. We have chosen 'present' for the time being, but this is open to review.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ purity ♣ absent ♥</b> Women were excluded from headmanship and banned from entering the men's house: 'Women are quite excluded from village administration. A woman can never be a village headman ( nokma), because a village nokma has certain ceremonial functions, and such ceremonial rites cannot be performed by a woman. The position occupied by women in village affairs is considered to be the lowest and equivalent to that of children. The Garo classify women, as regards their position in village affairs, with children by the use of the phrase mechik bisa-disa (literally, women-children). In areas where there are bachelors’ houses, women, excepting the nokma’s wife, are not allowed to enter the bachelors’ house by the front door. In village feasts and ceremonials, women are not allowed to occupy the positions reserved for persons of honour. They enjoy their meals outside in the open courtyard in front.' <sup id="cite_ref-1435" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1435">[1,435]</a></sup> While Christianized villages abandoned men's houses, women were still excluded from headmanship. However, it appears that menstruation and pregnancy were not subject to taboos or notions of impurity: 'Within a year or so after marriage most women become pregnant, but the Garos recognize some necessary preliminaries: “As a tree must bloom before it bears its fruit, so a woman must have her menses before she can bear her child.” Women sometimes have pain and discomfort at this time. An unmarried girl is expected to get over this by herself, and even her first menses are not ceremonially marked, but an attentive husband may perform a small sacrifice to appease the spirits who plague his wife if she is in pain or if the period lasts too long. A menstruating woman is under no formal restrictions, but sexual relations are avoided, and she often wears dark clothes and is likely to spend at least one or two days fairly close to the house so as not to be embarrassed before her neighbors. She has to wash extra clothes, and when these hang out to dry, the women of the village take notice and know that she is not yet pregnant. I was told that the men are seldom so observant.' <sup id="cite_ref-1436" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1436">[1,436]</a></sup> 'When the pregnancy becomes obvious by the enlargement of the abdomen or when the movement of the baby is first felt, several sacrifices are performed at intervals of a few days or a week. These insure the health of both the fetus and the mother. The woman’s husband most often performs the sacrifices himself, but he may call in another man if he prefers. Young husbands particularly feel some shyness in offering sacrifices, and any other person, even the girl’s father, can do them for him. It is expected that the father will perform the sacrifices for an unmarried daughter who becomes pregnant, but if a husband does not at least make certain that somebody attends to them, the relatives would surely blame him for any complications that should arise. Four sacrifices are usual at this time, though a sickly woman will warrant more. Each sacrifice is designed to appease a different spirit and as in sacrifices performed to cure disease, an animal must be killed at each, and its blood smeared on a specially built altar. Ideally a goat should be sacrificed at [Page 100] one of these and a baby pig at another, but poverty may force the substitution of a fowl. If the sacrifices are all properly performed the woman should be healthy and have no difficulty with giving birth, but otherwise the baby or even the mother may die.' <sup id="cite_ref-1437" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1437">[1,437]</a></sup> 'Predictions of the date of birth are often wide of the mark, but as nearly as possible to the time the parents should brew rice beer, pound rice, and obtain chickens and a pig to be used for the occasion. When a woman notices signs of imminent delivery, such as pain or rupture of the fetal membrane, she returns immediately to her house. If other villagers hear of her labor, they also come back to the village from their fields, and they are expected to be particularly careful to refrain from cutting banana leaves or bamboo leaves from their fields until she has given birth. The woman retires to the back room of the house for the delivery. In most villages a few women are recognized as skillful at midwifery, and one of these generally comes to assist at a birth. A second and unskilled woman, often a sister or some other female relative, assists the midwife. Other relatives gather in the main room of the house, some of the men help with the sacrifice, and the women help with the cooking. If the labor is protracted, chickens, a pig, or sometimes, if the family is wealthy enough, even a cow, may be sacrificed to assure the woman’s health. If labor goes so rapidly that there is no time for a sacrifice, then both the opportunity and the necessity for assuring ease to the mother are past, and the sacrifice can be safely omitted. Rapid delivery is considered to be easier for the mother. It allows her to get back to work promptly. The baby, on the other hand, is less likely to be healthy if the delivery goes quickly. For this purpose the husband, or another man, cuts two bamboo knives from a large rafter of the house. Bamboo knives are not otherwise used today, but Garos feel that iron tools are used in too many other ways to be appropriate for cutting the umbilical cord. New bamboo would be less sharp, and the rafters, which are made from the most suitable type of [Page 101] bamboo, provide an accessible source. One of these knives is used to cut the cord, and the other is later taken to the jungle with the afterbirth and left there for the spirits.' <sup id="cite_ref-1438" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1438">[1,438]</a></sup> Spirits demanded sacrifices and the observance of some taboos: 'Not all supernatural beings are so uniformly malign as the biting mite. Most of the others, the “creating” mite as they are occasionally called, are more or less neutral if not positively friendly. They are a bit more remote from daily life, but harmony between men and these gods, as they can be appropriately called, must be maintained by several annual sacrifices. There is confusion among the Garos as to how many of these gods exist and how many names each one has, and it is quite impossible to decide whether two names stand for two different gods or for two aspects of the same god, since Garos describe them now in one way and now in the other. Rabuga, Ranaga, Tatara or Dakgipa, are used as names for a god who is believed to have made the world and man. Dakgipa, in fact, means quite literally “the one who makes.” These names are called out in the course of sacrifices to ward off disease, but the sacrifices are directed primarily toward the lesser biting spirits, and not toward Rabuga. Saljong is a name referring to a god who presides over crops. Some identify Saljong with Rabuga, but others are inclined to regard him as distinct. At any rate, it is specifically to Saljong that most of the annual sacrifices are dedicated, particularly those that are held in the fields. Saljong controls the water and the rain, and the growing of all things. When the dried fields are burned at the beginning of planting, Saljong sees the smoke of the fire and comes to join the people as they worship him in their fields. He supervises them as they fix the boundaries, and he blinds the people if they later move the markers-the only example of supernatural punishent for immoral behavior that I ever heard of. Saljong is not an ordinary biting spirit, and the blindness which he causes is incurable, but he is more intimately concerned with the daily affairs of the Garos than the somewhat more remote, if abstractly speaking no less powerful Rabuga.' <sup id="cite_ref-1439" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1439">[1,439]</a></sup> 'There are other ways in which a Garo maintains his peaceful relationship with the supernatural beings which surround him. Some crops must not be eaten before a certain ceremony. One doesn’t beat drums while the rice is ripening, for to do so might offend the spirits or gods and bring suffering to the transgressor. But the Garos are hardly oppressed by fears of the supernatural, and the usages they follow are so taken for granted that they cause little feeling of deprivation. Moreover, one man’s transgressions harm only himself, so no one need keep a watchful eye on other people lest they bring down the fury of the gods on the whole community. This salutary attitude allows each man to conduct his behavior with little fear of moral disapproval from others, and helps to keep the Garos from getting too worried about the horrible effects of some offence to the gods. Most ceremonial behavior is concerned with repairing things that have gone wrong, not with prevention.' <sup id="cite_ref-1440" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1440">[1,440]</a></sup> 'Ahaia. The second of the three autumn ceremonies is held in September, after the rice harvest has been completed. Each household sacrifices a fish in its own field and then once again the rounds of the village are made with eating, drinking, and music at each house. This time, however, the young people dance, and the whole festival may take several days. They cannot dance at the earlier festivals because it is improper to beat the drums while the rice is growing, and without drums dancing is impossible. Besides, it is likely to be uncomfortably hot and too rainy for dancing much earlier. Red glutinous rice must not be eaten before Ahaia. Wangala follows about a month later.' <sup id="cite_ref-1441" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1441">[1,441]</a></sup> 'Around June to July, when the padi was growing in the swiddens, the Garo would observe a festival called Miamua. This festival lasted only a single day and, during it, the nokma would sacrifice a pig in his own swidden and sponsor a feast for all the villagers. After the feast, which took place around noon, the people used to sing and play music. But they were forbidden on this occasion to beat drums. It was said that the beating of drums at this particular time could attract the attention of some malevolent mite, like Bang, Rakashi or Chual, who might then decide to come to the village to enjoy the sound of the drums and subsequently cause damage to the growing padi plants. And, because there were no drums to accompany them, the villagers would not dance on the occasion of Miamua either.' <sup id="cite_ref-1442" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1442">[1,442]</a></sup> 'After the agalmaka ceremony, nobody should beat a drum (however, in the case of a death and during the propitiation of certain spirits, the drum is allowed to be beaten even within the prohibited period), utter the ahaia cry or utter the name of goera, the thunder-god. Transgression of these taboos are thought to bring misfortune to the village in general. In none of the villages did I find anybody flouting these taboos (though the belief of the younger generation in such taboos are gradually slackening), not due to any fear of punishment, but due to the feeling of general interest, since transgression of such taboos will mean harm to the whole village, including the household of the trangressor.' <sup id="cite_ref-1443" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1443">[1,443]</a></sup> However, we have found no material indicating that notions of ritual purity informed the observance of these taboos. More material on taboos may be needed. Christianized A’chik probably failed to observe any of the above taboos, but this remains in need of confirmation.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ kinship ♣ present ♥</b> Incest was punishable by ordeal: 'The a’krom ordeal was another dangerous method. A spot where once a man had been killed by a tiger was called a’krom and Garos never dared to go near it. For the most serious offence like incest, the village elders took recourse to a’krom ordeal. The man was ordered to lie down at that spot for the night and if he was found alive without injury the next day, his innocence was proved (Sangma, Milton. 1982, p. 98).' <sup id="cite_ref-1444" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1444">[1,444]</a></sup> The population was organized in land-owning matrilineal kin groups: 'The household is the primary production and consumption unit. A Garo household comprises parents, unmarried sons and daughters, a married daughter (heiress) with her husband and their children. In principle a married granddaughter and her children should be included, but in reality grandparents hardly exist to see their grandchildren married. Some households may--for short periods only--include distant relatives or non-related persons for various reasons.' <sup id="cite_ref-1445" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1445">[1,445]</a></sup> 'The Garos reckon their kinship through the mother. Individuals measure the degree of their relationship to one another by the distance of their matrilineages. For men, children of their sister or sister's daughters are very important kin. For women, children of their sister's daughters are equivalent to the children of their own daughters.' <sup id="cite_ref-1446" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1446">[1,446]</a></sup> 'Land for shifting cultivation is owned by the clan. Each village has a traditionally demarcated area of its own termed ADOK. This area is subdivided into plots that are used for cultivation in a cyclic order. The plots are distributed to the families. Allotment of the general plots is done by common consensus of the village elders. But the flat area for permanent wet cultivation is owned by individuals.' <sup id="cite_ref-1447" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1447">[1,447]</a></sup> 'Property among the Garos is inherited in the female line. One of the daughters is selected by the parents to be the heiress. If the couple have no female child, a girl belonging to the machong of the wife (preferably the daughter of her sister, whether real or classificatory) is adopted to be an heiress. She is not considered to be the absolute owner of the property. Decision about the disposal of property is taken by her husband, who is considered to be the household authority (NOKNI SKOTONG). After the death of the father-in-law responsibility transfers to the son-in-law. If a dead man is survived by a widow, she stays in the family of her daughter and is sometimes referred to as an additional wife (JIK) of her daughter's husband.' <sup id="cite_ref-1448" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1448">[1,448]</a></sup> 'In Garo society the most important social group is the clan known as MACHONG. A machong is an exogamous matrilineal descent group wherein a Garo is automatically assigned by birth to the unilineal group of his mother. A CHATCHI (moiety) is divided into many machong. Each married couple chooses one daughter--or, if they have none, they adopt a close relative of the mother--to be heiress (NAKNA DONQIPIKA MECHIK) of the family. Her husband traditionally is selected from the lineage group of the father and is accepted as the NOKROM of the house. He resides with his wife in her parents' house. He has to take on the responsibility of looking after his parents-in-law during their old age, and his wife inherits the property.' <sup id="cite_ref-1449" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1449">[1,449]</a></sup> Land was transmitted to a single heiress. Some conditions were attached to the status of heiress: 'Selection of the Nokna from amongst the daughters of a family and the Nokrom as well is a very important matter for a Garo family. After the selection of the Nokna she alone becomes the heiress of the property of the family and it is she who can exercise all rights over it; her sisters lose all claims over it. But if the Nokna does not reside with her parents and likes to live separately with her husband elsewhere she, as of course loses the noknaship and a different daughter is taken as the Nokna of the house. Even if the lady becomes unfaithful to her husband either by committing adultery or by some other reasons then also she loses the claim over the property. If she is divorced by her husband she loses the noknaship, the husband also having no claim either over the property. The man is provided with a wife by the machong of his divorced wife and he enjoys the property of the second wife till he lives with her. After the death of the man the new wife gets the property and after her her daughter gets it. If the husband becomes unfaithful to his legally married wife and is divorced by the latter he forfeits all the rights which he used to exercise over the property; he is to get out of the house leaving his wife, the children and the property. The lady is provided with a husband from her divorced husband’s clan. In case a lady becomes a widow having any daughter from her husband she is entitled to take a man as her spouse from the machong to which her deceased husband belonged. If a widower or a widow cannot be provided with a suitable man or a woman within a reasonable time, either of them can marry persons from amongst the eligible clans.' <sup id="cite_ref-1450" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1450">[1,450]</a></sup> Heiresses and their husbands were expected to care for their parents/in-laws: 'Just as there are conflicting pressures for and against being married at all, advantages and disadvantages are likewise seen in regard to becoming an heir. Most young men say that they do not want to become heirs, for the responsibility of caring for one’s parents-in-law in their later years, and of maintaining an old, and perhaps respected household may be an awesome prospect. Furthermore, it is recognized that there are personal complications to be faced in living with one’s parents-in-law. Since the father-in-law is normally a member of the same matrilineal lineage as his heir, he has a general authority over the younger man. This puts the heir in a sometimes uncomfortable position which boys hesitate to enter, in spite of the economic compensations and the approbation of one’s kinsmen which are gained thereby. A boy who agrees to become an heir explains his action by saying that he feels a sense of duty and believes he should help his father-in-law. Older men who have been heirs for many years, however, say that they could not imagine having done differently, and that the advantages of being able to move into an established household and of eventually inheriting all the assets of the household outweigh the responsibilities involved. In fact it would seem that the advantages and disadvantages just about balance each other, so that boys neither compete to become the heir of a rich man nor shrink from the task to the extent that it becomes difficult to find enough boys to assume the responsibility. In practice the system works with remarkable smoothness. Enough boys and girls are found to fulfill the requirements of heirship, while the others do not feel handicapped by their omission.' <sup id="cite_ref-1451" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1451">[1,451]</a></sup> This requirement influenced the process of selecting an heiress: 'The first step in arranging a marriage of heirs is the choice by the parents of one of their daughters as heiress. Because they need a girl to perform these duties, Garo parents welcome a [Page 78] daughter more than a son, though if they have many children, they say that they like best to have some of each. However, even if a couple should have no daughters, they can adopt a close relative who will come into their home and assume the duties of an actual daughter.' <sup id="cite_ref-1452" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1452">[1,452]</a></sup> 'Most women have at least one daughter of their own so they do not have to adopt another. A single daughter automatically becomes the heiress, but if a woman has more than one, a choice must be made. Garos simply say that they choose whichever girl loves her mother the most, or whichever is the hardest worker; but age also has a bearing upon the decision. The oldest of several girls is rarely chosen since she is likely to be too near the age of her mother, who will have no need of support until she is older. Most people prefer to wait until they draw near the age when they grow feeble before filling the house with a son-in-law and grandchildren. But if the parents so desire, even the oldest daughter may become heiress. Aling had a slightly withered leg, which made it difficult for him to do [Page 80] the heaviest labor. He and his wife, therefore, chose the oldest of their several daughters as heiress so that their household would acquire another adult man as soon as possible. Under more normal circumstances the youngest daughter is a more likely choice than the oldest, but there is no fixed rule either way. Rather, it is a matter for the personal decision of the family members. Since the choice is often made while the girls are still small, they have less to say about it than their parents, though their desires are taken into account if they are old enough. The decision is largely the parents’, and especially the mother’s.' <sup id="cite_ref-1453" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1453">[1,453]</a></sup> Lineage members were expected to cooperate in the selection of sons-in-law: 'As in the case of a woman looking for an adoptive daughter, a man who searches for a ‘nephew’ to bring to his home has the advantage of lineage authority on his side. All the members of a lineage cooperate in taking care of each other and being sure that each man is provided with an heir. Though not an obligatory duty, it is at least a proper and worthy act to oblige a ‘brother’ by giving him one’s son, and to oblige an ‘uncle’ by becoming his son-in-law. The ‘uncle’s’ authority over his younger lineage mates, both his ‘sister’ (the mother of his prospective ‘heir’) and the ‘nephew’ himself, makes it somewhat [Page 82] difficult to give him an outright refusal. His ‘sister’ may discourage him if she is opposed to the marriage, and in the final analysis he can never force a marriage against the will of the others. One man told me that one of his ‘uncles’ had tried to get either himself or his brother to come to be his heir. The ‘sister’ the mother of my informant, seemed to go along with him, never refusing outright, but she also quietly advised her sons to avoid the match since she did not like the girls. In this way she prevented the marriage from taking place. Nevertheless, all members of the lineage recognize that each man must find a younger lineage relative to be his heir, and the weight of opinion will aid a man who wants a ‘nephew’. Everyone encourages the ‘nephew’ to undertake the duty and tries to overcome his doubts.' <sup id="cite_ref-1454" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1454">[1,454]</a></sup> Men could expect support and hospitality from their matrilineage: 'Unlike the males, the role of a female centres round her own ‘mahari’ only. Her position in the ‘mahari’ is indicated by the term ‘ma-no’, which signifies that she is either a ‘ma’ (mother) or a ‘no’ (sister) to her ‘mahari’ people. In Garo language there is a proverb: “mana nona ok, jikna dena kok,” which signifies that when a man goes to his mother’s or sister’s house, he takes with him his empty stomach to be filled in, and when he goes to his wife and children he takes a basket full of provisions to feed them. This proverb aptly describes the position of the female as ‘ma-no’. Whenever a Garo male visits the house of his female ‘mahari’ (this is not very frequent due to the fact that the Garo follow the rule of matrilocal residence very strictly), he exercises considerable freedom in demanding hospitality; this is known to the Garo as ‘manok chaa’ (enjoying the hospitality of the mother’s house). Moreover, a male always expects help from his mother’s or sister’s household in times of need. When a man is divorced he is to come out of his wife’s house, and in such a case he comes back to his mother’s house, or finds out a sister who would shelter him.' <sup id="cite_ref-1455" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1455">[1,455]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ bravery ♣ present ♥</b> Bravery was traditionally valued within the framework of raiding and head-hunting, but it appears that past exploits continued to be a source of pride: ‘Hunting, raiding, beheading and attacking were the way of life for the Garo. In those days, people collected human skulls and decorated the roof of their houses with them. Head hunting was considered an act of chivalry, a symbol of higher status and social distinction. We may speculate that this practice might have originated owing to mutual suspicions, which led to attack and counter-attack. But it is clear that this was not a senseless activity because the institution of slavery was closely associated with it. During the raids the people who were caught were kept as  ‘nokkol’ (slaves). These slaves were expected to work in the fields and households of their masters. Keeping slaves was not merely a status symbol but enhanced the economy and position of their masters. Some of the prosperous families had as many as sixty slaves. More slaves meant more prosperity of their owners. As their economic status went up they engaged themselves in trade. They could not tolerate the sight of an outsider anywhere as a result of which a lot of mutual suspicion was generated. They often raided the villages in the neighbourhood, as well as in the plains (Pianazzi Fr. 1934, p. 3).’ <sup id="cite_ref-1456" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1456">[1,456]</a></sup> 'At least one old head-hunting sword is stuck into the back wall of every house, and one or more shields may lean against the wall below the sword. Nobody now living can remember head-hunting but everyone has heard of it, and all take a certain delight in recalling the bravery of their ancestors. The sword and shield are now reduced to little more than symbols of the household, but they stay in what is the most honored spot in the house. At large gatherings men use a sword and shield in solitary dances, and swords are used occasionally in the ritual sacrifice of animals; but otherwise they rest idly in their place on the back wall. On certain occasions the householder places a few piles of rice on the floor in front of them, and pours rice beer over the rice, as an offering to the gods and spirits, before the guests take their share.' <sup id="cite_ref-1457" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1457">[1,457]</a></sup> It appears that bravery figures prominently in some folk-tales: 'In course of time, Khorengpa Khobinpa bravely dashed down to the subterranean and underwater regions, attacked one female warrior, named Ahning Mechik Salne Tehrak, mistaking her for Ahning Mahbitchi Chining Dokandi Chongmitchang Patdrang, and forcibly dragged her up to the terrestrial surface amidst triumphant shouts of victory. By this act of daring and bravery, he made a name for himself. He was hailed as a hero by his relations and fellow-warriors. He was spontaneously respected by all of the children of Misi Saljong.' <sup id="cite_ref-1458" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1458">[1,458]</a></sup> '“Such an extremely cowardly, sneaking, depraved imbecile like Dejan deserves no better fate than being carried off by a tiger even in the midst of a crowd. He was a man devoid of will-power, energy and courage; a man who completely lacked alertness, wariness, self-guard and presence of mind. He was mere chaff, a debased specimen of humanity. Under the stupor of alcoholic influence he used to brag lustily of himself; but he had not even the bravery to face a grasshoper. Beware. Be not like Dejan who is quite unworthy of our race, my children. Tigers are fond of devouring such a man as Dejan.

<dd><b>♠ respect for property ♣ present ♥</b> Burling claims that the only form of moralistic supernatural punishment among the A’chik was associated with property offenses: 'Not all supernatural beings are so uniformly malign as the biting mite. Most of the others, the “creating” mite as they are occasionally called, are more or less neutral if not positively friendly. They are a bit more remote from daily life, but harmony between men and these gods, as they can be appropriately called, must be maintained by several annual sacrifices. There is confusion among the Garos as to how many of these gods exist and how many names each one has, and it is quite impossible to decide whether two names stand for two different gods or for two aspects of the same god, since Garos describe them now in one way and now in the other.

<p><b>♠ Moralistic punishment by human religious agents ♣ absent ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. Roy provides a general description of the religious system: 'There are two faiths prevalent among the Garos: native and Christian. People who follow the traditional faith are known as Songsarek. Difference in religion has not brought any split in the population. The traditional world of the Garos includes a number of spirits who behave like human beings but have no shape. They are SALJONG, the spirit of sun and fertility; GAERA, the spirit of strength and the thunderbolt; SUSIME, the spirit of wealth. Propitiation for each is followed by the sacrifice of an animal and an offering of beer. A Christian Garo is supposed to avoid such practices. There are also ogres and biting spirits, called MITES.' <sup id="cite_ref-1461" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1461">[1,461]</a></sup> 'They believe that after death human beings and animals turn into spirits known as MEMANG ('ghosts'). Memang are considered counterparts of the human beings.' <sup id="cite_ref-1462" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1462">[1,462]</a></sup> The sources provide a general description of the duties of village priests: 'The priest in Garo religion is called Kamal. The office of the Kamal is not hereditary, nor is it restricted to any particular class.

More often than not, his duties are both onerous and unpleasant. For instance, he has to attend the side of the deceased for long hours together, reciting tedious funeral dirges. To top it all, his remuneration is paltry. In no way does the Kamal enjoy privileges which his fellow villagers do not share. Like the rest, the Kamal too, must work in the fields and raise his crops. Every village has its Kamal and he never seems to shirk his duties.' <sup id="cite_ref-1464" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1464">[1,464]</a></sup> 'A Garo priest in deciding what evil spirit is troubling a sick person, has recourse to one of the two methods of divination, namely, pongsi-nina and risal-nina.'  <sup id="cite_ref-1465" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1465">[1,465]</a></sup> 'A Garo religious practitioner is known as KAMAL.

He must work in the fields and grow his crops like the rest, and the only way in which his lot is different from that of his neighbours, is that he must devote his attention to the requirements of others, even at personal inconvenience.

These are rough and unhewn stones, set up on the ground without any attempt for keeping in regular position and seldom more than three feet high. The sacrificial stone is cleansed once in a year with the blood of cow, dog, fowl or any other animal. It is important that all the members of the village should participate in this activity. No outsider is allowed to enter or go out of the village at the time of this celebration. If anybody violates this, he or she can be forced to pay any amount of dai. It may be a one-day or two-day affair depending on the size of the feasts they arrange. The nokma of the village has all the rights and obligations in organising the feasts. The blood of the sacrificed animal is offered to the stones and while doing so all the villagers are expected to take part in the worship of their mite. They have to pray to this mite to keep the village safe and sound from the enemies, diseases and also wild animals. The annual celebration of the stone is called as A’songtata. A priest in place of nokma can officiate at this sacrifice but it is for the nokma to provide or sanction it. No person has the right to perform A’songtata without the sanction from the nokma. If anybody does this, it would not only be an usurpation of nokma’s authority but would be tantamount to asserting himself as nokma and such person would be liable to pay heavy dai.' <sup id="cite_ref-1469" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1469">[1,469]</a></sup> Spirits were thought to cause illness, sometimes for taboo violations, and priests performed sacrifices to ameliorate misfortune: 'The Garos believe that the ailments come to people because of the devil’s wrath upon them and cure lies in propitiation of the devil and invocation of aids of the gods. The rites performed to scare away the devil from the person of the ailing one after invocation of the mercy of the gods are known by the term atela, pronounced atthela. Nobody has ever seen the devil or spirits and ghosts and gods but the priest performing the rites for the person ailing utters words like karkami, chumime, dakgipa and rabuga etc. When a member of a family falls ill and does not come round even after a long time after using of indigenous herbal drugs the family then prepares to worship the gods so that they may be pleased and with the aids of them the devil may be dispelled to cure the member from his ailments. To do this the family invites the wisest man of the locality; the wise man is known as kamal (pronounced kkhamal). The procedure is undergone [Page 18] during the morning time generally and is instituted outside the house of the sick. During the worship the patient is to remain with the kamal. Outside the house of the patient a place is neatly cleared and a bedi (a small elevation of earth) is constructed there; four banana trees (small) are planted around the bedi, one tree in each of the corners of the bedi; sometimes four small bamboo posts are also planted instead of banana trees. The entire place reserved for the purpose of such occasions is known as kiminda. On the bedi and within the four banana trees or bamboo posts a flat and round bamboo basket of the average size (commonly known as kula: winnowing fan) is placed on a banana leaf. A round basket ordinarily made of bamboo or cane and filled with rice is then placed on the kula. Feathers of fowls are planted in the rice contained in the basket and a fowl’s egg is kept within the feathers. The soul of the patient who is sitting beside the priest is supposed to be inside the egg during the times of worship. Besides these, boiled rice, meat and wine are offered in the kula to the gods invoked. Liquor is an essential article of offerings to the gods. The priest then wears a puggri planting some feathers of fowls within it and begins his works. He prays God and invokes the aid of all the gods to deliver the patient from the cluthes of diseases from which he or she suffers. The priest then gets a fowl, holds it before the patient, blows air from his mouth towards him or her wishing well of him or her and then sacrifices the fowl dissecting it by the neck. He puts marks of blood of the sacrificed fowl in the four banana trees or the bamboo posts around the bedi. The entrails of the fowl are then taken out by opening its inside and the banana trees or the posts are touched with them. After this a male goat is sacrificed before the kiminda. A boy would take the goat around the kiminda eight [Page 19] times, the priest giving a mild stroke on the back of it each time. The goat is then given a bath with water. The priest feeds the goat with some rice and spreads rice powders on its forehead and on the back, places it before the patient, blows air from his mouth towards him or her and invokes the aids of the gods to cure him or her. The animal is then placed near the kiminda; two persons would come forward, one pulls it forward with a rope while the other pulls it backward by the legs; in this position the animal is spread on a piece of the trunk of a plantain tree. The Matok or the Rangipa or the sacrificer dissects the animal in the neck with a stroke of a sword. If the Matok can cut the goat through its neck only with one stroke of his sword then the man is supposed to be deft in sacrificing animals before the gods and the gods are also supposed to be pleased with the family who institutes the process. If however, the animal is not disected with one stroke of the Matok’s sword then the Matok is not considered to be expert and the gods are also not taken to be propitiated. After the goat is sacrificed thus before the kiminda, its meats are cooked and distributed with rice amongst the persons witnessing the occasion. All the persons then enter into the house of the sick person and join in a sumptuous feast. Beefs and porks are also served in the feast when the family can afford to manage them. Wine or home brewed liquor must always be served to the guests; without some liquor no feast or merry-making can be complete. The feast being over a dance performance is given. Dance is an integral part of these institutions. The Matok or the sacrificer is the first man to begin the dance; he performs his dance with his sacrificing sword in one hand while taking a wooden shield in the other. The shield is carved in a convenient pattern and is sometimes coloured; it is called spi by the Garos. [Page 20] While the Matok goes on dancing some others keep time by beating drums, playing on flutes and pipes and also with ringing or gongs or bells. The Garo drums and all other instruments are of peculiar patterns; the drums are big and long, flutes are made of bamboo and are sometimes more than four feet long each. After the Matok, the kamal or the priest gives a dance performance and after him others follow in turn. During the dance performances drinking is indulged in freely. The entire quantity of liquor that the family of the sick man can afford to offer would be finished during the day but if the quantity is very big dancing goes on during the night also till the liquors are exhausted.' <sup id="cite_ref-1470" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1470">[1,470]</a></sup> While priests performed sacrifices to prevent supernatural sanctions by spirits, it appears that neither the sanctions nor the sacrifices were of a moralistic character: 'No suggestion is made that a man’s behavior in this world affects his later destiny. Spirits and gods are amoral, and punishment for wrong behavior comes in this world or not at all. One treats the spirits and gods with respect and circumspection because they can cause sickness and crop failure, but they do not send these as punishment for immoral behavior. Morality has a more pragmatic basis. Nothing is wrong unless it hurts someone else, and one may expect that the other person and his family will take action against the wrongdoer. One need not wait for punishment from the gods.' <sup id="cite_ref-1471" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1471">[1,471]</a></sup>

They are empowered to deal with all minor matters and settle unimportant disputes. They do this by calling together meetings of villagers, in which they sit as presidents and give final decisions. Their powers do not exceed those of inflicting fines and awarding compensation to injured parties. This is but an adaptation of the ancient usages of the people, for in former times, the village met in conference to decide any matter in dispute between its members. When in these meetings evidence could not be adduced, recourse was, and is yet had to trial by ordeal. This is of two kinds, the  s˘il-s[unknown]o °a, or ordeal of hot iron, and the  ch[unknown]okéla-s[unknown]o °a, or ordeal of boiling water.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1474" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1474">[1,474]</a></sup> ‘The Garo system of trial of cases beings with earth-taking. The complainant and the accused both swear by taking a lump of soil in their hands in front of the gathering with a promise that they will state the truth and nothing but the truth. It is believed by some Garos that this is the origin of the word “A’chik”, others believed that they have been called the A’chiks as they inhabited the high undulating land.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1475" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1475">[1,475]</a></sup> 'One type of ordeal required the two opponents to dive under water, the last to come up thereby demonstrating his veracity. In another, boiling water was poured over the arm of the accused person; if it burned him, he was shown to be guilty. Other procedures had the same purpose, though they did not involve tests of personal strength. A favorite method was to heat a carefully measured amount of water with a carefully measured amount of wood. If the water boiled over, the accused man was shown to be indeed guilty. At other times, a chicken was tied outside at night. If it survived the night without being taken by a wild animal, the accused was shown to be innocent. In every case, the result was to show clearly that one person or [Page 254] the other was in the wrong. Most people accepted the outcome, compensations were paid, and the cases were settled. I was told of many cases in which even the man shown to be guilty admitted his guilt after the outcome of an ordeal. Sometimes a man would continue to protest his innocence, but it did him little good since even his relatives were by that time convinced that he was lying. In any case a compensation would have to be paid, and the dispute should then be at an end.' <sup id="cite_ref-1476" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1476">[1,476]</a></sup> Incest was also punishable by ordeal: 'The a’krom ordeal was another dangerous method. A spot where once a man had been killed by a tiger was called a’krom and Garos never dared to go near it. For the most serious offence like incest, the village elders took recourse to a’krom ordeal. The man was ordered to lie down at that spot for the night and if he was found alive without injury the next day, his innocence was proved (Sangma, Milton. 1982, p. 98).' <sup id="cite_ref-1477" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1477">[1,477]</a></sup> Ordeals were abandoned in the colonial period: 'In this skeptical age, the teaching of missionaries and indirect exposure to new ideas from the rest of the world have destroyed the former faith in the reliability of these ordeals, and a new difficulty has arisen in the settlement of disputes. Today, when evidence is insufficient the case must simply be dismissed. This brings Garo practice into line with the Western belief that no man should be punished unless the evidence against him leaves no reasonable doubt of his guilt, but it also leaves cases dangling without final settlement. People may continue to believe in a person’s guilt but have no way of winding up an argument. While I was in Rengsanggri, a prominent member of the village was accused by his wife of having committed adultery with another woman of the village. They both denied it, and the case was eventually dismissed for lack of evidence. Villagers with whom I talked were privately convinced that the accusation was justified. In earlier years they probably could have extracted compensation from the accused man and his relatives, or at least they would have been able to test him by an ordeal. Today, evidence is presented more formally than before, and the intimate knowledge villagers have of one another is less likely to be taken into account in reaching a decision. Since ordeals are no longer possible, denial of guilt has become more attractive. In this case charging adultery, since it ended without a decision, hard feelings were created which were never mollified; and some villagers predicted that these people would continue their adulterous relationship at every opportunity.' <sup id="cite_ref-1478" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1478">[1,478]</a></sup> Offenses against life and limb were traditionally handled through vengeance ('an eye for an eye'): ‘The judicial authority of the Garo is based on the institution of  Nokma. Nokma looks after the village land as well as members of the village. The village judiciary system started with the  a’king Nokma or  Songni Nokma and the clan elders of that village.  Nokma took the leadership in all village activities and since he was supposed to be a warrior, he was not expected to hesitate to punish the guilty if he suspected  a foul play. In the past the Garo principle was ‘blood for blood, head for head’.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1479" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1479">[1,479]</a></sup> '“When a man of one clan murders a person belonging to a [Page 297] different community, the matter is arranged with more difficulty, and often produces a war, unless the chiefs mutually endeavour to reconcile matters, in which case their influence generally prevails; but they have no authority to declare peace or war, nor even in the field do they pretend to command any free man. If any man complains of an injury, such as one of his family having been murdered by a foreigner, the whole clan is ready to avenge his cause, or to fight until their companion is satisfied. No compulsion can be used; but the man who refuses to take the field would be entirely disgraced.”' <sup id="cite_ref-1480" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1480">[1,480]</a></sup> But community-sanctioned vengeance was discontinued in the colonial period, given the suppression of infighting by British punitive campaigns (see also information on warfare above): 'If peace was to be maintained, some method of settling disputes other than a resort to violence had to be established, and the new British administration was forced to guarantee the settlement of all legal cases, even petty ones. A dispute that could not be settled by traditional methods could not be allowed to lead to inter-village warfare. Inevitably the British government had to give some supervision to the settlement of trouble cases, and they had to provide a system of higher courts to which decisions that could not be settled at the village level could be appealed. They also, of course, had an interest in collecting taxes, and in building roads to allow for the development of the district. The solution to these needs was found in the system of loskorships with their petty courts at the lowest level, and the district courts above them to which their decisions could be appealed.' <sup id="cite_ref-1481" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1481">[1,481]</a></sup> Headmen and laskars were usually able to maintain the peace: '“The chiefs known as nokmas and the head men of families assemble in a council called jingma changga [which in modern Garo simply means “to assemble in a crowd”] and endeavor to reconcile all those of the clan who have disputes; for it would not appear that they have a right to inflict any punishment unless a man should be detected in uttering a falsehood before them, in which case he would be put to instant death, more from popular indignation than from a regular progress of justice. Dishonesty or stealing seem rarely to be practiced, and almost the only source of dispute seems to be murder, which would appear to be an ordinary crime. But the relations of the person killed are, by custom, held bound to demand blood for blood, and ought to put to death either the murderer or one of his kindred, or at least one of his slaves. The other family then is bound to pursue a similar mode of retaliation, and the feud would thus continue endless, unless the council interfered and brought about a mutual reconciliation, which it is usually able to effectuate, by inducing the parties to accept a price for the blood that has been split. Although every head of a family has an equal right to sit in their assemblies, the influence of the chiefs, or of one or two wise men usually decides everything.' <sup id="cite_ref-1482" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1482">[1,482]</a></sup></dd>

They established in Tura the office of Deputy Commissioner, which until the time of Indian independence was filled by a Britisher. Law courts were set up for the peaceful settlement of legal disputes, and though most of these were settled by Garo petty officials coming under the administration of the Deputy Commissioner, he himself sat as judge in the [Page 20] court of appeals. The government also undertook to build and maintain roads, to establish reserved forests, and to control trade and the markets. At first, education was left largely to the missionaries, but gradually the main responsibility for education has also been shifted to the government.' <sup id="cite_ref-1485" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1485">[1,485]</a></sup> 'For almost one hundred years there has existed in Assam a political division known as the Garo Hills District. Today its relation to the State of Assam and to the Indian nation are defined by the Indian constitution. The Deputy Commissioner’s office established by the British continues as the chief local arm of the state administration, supervising state schools, roads, and [Page 244] forests. Certain legal problems, including such major crimes as murder and treason, remain under the jurisdiction of its court. In the time of British rule the Deputy Commissioner was always British; since then he has been a plains Indian, usually a member of the Indian Civil Service. The constitution, however, provided for the establishment of a new District Council, to be composed of about twenty members elected from several constituencies into which the district was divided. This council elects from among its members a “chief executive member” just as the parliament in New Delhi chooses the national prime minister. Jurisdiction of Garo customary law was transferred to the District Council, and courts were established to judge disputes covered by this law. The collection of various taxes, including the important house tax, was likewise transferred, and the District Council began to build roads, to open schools, and to administer forests. In 1956, the jurisdictional boundaries between it and the Deputy Commissioner’s office had not yet become completely clear.' <sup id="cite_ref-1486" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1486">[1,486]</a></sup> Native petty officials mediated between local and colonial authorities: 'The loskor has several duties. He collects the house tax within his district, keeping a fixed portion of this as his own payment, and he organizes work parties to keep the roads open. His most important duty, however, is to supervise and try to settle legal disputes. The loskor sometimes appoints one or more assistants called sordars, to whom the District Council pays an annual stipend of 100 Rupees, together with a shirt and a pair of short pants. Saljing, who lived in Rengsanggri, was a sordar; but not every village had one, and a sordar does not have jurisdiction over a particular village. As a general assistant to the loskor he may assist in collecting information about a dispute, and in petty matters a sordar may sit as representative of the loskor and preside at a trial. The loskorship demands a large part of a man’s time, but a sordar spends most of his time working in his fields like his neighbors.' <sup id="cite_ref-1487" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1487">[1,487]</a></sup> 'In theory it is the loskor who, as presiding officer at a meeting to settle a dispute, passes judgment upon the rights and wrongs of the argument. Often the loskor is in no position to do more than guide the consensus of opinion among the men who meet, but he does put the government’s stamp of approval on the decision. He must act well within the bounds of customary law; but if the evidence is contradictory or unusually complex, the loskor may exert considerable influence toward the settlement of the dispute in one way or another. Today the loskors are powerful men. Any decision of the loskor may be appealed to the higher courts of the district, but the procedure of appeal is lengthy and expensive, and it is certainly more convenient to settle a case at the local level if that is possible. Decisions of both the District Council court and the Deputy Commissioner’s court can be appealed to the high court of Assam, though for most Garos the procedure is prohibitively expensive.' <sup id="cite_ref-1488" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1488">[1,488]</a></sup> 'Today the courts of the loskors are formally established under regulations passed by the District Council and approved by the governor of Assam; however, in 1956 Indian independence and the shift in jurisdiction over the loskors’ courts from the Deputy Commissioner’s office to the District Council were only beginning to have any effect on the villages in the district. Disputes were still settled in the same manner as during the period of British rule.' <sup id="cite_ref-1489" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1489">[1,489]</a></sup> Laskars were thus able to accumulate power at the expense of Nokmas: 'There is no evidence that the British administration was anything but completely sincere in its effort to settle disputes according to traditional Garo law. The loskors have always been Garos, and their job has always been explicitly defined as the administration of customary law according to traditional practice. Even in the district courts, which have generally been presided over by non-Garos, an attempt has been made to [Page 301] apply traditional law. Old men, who were presumed to be knowledgeable in Garo tradition, have been called in to give their opinion, and in the records of cases in the District Council, references have occasionally been made to a published ethnological article on Garo law. However sincere the attempt to follow traditional laws, the imposition of neutral judicial officers, the guarantee of settlement by the district government, and the reservation of force by the government authorities, could not help but bring changes. The office of loskor appears gradually to have accumulated power, probably at the expense both of the nokmas and of the matrilineal descent groups. This does not mean that the latter are no longer significant institutions, but only that their relative importance has probably declined somewhat as that of the loskor has risen. Today the loskors and their courts, and the administration above them are so much a part of the Garo social organization that it is quite inaccurate to describe the Garos as forming anything but a dependent non-sovereign unit in a much larger society. Significant power over the Garos was for eighty years concentrated in London; with Indian independence, this power has been inherited by New Delhi.' <sup id="cite_ref-1490" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1490">[1,490]</a></sup> The colonial authorities made the presence of government officials at trials mandatory in most cases: 'Garos today often say that adjudication of disputes was formerly the nokma’s job, but it seems reasonable to suggest that disputes were more frequently settled by negotiation between kinship groups, with a less significant part played by any neutral party, and this seems to be implied by Hamilton, who mentions “headmen of families” and “wise men” in addition to the “chiefs” themselves. In most of the Garo area today, only the most petty cases are decided without the presence of a neutral representative of the government. Chondu told me of a time when he and some of his relatives met in order to settle a dispute which had arisen when some children had stolen a few eggs. They met without any governmental representative, but Chondu described the meeting in exactly the same terms used to describe court cases, and the relatives collected money for a compensation, just as they do in more serious matters.' <sup id="cite_ref-1491" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1491">[1,491]</a></sup> Burling describes the process of dispute resolution; compensation was typically paid by the party found to be in the wrong: 'The loskor, or whoever presides at the hearing of a case, must act within the limits of customary law since he usually has to rely upon the kinship groups of the principals in the case for enforcing his decisions. This obliges him to find a solution [Page 250] which both sides can accept. One of the most important obligations of members of a kinship group is to support each other in legal cases and to punish each other when guilty. In any serious quarrel which arises out of misbehaviour-such as divorce, theft, or false accusation-the two principals, each with their relatives, come together at a formal meeting such as that which considered Mingcheng’s behavior. This assembly constitutes the lowest Garo court, and its sessions are always described by the Garos as consisting of a meeting between two opposing groups of relatives who are seen as representing the principals. They defend and look out for the interests of their protégé if his rights have been infringed upon, and they are considered to be collectively responsible for any improper act of which he may be guilty. Specifically they are responsible for cash contributions toward the compensation that is given to redress any injury. Conversely, the relatives have the right, or even the duty, to punish him, by either a physical beating or a verbal denunciation or both. If a man behaves so badly that his relatives have to contribute their money to pay his compensation, he deserves to be punished by them. Relatives also share in any compensation that is received by an injured party, and thus gain recognition of the support which they have given. The money required for compensation is neither collected nor distributed in a systematic fashion, and sometimes after a trial in which compensation is given, different participants in a case give quite different guesses as to how much the various relatives gave or received. Garos were amused at my curiosity about these amounts, since even the closest relatives did not feel this was important enough to remember. One contributes in order to uphold his own and his family’s honor. It would be uncouth to calculate such a contribution too closely, but the contribution is the most explicit act of support that one can give to one’s kinsmen, and it certainly does a man’s reputation no harm to be known as a vigorous supporter of his relatives at trials.' <sup id="cite_ref-1492" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1492">[1,492]</a></sup> 'The greatest responsibility is held by the closely related [Page 251] members of the lineages of the principals to a dispute, but the precise range of relatives is ill-defined and varies from case to case. More people will assemble to deal with a serious case than with a petty one. Relatives who live near by, and especially those living in the village of the principals, are more likely to assemble than those from elsewhere. Finally, while lineage mates are more likely to assemble than others, close relatives of other lineages also join them. A father will be considered on the side of his son, for instance, even though he is not his lineage mate. A father may even contribute to the compensation his son pays, or share in what he receives, though a father never takes part in beating or publicly denouncing his son.' <sup id="cite_ref-1493" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1493">[1,493]</a></sup> 'The group that supports a disputant might be briefly characterized as a matrilineally skewed kindred, since all relatives can take part, but those related to one in the matrilineal direction are more likely to do so than others. The degree of relationship out to which kinsmen feel responsibility is in no way fixed, but depends upon the seriousness of the case and upon the availability or absence of other more closely related kinsmen who might more appropriately take charge. Since the lineages never split up in a precise manner, no boundaries can neatly distinguish those responsible from those who are not. Responsibility simply grows weaker as one becomes less closely related.' <sup id="cite_ref-1494" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1494">[1,494]</a></sup> 'Criminal law as such does not exist for the Garos, since a suit is always brought by a private party, even though a government official supervises the court. But while all trials are seen as disputes between two opposing kinship groups, people at most ordinary trials do not obstinately back up their own relative and refuse to consider the opposite side. Quite the reverse is in fact the case. When it is evident that one’s own relative is at fault, one does not try to minimize this fact; rather, by arranging compensation with dispatch and by vigorously punishing the culprit, one demonstrates to the other side and to the public at large that here is a group of men who know their responsibilities and are willing to live up to them. The actual tenor of [Page 252] the trials I attended was a firm intention to reach a consensus as to what action should be taken. There were well-defined procedures to be followed, and usually there was little question of fixing guilt since people knew each other’s characters so intimately. Most cases could be disposed of by arranging compensation, which was set according to reasonably fixed standards. Members of the two “opposing” sides show no animosity toward each other, and never exhibit an unreasonable disposition to back up a relative at the expense of their reputation as reasonable and law-abiding citizens.' <sup id="cite_ref-1495" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1495">[1,495]</a></sup> 'Ideally, and usually in practice as well, the compensation should end the dispute and clear the air. To pay compensation is to acknowledge guilt formally, and grant satisfaction to the other side. Afterward everyone should return to normal life, and not nurse injured feelings. The explicit purpose of the trial is to pacify people, to soothe their damaged reputations, or to compensate them for any loss. Every effort is made to find a solution which will be accepted so firmly by all sides that bickering will be avoided. Of course, not everyone is always satisfied. People sometimes feel that justice has miscarried and go away from a trial discontented; but ideally this should not happen, and usually there is enough agreement so that a man who feels unfairly treated will have little sympathy from his relatives and little choice but to accept the public consensus. Garo law has little in the way of moral overtone. Unlawful acts are felt to be wrong because they hurt some particular person, not because they violate an abstract moral precept. The injured party has legal means of redressing such an action, and Garos are more apt to cite the danger of legal action than abstract principles when explaining why some behavior must not be indulged in.' <sup id="cite_ref-1496" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1496">[1,496]</a></sup> 'Since most legal cases begin with an accusation, either the accuser or the accused should eventually be found in the wrong. This neat device undoubtedly helps limit the amount of litigation. Garos are not free with their accusations, or at least not with public ones. The rule, however, has one serious defect. In some cases the evidence is simply not sufficient to decide whether the accuser or the accused is in the wrong. Until a generation or two ago arguments of this sort were resolved by resorting to ordeals, but ordeals are no longer practiced, and Garos say that people no longer believe in them. Many people still living remember them well and described them to me clearly.' <sup id="cite_ref-1497" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1497">[1,497]</a></sup> Most disputes revolved around land titles: 'No disputes arouse as much heat or go on so interminably as those over land titles. Since the period of British rule the government has attempted to record land titles at the district headquarters, but the distribution of the titles is extremely complex in practice and the records have tended to imply a simplified system of rights. Moreover, writing them down introduces into the system an inflexibility which is not found in the actual feelings of Garos about their rules. For each village or village cluster the district government recognizes a single nokma who is regarded as having title to the land of those villages. Sketch maps record the village boundaries, and the government confirms inheritance of the title by the nokma’s heir. It is also recognized that titles can be sold, though the courts seem to have been quite consistent in demanding general agreement among the villagers before a sale of land is recognized. That is, though he holds title, no nokma has been able to sell land to another village without permission. There are occasional legal disputes over the nokmaship, which are seen primarily as disputes over title to the village land. If the choice of the nokma’s heir proceeds according to the normal rule, then there can be no question about legitimacy; but complicating [Page 268] factors can arise. In one village the nokma’s first wife died, and he was given a replacement. Many years later the nokma died, and a dispute arose as to whether the replacement wife or the only daughter of the first wife should be entitled to the land. The rules for inheritance of personal property are not entirely clear in such a case, and disposition depends upon the decision of the family as to the next heiress. This particular case was decided by the district court on the reasonable basis that the land title was not entirely personal property but that the villagers had a voice in choosing the title-holder. The court concluded that the villagers preferred the replacement wife to the daughter.' <sup id="cite_ref-1498" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1498">[1,498]</a></sup> 'These rather complex disputes over inheritance are unusual. More often, the nokmaship passes without ambiguity to a man’s heir. Similar ambiguities could arise over inheritance of personal property, but where traditional shifting agriculture is practiced this is simply not valuable enough to make a dispute worthwhile, and families are able to make amicable settlements without going to court. Only the nokmaship and land titles are really worth quarreling over.' <sup id="cite_ref-1499" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1499">[1,499]</a></sup> Offences against the ritual privileges of headmen were subject to fines: 'In every big Garo village there are sacrificial stones called kosi at the entrance of the village. These are rough and unhewn stones, set up on the ground without any attempt for keeping in regular position and seldom more than three feet high. The sacrificial stone is cleansed once in a year with the blood of cow, dog, fowl or any other animal. It is important that all the members of the village should participate in this activity. No outsider is allowed to enter or go out of the village at the time of this celebration. If anybody violates this, he or she can be forced to pay any amount of dai. It may be a one-day or two-day affair depending on the size of the feasts they arrange. The nokma of the village has all the rights and obligations in organising the feasts. The blood of the sacrificed animal is offered to the stones and while doing so all the villagers are expected to take part in the worship of their mite. They have to pray to this mite to keep the village safe and sound from the enemies, diseases and also wild animals. The annual celebration of the stone is called as A’songtata. A priest in place of nokma can officiate at this sacrifice but it is for the nokma to provide or sanction it. No person has the right to perform A’songtata without the sanction from the nokma. If anybody does this, it would not only be an usurpation of nokma’s authority but would be tantamount to asserting himself as nokma and such person would be liable to pay heavy dai.' <sup id="cite_ref-1500" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1500">[1,500]</a></sup> The same was true of adultery: 'Exclusive sexual right over each other is regarded as the prerogative of a married couple. Thus, adultery is considered as a breach of this privilege and the offender is to pay a compensation to the aggrieved partner. Not only the commission of the sexual act, but any sexual advance is considered as tantamount to this breach of privilege. This idea of sexual relationship between married couples has given rise to the fact that sexual relations between unmarried youths are not regarded with the same seriousness as in the case of adultery. Young people quite often indulge in sexual intercourse which may or may not culminate in a permanent union. Such occurrences are not looked upon as very serious until pregnancy follows and the illegitimate child (known in Garo language as de-burung, the child of the jungle) becomes a liability to the parents or the guardians of the woman involved. No great social stigma is attached to a woman having a de-burung, and she is normally accepted as a wife. Sexual intercourse between unmarried men and women, though socially disapproved, is not regarded as a social offence nor as a sin to be punished by supernatural agencies. An illegitimate child does not suffer from social stigma throughout life, provided the physiological parents belong to marriageable clan groups.' <sup id="cite_ref-1501" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1501">[1,501]</a></sup> We have assumed that fines were fully monetized during the colonial period.</dd>

<p><b>State Intervention in Economy</b>
</p>
<dl><dd> <b>♠ The state regulates banking ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Note: Most of the population relied on subsistence agriculture: ‘Traditionally, the Garos living in the hills subsist by slash-and-burn cultivation. The iron hoe, chopper, and wooden digging stick are essential appliances. Human labor continue to be the principal source of energy. Very often in some areas a plot allotted to a family remains under-used because of an insufficient number of workers and the low level of technology. To survive the erratic nature of monsoons, mixed crops--both wet and dry varieties--are planted. A shifting cultivator plants a wide assortment of crops consisting of rice (mainly dry varieties), millet, maize and many root crops, vegetables, etc. In addition to these, cotton, ginger, and chili peppers are commonly raised as cash crops. All crops are harvested in October. At present the available strips of low and flat land lying between the hillocks or hills are used for permanent wet cultivation. The variety of crops cultivated is like that of the neighboring plains peoples. Such lands are owned individually. Additional production from such plots places the villagers in a better economic condition. The expansion of the modern economy and the steady increase of population are causing constant pressure on traditionally-worked plots. The same plot is used almost continuously in some areas thus leading to the decline in annual production. This trend is evident from the 1981 census report, which estimates that about 50 percent of the Garo people are now solely dependent on shifting cultivation and the rest use a part of a jhum plot permanently for areca nut, oranges, tea (on a small scale), pineapples, etc. In this changing situation a producer may not always be a consumer; and reciprocity and cooperation do not exist as a dominant force in the socioeconomic life of this population.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1502" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1502">[1,502]</a></sup> ‘The division of labor between members of the household is as follows: the males are responsible for clearing jungle and setting fire to the debris for shifting cultivation, while women are responsible for planting, weeding and harvesting.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1503" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1503">[1,503]</a></sup> There was some trade based on cash crops: 'A few centuries ago the Garos were famous for headhunting. That practice constrained the neighboring population of the plains from entering the hills. But people must exchange their produce to meet their requirements, and both hill and plains Garos needed such trade. Hence some trade started at border points on a very limited scale. Over time, these contacts grew into organized HUTTA (weekly markets) under the initiative of the Zamindars, who were subjects of the Muslim ruler. Initially cotton was exchanged in silent barter for pigs, cattle, goat, tobacco and metallic tools. This trade has continued to the present, with increasing involvement of peoples from the neighboring areas, and has now become fully monetized. Cotton, ginger and, dried chilies produced by the Garos are sold to the traders. The Garos in turn purchase pottery, metallic tools, and other industrial goods such as cloth from the traders.' <sup id="cite_ref-1504" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1504">[1,504]</a></sup>  Roy mentions commercial pottery and weaving: 'Each family in a traditional context acts as a self-contained economic unit. Modernization has brought some changes in the socioeconomic sphere of this population. The Garos residing in the hills did not weave cloth a few decades back; they used to procure thick cloth known as KANCHA from the plains Garos. Now that the loom has been introduced in the hill areas, they weave DOKMANDE (a kind of cloth) for commercial purposes as well as for their personal use. Previously each family used to make pottery for its domestic use, nowadays the art is confined to a few families only who either sell or barter it.' <sup id="cite_ref-1505" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1505">[1,505]</a></sup> Writing in the post-independence period, Majumdar describes agricultural labour in permanent cultivation: 'The household is the working unit in permanent cultivation also. Some of the households of Wajadagiri engage agricultural labourers for the whole agricultural season, whose day to day expenditures are borne by the household concerned and a remuneration of 12 to 15 maunds of paddy (the rate prevailing in 1965) is to be given at the end of the winter harvest. This remuneration is paid even though the person engaged is related to the husband or to the wife. The person who is thus engaged is known as chaparikgipa, and he is expected to help in all agricultural activities. Additional labour required at the time of transplantation is procured by the system of ajak and this happens to be the only feature which we find common in shifting cultivation of Matchakolgiri and permanent cultivation of Wajadagiri. However, in Matchakolgiri the system of ajak is not confined to agricultural activities only. It is used for getting labour for other purposes also, such as in constructing a house, in cutting of thatching grass, etc. But in non-agricultural activities usually only a meal is provided and no remuneration in cash or kind is given. Harvesting and thrashing are done with the help of annual agricultural labourers. At the time of winnowing, neighbouring villages help each other and the owner has to feed the helpers and sometimes provides one or two pitchers of beer.' <sup id="cite_ref-1506" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1506">[1,506]</a></sup> But his report also suggests the absence of occupational classes: ‘All the households of Wajadagiri are subsistence cultivators. Though some of the households can sell a part of their produce just after the harvest, there is no large scale farmer selling major portion of their produce for cash. There are no occupational groups in the village. Nor do they borrow the services of occupational groups from the plains. In this respect the contrast with the non-Garo population in the surrounding villages is interesting. The Koch and the Hajong of the neighbouring areas utilize the services of barbers from the plains, who are annualy remunerated  by giving a fixed quantity of paddy by each household. However, some of the Wajadagiri people, who can manage a small sum of money, occasionally do a little prospective business of cash crops. But nobody has yet taken up trading as a wholetime occupation.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1507" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1507">[1,507]</a></sup> ‘No occupational classes have developed in the village. Individuals and households change over from one occupation to another. One household occasionally deals in dry fish. Three of the households possess some permanent agricultural lands in the plains areas. Though the owners do not cultivate these lands themselves, they get their lands cultivated on share-crop basis and bring the owner’s half of the yield to the village for consumption.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1508" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1508">[1,508]</a></sup> Monetization and formal law were introduced by colonial administrators. This process could be patchy and uneven at times. Accordingly, the below material may not apply to all A’chik villages at all times.******According to SCCS variable 17 'Money (Media of Exchange) and Credit' is coded as 'Foreign coinage or paper currency'. According to SCCS variable 18 'Credit Source' is coded 'External money lending specialists', not 'Personal loans between friends or relatives', 'Internal money lending specialists', or 'Banks or comparable institutions'. Money was introduced in the colonial period: 'One of the significant economic transition brought about by the development of markets in Garo Hills is the gradual change over from barter to money economy. However, the change over [Page 113] was not very swift and sudden. Even in the earlier days of the Company rule, when the markets were developed in Garo Hills and the Garo economy was being opened up to the outside world, most of the exchanges were conducted on the basis of barter. Essential commodities were purchased by the Garos in the markets in exchange mainly of cotton produced by them. In such deals, the Garos were always the losers as the rate of exchange never reflected the relative scarcities of the commodities. And as a result, the value of cotton exchanged far exceeded the amount of the goods purchased by them. However, even during those days, money was gradually being introduced as medium of exchange. In those markets, a large balance arising out of the deals, was paid in ‘Naryani Rupees’ (currency issued by Kochbehar kings) and also in Mughal currencies. As these currencies were of higher value, for small purchases cowries were used and later on pice and rupees issued by the Company government began to be used for medium of exchange. Subsequently, in 1938, the British Government introduced and circulated their own currency in all the weekly markets of Garo Hills. Introduction of money in the hats gradually ushered in the money economy in the whole of Garo Hills and the dependence on the outside world also increased. The degree of monetisation increased with the increase in the receipt of cash income by the Garos, not only from the sale proceeds of a variety of local products, but also from the remunerative works done by the Garos like wage labour, services of all categories, contract works, etc. However, the degree of money economy was not uniform in all parts of the Garo hills. Nearness to money economy varies according to level of communication, proximity to town and sites of development works and also success or failure of shifting cultivation.' <sup id="cite_ref-1509" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1509">[1,509]</a></sup> Accordingly, barter trade was gradually displaced by monetized exchange. The coins and bank notes used were of Koch, colonial and national origin. ‘This shows how due to the adoption of permanent cultivation the cash income position from crop sales in Wajadagiri has improved.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1510" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1510">[1,510]</a></sup> Alam claims little investment on the part of cash croppers: ‘On the other hand, almost the entire money income, received by the local people from various sources, is mainly spent for consumption purposes on various types of consumption goods of daily use brought by the outside traders in the markets. As a result, the increasing money income of the people does not lead to higher saving and investment and development of industries to satisfy the needs of various consumer goods. It is only one way drainage of resources. Thus we have a picture of a colonial type of economy operating in Garo Hills through the markets. The district supplies its valuable native products at a relatively cheaper rate to the metropolitan businessmen or industrialists either for final consumption or for use as raw materials for various industries. On the other hand, the increase in money income in the district leads to greater demand for various consumer goods manufactured by the metropolitan industries. The local people pay higher prices for these goods. The markets also help in operating such colonial type economy, first by providing an outlet for supplying primary products, secondly, by changing the consumption habits of the people. Because of exhibition of ever new items of consumption brought to the market, new and sometimes artificial demands are created. Thus the increasing marginal propensity to consume has become a potent cause of resource drainage.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1511" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1511">[1,511]</a></sup> Momin writes about the introduction of banking schemes, but this may not apply to the colonial period: ‘Banking can play a very important role in any economic development effort. With the introduction of lead Bank scheme, bank branches have been opened in different blocks to cater to  the needs of the people and to extend banking facilities to the remote areas. This would help in tapping the idle resources in the rural sector and at the same time, provide credit facilities to the rural population. In 1986 there were as many as 34 bank branches with total deposit of Rs. 1,728 lakhs and total advances of Rs. 555 lakhs. For a small beginning it is a welcome sign. This can be increased with easy and simple formalities.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1512" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1512">[1,512]</a></sup> We are thus unsure about the presence of banking schemes in the colonial period.

<dd> <b>♠ Pensions ♣ absent ♥</b> Prior to colonization, the A’chik were not governed by a state structure. Clans and lineages exercised social control on the village and local levels: ‘In Garo society the most important social group is the clan known as MACHONG. A machong is an exogamous matrilineal descent group wherein a Garo is automatically assigned by birth to the unilineal group of his mother. A CHATCHI (moiety) is divided into many machong. Each married couple chooses one daughter--or, if they have none, they adopt a close relative of the mother--to be heiress (NAKNA DONQIPIKA MECHIK) of the family. Her husband traditionally is selected from the lineage group of the father and is accepted as the NOKROM of the house. He resides with his wife in her parents' house. He has to take on the responsibility of looking after his parents-in-law during their old age, and his wife inherits the property.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1515" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1515">[1,515]</a></sup> Local authority was exercised by lineage elders: ‘The authority within a lineage is exercised according to age, the older member always being allowed to direct and punish the younger members. The age differences are otherwise symbolized  in only one way-the order in which rice beer is served. When beer is first passed out at a gathering, the people should be served in order of formal seniority. A maternal uncle should be served before his nephew, and an older brother before a younger one. Even an older sister may precede a younger brother, though generally men and women do not drink together. [...] In spite of this formal deference, older people do not monopolize positions of power, and an old person cannot exercise authority outside his lineage simply because of his age. One defers to one’s lineage seniors, but not to old people in general.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1516" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1516">[1,516]</a></sup> Village headmen acted as intermediaries in local disputes: ‘Among the Garos most disputes arise over the issues of property, inheritance, and domestic quarrels within the family. Such problems are to a large extent settled by the MAHARI (lineage) of the offended and the offender. A new situation develops when someone's cattle cause damage to another's crops. Under such situation the NOKMA (village headman) acts as an intermediary only. If he fails to settle the dispute, the matter can go to the civil court of the district council.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1517" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1517">[1,517]</a></sup>  ‘Traditionally, the  nokma’s position was connected with the indigeneous customary rites. His temporal and ritual powers in a traditional society were linked with his position. The conversion of a  nokma to Christianity automatically led to the loss of his ritualistic role. When the  nokma’s were endowed with real temporal power, the resistance was great as  Nokmas were non-Christians. But when the  Nokma accepted Christianity,  nokmaship passed to another person who could act as a  nokma in performing rites and rituals. However, the Government still recognized the converted persons as  nokmas. This created dislocation in the traditional system, one looking after the customary right and other ritual responsibilities. As the author has tried to show that in the traditional system the two roles cannot be separated, the two roles are enmeshed into each other.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1518" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1518">[1,518]</a></sup> Nokmas also formally held titles to land: ‘In a Garo village very little difference of status is seen. A particular clan holds right of ownership of the village homestead and shifting cultivation lands, and the title of ownership is inherited by a particular household. The head of the land-owning household is known as the  nokma, and the particular area under which he holds ownership right is known as   a’king. He also acts as the religious head of the village, and he is to perform the ceremonies for the general well-being of the village. He is called upon to settle disputes between villagers. But in all his decisions he is guided by the elders of the village. He is not entitled to any tribute from the villagers, and he has no special paraphernalia to indicate himself as the  nokma. However, in the village a rich man gets respect, because in times of need people have to seek help from him. But in a Garo village it is usually very rare to find an extremely rich man. To a Garo wealth consists of a number of brass gongs called  rang and some ornaments made of silver or some such metal. Now-a-days a gun is also regarded as the status symbol of a wealthy man.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1519" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1519">[1,519]</a></sup> Formalization was largely absent from village councils and trials: ‘The Rules require the village court to “try all suits and cases in accordance with the customary laws of the village.” Village courts are supposed to be non-professional bodies and decide [minor, village-level] cases in an informal atmosphere without procedural technicalities and formalities.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1520" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1520">[1,520]</a></sup> During colonial rule, supralocal executive offices were superimposed onto village- and lineage-based A’chik structures: ‘When the Britishers took over the administration of this district, one witnessed an imposition of hierarchy of new political and administrative units in the district over the traditional democratic village set-up. The British Government, being actuated with the desire to have effective control over the villages and to facilitate the collection of revenues and house tax introduced the office of  laskar with limited police, civil and criminal powers. Accordingly there was a  laskar over a circle of villages; each having jurisdiction covering ten or twelve of villages. Although, the villagers were left to settle all disputes through the  nokma and the village courts, they had right to appeal to the court of  laskars against the decisions of the village councils.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1521" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1521">[1,521]</a></sup> ’In the same way the introduction of offices of  sardar, hill  mandal and hill  mauzadar curtailed the powers and authorities of the  nokmas and their village councils. The new offices were created for the effective administration over the Garo with  the idea of village self-government under the direct control of Deputy Commissioner at the centre.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1522" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1522">[1,522]</a></sup> Village headmen and elders were not bureaucrats, but mediated between village self-governance and colonial authorities: ‘Many of the disputes of the Garos were decided in their village  Panchayats. When a man has some complaints against another he reports them to the Nokma or the village-head. If the nature of the complaints is simple, the Nokma in a meeting of the few leading persons of the village, decides the dispute; but if the nature of the complaints is complicated and not easy of solution the Nokma reports the matter to the Laskar. The Laskar is a very important and influential man in the Garo Hills District. The hills areas are divided into some elekas and each of such elekas is placed under a Laskar for convenient collection of the house tax as well as for deciding the disputes of small nature locally. The Laskar need not essentially be a literate man, worldly prudence is enough for the management of his eleka. In practice a Laskar wields immense influence in his eleka.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1523" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1523">[1,523]</a></sup> The degree of professionalization differs according to administrative level, with full-time bureaucrats restricted to the higher ones. Judges employed at government courts and other top officials functioned on a higher administrative level than the native village councils and were solely dependent on the colonial or independent Indian district executive: ‘During the first few years of the British rule in Assam the district of Garo Hills was treated as a part of the Goalpara district. The whole tract was placed under a Civil Commissioner. This officer took into his hands the collection of rents claimed by the Zaminders from the Garos, and abolished the duties levied by them on the hill producers. For some years a policy of  non-interference was followed but without the desired success; so it was decided to appoint an officer-in-charge of the hills and in 1869 a.d. the Garo Hills were formed into a separate district with Tura as its headquarters. It is said in some parts of the district even now that the British administrators had to get away with many of the influential chiefs and other men of the tribe by killing them for, they could not easily bow down to the foreigners. Once this hills area was completely brouht undegr the control of the government, the Garos lived peacefully.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1524" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1524">[1,524]</a></sup> ‘The judicial officers (who preside over those courts) are appointed by, or with the approval of the Governor. The rules as to administration of justice do not contain specific provisions as to their tenure and salary, or as to their full time or part time character. But most of these matters will be regulated as rules or orders issued under Rule 15 of the Assam Autonomous Districts (Constitution of District Councils) Rules, 1951. It may be of interest to note that there is a specific prohibition against a member of the Executive Committee being appointed to these courts. To this extent, their independence is protected. A legal practitioner can appear before these courts. But in cases where an accused is not arrested, the legal practitioner takes the permission of the District Council Court for such appearance.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1525" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1525">[1,525]</a></sup> Positions given to native petty officials were less formalized: ‘The  loskor has several duties. He collects the house tax within his district, keeping a fixed portion of this as his own payment, and he organizes work parties to keep the roads open. His most important duty, however, is to supervise and try to settle legal disputes. The  loskor sometimes appoints one or more assistants called  sordars, to whom the District Council pays an annual stipend of 100 Rupees, together with a shirt and a pair of short pants. Saljing, who lived in Rengsanggri, was a  sordar; but not every village had one, and a  sordar does not have jurisdiction over a particular village. As a general assistant to the  loskor he may assist in collecting information about a dispute, and in petty matters a  sordar may sit as representative of the  loskor and preside at a trial. The  loskorship demands a large part of a man’s time, but a  sordar spends most of his time working in his fields like his neighbors.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1526" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1526">[1,526]</a></sup> The material seems to indicate that native officials performed their duties on a part-time basis only. Appointed officials on the lower, less professionalized level received stipends or drew their wages from tax income. Lineage elders were appointed to colonial courts on a temporary basis, but only as advisers: ‘The District Council may, whenever it deems necessary, also nominate two or more local elders well conversant with the tribal usages and customary laws, to sit with the judicial officer of the court as a bench and may, by order, invest such bench with any of the powers conferred or conferrable by or under the rules for the trial of suits and cases based on the tribal usages and the tribal customary laws only.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1527" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1527">[1,527]</a></sup> While village headmen were acknowledged by the British administration, the imposition of appointed officials led to a loss of political power among Nokmas: ’In the same way the introduction of offices of  sardar, hill  mandal and hill  mauzadar curtailed the powers and authorities of the  nokmas and their village councils. The new offices were created for the effective administration over the Garo with  the idea of village self-government under the direct control of Deputy Commissioner at the centre.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1528" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1528">[1,528]</a></sup> ‘There was a move for retention of the old institution of  nokmaship which could not function with authority since the British administration had appointed the  laskars and  sardars for the smooth running of their administration from 1824 onwards. The  nokmas became only the clan chief and custodian of the clan land  a’king. The  nokma could not administer effectively as he used to do prior to the British administration in the district. The  nokmas were supposed to be well versed with their functions and duties in the villages. The British administration enforced the Rules of Administration of Justice in the Garo Hills both Civil and Police in 1937. These rules have been renewed again and again. They are in use till the present day. The head of the district administration was the Deputy Commissioner and his Assistants and it has never been changed.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1529" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1529">[1,529]</a></sup> While laskars and sordars received stipends, we have assumed that they were not entitled to receive pensions from the colonial administration.</dd>

Nearness to money economy varies according to level of communication, proximity to town and sites of development works and also success or failure of shifting cultivation.' <sup id="cite_ref-1530" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1530">[1,530]</a></sup> Accordingly, barter trade was gradually displaced by monetized exchange. The coins and bank notes used were of Koch, colonial and national origin. ‘This shows how due to the adoption of permanent cultivation the cash income position from crop sales in Wajadagiri has improved.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1531" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1531">[1,531]</a></sup> We are unsure whether the variable applies the colonial administration, but have assumed so for the time being.

<dd> <b>♠ Public markets ♣ present ♥</b> According to Marak, plains markets were frequented by the A’chik even when raiding was still practiced: ‘They visited markets at bordering plains with their produce from the hills like raw cotton, chillies, ginger, wax, rubber, lac and other things to barter for essential items such as salt, dried fish and jewellery of all kinds and most important metal implements and weapons which they needed so desperately. In other words, to generate surplus they needed slaves. To get slaves they had to attack the plains or neighbouring villages. To win and capture slaves they needed to be strong and alert. Obviously in a situation like this economic strength promoted the physical strength.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1532" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1532">[1,532]</a></sup> Colonial administrators held jurisdiction over markets, but farmed out tax collection to locals: 'The markets are under the general jurisdiction of the District Council. The Council “sells” the right to collect certain taxes and fees to an individual whom the Garos speak of as the ‘owner’ of the market, though he has to renew his contract with the District Council each year. The ‘owner’ pays a fixed sum to the Council, and this provides an important source of revenue, as much as several thousand rupees from each market. The ‘owner’ has to ensure his profit by enforcing the collection of fees as rigidly as possible, and an able man can make a considerable profit in a year of market operations. The District Council fixes the legal fees. These are mostly levied on the seller of any merchandise, and may be determined by the quantity sold. Four annas, for instance, are charged to the seller of each maund of cotton that changes hands. In other cases each salesman is taxed regardless of what he sells; for example, each cloth merchant pays a fixed market fee of eight annas. Many Garos believe that unscrupulous market ‘owners’ charge more than the stipulated fees and thereby line their own pockets at the expense of the farmers who do not know the rules very well. I [Page 275] was told, for instance, that the proper tax on the sale of a cow is twelve annas, but that ‘owners’ sometimes manage to charge this fee to both the buyer and seller, thereby collecting twice the amount they are entitled to. The ‘owner’ has certain responsibilities in addition to paying a sum to the District Council. He must keep the sheds in repair, and must hire somebody to sweep up the debris after the people have left. The ‘owner’ of the Rongram market also had to hire several assistants to make the rounds and collect the taxes for him.' <sup id="cite_ref-1533" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1533">[1,533]</a></sup> Colonial and post-colonial administrators also restricted and regulated the sale of some goods: 'It is illegal to sell rice beer in the market place itself, and it is the existence of this regulation-even though some beer may be sold under cover-which gives the Rengsanggri women a favorable opportunity to do business. They have two favorite spots, one immediately adjacent to the village and one about a mile closer to the market, at the junction of two paths. Women from another village sometimes sell beer at this latter place also, but the Rengsanggri women always sit together, stirring their pots of the brew, and chatting gaily with each other and with the travelers who stop to rest and sometimes to have a drink.' <sup id="cite_ref-1534" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1534">[1,534]</a></sup> 'From very early times cotton has been the principal cash crop of the Garo. Alongwith this, Deccan Hemp (which is known as Goru or GaldaKosta) [Page 104] are the only cash crops of Matchakolgiri. Wajadagiri had, in addition, jute produced in their permanent plots. Moreover, Wajadagiri is fortunate to have one of he biggest cotton markets of the Garo Hills within easy reach. They sell their cotton at the Rom weekly market, which is situated about 7 miles away from the village. The Garo Hills District Council has made elaborate regulations for the buyers of cotton from the local producers. The main motive of these regulations is to protect the interest of the growers. The District Council appoints a number of representatives from the growers in all the cotton growing areas of the district. On market days, nobody is allowed to sell cotton before the price is fixed by the representatives with the cotton traders. The price is fixed by the bid system. The highest bid is usually accepted. Once the price is declared, no trader is allowed to purchase cotton at a price lower than that. Occasionally representatives of the Garo Hills District Cotton Growers’ Association visit the chief cotton markets to supervise sales of cotton. According to this procedure the growers should have obtained the maximum benefit from the sales. But this does not always materialize. Small Garo traders purchase cotton from villagers, either in the village or in the roads leading to the market place. They usually offer prices on the basis of last sales. They in turn sell it to cotton merchants at the rate fixed by growers’ representatives. Thus by investing their money for a day or two they reap the benefit. On the other hand, small growers cannot wait till the price is fixed, because they are always in a hurry to dispose of the merchandise, as they require ready cash to make purchases in the same market place.' <sup id="cite_ref-1535" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1535">[1,535]</a></sup> Burling describes some local markets: ‘Each of the markets in the Garo Hills is held on a particular day in the seven-day week. They are staggered to allow the traders to make the rounds of several markets, staying just one  day at each before moving on. The traders are plains men, mostly Bengalis. The Rengsanggri people deal primarily with two markets. The most important is the Friday market at Rongram, which is on the road about three miles from the village; but a few villagers always attend the Saturday market which is held in Tura, another nine miles along the road to the south. More rarely one or two men from Rengsanggri visit the market which is held at Garobadha, to the west of Tura. The Rongram market has been opened only since the partition of India, following which a new road was put through to Tura to avoid the threat of disrupted communications raised by the partition. Formerly most marketing was done in Tura, but the one at Rongram is more convenient and has become one of the most important markets of the Garo Hills. It draws people from all sides-particularly from the north and east, since in those directions there are no markets for many miles, while it has competition from Tura and Garobadha in the south and west. People are already streaming into the market area by Thursday afternoon, since the Friday market really begins then. Those who come from a great distance camp for the night in the market area and cook their supper at open fires from food that they bring with them. On Friday morning they are joined by many more people from the villages closer by. Garos walk in over the footpaths that crisscross the hills, and almost everybody carries a basket hung by a tump line from his forehead. Some carry goods to sell, others need the space to carry home their purchases, and everyone brings along a few personal possessions. Traders come by truck or by bus, bringing large burlapwrapped bundles of their wares. Activity in Rongram reaches a peak early Friday morning, when as many as three thousand people may be milling around the market; by noon, people are leaving again. Many go back to their villages, but most of the traders, and a few of the Garos, move up to Tura for the market the next day.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1536" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1536">[1,536]</a></sup> While regulations were present, we have assumed that the colonial-era markets can still be characterized as 'public markets'.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>♠ State enforcement ♣ present ♥</b> The colonial authorities established courts: 'The British reserved the use of force to themselves and their officials. They established in Tura the office of Deputy Commissioner, which until the time of Indian independence was filled by a Britisher. Law courts were set up for the peaceful settlement of legal disputes, and though most of these were settled by Garo petty officials coming under the administration of the Deputy Commissioner, he himself sat as judge in the [Page 20] court of appeals. The government also undertook to build and maintain roads, to establish reserved forests, and to control trade and the markets. At first, education was left largely to the missionaries, but gradually the main responsibility for education has also been shifted to the government.' <sup id="cite_ref-1537" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1537">[1,537]</a></sup> 'For almost one hundred years there has existed in Assam a political division known as the Garo Hills District. Today its relation to the State of Assam and to the Indian nation are defined by the Indian constitution. The Deputy Commissioner’s office established by the British continues as the chief local arm of the state administration, supervising state schools, roads, and [Page 244] forests. Certain legal problems, including such major crimes as murder and treason, remain under the jurisdiction of its court. In the time of British rule the Deputy Commissioner was always British; since then he has been a plains Indian, usually a member of the Indian Civil Service. The constitution, however, provided for the establishment of a new District Council, to be composed of about twenty members elected from several constituencies into which the district was divided. This council elects from among its members a “chief executive member” just as the parliament in New Delhi chooses the national prime minister. Jurisdiction of Garo customary law was transferred to the District Council, and courts were established to judge disputes covered by this law. The collection of various taxes, including the important house tax, was likewise transferred, and the District Council began to build roads, to open schools, and to administer forests. In 1956, the jurisdictional boundaries between it and the Deputy Commissioner’s office had not yet become completely clear.' <sup id="cite_ref-1538" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1538">[1,538]</a></sup> Native petty officials acted as intermediaries between informal local authority and the colonial administration: 'The loskor has several duties. He collects the house tax within his district, keeping a fixed portion of this as his own payment, and he organizes work parties to keep the roads open. His most important duty, however, is to supervise and try to settle legal disputes. The loskor sometimes appoints one or more assistants called sordars, to whom the District Council pays an annual stipend of 100 Rupees, together with a shirt and a pair of short pants. Saljing, who lived in Rengsanggri, was a sordar; but not every village had one, and a sordar does not have jurisdiction over a particular village. As a general assistant to the loskor he may assist in collecting information about a dispute, and in petty matters a sordar may sit as representative of the loskor and preside at a trial. The loskorship demands a large part of a man’s time, but a sordar spends most of his time working in his fields like his neighbors.' <sup id="cite_ref-1539" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1539">[1,539]</a></sup> 'In theory it is the loskor who, as presiding officer at a meeting to settle a dispute, passes judgment upon the rights and wrongs of the argument. Often the loskor is in no position to do more than guide the consensus of opinion among the men who meet, but he does put the government’s stamp of approval on the decision. He must act well within the bounds of customary law; but if the evidence is contradictory or unusually complex, the loskor may exert considerable influence toward the settlement of the dispute in one way or another. Today the loskors are powerful men. Any decision of the loskor may be appealed to the higher courts of the district, but the procedure of appeal is lengthy and expensive, and it is certainly more convenient to settle a case at the local level if that is possible. Decisions of both the District Council court and the Deputy Commissioner’s court can be appealed to the high court of Assam, though for most Garos the procedure is prohibitively expensive.' <sup id="cite_ref-1540" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1540">[1,540]</a></sup> Burling describes the process of dispute resolution: 'The loskor, or whoever presides at the hearing of a case, must act within the limits of customary law since he usually has to rely upon the kinship groups of the principals in the case for enforcing his decisions. This obliges him to find a solution [Page 250] which both sides can accept. One of the most important obligations of members of a kinship group is to support each other in legal cases and to punish each other when guilty. In any serious quarrel which arises out of misbehaviour-such as divorce, theft, or false accusation-the two principals, each with their relatives, come together at a formal meeting such as that which considered Mingcheng’s behavior. This assembly constitutes the lowest Garo court, and its sessions are always described by the Garos as consisting of a meeting between two opposing groups of relatives who are seen as representing the principals. They defend and look out for the interests of their protégé if his rights have been infringed upon, and they are considered to be collectively responsible for any improper act of which he may be guilty. Specifically they are responsible for cash contributions toward the compensation that is given to redress any injury. Conversely, the relatives have the right, or even the duty, to punish him, by either a physical beating or a verbal denunciation or both. If a man behaves so badly that his relatives have to contribute their money to pay his compensation, he deserves to be punished by them. Relatives also share in any compensation that is received by an injured party, and thus gain recognition of the support which they have given. The money required for compensation is neither collected nor distributed in a systematic fashion, and sometimes after a trial in which compensation is given, different participants in a case give quite different guesses as to how much the various relatives gave or received. Garos were amused at my curiosity about these amounts, since even the closest relatives did not feel this was important enough to remember. One contributes in order to uphold his own and his family’s honor. It would be uncouth to calculate such a contribution too closely, but the contribution is the most explicit act of support that one can give to one’s kinsmen, and it certainly does a man’s reputation no harm to be known as a vigorous supporter of his relatives at trials.' <sup id="cite_ref-1541" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1541">[1,541]</a></sup> 'The greatest responsibility is held by the closely related [Page 251] members of the lineages of the principals to a dispute, but the precise range of relatives is ill-defined and varies from case to case. More people will assemble to deal with a serious case than with a petty one. Relatives who live near by, and especially those living in the village of the principals, are more likely to assemble than those from elsewhere. Finally, while lineage mates are more likely to assemble than others, close relatives of other lineages also join them. A father will be considered on the side of his son, for instance, even though he is not his lineage mate. A father may even contribute to the compensation his son pays, or share in what he receives, though a father never takes part in beating or publicly denouncing his son.' <sup id="cite_ref-1542" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1542">[1,542]</a></sup> 'The group that supports a disputant might be briefly characterized as a matrilineally skewed kindred, since all relatives can take part, but those related to one in the matrilineal direction are more likely to do so than others. The degree of relationship out to which kinsmen feel responsibility is in no way fixed, but depends upon the seriousness of the case and upon the availability or absence of other more closely related kinsmen who might more appropriately take charge. Since the lineages never split up in a precise manner, no boundaries can neatly distinguish those responsible from those who are not. Responsibility simply grows weaker as one becomes less closely related.' <sup id="cite_ref-1543" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1543">[1,543]</a></sup> 'Criminal law as such does not exist for the Garos, since a suit is always brought by a private party, even though a government official supervises the court. But while all trials are seen as disputes between two opposing kinship groups, people at most ordinary trials do not obstinately back up their own relative and refuse to consider the opposite side. Quite the reverse is in fact the case. When it is evident that one’s own relative is at fault, one does not try to minimize this fact; rather, by arranging compensation with dispatch and by vigorously punishing the culprit, one demonstrates to the other side and to the public at large that here is a group of men who know their responsibilities and are willing to live up to them. The actual tenor of [Page 252] the trials I attended was a firm intention to reach a consensus as to what action should be taken. There were well-defined procedures to be followed, and usually there was little question of fixing guilt since people knew each other’s characters so intimately. Most cases could be disposed of by arranging compensation, which was set according to reasonably fixed standards. Members of the two “opposing” sides show no animosity toward each other, and never exhibit an unreasonable disposition to back up a relative at the expense of their reputation as reasonable and law-abiding citizens.' <sup id="cite_ref-1544" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1544">[1,544]</a></sup> 'Ideally, and usually in practice as well, the compensation should end the dispute and clear the air. To pay compensation is to acknowledge guilt formally, and grant satisfaction to the other side. Afterward everyone should return to normal life, and not nurse injured feelings. The explicit purpose of the trial is to pacify people, to soothe their damaged reputations, or to compensate them for any loss. Every effort is made to find a solution which will be accepted so firmly by all sides that bickering will be avoided. Of course, not everyone is always satisfied. People sometimes feel that justice has miscarried and go away from a trial discontented; but ideally this should not happen, and usually there is enough agreement so that a man who feels unfairly treated will have little sympathy from his relatives and little choice but to accept the public consensus. Garo law has little in the way of moral overtone. Unlawful acts are felt to be wrong because they hurt some particular person, not because they violate an abstract moral precept. The injured party has legal means of redressing such an action, and Garos are more apt to cite the danger of legal action than abstract principles when explaining why some behavior must not be indulged in.' <sup id="cite_ref-1545" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1545">[1,545]</a></sup> More difficult cases were referred to the colonial courts: 'The attitudes displayed in this case are typical of many more significant Garo court cases. The attempt is always to find a formula that will satisfy the honor of all the parties and restore peace to the community. Of course in more serious cases feelings run higher, and divergent points of view may not be so easily reconciled. Some complex cases are appealed to the district courts. Very rarely disputes may leave such bitterness that resolution can come only if some people move away permanently from their village and in the past some of these disputes undoubtedly led to war; but litigation does not usually end in such extremes. Most trials do lead to the settlement that they are designed to achieve.' <sup id="cite_ref-1546" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1546">[1,546]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>Burling describes the process of legal formalization: 'If peace was to be maintained, some method of settling disputes other than a resort to violence had to be established, and the new British administration was forced to guarantee the settlement of all legal cases, even petty ones. A dispute that could not be settled by traditional methods could not be allowed to lead to inter-village warfare. Inevitably the British government had to give some supervision to the settlement of trouble cases, and they had to provide a system of higher courts to which decisions that could not be settled at the village level could be appealed. They also, of course, had an interest in collecting taxes, and in building roads to allow for the development of the district. The solution to these needs was found in the system of loskorships with their petty courts at the lowest level, and the district courts above them to which their decisions could be appealed.' <sup id="cite_ref-1547" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1547">[1,547]</a></sup> 'There is no evidence that the British administration was anything but completely sincere in its effort to settle disputes according to traditional Garo law. The loskors have always been Garos, and their job has always been explicitly defined as the administration of customary law according to traditional practice. Even in the district courts, which have generally been presided over by non-Garos, an attempt has been made to [Page 301] apply traditional law. Old men, who were presumed to be knowledgeable in Garo tradition, have been called in to give their opinion, and in the records of cases in the District Council, references have occasionally been made to a published ethnological article on Garo law. However sincere the attempt to follow traditional laws, the imposition of neutral judicial officers, the guarantee of settlement by the district government, and the reservation of force by the government authorities, could not help but bring changes. The office of loskor appears gradually to have accumulated power, probably at the expense both of the nokmas and of the matrilineal descent groups. This does not mean that the latter are no longer significant institutions, but only that their relative importance has probably declined somewhat as that of the loskor has risen. Today the loskors and their courts, and the administration above them are so much a part of the Garo social organization that it is quite inaccurate to describe the Garos as forming anything but a dependent non-sovereign unit in a much larger society. Significant power over the Garos was for eighty years concentrated in London; with Indian independence, this power has been inherited by New Delhi.' <sup id="cite_ref-1548" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1548">[1,548]</a></sup> 'Today the courts of the loskors are formally established under regulations passed by the District Council and approved by the governor of Assam; however, in 1956 Indian independence and the shift in jurisdiction over the loskors’ courts from the Deputy Commissioner’s office to the District Council were only beginning to have any effect on the villages in the district. Disputes were still settled in the same manner as during the period of British rule.' <sup id="cite_ref-1549" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1549">[1,549]</a></sup> Land titles were the most common source of conflict: 'No disputes arouse as much heat or go on so interminably as those over land titles. Since the period of British rule the government has attempted to record land titles at the district headquarters, but the distribution of the titles is extremely complex in practice and the records have tended to imply a simplified system of rights. Moreover, writing them down introduces into the system an inflexibility which is not found in the actual feelings of Garos about their rules. For each village or village cluster the district government recognizes a single nokma who is regarded as having title to the land of those villages. Sketch maps record the village boundaries, and the government confirms inheritance of the title by the nokma’s heir. It is also recognized that titles can be sold, though the courts seem to have been quite consistent in demanding general agreement among the villagers before a sale of land is recognized. That is, though he holds title, no nokma has been able to sell land to another village without permission. There are occasional legal disputes over the nokmaship, which are seen primarily as disputes over title to the village land. If the choice of the nokma’s heir proceeds according to the normal rule, then there can be no question about legitimacy; but complicating [Page 268] factors can arise. In one village the nokma’s first wife died, and he was given a replacement. Many years later the nokma died, and a dispute arose as to whether the replacement wife or the only daughter of the first wife should be entitled to the land. The rules for inheritance of personal property are not entirely clear in such a case, and disposition depends upon the decision of the family as to the next heiress. This particular case was decided by the district court on the reasonable basis that the land title was not entirely personal property but that the villagers had a voice in choosing the title-holder. The court concluded that the villagers preferred the replacement wife to the daughter.' <sup id="cite_ref-1550" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1550">[1,550]</a></sup> 'These rather complex disputes over inheritance are unusual. More often, the nokmaship passes without ambiguity to a man’s heir. Similar ambiguities could arise over inheritance of personal property, but where traditional shifting agriculture is practiced this is simply not valuable enough to make a dispute worthwhile, and families are able to make amicable settlements without going to court. Only the nokmaship and land titles are really worth quarreling over.' <sup id="cite_ref-1551" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1551">[1,551]</a></sup> We have assumed that the legal transformations of the colonial period amount to the 'state enforcement' of contracts.

These are the village granaries, of which each family possesses one or more. The custom of building all the granaries in one place no doubt has its origin in the fact that the grain is thus in less danger of fire than if it were stored in the living houses. In many parts of the hills the grain is protected from the inroads of rats and other vermin by laying the floors of the granaries on posts, the tops of which are carved in the shape of a mushroom, so as to give the animals the least possible foothold.  The practice of placing these granaries at a distance from other houses has, however, its drawbacks, for it is no rare thing for an elephant to come round at night, and finding unguarded houses full of his favourite food, to pull one down and help himself to the contents.

<p><b>♠ Drinking water ♣ absent ♥</b> Villages relied on natural water sources: ‘Unlike other hill tribes, such as the Nagas and the Lushais, who build their villages high up on the slopes of hills, the Garos construct theirs in valleys or in depressions on the hillsides, close to running water. They attach great importance to pure water, and it is quite the exception for them to live at any distance from a good stream. The sites chosen for the houses are nevertheless generally steep, and the villages are rarely on flat ground.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1554" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1554">[1,554]</a></sup> Access to rivers was an important factor when choosing a site for a new village even in the post-independence period: ‘There are different sizes of village in the Garo Hills. I have seen small villages consisting of two or three huts, practically isolated from all the advantages of a big village. On the other hand, in a big village there may be as many as fifty or more huts. The size of the big village entirely depends on the space that is available for the house building and also the facilities the inhabitants of the village may derive for cultivation and other purposes from the surroundings of the locality. The largest village, I visited, was situated on the slopes of the hills, as is the usual practice, facing long strip of valley, nearly about a mile and a half long and about half a mile broad. It is easily understandable that people living in such villages take to plough and utilise the valley for agricultural purposes. It has, therefore, the advantage of accommodating larger people than it is possible for the village which is situated on the hill slopes and which is to depend primarily on  jhum cultivation as described hereafter. Usually, an average sized village contains ten to fifteen houses. The economic factor is one of the main guiding principles regarding the expansion of a village. Availability of arrable land or hillocks for jhum cultivation, good drinking water, facilities of conveyance and also facilities of market places are some of the main factors, which the Garos consider before they fix up a place to start a new village. The common practice is to have one house for one family consisting of husband, wife, and children. Occasionally, the old mother or the mother-in-law also stays in the family.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1555" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1555">[1,555]</a></sup> We have therefore assumed that drinking water facilities were not available in the colonial period.

<p><b>♠ Irrigation works ♣ absent ♥</b> 'The Garos may be roughly divided into Hill Garos and Plains Garos, and both classes inhabit the district which owes its name to the tribe.' <sup id="cite_ref-1556" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1556">[1,556]</a></sup> The primary subsistence strategy of the hill country was slash-and-burn/dry cultivation, whereas wet cultivation was practiced in the plains. Wet cultivation was only expanded in the colonial and post-independence periods: ‘Hill farmers seem to have had little opposition to the clearing of some land for wet rice, even though this has meant that it could no longer be used for dry cultivation. In most villages the areas in which wet cultivation is possible are more or less limited, it never yet having occurred to a Garo that hillsides  might be terraced; and the threat of alienation of the land has not yet seemed particularly serious. Strangers, and sometimes even non-Garos, have been allowed to settle and clear new land. At the present time the laws passed by the Garo Hills District Council in an effort to encourage wet rice cultivation provide that if local villagers do not take advantage of suitable land, others will have the right to convert it to paddy fields. In some cases new settlers have probably paid the  nokma or even the  a’king owners (title-holders) a fee to permit its use and alienation. Some might interpret this as  a’wil, the fee that is traditionally paid to the  a’king owner by non-villagers who wish to use dry fields, though ordinarily  a’wil confers only a temporary right. Others might interpret it as purchase price for the land; or, finally, it might be considered a bribe, since no such purchase is recognized as legal by the government. However regarded, such a fee might help to smooth over any antagonism toward the new arrival, though in practice it appears that the villagers have often failed to appreciate the value of potential paddy land and have let it go with little or no opposition.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1557" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1557">[1,557]</a></sup> The code reflects dry rather than wet cultivation. We have assumed this to be true of most of the colonial period.

<p><b>♠ Health infrastructure ♣ present ♥</b> Illness was traditionally treated by ritual specialists and midwives with knowledge of herbal medicines rather than within the framework of a public health infrastructure: 'They use a variety of herbal medicines for all sorts of ailments, and they claim to have herbal medicine for birth control also.' <sup id="cite_ref-1558" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1558">[1,558]</a></sup> 'A Garo religious practitioner is known as KAMAL. The word is used to mean 'specialist'; thus a midwife may be a kamal. A kamal has neither special privilege nor prestige from his service to the society.' <sup id="cite_ref-1559" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1559">[1,559]</a></sup> Sacrifices were offered to spirits in order to cure disease: 'Scattered about in non-Christian villages are decaying remains of old sacrificial altars, which must be built new each time a sacrifice is performed. Sacrifices occur on a number of [Page 22] special occasions throughout the year which mark important points in the agricultural cycle, but they are also performed irregularly as the main method of curing disease. Anything from an egg to a cow may be sacrificed according to the symptoms and seriousness of the complaint. Sacrifices provide an opportunity for the cooperation of a number of households, and they usually culminate with a meal at which the sacrificed animal is eaten. Posts erected in memory of the dead stand in front of many of the houses. Bamboo boxes filled with rice and bedecked with pots, baskets, and gourds may occasionally be seen; in these a few of the bones of the dead are kept between the cremation and the post-funeral ceremony.' <sup id="cite_ref-1560" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1560">[1,560]</a></sup> Illness was thought to be caused by spirit attacks: 'Their technological skills and knowledge enable the Garos to draw sustenance from the natural environment in which they live. They are also surrounded by a spiritual environment, and though the Garos are remarkably uncertain of its nature, they know that they must behave in appropriate ways toward it if disaster is not to overtake them. Other than me’mang (‘ghost’,) the Garos have only one general term, mite, for supernatural beings; but this covers both beings whom we would call gods and certain lesser, quite different nuisances, which hardly deserve to be known by any term more dignified than spirit. The latter, distinguished from the gods as “the mite that bite,” are numerous and ubiquitous, and when they bite they cause disease. Beyond this, little is concretely known about the mite, [Page 55] and the usual response to a request to describe them more fully is “We don’t know what they look like because we can’t see them. What do you think about them?” Garos were puzzled, for instance, by the question of whether the spirits were male or female. Such questions simply do not arise, and in the Garo language it is possible to talk about a spirit without being forced to choose a third person pronoun indicative of gender. There is no question but that they cause disease, however, and just enough is known of their habits, even if not of their appearance, to allow such action to be taken against them that they will be persuaded to stop biting and permit the sick person to recover. The symptoms of the disease indicate which spirit is causing it, thus allowing those concerned to choose the proper kind of sacrifice. Any Garo can name a few mite, along with the disease that each produces, the place where it lives-or at any rate the place in which the sacrifice to it should be performed-and the manner of the sacrifice. A few men who are more interested or skilled in these matters can give dozens of names. Susume mite, for instance, causes alternate chills and fever, a frequent complaint in this malarial country, and to drive it away an altar of bamboo and leaves must be built in the yard in front of the house. A pig or chicken is sacrificed at this altar, and the animal is eaten. When a spirit known as but causes an attack of dysentery, a small boat is built of bamboo, dabbed with the blood of a sacrificial animal, and floated down the river; and the spirit is supposed to follow it. Other mite are held responsible for paleness, lassitude, skin diseases, and all the other aches and pains which plague the Garos. Each can be pacified with a special form of sacrifice.' <sup id="cite_ref-1561" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1561">[1,561]</a></sup> 'These mite live in many places. Some dwell in the village, others in the jungle, near a tree, or by a stream or waterfall. A fork in a road is a favorite place, and powerful mite are said to live on mountain tops. All are dealt with in the same general fashion, though the details of the sacrifices differ. Several men usually spend about two hours building an altar. Most altars [Page 56] are built of bamboo and leaves, but the precise form depends upon the particular spirit to whom the sacrifice is to be directed. Once the altar is built, a ritually skilled man must offer an egg, a chicken, a pig, or even a cow, depending upon the seriousness of the disease and the demands of the mite. This priest kills the animal in a ritually prescribed manner, and smears the blood on to the altar. He recites a number of chants while standing or squatting before the altar, and usually pours a bit of rice beer on to the ground as an additional offering. At a sacrifice to cure disease, as on other occasions when animals are ceremoniously killed, the priest inspects their viscera for omens. If the proper portion of a chicken’s intestines prove to be filled, for instance, the prognosis is good; otherwise it is bad. While the priest is performing the ritual, the men who have helped build the altar sit around, chatting and joking, with no outward signs of respect or attention. There is no ecstasy and no sleight of hand, and the sick person is not even necessarily present. When the formalities are completed, the helpers prepare the animal and cook it into a curry. Rice is boiled, and all of the helpers share in the ensuing meal. Typically, the entire sacrifice, from the time the participants first assemble to the time they finish the feast, takes three or four hours. Afterward the participants go to their own houses. They are not supposed to go to their fields for the whole day, though they may do chores about the house. Sacrifices of this sort are the commonest kind of ceremony performed by the people of Rengsanggri. They involve only a half dozen or so neighbors and relatives, and they are held whenever the need arises. Occasionally two or three may even be held on the same day if several people in the village are sick. Altogether several hundred sacrifices are likely to be performed in the village of Rengsanggri in a single year.' <sup id="cite_ref-1562" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1562">[1,562]</a></sup> 'Sacrifices are usually quite effective, for within a few days people usually feel much better and are able to go back to work. Some spirits are more stubborn, however, and may demand a larger animal, or sometimes developing symptoms may show [Page 57] that a mistake had been made about the identity of the biter, and so another sacrifice must be performed to a different spirit. If the village should have an unusual number of sick people, more dramatic procedures may be tried. The men of the village may all cooperate by going to the jungle and attempting to catch a monkey. They are not experts at this and the monkeys are elusive, but by surrounding the animals, using sticks, stones, and sometimes even a gun, they may be able to get one or more. These, if not killed in capture, are soon dispatched, for they bite too much to be carried back alive. While the women closet themselves at home behind closed doors, the men drag the monkey systematically around the village, pausing before each house, and then suspend it from a pole near a river, in the hope that the spirits will leave them alone for a while. Of course, in spite of all efforts some people die. Some spirits are simply too strong, and kill their victims no matter what efforts are made to drive them away. Garos realize that even the best of their sacrifices cannot dissuade them.' <sup id="cite_ref-1563" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1563">[1,563]</a></sup> Ill people were cared for within the household: 'One other explicit duty of household members toward one another, not unlike the care of the aged, is care of the sick. A frequent reason given for desiring marriage is to ensure care during times of illness. Husband and wife are expected to look after each other, and husbands even cook for their sick wives. [Page 136] If illness becomes serious, then neighbors and more distant relatives are called in to help with the necessary sacrifices, and relatives other than immediate members of the household occasionally help with the ordinary nursing, though it is more often the household members who fulfill these duties.' <sup id="cite_ref-1564" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1564">[1,564]</a></sup> Western hospitals and medicines were introduced in the colonial and post-independence periods. Missionaries played a key part in this development: 'The third major influence on the Garos, and in some ways the most important, has been that of Christianity. American Baptist missionaries began to have a few peripheral contacts with the Garos even before their hills were occupied by the British. Missionaries were stationed in Goalpara, a town on the Brahmaputra just north of the Garo Hills, and some of their work was with Garos. However, intensive Christianization began only after the occupation of the hills. American missionaries followed the government officers into the hills and like them set up their headquarters in the town of Tura, which remains the center of Garo Christian activities today. The missionaries not only evangelized, but from the beginning carried out extensive medical and educational work. They established a hospital in Tura, and set up dispensaries at various other points in the district. At first almost all of the education in the district was in the hands of the missionaries. They first used the Bengali alphabet for writing the language, on the principle that this was the alphabet used by the people surrounding the Garos; but they later switched to the Roman alphabet, and today the latter is used exclusively. Today, although the largest part of Garo education is actually administered and paid for by the district or state governments, the [Page 313] legacy of missionary work continues to permeate the educational system. It apparently became established very early that an essential ingredient of all education was the teaching of Christianity. Mission teachers have been expected to teach Christianity as well as reading and arithmetic, and today Garos accept without question that becoming educated is an adequate reason for becoming a Christian. Non-Christian Garos, or Songsareks, as the adherents of the older religion are called, have little opposition to Christianity. Parents of children who have become Christian never express sorrow over the fact but simply point out that after all the child went to school, and so naturally he became a Christian. So completely has this attitude been accepted that the change to government-supported schools has made little difference. Village teachers, whether paid by a missionary society or by the government, are certain to be Christians, since they themselves have had some education, and they almost always see it as part of their job to teach Christianity, even though the government may not require them to do so.' <sup id="cite_ref-1565" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1565">[1,565]</a></sup> A’chik and Westerns systems of healing coexisted to an extent: 'Sacrifices on the occasion of village festivals are, as we have already remarked, no longer performed by Garo living in Bangladesh. But the offering of sacrifices to obtain release from sickness still continues among non-Christian Garo, and sometimes among Christian Garo as well. But, when they are sick, Chunia’s Christian Garo usually visit the hospital attached to the local Roman Catholic mission, where they receive both treatment and medicines free of [Page 140] charge. Some of the non-Christian villagers also patronize the Catholic hospital, where they receive the same attention as do their Christian counterparts. But most non-Christian Garo are reluctant to take modern medicine. In this connection Paresh Mri (Pl. 5), a Garo social worker resident in Chunia village, told me that, in order to convince his fellow villagers of the efficacy of modern medicine, he had himself practised as a medic for several years. Although he was able to persuade many people of the value of modern medicine, he told me that he could not convince his own father.' <sup id="cite_ref-1566" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1566">[1,566]</a></sup>

<dd> <b>♠ Care of elderly ♣ absent ♥</b> The elderly were taken care of within the family rather than the community as a whole: 'The alternatives that face a girl are not unlike those facing a boy, except that personal sentiments are apt to be much more important to her. She will either stay in her home and care for her own parents or move out and set up a new household. Only rarely is there any real problem in persuading a girl to accept either responsibility, but the choice must be made one way or another before she can be married, and it is usually made many years beforehand.' <sup id="cite_ref-1567" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1567">[1,567]</a></sup> Heirs were expected to care for their elderly in-laws: 'Just as there are conflicting pressures for and against being married at all, advantages and disadvantages are likewise seen in regard to becoming an heir. Most young men say that they do not want to become heirs, for the responsibility of caring for one’s parents-in-law in their later years, and of maintaining an old, and perhaps respected household may be an awesome prospect. Furthermore, it is recognized that there are personal complications to be faced in living with one’s parents-in-law. Since the father-in-law is normally a member of the same matrilineal lineage as his heir, he has a general authority over the younger man. This puts the heir in a sometimes uncomfortable position which boys hesitate to enter, in spite of the economic compensations and the approbation of one’s kinsmen which are gained thereby. A boy who agrees to become an heir explains his action by saying that he feels a sense of duty and believes he should help his father-in-law. Older men who have been heirs for many years, however, say that they could not imagine having done differently, and that the advantages of being able to move into an established household and of eventually inheriting all the assets of the household outweigh the responsibilities involved. In fact it would seem that the advantages and disadvantages just about balance each other, so that boys neither compete to become the heir of a rich man nor shrink from the task to the extent that it becomes difficult to find enough boys to assume the responsibility. In practice the system works with remarkable smoothness. Enough boys and girls are found to fulfill the requirements of heirship, while the others do not feel handicapped by their omission.' <sup id="cite_ref-1568" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1568">[1,568]</a></sup> Occasionally, adoptions were arranged in order to provide elderly women with daughters who would look after them: 'The formal negotiations for arranging such an adoption require the cooperation of the men of the woman’s lineage. Men are supposed to look after their sisters in formal kinship matters, and part of their duty is to make sure that they are properly taken care of in their old age. It is to the general advantage of the lineage to shift daughters about when necessary to make [Page 79] sure that each woman has one girl who will look after her. The whole weight of opinion within the lineage will favor making suitable adoptions. Since the same group of men have authority over and responsibility for both the actual mother and the potential adoptive mother, they will support any necessary adoptions. When the girl actually shifts residence, a number of lineage people, including the adopting mother, go to the girl’s house, taking curry, rice, and rice beer, and formally “lead” the girl back to her new house; but the crucial arrangements are made earlier in a less ritualized atmosphere.' <sup id="cite_ref-1569" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1569">[1,569]</a></sup> We have found no evidence of colonial-era facilities for the care of the elderly.</dd></dl>
<p><b>♠ State pensions for elites ♣ absent ♥</b> Prior to colonization, the A’chik were not governed by a state structure. Clans and lineages exercised social control on the village and local levels: ‘In Garo society the most important social group is the clan known as MACHONG. A machong is an exogamous matrilineal descent group wherein a Garo is automatically assigned by birth to the unilineal group of his mother. A CHATCHI (moiety) is divided into many machong. Each married couple chooses one daughter--or, if they have none, they adopt a close relative of the mother--to be heiress (NAKNA DONQIPIKA MECHIK) of the family. Her husband traditionally is selected from the lineage group of the father and is accepted as the NOKROM of the house. He resides with his wife in her parents' house. He has to take on the responsibility of looking after his parents-in-law during their old age, and his wife inherits the property.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1570" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1570">[1,570]</a></sup> Local authority was exercised by lineage elders: ‘The authority within a lineage is exercised according to age, the older member always being allowed to direct and punish the younger members. The age differences are otherwise symbolized  in only one way-the order in which rice beer is served. When beer is first passed out at a gathering, the people should be served in order of formal seniority. A maternal uncle should be served before his nephew, and an older brother before a younger one. Even an older sister may precede a younger brother, though generally men and women do not drink together. [...] In spite of this formal deference, older people do not monopolize positions of power, and an old person cannot exercise authority outside his lineage simply because of his age. One defers to one’s lineage seniors, but not to old people in general.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1571" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1571">[1,571]</a></sup> Village headmen acted as intermediaries in local disputes: ‘Among the Garos most disputes arise over the issues of property, inheritance, and domestic quarrels within the family. Such problems are to a large extent settled by the MAHARI (lineage) of the offended and the offender. A new situation develops when someone's cattle cause damage to another's crops. Under such situation the NOKMA (village headman) acts as an intermediary only. If he fails to settle the dispute, the matter can go to the civil court of the district council.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1572" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1572">[1,572]</a></sup>  ‘Traditionally, the  nokma’s position was connected with the indigeneous customary rites. His temporal and ritual powers in a traditional society were linked with his position. The conversion of a  nokma to Christianity automatically led to the loss of his ritualistic role. When the  nokma’s were endowed with real temporal power, the resistance was great as  Nokmas were non-Christians. But when the  Nokma accepted Christianity,  nokmaship passed to another person who could act as a  nokma in performing rites and rituals. However, the Government still recognized the converted persons as  nokmas. This created dislocation in the traditional system, one looking after the customary right and other ritual responsibilities. As the author has tried to show that in the traditional system the two roles cannot be separated, the two roles are enmeshed into each other.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1573" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1573">[1,573]</a></sup> Nokmas also formally held titles to land: ‘In a Garo village very little difference of status is seen. A particular clan holds right of ownership of the village homestead and shifting cultivation lands, and the title of ownership is inherited by a particular household. The head of the land-owning household is known as the  nokma, and the particular area under which he holds ownership right is known as   a’king. He also acts as the religious head of the village, and he is to perform the ceremonies for the general well-being of the village. He is called upon to settle disputes between villagers. But in all his decisions he is guided by the elders of the village. He is not entitled to any tribute from the villagers, and he has no special paraphernalia to indicate himself as the  nokma. However, in the village a rich man gets respect, because in times of need people have to seek help from him. But in a Garo village it is usually very rare to find an extremely rich man. To a Garo wealth consists of a number of brass gongs called  rang and some ornaments made of silver or some such metal. Now-a-days a gun is also regarded as the status symbol of a wealthy man.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1574" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1574">[1,574]</a></sup> Formalization was largely absent from village councils and trials: ‘The Rules require the village court to “try all suits and cases in accordance with the customary laws of the village.” Village courts are supposed to be non-professional bodies and decide [minor, village-level] cases in an informal atmosphere without procedural technicalities and formalities.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1575" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1575">[1,575]</a></sup> During colonial rule, supralocal executive offices were superimposed onto village- and lineage-based A’chik structures: ‘When the Britishers took over the administration of this district, one witnessed an imposition of hierarchy of new political and administrative units in the district over the traditional democratic village set-up. The British Government, being actuated with the desire to have effective control over the villages and to facilitate the collection of revenues and house tax introduced the office of  laskar with limited police, civil and criminal powers. Accordingly there was a  laskar over a circle of villages; each having jurisdiction covering ten or twelve of villages. Although, the villagers were left to settle all disputes through the  nokma and the village courts, they had right to appeal to the court of  laskars against the decisions of the village councils.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1576" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1576">[1,576]</a></sup> ’In the same way the introduction of offices of  sardar, hill  mandal and hill  mauzadar curtailed the powers and authorities of the  nokmas and their village councils. The new offices were created for the effective administration over the Garo with  the idea of village self-government under the direct control of Deputy Commissioner at the centre.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1577" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1577">[1,577]</a></sup> Village headmen and elders were not bureaucrats, but mediated between village self-governance and colonial authorities: ‘Many of the disputes of the Garos were decided in their village  Panchayats. When a man has some complaints against another he reports them to the Nokma or the village-head. If the nature of the complaints is simple, the Nokma in a meeting of the few leading persons of the village, decides the dispute; but if the nature of the complaints is complicated and not easy of solution the Nokma reports the matter to the Laskar. The Laskar is a very important and influential man in the Garo Hills District. The hills areas are divided into some elekas and each of such elekas is placed under a Laskar for convenient collection of the house tax as well as for deciding the disputes of small nature locally. The Laskar need not essentially be a literate man, worldly prudence is enough for the management of his eleka. In practice a Laskar wields immense influence in his eleka.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1578" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1578">[1,578]</a></sup> The degree of professionalization differs according to administrative level, with full-time bureaucrats restricted to the higher ones. Judges employed at government courts and other top officials functioned on a higher administrative level than the native village councils and were solely dependent on the colonial or independent Indian district executive: ‘During the first few years of the British rule in Assam the district of Garo Hills was treated as a part of the Goalpara district. The whole tract was placed under a Civil Commissioner. This officer took into his hands the collection of rents claimed by the Zaminders from the Garos, and abolished the duties levied by them on the hill producers. For some years a policy of  non-interference was followed but without the desired success; so it was decided to appoint an officer-in-charge of the hills and in 1869 a.d. the Garo Hills were formed into a separate district with Tura as its headquarters. It is said in some parts of the district even now that the British administrators had to get away with many of the influential chiefs and other men of the tribe by killing them for, they could not easily bow down to the foreigners. Once this hills area was completely brouht undegr the control of the government, the Garos lived peacefully.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1579" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1579">[1,579]</a></sup> ‘The judicial officers (who preside over those courts) are appointed by, or with the approval of the Governor. The rules as to administration of justice do not contain specific provisions as to their tenure and salary, or as to their full time or part time character. But most of these matters will be regulated as rules or orders issued under Rule 15 of the Assam Autonomous Districts (Constitution of District Councils) Rules, 1951. It may be of interest to note that there is a specific prohibition against a member of the Executive Committee being appointed to these courts. To this extent, their independence is protected. A legal practitioner can appear before these courts. But in cases where an accused is not arrested, the legal practitioner takes the permission of the District Council Court for such appearance.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1580" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1580">[1,580]</a></sup> Positions given to native petty officials were less formalized: ‘The  loskor has several duties. He collects the house tax within his district, keeping a fixed portion of this as his own payment, and he organizes work parties to keep the roads open. His most important duty, however, is to supervise and try to settle legal disputes. The  loskor sometimes appoints one or more assistants called  sordars, to whom the District Council pays an annual stipend of 100 Rupees, together with a shirt and a pair of short pants. Saljing, who lived in Rengsanggri, was a  sordar; but not every village had one, and a  sordar does not have jurisdiction over a particular village. As a general assistant to the  loskor he may assist in collecting information about a dispute, and in petty matters a  sordar may sit as representative of the  loskor and preside at a trial. The  loskorship demands a large part of a man’s time, but a  sordar spends most of his time working in his fields like his neighbors.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1581" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1581">[1,581]</a></sup> The material seems to indicate that native officials performed their duties on a part-time basis only. Appointed officials on the lower, less professionalized level received stipends or drew their wages from tax income. Lineage elders were appointed to colonial courts on a temporary basis, but only as advisers: ‘The District Council may, whenever it deems necessary, also nominate two or more local elders well conversant with the tribal usages and customary laws, to sit with the judicial officer of the court as a bench and may, by order, invest such bench with any of the powers conferred or conferrable by or under the rules for the trial of suits and cases based on the tribal usages and the tribal customary laws only.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1582" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1582">[1,582]</a></sup> While village headmen were acknowledged by the British administration, the imposition of appointed officials led to a loss of political power among Nokmas: ’In the same way the introduction of offices of  sardar, hill  mandal and hill  mauzadar curtailed the powers and authorities of the  nokmas and their village councils. The new offices were created for the effective administration over the Garo with  the idea of village self-government under the direct control of Deputy Commissioner at the centre.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1583" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1583">[1,583]</a></sup> ‘There was a move for retention of the old institution of  nokmaship which could not function with authority since the British administration had appointed the  laskars and  sardars for the smooth running of their administration from 1824 onwards. The  nokmas became only the clan chief and custodian of the clan land  a’king. The  nokma could not administer effectively as he used to do prior to the British administration in the district. The  nokmas were supposed to be well versed with their functions and duties in the villages. The British administration enforced the Rules of Administration of Justice in the Garo Hills both Civil and Police in 1937. These rules have been renewed again and again. They are in use till the present day. The head of the district administration was the Deputy Commissioner and his Assistants and it has never been changed.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1584" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1584">[1,584]</a></sup> While laskars and sordars received stipends, we have assumed that they were not entitled to receive pensions from the colonial administration.

<p><b>♠ Funding for festivals ♣ absent ♥</b> 'All traditional annual festivals were connected with the different stages of shifting cultivation: AGALMAKA, MAIMUQ, RENACHUGALA, AHAIA, WANGALA, etc. Wangala is considered to be the national festival among the Garos, taking place during October-December. When a member of a family becomes Christian, he refuses to participate in Songsarek festivals.' <sup id="cite_ref-1585" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1585">[1,585]</a></sup> Festivals were organized through Nokma sponsorship and cooperation among the individual households of the village rather than being 'publicly funded'. This is evident from Khaleque's description of the festival cycle: 'The first of the annual cycle of village festivals was called Denbilsia and was observed after the completion of the clearing of the new swiddens, generally in January to February. Denbilsia was a one-day festival and was held at the nokma’s house. During the morning of the festival day, all the people gathered in front of the nokma’s house, where a bamboo altar was set up. Around noon, the nokma sacrificed a pig or a goat at this altar. After the sacrifice, the animal’s flesh was cut up and cooked, along with other foodstuffs, such as rice, fish, and other kinds of meat, and these were offered to all the villagers at a feast sponsored by the nokma. The nokma would also provide liberal amounts of rice-beer which the villagers drank all day long. After the feast, in the afternoon, the people would dance, sing and make music, activities which were continued until about midnight, when the villagers would return home to sleep.' <sup id="cite_ref-1586" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1586">[1,586]</a></sup> 'The second festival, Agalmaka, was observed after the swiddens had been fired. The festival began with the nokma sacrificing a cock in his own swidden, after which the head of every household in the village would offer an egg, each in his own field. Although the sacrifice and offerings were accomplished in a single morning, the festival itself lasted for several days. On the first day the nokma sponsored a feast for his villagers. After eating and drinking, the [Page 142] people would make music, dance and sing at the nokma’s house. On the following days people would visit each other’s houses, the arrangements for food, drink, dancing and singing being the responsibility of each individual household.' <sup id="cite_ref-1587" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1587">[1,587]</a></sup> 'Before seeds were sown in the swiddens, the Garo would observe the festival called Asiroka. On this occasion the nokma sacrificed a cock at a bamboo altar erected somewhere within the village itself. Following this sacrifice, the villagers would slaughter a cow, which they had purchased beforehand. This cow was not sacrificed to propitiate any mite, but simply killed for its flesh, which was distributed among the villagers according to the amount of money they had contributed for its purchase in the first place. After this distribution of meat, the villagers returned home to rest for the remainder of the day. The next day, each household head would sacrifice an animal (ox, pig, goat, or at least a cock, the kind of animal depending upon the household’s economic condition) in his own swidden. After the sacrifice the villagers would feast, dance and sing. But the following day was again set aside as a day of rest. After this the villagers began their planting operations.' <sup id="cite_ref-1588" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1588">[1,588]</a></sup> 'Around June to July, when the padi was growing in the swiddens, the Garo would observe a festival called Miamua. This festival lasted only a single day and, during it, the nokma would sacrifice a pig in his own swidden and sponsor a feast for all the villagers. After the feast, which took place around noon, the people used to sing and play music. But they were forbidden on this occasion to beat drums. It was said that the beating of drums at this particular time could attract the attention of some malevolent mite, like Bang, Rakashi or Chual, who might then decide to come to the village to enjoy the sound of the drums and subsequently cause damage to the growing padi plants. And, because there were no drums to accompany them, the villagers would not dance on the occasion of Miamua either.' <sup id="cite_ref-1589" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1589">[1,589]</a></sup> 'Before they harvested their swidden crops, the villagers would observe the festival called Rongchugala. This usually fell in August. On this occasion the nokma would offer the mite a special dish called rongchu, which is rice which has been cooked until dry and crisp. The rongchu was spread out on a banana leaf and kept in the nokma’s house. After the nokma had made this traditional offering, there would be feasting, drinking and music-making. But, for the very same reason as at the Miamua festival, there would be no drumming or dancing on this occasion.' <sup id="cite_ref-1590" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1590">[1,590]</a></sup> 'After the harvest, in September, the Garo villagers observed the festival called Ahaia. On this occasion each household head would prepare a fish for the mite, the offering being made in the farmer’s own swidden. Then, for several days, there would be much feasting, drinking, dancing and music-making. All the households would exchange visits during the course of the Ahaia festival.' <sup id="cite_ref-1591" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1591">[1,591]</a></sup> 'The last festival of the annual cycle was Wangala and this was the greatest celebration of them all. It would be observed about a month after Ahaia, at a time when the Garo villagers were completely free from farm work, having brought in their harvest even before Ahaia. The Wangala festival would last for several days. The first day would find the villagers busy slaughtering cows, which they had purchased earlier for this purpose. These animals were killed [Page 143] solely for their meat, not as a sacrifice to the mite. Several households joined together to purchase an animal and would share the meat among themselves according to the amount of money they had contributed to the purchase price. It was essential for every household to have meat to offer their guests on this great festive occasion. On the second day of Wangala, the nokma made offerings to the mite inside his house. Known as churugala, this ceremony involved the pouring of some chu, or rice-beer, and the placing of other offerings (cooked rice, an onion, a root of ginger, and a squash), all set out on a banana leaf, at an especially sacred place known as the dinsam. This place could be located at any corner of the nokma’s main sleeping room ( din) and it was here that he kept the sacred drums, other musical instruments, his sword, shield, etc. After these offerings had been made, the villagers decorated the posts and beams of the nokma’s house by making handprints on them with a paste of flour and water. Having thus decorated their leader’s house, the villagers helped each other decorate their own buildings in exactly the same fashion. Feasting, drinking, music-making and dancing lasted for several days. First, each household would visit the nokma’s house, after which it would visit every other house in the village. At each establishment, the guests would be honoured with food and drink, music and dance.' <sup id="cite_ref-1592" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1592">[1,592]</a></sup> 'Except on the occasions of Miamua and Rongchugala, dancing was an integral part of Garo village festivals. In general it was the menfolk - especially the young ones - who would dance, with the women and older men sitting around as spectators. But on the occasion of the Wangala festival all the villagers, young and old, men and women, would join in the dance. Sometimes men and women danced together and sometimes separately. Moreover, there were certain dances restricted to members of a particular sex.' <sup id="cite_ref-1593" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1593">[1,593]</a></sup> Sponsoring and hospitality were associated with prestige within the commmunity: 'One of these feasts may serve simultaneously to validate the right of a household to use its own gongs for beating at village festivals. A house must have about fifteen gongs before it is considered decent to use them, and houses which do not own enough must borrow them from a richer neighbor when they are needed. But just to accumulate and own enough gongs is not sufficient; the household must kill a cow for some occasion, such [Page 205] as to honor a parent, before the gongs can be used. After this the household will be expected to entertain regularly and on a larger than average scale, and so to maintain its prestigeful position. In Rengsanggri eight households owned enough gongs to be used in festivals: those of Gajang, Jengnon, Nanggan, Anat, Kakan, Chondu, Rongsin, and Gurang. Many other households had a few gongs but used those from one of these eight households and carried them to their houses when it was their turn to entertain during village festivals. Feasts are frequent enough for poor people to eat significantly better than they would if they relied entirely on their own gardens. Wealth differences lead to greater differences in prestige than in standards of consumption. Prestige and social standing go to the industrious and skillful.' <sup id="cite_ref-1594" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1594">[1,594]</a></sup> We have assumed the above comments to be true of both the pre-colonial and the colonial periods. Converts to Christianity celebrated Christian holidays and rest days: 'The cultural changes that come with a switch to Christianity do not all seem to be very intimately associated with the new religion, but any aspects of the culture that either the early missionaries or the Garos themselves considered to be somehow connected with the traditional religion have been replaced. These include almost all of the traditional arts of the Garos-their music, their dancing, and their wood-carving where that was important. Christians do not build bachelors’ houses and they are not supposed to drink rice beer. The traditional village festivals always have a ceremonial aspect. The climax is usually a sacrifice, and a supplication of the spirits or gods. Christianity can hardly coexist with sacrifices to the spirits, and as a result the whole festival-music, dancing, feasting, and merrymaking-is abandoned. Of course, Christians substitute new activities for those that are lost. They have church services on Sundays, and sometimes prayer meetings on other days. They observe [Page 314] Sunday as a day of rest, just as non-Christians sometimes take days of rest in connection with their village festivals. Christians have their own feast days, and on Christmas especially all Christians of a village usually participate in a communal feast to which they all contribute. The delight taken in such feasts is no different from that of Songsarek festivals, except that no rice beer stimulates the Christian’s gaiety. The variety of Protestantism which has influenced the Garos has been rigid in its disapproval of alcohol, and perhaps the Garos have exaggerated the ideas of their teachers more dogmatically than was intended. Today, Christians and Songsareks alike often cite the shunning of rice beer as the primary sign of Christianity, and in answer to the question “Is he a Christian?” the answer is often “No, he is a rice-beer drinker.” If a Christian drinks today, and some of them do, he does it surreptitiously. Christians substitute tea, very milky and sugary, for rice beer, and the two drinks are clearly equivalent. Tea has become a hospitality symbol among the Christians. If one visits six Christian houses in the course of an afternoon, he will almost surely drink six cups of tea; and in some areas at least, tea is served to large parties of visitors at the Christian holidays, just as visitors during Songsarek festivals are served rice beer.' <sup id="cite_ref-1595" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1595">[1,595]</a></sup> We have assumed that festivals were a collective effort rather than 'publicly funded' in Christian communities as well.

The word  nokpante literally means ‘a house of bachelor’ (nok-house, pante-bachelor). Almost all the Garo villages have their own nokpantes; the unmarried youth sleep together in the nokpantes at night. Nokpantes are very big houses built of bamboo, wood, thatches and cane. A nokpante is sometimes 20 feet high and 80 to 90 feet long; it is decently built on bamboo machang and its walls are also neatly woven. Almost half the length of the house is kept open while the other half is enclosed with bamboo mats of sufficiently polished works; two doors are kept, one in the front and the  other in the back side of it. The bamboo machang is six to ten feet from the ground and a ladder helps one to ascend the nokpante; along the ladder a big and unusually long cane stalk is hung from the roofs of the house and it is used as support while ascending it. The ladder is nothing but a big log of wood with steps cut on it. The nokpantes are really big village halls.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1597" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1597">[1,597]</a></sup> ‘Carvings and paintings are also worked into the front posts of the nokpante; these are big wood posts either of sal trees or such other trees. In certain nokpantes pig heads and tusks are seen hung from the beams; these are nothing but heads and tusks of pigs killed for village or community feasts. Inside the house and on the bamboo machang or platform a rectangular hearth is constructed where fires are lit during the winter to roast porks and other meats for feasts. Feathers of fowls, horns of cattle and drums and gongs which are public property are also kept in the nokpante. Entrance of a lady into a nokpante is very strictly regulated; entrance of a lady through the front door is never allowed; certain respectable and reliable ladies are, however, allowed to enter the house through the back door to supply liquor and important informations in times of feasts only.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1598" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1598">[1,598]</a></sup> ‘Besides being a bachelor’s house, a nokpante serves many a good purpose of the village. Village elders meet here to discuss and decide important affairs of common interest; people go there at leisure and particularly after the day’s supper and in the afternoon to make baskets, mats and fishing nets etc. The officers or other persons happening to be there from distant places are also allowed to live there temporarily. Some villages again build small separate houses with cooksheds attached to them for guests; such houses are called by the Garos  alda.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1599" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1599">[1,599]</a></sup> Altars were mostly temporary: ‘Once boundaries are established, each family builds a small altar and honors the god Saljong by sacrificing an egg near the place on their own plot-generally at about the center-where they will build their field house. One man only, the  nokma or ‘headman’ who acts as ceremonial leader of the village, sacrifices a chicken. Only when the sacrifice is complete can the sowing begin. [...] A bit of  rice and curry is placed by the altar, as an offering to Saljong, the god, and then the family “eat with Saljong,” squatting in the open near the offering place. People soon begin to circulate about the fields, visiting neighbors and offering drinks of rice beer back and forth. It would be considered rude not to offer a drink to anyone who passes by, and everyone rapidly waxes gay. Shortly before noon, after perhaps five hours in the fields, people make their way back to the village in a thoroughly festive mood. A few must take naps to sleep off the rice beer they have already consumed, but others visit their neighbor’s houses informally and continue drinking; the next few days are spent in celebrating the festival of  Agalmaka.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1600" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1600">[1,600]</a></sup> But sacrificial stones were more permanent: ‘In every big Garo village there are sacrificial stones called  kosi at the entrance of the village. These are rough and unhewn stones, set up on the ground without any attempt for keeping in regular position and seldom more than three feet high. The sacrificial stone is cleansed once in a year with the blood of cow, dog, fowl or any other animal. It is important that all the members of the village should participate in this activity. No outsider is allowed to enter or go out of the village at the time of this celebration. If anybody violates this, he or she can be forced to pay any amount of  dai. It may be a one-day or two-day affair depending on the size of the feasts they arrange. The  nokma of the village has all the rights and obligations in organising the feasts. The blood of the sacrificed animal is offered to the stones and while doing so all the villagers are expected to take part in the worship of their  mite. They have to pray to this  mite to keep the village safe and sound from the enemies, diseases and also wild animals. The annual celebration of the stone is called as  A’songtata. A priest in place of  nokma can officiate at this sacrifice but it is for the  nokma to provide or sanction it. No person has the right to perform  A’songtata without the sanction from the  nokma. If anybody does this, it would not only be an usurpation of  nokma’s authority but would be tantamount to asserting himself as  nokma and such person would be liable to pay heavy  dai.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1601" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1601">[1,601]</a></sup> We have therefore considered sacrifical stones to constitute ritual spaces. Christianity was introduced in the colonial period: 'There are two faiths prevalent among the Garos: native and Christian. People who follow the traditional faith are known as Songsarek. Difference in religion has not brought any split in the population. The traditional world of the Garos includes a number of spirits who behave like human beings but have no shape. They are SALJONG, the spirit of sun and fertility; GAERA, the spirit of strength and the thunderbolt; SUSIME, the spirit of wealth. Propitiation for each is followed by the sacrifice of an animal and an offering of beer. A Christian Garo is supposed to avoid such practices. There are also ogres and biting spirits, called MITES.' <sup id="cite_ref-1602" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1602">[1,602]</a></sup> Converts to Christianity performed Christian rituals: 'The cultural changes that come with a switch to Christianity do not all seem to be very intimately associated with the new religion, but any aspects of the culture that either the early missionaries or the Garos themselves considered to be somehow connected with the traditional religion have been replaced.

However, arts were produced by ordinary villagers rather than full-time entertainment specialists. This is evident from Burling's description of the Wangala and Miamua ceremonies: 'Wangala is one of the three festivals at which group dancing takes place. This occurs in the courtyards in front of the houses, where people like to keep a sizable cleared space for this very purpose. Both married and unmarried people take part, though dancing is generally felt to be most appropriate for the young, especially those who are unmarried. Group dancing is almost exclusively a night pastime, and may continue intermittently until dawn.' <sup id="cite_ref-1605" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1605">[1,605]</a></sup> 'The dance figures are stylized pantomimes of everyday activities. In one, the girls pretend to cut off their heads, letting them flop to one side in imitation of cutting down a tree. In another, a girl dances with one boy and then moves to a second in a way suggesting that she has been stolen away by a new lover; and in fact, such boy-and-girl teasing is an element expressed in many of the dances. Groups of girls always dance more or less opposed to groups of boys, though they pair off now and then temporarily; and there need not even be equal numbers of the two sexes dancing. Each boy carries a drum suspended from a cord around his neck, and maintains a steady and sometimes intricate rhythm while everyone executes the various steps and patterns. Though the boys and girls approach one another repeatedly, they never quite come into physical contact, apparently teasing each other by coming as close as possible without touching. Some people are recognized as being more skilled than others at dancing, and not all are equally enthusiastic. People drop out when tired and rejoin when they wish to, for no specific number is ever required. Rice beer drunk in copious quantities frees the dancers of some of their shyness, and allows them to continue their strenuous sport for many hours. The boys and girls associate far more freely than on ordinary working days, and the closest public intimacies ever indulged in come during the breaks between dances when they sit together and pass around rice beer, betel nuts, and tobacco. [Page 67] They talk, joke, engage in a mild sort of horseplay, and have a certain superficial physical contact with members of the opposite sex which would be out of the question at other times.' <sup id="cite_ref-1606" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1606">[1,606]</a></sup> 'Older people dance less often, but they visit the houses of the village in the daytime and feast with food and drink. These drinking parties at Wangala are times for good-natured relaxation, talk, and merriment. Men gather at the back of the house and rice beer is passed around to them. The guests sit with their backs to the wall, rarely standing up except to go and come, and talk animatedly with their neighbors, growing more and more friendly as they drink more beer. As the rice beer is served, more and more water is poured through the mash and strained out to drink. The beer grows weaker as water is added, but this makes progressively less difference to the drinkers. At intervals the assembled drinkers take up gongs, which the host provides from his own stock if he is rich enough or borrows if he is not, and beat out various rhythms. Besides the gongs, there are usually a small bamboo flute, a trumpet made from a buffalo horn tied to a long bamboo tube, and the nokma’s small sacred drum, which is carried from house to house and beaten. Festivals such as Wangala are also occasions for the telling of stories, especially the mildly competitive stories in which two people alternately chant, each trying to outdo the other in the cleverness and obscurity of his phraseology, to the amusement of all bystanders.' <sup id="cite_ref-1607" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1607">[1,607]</a></sup> 'In the afternoon most of the villagers join in this feast, and the men then beat gongs and one by one some of them dance with a headhunting sword inside the nokma’s house.' <sup id="cite_ref-1608" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1608">[1,608]</a></sup> 'Miamua, ( mi ‘rice’; amua ‘sacrifice’). This ceremony lasts only one day, and is usually held at the end of June or early in July, after the rice has grown tall but has not yet started to ripen. The nokma sacrifices a large pig in his field, and the villagers gather there to help with the preparations and to share in the feast. In the afternoon they return to the nokma’s house in the village and make music with gongs, flutes, and buffalo horns; but they do not dance.' <sup id="cite_ref-1609" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1609">[1,609]</a></sup> Some 'traditional' arts were in decline by the post-independence period due to Christianization: 'The cultural changes that come with a switch to Christianity do not all seem to be very intimately associated with the new religion, but any aspects of the culture that either the early missionaries or the Garos themselves considered to be somehow connected with the traditional religion have been replaced.

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Publicly funded or subsidized education ♣ present ♥</b> There was no system of formal education prior to the colonial period. Young men and boys were educated at the men's house: 'Indigenous system of education in the broadest sense, was in vogue in the villages of Garo Hills prior to the establishment of schools for formal education. The Nokpante or the bachelors dormitory was the only traditional institution which could be regarded as the centre of learning among the Garos. The word Nokpante literally means “a house of bachelors”. The Nokpantes [Page 188] were constructed at the centre of the village, opposite to the Nokma’s or Chief’s house. In certain big villages, each clan had its own Nokpante for the unmarried young men.' <sup id="cite_ref-1611" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1611">[1,611]</a></sup> 'From the age of seven or eight to the date of marriage, all the males were expected to sleep in the Nokpante. The old and experienced men of the village taught the young boys the knowledge and the skills necessary for their traditional life. Besides the practical training in different arts and culture, the Nokpante boys were also given practical lessons on discipline and on high sense of duty. The younger boys were trained rigorously to obey the orders and carry out the work assigned by their seniors. The Nokpante boys also served as the guards of the village. They had to defend the village from attack and do the social welfare activities for the families there. Besides, Nokpante was used as the court room of the Nokma, the Community Hall and an inn for the male visitors to the village to spend the night. The female visitors to the village had to sleep with other women in the village houses. The women were not allowed to enter the Nokpante. The education of girls was considered as the responsibility of the adult women in the family-mother or aunties or grandmother.' <sup id="cite_ref-1612" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1612">[1,612]</a></sup> Missionaries introduced schools: 'The third major influence on the Garos, and in some ways the most important, has been that of Christianity. American Baptist missionaries began to have a few peripheral contacts with the Garos even before their hills were occupied by the British. Missionaries were stationed in Goalpara, a town on the Brahmaputra just north of the Garo Hills, and some of their work was with Garos. However, intensive Christianization began only after the occupation of the hills. American missionaries followed the government officers into the hills and like them set up their headquarters in the town of Tura, which remains the center of Garo Christian activities today. The missionaries not only evangelized, but from the beginning carried out extensive medical and educational work. They established a hospital in Tura, and set up dispensaries at various other points in the district. At first almost all of the education in the district was in the hands of the missionaries. They first used the Bengali alphabet for writing the language, on the principle that this was the alphabet used by the people surrounding the Garos; but they later switched to the Roman alphabet, and today the latter is used exclusively. Today, although the largest part of Garo education is actually administered and paid for by the district or state governments, the [Page 313] legacy of missionary work continues to permeate the educational system. It apparently became established very early that an essential ingredient of all education was the teaching of Christianity. Mission teachers have been expected to teach Christianity as well as reading and arithmetic, and today Garos accept without question that becoming educated is an adequate reason for becoming a Christian. Non-Christian Garos, or Songsareks, as the adherents of the older religion are called, have little opposition to Christianity. Parents of children who have become Christian never express sorrow over the fact but simply point out that after all the child went to school, and so naturally he became a Christian. So completely has this attitude been accepted that the change to government-supported schools has made little difference. Village teachers, whether paid by a missionary society or by the government, are certain to be Christians, since they themselves have had some education, and they almost always see it as part of their job to teach Christianity, even though the government may not require them to do so.' <sup id="cite_ref-1613" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1613">[1,613]</a></sup> Matthew provides a summary of the process: 'THE development of education in Garo Hills is a fascinating field of inquiry. It unfolds their indigenous system of education, growth and development of school and college education in Garo Hills. It is an interesting story of series of forward failures, intermittent progress and slow but steady success, that one comes across when there is transition from savage state to civilization. The missionary spirit that propelled a number of eminent men and women to overcome all sorts of imaginable difficulties in a strange land with wonderful culture of head hunting deserves appreciation. The lessons that we learn from their experiments with the Herculean task will be immensely useful for all those who are engaged directly or indirectly in National Literacy Mission, and formal or non-formal education.' <sup id="cite_ref-1614" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1614">[1,614]</a></sup> 'It was David Scott who first conceived the idea of educating the Garos. He took keen interest to teach some smart Garo boys reading and writing. When it was found difficult to educate the savages, the help of Christian Missionaries was sought. The idea of David Scott was to win over the Garos through the spiritual force of the principles of Christianity applied through the medium of schools. His years of continuous effort led to the establishment of a Government Missionary school at Singimari (1826-29). Mr. Valentine William Hurley was appointed as School Master in July 1828. However, the school had to be discontinued with the death of James Formis, the next School Master, in 1828. The Bengali medium school could not make significant influence on the life of Garos. Towards the end of 1829, James Rae, an young man from Scotland, opened a school at Gauhati for the tribals of the north-eastern region and there were nine Garo youths in that school.' <sup id="cite_ref-1615" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1615">[1,615]</a></sup> 'In 1837, after the arrival of Rev. Nathan Brown, the first American Baptist Missionary to Assam, Captain Francis Jenkins tried his best to establish Bengali medium schools for the Garos by meeting the maintenance expense of the boys and the salary of the teachers by the Government. Thus a school was started at Goalpara in 1847, under the care of Captain Jenkins. But the school could not attract Garo boys in the beginning. However, one day in 1847, news was spread at the Rongjuli market that the Government wanted Garo boys for a school at Goalpara, and would feed, clothe and teach them. The news spread to the villages [Page 190] located above the market. Soon Omed W. Momin and two others Ramsing and Jongrin started from their village, travelled through the jungles and arrived at Goalpara. Omed was over twenty years of age then and others were about 12 or 13. There were already six Garos from other villages in that school. Two other boys joined them a little later. The twelve Garo boys were accommodated in a separate building at the outskirts of the town, away from the Hindu boys in the school. A number of peons were engaged to keep the Garo boys out of mischief. Six months later, Ramke W. Momin, nephew of Omed, also got admitted to the school. Thus there were 13 Garo boys in the school.' <sup id="cite_ref-1616" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1616">[1,616]</a></sup> 'In 1856, near to the Goalpara school, another school was opened at Rongjuli.

In February 1868, when Dr. Bronson came again with Dr. Stoddard, there were 30 boys in that school. A grant of Rs. 250/- was sanctioned by the Government for the preparation and printing of Garo books and also a monthly grant of Rs. 50/- was made for the Damra Normal school and Rs. 52/- for village schools. During rainy season, the Normal school started functioning at Goalpara for four months from 1870.

They taught both Bengali and Garo in that school, in addition to other subjects. It [Page 191] was closed after a year. There were 14 village schools and one Normal school in 1874. Captain W.J. Williamson, the first Deputy Commissioner of Garo Hills, personally visited those schools. The boys were taught through Bengali medium including simple Garo texts. The need for strengthening Normal school was felt since the products of that school could spread education to all the villages in Garo Hills. As the missionaries concentrated their school work mainly in the northern part, in 1873 a few government schools were established in the south. Thus two types of schools, grant-in-aid schools under the Baptist Mission and the Government schools, came into existence.' <sup id="cite_ref-1621" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1621">[1,621]</a></sup> 'Ramke, the product of Goalpara school, was one of the moving spirits behind the revolution in education in Garo Hills by establishing new schools in the villages, by writing Garo books and by encouraging Missionary grant-in-aid schools. In 1874-75, there were 9 schools under the Deputy Commissioner and nine schools under the Baptist Mission. Step by step, the responsibility of establishing the school, its management and the appointment of teachers, etc. fell on the shoulders of the people of each village, and the teachers often acted as preachers too. The schools established by the Mission were effective instruments in converting people to Christianity. Gradually, Tura became the Mission Headquarters and teacher training centre. The American Baptist Mission accepted the responsibility of running the schools with the grants-in-aid. In 1877, 78 and 79, the Mission opened a few schools and side by side the Government also opened schools on their own. In 1880-81, there were only 458 pupils attending schools and most of them were boys. Mr. Burdette and Thankan Sagma helped teachers training in the Normal school and the trained teachers were then sent to the villages to open new schools.

In 1902-03, there were 3 upper primary and 86 lower primary schools and one Normal school in Garo Hills. In 1903-04, there were 94 primary schools and the number of girls attending those schools was 276. In 1905, there were 109 schools and the Teachers’ Training school was raised to the grade of Middle English school. From the beginning of this century, Garos began to take keen interest in the education of their [Page 192] children and as a result, the demands for teachers were far in excess of the supply.' <sup id="cite_ref-1623" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1623">[1,623]</a></sup> 'In 1907-08, the Baptist Mission maintained a Middle English school at Tura itself, two upper primary and 77 lower primary schools.

The first college was opened by the public at Tura in 1955 with evening class in the First Year class of Intermediate Arts Course, where 20 students were admitted. It was closed after one year due to paucity of funds. However, it was revived in 1958. In 1962, it produced the first batch of Arts graduates. In 1958, a Higher Secondary school and a Multipurpose school were opened at Tura. To satisfy the demand for colleges in Garo Hills, the following colleges were established in the year noted against each.' <sup id="cite_ref-1627" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1627">[1,627]</a></sup> Writing in the post-independence period, Marak also provides a short historical overview of the relationship between mission and schooling: 'In 1902 all mission schools were converted into Garo medium schools. The pupils were sent to different schools as teachers as well as pastors to preach in the church in villages. The church activities were conducted in the school buildings and thus they managed to bring all school going pupils into the fold of Christianity. The education and conversion went hand in hand. Thus the dreams of David Scott had come true by ‘making the savage and rude Garos into better human beings.’ Those converted Garos were taught to abandon their traditional religion, feasts, festivals, music, dancing and stop all kinds of sacrifices for invoking the spirits and natural forces. Men cropped off their long hair and stopped wearing jewellery and started covering their naked bodies with the clothes available in the market or wore the clothes the missionaries gave them particularly during the winter months.' <sup id="cite_ref-1628" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1628">[1,628]</a></sup> 'The Christian villages had remarkably changed their set-up by discarding the famous institution of nokpante which was an institution for the young boys specially to educate them in their indigenous ways in the village activities. On the other hand the nokma of the village could not perform the duties of the village teacher and pastor in the churches. Thus the authority of nokma had been completely usurped by these teachers and church leaders in the village. The cultural and socio-political life of the Garos had changed by these foreign forces within a few years of time. They started building their dwelling houses according to designs adopted from the plain areas. Some Garos imitated the life style of Westerners. With the introduction of education and Christianity all the marriages were conducted in accordance with the Christian custom and were called church marriages. Though most of the rural areas had not received education and were free from the impact of Christianity, the parents did not prevent their children to go to school and become Christians. Some of the Garo boys were sent to America to [Page 170] allow them to learn about other cultures and study them. When the missionaries were not given permission to carry on with the evangelization work in India after Independence, the people became deprived of their teaching and guidance with the result that they are neither good Christians nor totally songsarek. Older persons always remember and miss the missionaries; their teaching and guidance had changed ‘the rude and savage tribe’ into one of the sophisticated tribes of India. However, the young enthusiasts do not suffer from this nostalgia and look forward to a healthy revival of traditional norms.' <sup id="cite_ref-1629" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1629">[1,629]</a></sup> Only few A’chik received university degrees (at institutions outside the Garo Hills district): 'The last hundred years have seen the incorporation of the Garos into a larger political and economic unit than they had belonged to before. In the process many Garos have had their range of vision widened from the village to the entire Garo district, but few Garos today have yet acquired any deep realization that for better or worse, the Garo Hills District has become and will remain politically and economically a part of India. There is simply no other place for it to go. More and more Garos are becoming educated. A number have received the B.A. degree and more are attending Gauhati and Calcutta Universities; but almost all Garos think of themselves as Garos only and not at all as Indians. Rural development is being pushed by the government. This will hasten changes in Garo agriculture and perhaps in other aspects of their culture. Economic and political developments will inevitably bring Garos into an ever closer relationship with the rest of the country, but adjustments will be necessary on both sides before the Garos can achieve a secure place within the nation. It is not yet clear how many of the essentials of their culture can be retained in the face of ever-increasing contact with the rest of India.' <sup id="cite_ref-1630" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1630">[1,630]</a></sup> While there was an emerging intelligentsia, most A’chik had little to no access to education. [There was precious little such infrastructure in the mid 50's, so I suppose there was not much earlier. There were no schools in my area in the 50's--There were missionary schools in some areas, and a high school in Tura.  Where there were schools, I think they were run by, supervised by, the Baptist Mission.]</dd>

<dd> <b>♠ Literacy rate ♣ rare ♥</b> Prior to the colonial period, the A’chik were illiterate: ‘Some of the Garos are of the opinion that they had their own alphabetic system of writing their language in some hoary past but this is not proved till now; it is really doubtful if the Garos had their own alphabet ever. Before the district of the Garo Hills was taken over by the British, the people living in the areas bordering Goalpara and Kamrup used to write in Assamese character while those living in the borders of the Mymensing and the Sylhet districts used to write in Bengali character; the Garos of the interior hills were mostly illiterate who are even now mostly illiterate. After the district came under the administration of the British the foreign missionaries introduced Roman characters of writing and this facilitated them to translate the holy Bible into Garo and preach christianity there. The Garos now write in Roman characters but even then all the letters of the English alphabet are not necessary to write the language.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1631" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1631">[1,631]</a></sup> Cultural knowledge was transmitted orally instead: ‘THE fact that the Garos migrated from Tibet to India is recorded in their own traditional literature; the memory of their leaders Jappa Jalimpa, Sukpa Bonggepa and the manner of their journey awakened again each time their history is narrated by the bards. Research into their origin and language during the British rule confirmed their tradition though the exact place of their former home could not be located. Scholars differ on the routes they followed; Playfair holds the view that the present settlers in Garo hills came in separate batches along the river Brahmaputra. D.S. Rongmuthu, who has done research in traditional Garo literature is of the opinion that they came through Garhwal. According to some scholars their migration dates back to the Vedic period. In the course of their migration over the years they became scattered all over North-East India and Bangladesh. The bulk of the tribe eventually settled down in Garo Hills and gave the place its name.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1632" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1632">[1,632]</a></sup> ‘The oral literature thus evolved has been tenaciously handed down from one generation to another, which thus assumes the character of an indispensable link between the past and a particular generation. Through it any generation can trace back its own origin and history.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1633" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1633">[1,633]</a></sup> ‘The oral literature has also been indispensable in another sense to the life of the Garos, it has permeated the very fabric of the life of the community. Though the primary object of the bards in narrating the history, legends and myths is undeniably to entertain, the desire to inform and to create awareness, too, might be another. The literature is not merely to entertain, it is part and parcel of festival, various ceremonies, rites and rituals and important occasions. Without it, they cannot be complete, just as the various ceremonies, religious and otherwise, is incomplete without the rice beer and the Wangala without the dance. Literature, thus, in the traditional society, by which I mean the community practising traditional religion, customs and ways of life, pervades a great deal of the activities of life. Its role is comparable to that of the written literature which has emerged recently.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1634" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1634">[1,634]</a></sup> Writing was introduced by Christian missionaries (see material on schooling above). There were some print publications: ‘Most of the writings before 1940 had religious intonation though secular form of literature began in 1924. Before this, there  were only two journals in Garo language-one was the  A’chikni Ripeng or “Friend of the Garos”, a powerful organ of the American Baptist Mission started in 1879. Since the journal was meant for propagation of plans and policies of the American Baptist Mission, articles dealing with one’s freedom of thought and expression were not accepted and published in it. The other journal, which was brought out in October, 1912 by three local leaders, namely Jobang D. Marak, Modhunath G. Momin and Alexander Macdonald Bassamoit, was  Phringphrang or “Morning Star”. This journal, which was supposed to be secular in nature, was not very much different from the  A’chikni Ripeng as most of the articles there, were connected with religion. The journal had its last publication in December, 1914 after which there were no more secular journals.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1635" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1635">[1,635]</a></sup> However, the growth rate of literacy was low in the colonial period: 'In the Garo Hills the percentage of literacy was only 0.85 percent in 1901. It went upto 2.65 percent in 1931. Prior to Independence, the literacy was only 7.31 percent (1951 census). Between 1951 and 1961 there was a spectacular increase. In 1991 the literacy percentage in the Garo Hills was recorded as 37.04 percent, much below the national average as well as the overall state average of 48.26 percent. In the Garo Hills there is a positive cor-relation between the level of literacy and the extent of participation in the active economic life.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1636" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1636">[1,636]</a></sup> ‘Before Independence, the growth rate of literacy was low. In the post Independence period, the growth rate is high, though Garo Hills is lagging behind other districts of Meghalaya and the national literacy. People are living in nearly 2,400 villages which are mostly small and scattered. The traditional system of shifting cultivation is still in vogue in many villages. Hence, there is serious problem of availability of school facilities, dearth of qualified teachers, motivation of parents and pupils and poor socio-economic conditions that stand in the way of spreading literacy.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1637" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1637">[1,637]</a></sup></dd></dl>

Dalton gives them a better character in this respect, and describes how both sexes love an open-air bath, but the fact that skin diseases are very prevalent among them is, I think, proof that the Garos are not a clean people. This remark applies to the uncivilized Garos only, for the efforts of the American Baptist Mission have resulted in a higher standard of living among their converts. Christian villages show a considerable improvement, and both men and women have learned to clothe themselves and to take a pride in personal cleanliness.' <sup id="cite_ref-1639" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1639">[1,639]</a></sup> Leprosy, malaria and kala-azar were common: 'Uneducated Garos can be called unsophisticated, they are simple and honest. Educated persons are as good as others of the world. Sometimes causes of the bodily sufferings of the Garos, particularly from leprosy, malaria and kala-azar are ascribed to their want of cleanliness and eating of almost all sorts of meat. This may be true to some extent only. The main causes of their sufferings are the malarial climate of the hills, impurity of the spring waters which they use for drinking and other purposes and want of proper treatment in times of need. Poverty is also not less responsible for this.' <sup id="cite_ref-1640" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1640">[1,640]</a></sup> This was due to the climatic and ecological conditions of the hill country: 'As a people, the Garos, both men and women, are short, the former averaging 5 ft. 1½ ins. and the latter 4 ft. 10 ins. In build they are rather lean and wiry than stoutly made, and a fat man is quite a rarity. They do not exhibit the development of the lower limbs that is such a feature of, for instance, the Khasis, but an outdoor life and continual climbing up and down their rugged hills has made them hardy and capable of much endurance. Though strong, they are not remarkable as porters, though in the cold season they make long marches to market with heavy baskets of cotton on their backs. The finest physique is to be met with among the inhabitants of the higher ranges, and among the Atongs of the Someswari valley. In the first case this must be attributed to the healthier climate in which they live, for in the low hills bordering on the plains fever is very common, and in the past, Kala-Azar played havoc among the people of the outer ranges. This fever appears to have first been noticed in 1869, and it existed in epidemic form for many years. Sporadic cases are still found, but the scourge has lost its virulence and the people are recovering from its ravages. Better physique among the Atongs is ascribed by some to the fact that among this section of the tribe marriages are contracted when the parties are of more mature age, though among none of them can child-marriage be said to be in vogue.' <sup id="cite_ref-1641" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1641">[1,641]</a></sup>  'The rainfall all over this tract of country is very heavy, particularly along the foot of the central range which forces the moisture-laden winds from the Bay of Bengal to rise to a cooler at mosphere and thus causes condensation of their water vapour. The average rainfall of Tura during the past five years has been 154·39 ins. The rainfall decreases with the elevation of the hills and distance from the central ridge, and is very much less on the borders of the district than it is in Tura. It is, however, sufficiently heavy to cause a very rank and dense undergrowth to spring up, which is in great part responsible for the unenviable reputation that the district possesses of being malarious.' <sup id="cite_ref-1642" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1642">[1,642]</a></sup> 'The district being next to Cherapunji which claims the greatest rainfall in India, has naturally a very high degree of rainfall throughout the year, particularly between April and August. The foot tracks on the hills during rains become very slippery and difficult to tread. To add to this trouble the forest undergrowths and weeds of various kinds gain luxurious growth during rains and practically cover up the entire area of foot tracks. Different types of pests also appear with the rains. Insects of various kinds and leeches are abundant in the area throughout the rainy season. It is a painful experience to live in the hills during the rains for one who is not habituated with the condition of the land. I had difficulties in pursuading the plains people to accompany me to the hills during the rainy season. Malarial fever in epidemic form appears during the rains and continues up to the autumn. Digestive and other intestinal troubles also are very common amongst the people living in the hills, particularly during this season. In one word, the Garos maintain a miserable existence in the hills during the rainy season. Fortunately, they have not to do much of outdoor work during this season excepting weeding their fields where necessary.' <sup id="cite_ref-1643" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1643">[1,643]</a></sup> Malaria slowed down the expansion of the colonial administration: 'As the power of the British government of India increased in Assam, the problem of unadministered hill areas became ever more acute. There were periodic raids from the hills that could not be effectively controlled. For many years administration of the Garo Hills was delayed by the extremely serious malaria which was, and still is, characteristic of the district. Finally, however, in 1867, the district was occupied, permanent headquarters were established at Tura, and peace was rapidly achieved. The American Baptist Missionary Society sent missionaries to the Garo Hills almost immediately after the government was established, and these were followed, in this century, by Catholic missionaries, with the result that today between one-quarter and one-third of the Garos are Christians, the largest number of them Baptist.' <sup id="cite_ref-1644" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1644">[1,644]</a></sup> The sources report a number of disease outbreaks even during and after the colonial period: 'This ceremony has now attained a national prestige, sponsored as the state festival, and is referred to as festival of the hundred drums. It is one of the major tourist attractions, wherein all the regional dance groups join and perform for the public. Traditionally every member of the village is supposed to participate in these festivals. At times these village festivities ended with breaking of an epidemic like cholera, malaria, small pox or kala-azar and to appease the [Page 125] spirits of these diseases the nokma had to fix a day for performing the animal sacrifice. During such rituals no outsider is allowed to enter the village. This rule is strictly enforced by the nokma.

The original village of Matchakolgiri [Page 44] was in a corner of its adok. The farthest plots were about four miles away from the village. Moreover, tigers often troubled the villagers. So, one of the households of old Matchakolgiri, the head of which was Kiljan, shifted to the present site in about 1947. Afterwards Changnan, the nokma himself shifted to the new site followed by all other households.

In build they are rather lean and wiry than stoutly made, and a fat man is quite a rarity. They do not exhibit the development of the lower limbs that is such a feature of, for instance, the Khasis, but an outdoor life and continual climbing up and down their rugged hills has made them hardy and capable of much endurance. Though strong, they are not remarkable as porters, though in the cold season they make long marches to market with heavy baskets of cotton on their backs. The finest physique is to be met with among the inhabitants of the higher ranges, and among the Atongs of the Someswari valley. In the first case this must be attributed to the healthier climate in which they live, for in the low hills bordering on the plains fever is very common, and in the past, Kala-Azar played havoc among the people of the outer ranges. This fever appears to have first been noticed in 1869, and it existed in epidemic form for many years. Sporadic cases are still found, but the scourge has lost its virulence and the people are recovering from its ravages. Better physique among the Atongs is ascribed by some to the fact that among this section of the tribe marriages are contracted when the parties are of more mature age, though among none of them can child-marriage be said to be in vogue.' <sup id="cite_ref-1649" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1649">[1,649]</a></sup>  'The rainfall all over this tract of country is very heavy, particularly along the foot of the central range which forces the moisture-laden winds from the Bay of Bengal to rise to a cooler at mosphere and thus causes condensation of their water vapour. The average rainfall of Tura during the past five years has been 154·39 ins. The rainfall decreases with the elevation of the hills and distance from the central ridge, and is very much less on the borders of the district than it is in Tura. It is, however, sufficiently heavy to cause a very rank and dense undergrowth to spring up, which is in great part responsible for the unenviable reputation that the district possesses of being malarious.' <sup id="cite_ref-1650" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1650">[1,650]</a></sup> 'The district being next to Cherapunji which claims the greatest rainfall in India, has naturally a very high degree of rainfall throughout the year, particularly between April and August. The foot tracks on the hills during rains become very slippery and difficult to tread. To add to this trouble the forest undergrowths and weeds of various kinds gain luxurious growth during rains and practically cover up the entire area of foot tracks. Different types of pests also appear with the rains. Insects of various kinds and leeches are abundant in the area throughout the rainy season. It is a painful experience to live in the hills during the rains for one who is not habituated with the condition of the land. I had difficulties in pursuading the plains people to accompany me to the hills during the rainy season. Malarial fever in epidemic form appears during the rains and continues up to the autumn. Digestive and other intestinal troubles also are very common amongst the people living in the hills, particularly during this season. In one word, the Garos maintain a miserable existence in the hills during the rainy season. Fortunately, they have not to do much of outdoor work during this season excepting weeding their fields where necessary.' <sup id="cite_ref-1651" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1651">[1,651]</a></sup> Malaria slowed down the expansion of the colonial administration: 'As the power of the British government of India increased in Assam, the problem of unadministered hill areas became ever more acute. There were periodic raids from the hills that could not be effectively controlled. For many years administration of the Garo Hills was delayed by the extremely serious malaria which was, and still is, characteristic of the district. Finally, however, in 1867, the district was occupied, permanent headquarters were established at Tura, and peace was rapidly achieved. The American Baptist Missionary Society sent missionaries to the Garo Hills almost immediately after the government was established, and these were followed, in this century, by Catholic missionaries, with the result that today between one-quarter and one-third of the Garos are Christians, the largest number of them Baptist.' <sup id="cite_ref-1652" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1652">[1,652]</a></sup> The sources report a number of disease outbreaks even during and after the colonial period: 'This ceremony has now attained a national prestige, sponsored as the state festival, and is referred to as festival of the hundred drums. It is one of the major tourist attractions, wherein all the regional dance groups join and perform for the public. Traditionally every member of the village is supposed to participate in these festivals. At times these village festivities ended with breaking of an epidemic like cholera, malaria, small pox or kala-azar and to appease the [Page 125] spirits of these diseases the nokma had to fix a day for performing the animal sacrifice. During such rituals no outsider is allowed to enter the village. This rule is strictly enforced by the nokma. Not complying to the wishes of the nokma amounts to undermining the authority and such cases are dealt with by the traditional councils.' <sup id="cite_ref-1653" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1653">[1,653]</a></sup> 'The original village was named Matchakolgiri (the village of the tiger’s den) because there was a tiger’s den near the village. After the villages separated each village demarcated the limits within which they confined their shifting cultivation ( adok). The original village of Matchakolgiri [Page 44] was in a corner of its adok. The farthest plots were about four miles away from the village. Moreover, tigers often troubled the villagers. So, one of the households of old Matchakolgiri, the head of which was Kiljan, shifted to the present site in about 1947. Afterwards Changnan, the nokma himself shifted to the new site followed by all other households. During that time Kala Azar epidemic spread in the village and as a result many of the households were entirely wiped out. The original households of Matchakolgiri are represented in the village by three households only, namely, households represented by serial Nos. 1, 2 and 3.' <sup id="cite_ref-1654" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1654">[1,654]</a></sup></dd>

In Garo language there is a proverb: “mana nona ok, jikna dena kok,” which signifies that when a man goes to his mother’s or sister’s house, he takes with him his empty stomach to be filled in, and when he goes to his wife and children he takes a basket full of provisions to feed them. This proverb aptly describes the position of the female as ‘ma-no’. Whenever a Garo male visits the house of his female ‘mahari’ (this is not very frequent due to the fact that the Garo follow the rule of matrilocal residence very strictly), he exercises considerable freedom in demanding hospitality; this is known to the Garo as ‘manok chaa’ (enjoying the hospitality of the mother’s house). Moreover, a male always expects help from his mother’s or sister’s household in times of need.

A house must have about fifteen gongs before it is considered decent to use them, and houses which do not own enough must borrow them from a richer neighbor when they are needed. But just to accumulate and own enough gongs is not sufficient; the household must kill a cow for some occasion, such [Page 205] as to honor a parent, before the gongs can be used.

In Rengsanggri eight households owned enough gongs to be used in festivals: those of Gajang, Jengnon, Nanggan, Anat, Kakan, Chondu, Rongsin, and Gurang.

</p>
<dl><dd><b>♠ Staple ♣ ♥</b> Note: Prior to colonization, the A’chik were not governed by a state structure. Clans and lineages exercised social control on the village and local levels: ‘In Garo society the most important social group is the clan known as MACHONG. A machong is an exogamous matrilineal descent group wherein a Garo is automatically assigned by birth to the unilineal group of his mother. A CHATCHI (moiety) is divided into many machong. Each married couple chooses one daughter--or, if they have none, they adopt a close relative of the mother--to be heiress (NAKNA DONQIPIKA MECHIK) of the family. Her husband traditionally is selected from the lineage group of the father and is accepted as the NOKROM of the house. He resides with his wife in her parents' house.

The age differences are otherwise symbolized  in only one way-the order in which rice beer is served. When beer is first passed out at a gathering, the people should be served in order of formal seniority. A maternal uncle should be served before his nephew, and an older brother before a younger one. Even an older sister may precede a younger brother, though generally men and women do not drink together. [...] In spite of this formal deference, older people do not monopolize positions of power, and an old person cannot exercise authority outside his lineage simply because of his age. One defers to one’s lineage seniors, but not to old people in general.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1674" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1674">[1,674]</a></sup> Village headmen acted as intermediaries in local disputes: ‘Among the Garos most disputes arise over the issues of property, inheritance, and domestic quarrels within the family. Such problems are to a large extent settled by the MAHARI (lineage) of the offended and the offender. A new situation develops when someone's cattle cause damage to another's crops. Under such situation the NOKMA (village headman) acts as an intermediary only. If he fails to settle the dispute, the matter can go to the civil court of the district council.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1675" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1675">[1,675]</a></sup>  ‘Traditionally, the  nokma’s position was connected with the indigeneous customary rites. His temporal and ritual powers in a traditional society were linked with his position. The conversion of a  nokma to Christianity automatically led to the loss of his ritualistic role. When the  nokma’s were endowed with real temporal power, the resistance was great as  Nokmas were non-Christians. But when the  Nokma accepted Christianity,  nokmaship passed to another person who could act as a  nokma in performing rites and rituals. However, the Government still recognized the converted persons as  nokmas. This created dislocation in the traditional system, one looking after the customary right and other ritual responsibilities. As the author has tried to show that in the traditional system the two roles cannot be separated, the two roles are enmeshed into each other.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1676" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1676">[1,676]</a></sup> Nokmas also formally held titles to land: ‘In a Garo village very little difference of status is seen. A particular clan holds right of ownership of the village homestead and shifting cultivation lands, and the title of ownership is inherited by a particular household. The head of the land-owning household is known as the  nokma, and the particular area under which he holds ownership right is known as   a’king. He also acts as the religious head of the village, and he is to perform the ceremonies for the general well-being of the village. He is called upon to settle disputes between villagers. But in all his decisions he is guided by the elders of the village. He is not entitled to any tribute from the villagers, and he has no special paraphernalia to indicate himself as the  nokma. However, in the village a rich man gets respect, because in times of need people have to seek help from him. But in a Garo village it is usually very rare to find an extremely rich man. To a Garo wealth consists of a number of brass gongs called  rang and some ornaments made of silver or some such metal. Now-a-days a gun is also regarded as the status symbol of a wealthy man.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1677" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1677">[1,677]</a></sup> Formalization was largely absent from village councils and trials: ‘The Rules require the village court to “try all suits and cases in accordance with the customary laws of the village.” Village courts are supposed to be non-professional bodies and decide [minor, village-level] cases in an informal atmosphere without procedural technicalities and formalities.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1678" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1678">[1,678]</a></sup> During colonial rule, supralocal executive offices were superimposed onto village- and lineage-based A’chik structures: ‘When the Britishers took over the administration of this district, one witnessed an imposition of hierarchy of new political and administrative units in the district over the traditional democratic village set-up. The British Government, being actuated with the desire to have effective control over the villages and to facilitate the collection of revenues and house tax introduced the office of  laskar with limited police, civil and criminal powers. Accordingly there was a  laskar over a circle of villages; each having jurisdiction covering ten or twelve of villages. Although, the villagers were left to settle all disputes through the  nokma and the village courts, they had right to appeal to the court of  laskars against the decisions of the village councils.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1679" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1679">[1,679]</a></sup> ’In the same way the introduction of offices of  sardar, hill  mandal and hill  mauzadar curtailed the powers and authorities of the  nokmas and their village councils. The new offices were created for the effective administration over the Garo with  the idea of village self-government under the direct control of Deputy Commissioner at the centre.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1680" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1680">[1,680]</a></sup> Village headmen and elders were not bureaucrats, but mediated between village self-governance and colonial authorities: ‘Many of the disputes of the Garos were decided in their village  Panchayats. When a man has some complaints against another he reports them to the Nokma or the village-head. If the nature of the complaints is simple, the Nokma in a meeting of the few leading persons of the village, decides the dispute; but if the nature of the complaints is complicated and not easy of solution the Nokma reports the matter to the Laskar. The Laskar is a very important and influential man in the Garo Hills District. The hills areas are divided into some elekas and each of such elekas is placed under a Laskar for convenient collection of the house tax as well as for deciding the disputes of small nature locally. The Laskar need not essentially be a literate man, worldly prudence is enough for the management of his eleka. In practice a Laskar wields immense influence in his eleka.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1681" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1681">[1,681]</a></sup> The degree of professionalization differs according to administrative level, with full-time bureaucrats restricted to the higher ones. Judges employed at government courts and other top officials functioned on a higher administrative level than the native village councils and were solely dependent on the colonial or independent Indian district executive: ‘During the first few years of the British rule in Assam the district of Garo Hills was treated as a part of the Goalpara district. The whole tract was placed under a Civil Commissioner. This officer took into his hands the collection of rents claimed by the Zaminders from the Garos, and abolished the duties levied by them on the hill producers. For some years a policy of  non-interference was followed but without the desired success; so it was decided to appoint an officer-in-charge of the hills and in 1869 a.d. the Garo Hills were formed into a separate district with Tura as its headquarters. It is said in some parts of the district even now that the British administrators had to get away with many of the influential chiefs and other men of the tribe by killing them for, they could not easily bow down to the foreigners. Once this hills area was completely brouht undegr the control of the government, the Garos lived peacefully.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1682" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1682">[1,682]</a></sup> ‘The judicial officers (who preside over those courts) are appointed by, or with the approval of the Governor. The rules as to administration of justice do not contain specific provisions as to their tenure and salary, or as to their full time or part time character. But most of these matters will be regulated as rules or orders issued under Rule 15 of the Assam Autonomous Districts (Constitution of District Councils) Rules, 1951. It may be of interest to note that there is a specific prohibition against a member of the Executive Committee being appointed to these courts. To this extent, their independence is protected. A legal practitioner can appear before these courts. But in cases where an accused is not arrested, the legal practitioner takes the permission of the District Council Court for such appearance.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1683" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1683">[1,683]</a></sup> Positions given to native petty officials were less formalized: ‘The  loskor has several duties. He collects the house tax within his district, keeping a fixed portion of this as his own payment, and he organizes work parties to keep the roads open. His most important duty, however, is to supervise and try to settle legal disputes. The  loskor sometimes appoints one or more assistants called  sordars, to whom the District Council pays an annual stipend of 100 Rupees, together with a shirt and a pair of short pants. Saljing, who lived in Rengsanggri, was a  sordar; but not every village had one, and a  sordar does not have jurisdiction over a particular village. As a general assistant to the  loskor he may assist in collecting information about a dispute, and in petty matters a  sordar may sit as representative of the  loskor and preside at a trial. The  loskorship demands a large part of a man’s time, but a  sordar spends most of his time working in his fields like his neighbors.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1684" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1684">[1,684]</a></sup> The material seems to indicate that native officials performed their duties on a part-time basis only. Appointed officials on the lower, less professionalized level received stipends or drew their wages from tax income. Lineage elders were appointed to colonial courts on a temporary basis, but only as advisers: ‘The District Council may, whenever it deems necessary, also nominate two or more local elders well conversant with the tribal usages and customary laws, to sit with the judicial officer of the court as a bench and may, by order, invest such bench with any of the powers conferred or conferrable by or under the rules for the trial of suits and cases based on the tribal usages and the tribal customary laws only.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1685" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1685">[1,685]</a></sup> While village headmen were acknowledged by the British administration, the imposition of appointed officials led to a loss of political power among Nokmas: ’In the same way the introduction of offices of  sardar, hill  mandal and hill  mauzadar curtailed the powers and authorities of the  nokmas and their village councils. The new offices were created for the effective administration over the Garo with  the idea of village self-government under the direct control of Deputy Commissioner at the centre.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1686" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1686">[1,686]</a></sup> ‘There was a move for retention of the old institution of  nokmaship which could not function with authority since the British administration had appointed the  laskars and  sardars for the smooth running of their administration from 1824 onwards. The  nokmas became only the clan chief and custodian of the clan land  a’king. The  nokma could not administer effectively as he used to do prior to the British administration in the district. The  nokmas were supposed to be well versed with their functions and duties in the villages. The British administration enforced the Rules of Administration of Justice in the Garo Hills both Civil and Police in 1937. These rules have been renewed again and again. They are in use till the present day. The head of the district administration was the Deputy Commissioner and his Assistants and it has never been changed.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1687" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1687">[1,687]</a></sup> The result was a complex system made up of colonial administrators, native headmen, and petty officials who mediated between formal and informal forms of authority.</dd>

<p><b>♠ Degree of taxation ♣ present ♥</b> [The guidelines in the Code Book are unclear on this one.] Nokmas were not entitled to tribute from co-villagers: ‘In a Garo village very little difference of status is seen. A particular clan holds right of ownership of the village homestead and shifting cultivation lands, and the title of ownership is inherited by a particular household. The head of the land-owning household is known as the  nokma, and the particular area under which he holds ownership right is known as   a’king. He also acts as the religious head of the village, and he is to perform the ceremonies for the general well-being of the village. He is called upon to settle disputes between villagers. But in all his decisions he is guided by the elders of the village. He is not entitled to any tribute from the villagers, and he has no special paraphernalia to indicate himself as the  nokma. However, in the village a rich man gets respect, because in times of need people have to seek help from him. But in a Garo village it is usually very rare to find an extremely rich man. To a Garo wealth consists of a number of brass gongs called  rang and some ornaments made of silver or some such metal. Now-a-days a gun is also regarded as the status symbol of a wealthy man.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1688" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1688">[1,688]</a></sup> During British rule, a colonial administrative structure was superimposed onto the native system of informal leadership: 'During the first few years of the British rule in Assam the district of Garo Hills was treated as a part of the Goalpara district. The whole tract was placed under a Civil Commissioner. This officer took into his hands the collection of rents claimed by the Zaminders from the Garos, and abolished the duties levied by them on the hill produces.

Today its relation to the State of Assam and to the Indian nation are defined by the Indian constitution. The Deputy Commissioner’s office established by the British continues as the chief local arm of the state administration, supervising state schools, roads, and [Page 244] forests. Certain legal problems, including such major crimes as murder and treason, remain under the jurisdiction of its court. In the time of British rule the Deputy Commissioner was always British; since then he has been a plains Indian, usually a member of the Indian Civil Service. The constitution, however, provided for the establishment of a new District Council, to be composed of about twenty members elected from several constituencies into which the district was divided. This council elects from among its members a “chief executive member” just as the parliament in New Delhi chooses the national prime minister. Jurisdiction of Garo customary law was transferred to the District Council, and courts were established to judge disputes covered by this law. The collection of various taxes, including the important house tax, was likewise transferred, and the District Council began to build roads, to open schools, and to administer forests. In 1956, the jurisdictional boundaries between it and the Deputy Commissioner’s office had not yet become completely clear.' <sup id="cite_ref-1690" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1690">[1,690]</a></sup> Colonial administrators also introduced taxation. Native petty officials were responsible for the collection of taxes: ’In the same way the introduction of offices of  sardar, hill  mandal and hill  mauzadar curtailed the powers and authorities of the  nokmas and their village councils. The new offices were created for the effective administration over the Garo with  the idea of village self-government under the direct control of Deputy Commissioner at the centre.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1691" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1691">[1,691]</a></sup> ‘When the Britishers took over the administration of this district, one witnessed an imposition of hierarchy of new political and administrative units in the district over the traditional democratic village set-up.

He was the agency through which the Lashkar collected house-tax from the villagers. The nokma was also expected to arrange for the accommodation, food and comforts of government officers touring in his a’king. It was also the responsibility of the nokma to arrange free labour ( begal) for touring officers, and they were assigned the task of clearing bridle paths annually by free labour of the villagers. Now, there is no begal system nor can the villagers be forced to contribute free labour to clear bridle paths. House-tax is usually collected by the Secretary of the Village Council (which is a body [Page 142] constituted by the District Council). So, the nokma is now left with the only responsibility of looking after the comforts of government officers whenever they happen to visit his village. It involves no power; and it is considered rather as a liability than as a duty which he fulfils, only with a little grudge.' <sup id="cite_ref-1694" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1694">[1,694]</a></sup> Mauzadars were also responsible for the collection of taxes: 'The post of Mauzadar was created in 1878 for the purpose of assessing and collecting the land revenues, house tax and other taxes. There were two types of mauzadars: the hill mauzadar and the plain mauzadar. Captain H.J. Peet had appointed four Garo boys as hill mauzadars who could read and write Bengali. They were all Christians and got education in missionary schools. This post continues till today. There are ten mauzas in the entire district. Each Mauzadar was assisted by a Mandal whom the Mauzadar appointed with the approval of Deputy Commissioner of the district. The post of Mandal also had both the hill mandal and the plain mandal who were supposed to assist the Mauzadar in their own capacities. The Mauzadar had to take them in his tours of inspection in the villages and settle some disputes on a’king or revenue matters. The plain mandals were trained by the Survey Department and their function was survey and demarcation of lands. The office of Kanungo was also [Page 56] established to supervise the work of twelve mandals in the plain areas of Garo Hills district. The post was created after all other posts. Kanungo worked purely as a revenue official.' <sup id="cite_ref-1695" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1695">[1,695]</a></sup> Burling describes land taxes and house taxes: 'Once land has been prepared for wet cultivation it can, of course, be cultivated year after year and need no longer be retired periodically like dry fields. The district government has recognized the right of the man who clears land to use it continuously, but has demanded the payment of an annual land tax. Within a few years after preparation, the clearer can expect his lands to be surveyed by the district government, and thereafter to be taxed. This arrangement is not entirely unwelcome, since his name is recorded at the same time and he is thus officially recognized as having the right to cultivate the land. However, the clearer does not immediately have full ownership. Rather, his rights first amount only to what is locally known as “temporary patta,” which is a grant of rights of usufruct. Normally such land can be inherited in the usual fashion but cannot be sold, and if timber should be standing on the land, the government reserves the right to prevent its being cut. [Page 306] Moreover, if the government should require the use of the land for such purposes as road-building, the cultivator must surrender his plot without compensation. After a good many years the land may be converted to “permanent patta.” The cultivator then has full ownership rights, including the right of sale and the right to compensation if the land is needed for government purposes. He continues to pay a tax to the district government in proportion to the amount of land registered in his name. Tax on wet rice land is collected by a number of special tax officials called mausidars, each of whom has jurisdiction over a certain area. Under the mausidars are lesser officials in charge of the land records of the smaller “circles.” Villagers in plains areas may pay a land tax but no house tax. House tax alone is collected in villages with no wet rice, but some villages have to pay both. House tax, unlike land tax, however, is channeled through the loskor. Land held under “permanent patta” is bought and sold from time to time. The price paid for the land is agreed to by buyer and seller. Such prices have not been exorbitant in terms of the value of the crop which it can produce; they rarely amount to more than three times the value of the annual crop, and are sometimes even less. New land potentially usable for wet cultivation has been available readily enough to prevent serious bidding up of the land values, and Garos have not been cultivating in this manner long enough to have come to place great faith in land as an investment. Even so, this type of private land ownership has helped to alter the distribution of wealth quite sharply in villages where it has become important. Inevitably some people show more foresight than others in opening wet plots, and in many areas of long-established wet rice cultivation a few large proprietors own more land than they are able to cultivate by their own labor. They therefore either hire labor or, more often, let their land out on shares to others who have failed to acquire wet fields. When land is thus worked on shares, the owner generally provides the seed, but the harvest is split equally between the [Page 307] owner and the cultivator. The owner may also advance rice for the cultivator and his family to eat, without changing any interest; but the rice must be paid back at the time of the harvest. Such a loan is looked upon as a distinct advantage for the cultivator, since only in this way can he avoid heavy interest on a rice loan. Working on shares has not yet led to a serious problem of absentee land ownership, for even the largest proprietor usually lets out only part of his land, and retains enough for his family to work themselves. He and his tenant continue to do the same kind of labor, to live in the same village, and to treat each other as social equals, the contractual relationship not giving rise to any marked status differences. Nevertheless, such an agreement gives a pronounced economic advantage to the owner, for he gets half his tenant’s harvest in return for very little work or responsibility. Since many villages with large areas of wet rice land include a number of families who own no wet fields at all, while there are other families who control three or four times as much land as they require for their own use, these villages are often marked by a greater disparity in income than are those which depend entirely upon traditional methods of cultivation. In wet rice areas this variation in wealth is often immediately apparent to the most casual visitor. Such a village may have two or three large plank houses with corrugated iron roofs-structures more solid, permanent, and elegant than the traditional bamboo houses, if not much more comfortable. At the same time, other villagers are likely to live in small bamboo shacks which the people of Rengsanggri would hardly consider decent.' <sup id="cite_ref-1696" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1696">[1,696]</a></sup> The collection of taxes on markets and trade was farmed out as well: 'The markets are under the general jurisdiction of the District Council. The Council “sells” the right to collect certain taxes and fees to an individual whom the Garos speak of as the ‘owner’ of the market, though he has to renew his contract with the District Council each year. The ‘owner’ pays a fixed sum to the Council, and this provides an important source of revenue, as much as several thousand rupees from each market. The ‘owner’ has to ensure his profit by enforcing the collection of fees as rigidly as possible, and an able man can make a considerable profit in a year of market operations. The District Council fixes the legal fees. These are mostly levied on the seller of any merchandise, and may be determined by the quantity sold. Four annas, for instance, are charged to the seller of each maund of cotton that changes hands. In other cases each salesman is taxed regardless of what he sells; for example, each cloth merchant pays a fixed market fee of eight annas. Many Garos believe that unscrupulous market ‘owners’ charge more than the stipulated fees and thereby line their own pockets at the expense of the farmers who do not know the rules very well. I [Page 275] was told, for instance, that the proper tax on the sale of a cow is twelve annas, but that ‘owners’ sometimes manage to charge this fee to both the buyer and seller, thereby collecting twice the amount they are entitled to. The ‘owner’ has certain responsibilities in addition to paying a sum to the District Council. He must keep the sheds in repair, and must hire somebody to sweep up the debris after the people have left. The ‘owner’ of the Rongram market also had to hire several assistants to make the rounds and collect the taxes for him.' <sup id="cite_ref-1697" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1697">[1,697]</a></sup> Sinha provides a general description of the administrative system: 'For administrative purposes, the area being a backward tract, inhabited by the Garo tribe who are primitive in their culture, the district of Garo Hills has been grouped under the partially excluded areas of Assam. The Governor of Assam has special power over the administrative machinery of the district. The local administration of the Garo Hills is entrusted to a Deputy Commissioner whose headquarters is at Tura. The Deputy Commissioner is the judicial and executive head of the district. The Divisional Forest Officer of the Garo Hills looks after the reserve forest and forest produces of the district. The reserve forest areas and plantations, i.e., aforestation work in general, as also the preservation of forest are looked after by this officer. Under the Deputy Commissioner, there are Assistant Deputy Commissioners to help him in his various functions. The whole of the district has been divided into a number of small areas known as elaka (jurisdiction). There is a Laskar over each elaka who has been empowered to decide minor judicial matters to try cases locally and also to collect revenues from the villagers. Some minor executive functions have also been delegated to the Laskar. He gets a sort of commission over the realised revenue and fines collected within his jurisdiction. A Laskar has a few Sardars under him who serve as his peons and sometimes as his assistants to help him in his work. A Laskar in certain cases may ask a Sardar to go to a village to conduct a trial where it may not be possible for him to attend personally. In matters of greater importance, however, a Laskar decides the case personally. There are usually two kinds of Nokmas: (a) the village headman called Songni Nokma and (b) Akhing Nokma, i.e., the Landlord. The Songni Nokma has jurisdiction only over the village he lives in, and any trouble arising in the village is usually settled by him and is referred to him for necessary redress. If the decision be beyond his jurisdiction, the case is taken up by the Laskar or is sent up to Tura for the Deputy Commissioner’s decision. On ceremonial occasions, the Nokma is respected. On such occasions, liquor is first offered to him after it has been offered to the deity connected with the festival or the ceremony. The Akhing Nokma is a nominal head over the area of land and hillocks under him. If anyone desires to settle within his elaka or to cultivate any portion of the land within his jurisdiction, he must have the consent of Akhing Nokma before he can do so; sometimes a sort of small royalty is paid to him, but this is not [Page 13] compulsory. He can, however, demand a very small portion of the produce of the land on the first occasion. In lieu of this, some sort of forest products, such as bamboo and timber, may be given to him by cultivators within his elaka. He has absolute right to refuse land to anyone without assigning any reason. But this is almost never done. In a few villages, a third kind of Nokma known as Gana Nokma can also be seen. I have given a short description of this Gana Nokma at the end of this chapter. Besides the Deputy Commissioner, the Garos are very much afraid of the Laskar who has the authority to inflict very severe corporal punishment on the culprits and also the right to impose heavy fine. A Mauzadar is a tax collector.' <sup id="cite_ref-1698" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1698">[1,698]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Wages ♣ ♥</b> Note: Most of the population relied on subsistence agriculture: ‘Traditionally, the Garos living in the hills subsist by slash-and-burn cultivation. The iron hoe, chopper, and wooden digging stick are essential appliances. Human labor continue to be the principal source of energy. Very often in some areas a plot allotted to a family remains under-used because of an insufficient number of workers and the low level of technology. To survive the erratic nature of monsoons, mixed crops--both wet and dry varieties--are planted. A shifting cultivator plants a wide assortment of crops consisting of rice (mainly dry varieties), millet, maize and many root crops, vegetables, etc. In addition to these, cotton, ginger, and chili peppers are commonly raised as cash crops. All crops are harvested in October. At present the available strips of low and flat land lying between the hillocks or hills are used for permanent wet cultivation. The variety of crops cultivated is like that of the neighboring plains peoples. Such lands are owned individually. Additional production from such plots places the villagers in a better economic condition. The expansion of the modern economy and the steady increase of population are causing constant pressure on traditionally-worked plots. The same plot is used almost continuously in some areas thus leading to the decline in annual production. This trend is evident from the 1981 census report, which estimates that about 50 percent of the Garo people are now solely dependent on shifting cultivation and the rest use a part of a jhum plot permanently for areca nut, oranges, tea (on a small scale), pineapples, etc. In this changing situation a producer may not always be a consumer; and reciprocity and cooperation do not exist as a dominant force in the socioeconomic life of this population.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1699" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1699">[1,699]</a></sup> ‘The division of labor between members of the household is as follows: the males are responsible for clearing jungle and setting fire to the debris for shifting cultivation, while women are responsible for planting, weeding and harvesting.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1700" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1700">[1,700]</a></sup> There was some trade based on cash crops: 'A few centuries ago the Garos were famous for headhunting. That practice constrained the neighboring population of the plains from entering the hills. But people must exchange their produce to meet their requirements, and both hill and plains Garos needed such trade. Hence some trade started at border points on a very limited scale. Over time, these contacts grew into organized HUTTA (weekly markets) under the initiative of the Zamindars, who were subjects of the Muslim ruler. Initially cotton was exchanged in silent barter for pigs, cattle, goat, tobacco and metallic tools. This trade has continued to the present, with increasing involvement of peoples from the neighboring areas, and has now become fully monetized. Cotton, ginger and, dried chilies produced by the Garos are sold to the traders. The Garos in turn purchase pottery, metallic tools, and other industrial goods such as cloth from the traders.' <sup id="cite_ref-1701" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1701">[1,701]</a></sup>  Roy mentions commercial pottery and weaving: 'Each family in a traditional context acts as a self-contained economic unit. Modernization has brought some changes in the socioeconomic sphere of this population. The Garos residing in the hills did not weave cloth a few decades back; they used to procure thick cloth known as KANCHA from the plains Garos. Now that the loom has been introduced in the hill areas, they weave DOKMANDE (a kind of cloth) for commercial purposes as well as for their personal use. Previously each family used to make pottery for its domestic use, nowadays the art is confined to a few families only who either sell or barter it.' <sup id="cite_ref-1702" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1702">[1,702]</a></sup> Writing in the post-independence period, Majumdar describes agricultural labour in permanent cultivation: 'The household is the working unit in permanent cultivation also. Some of the households of Wajadagiri engage agricultural labourers for the whole agricultural season, whose day to day expenditures are borne by the household concerned and a remuneration of 12 to 15 maunds of paddy (the rate prevailing in 1965) is to be given at the end of the winter harvest. This remuneration is paid even though the person engaged is related to the husband or to the wife. The person who is thus engaged is known as chaparikgipa, and he is expected to help in all agricultural activities. Additional labour required at the time of transplantation is procured by the system of ajak and this happens to be the only feature which we find common in shifting cultivation of Matchakolgiri and permanent cultivation of Wajadagiri. However, in Matchakolgiri the system of ajak is not confined to agricultural activities only. It is used for getting labour for other purposes also, such as in constructing a house, in cutting of thatching grass, etc. But in non-agricultural activities usually only a meal is provided and no remuneration in cash or kind is given. Harvesting and thrashing are done with the help of annual agricultural labourers. At the time of winnowing, neighbouring villages help each other and the owner has to feed the helpers and sometimes provides one or two pitchers of beer.' <sup id="cite_ref-1703" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1703">[1,703]</a></sup> But his report also suggests the absence of occupational classes: ‘All the households of Wajadagiri are subsistence cultivators. Though some of the households can sell a part of their produce just after the harvest, there is no large scale farmer selling major portion of their produce for cash. There are no occupational groups in the village. Nor do they borrow the services of occupational groups from the plains. In this respect the contrast with the non-Garo population in the surrounding villages is interesting. The Koch and the Hajong of the neighbouring areas utilize the services of barbers from the plains, who are annualy remunerated  by giving a fixed quantity of paddy by each household. However, some of the Wajadagiri people, who can manage a small sum of money, occasionally do a little prospective business of cash crops. But nobody has yet taken up trading as a wholetime occupation.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1704" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1704">[1,704]</a></sup> ‘No occupational classes have developed in the village. Individuals and households change over from one occupation to another. One household occasionally deals in dry fish. Three of the households possess some permanent agricultural lands in the plains areas. Though the owners do not cultivate these lands themselves, they get their lands cultivated on share-crop basis and bring the owner’s half of the yield to the village for consumption.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1705" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1705">[1,705]</a></sup> As most A’chik were not permanently employed in wage labour, the below variables may not be applicable.
