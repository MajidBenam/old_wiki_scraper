<dl><dd>General description</dd>
<dd>During the Monte Alban IIIB and IV periods (500-900 CE) in the Valley of Oaxaca Monte Alban and the capital of the neighbouring state, Teotihuacaln declined, with public buildings no longer being maintained and the population of the capitals declining. A mixture of internal and external reasons for this decline are suggested, and has been summed up by Flannery and Marcus: ‘...without the ever-present competitive threat of Teotihuacan, there was one less reason to support what already had become a maladaptive concentration of population on an unproductive 400-m mountaintop.’<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> Unfortunately, detailed chronological data from this period is not present as the ceramic sequences of the IIIB and IV phases are very difficult to differentiate and radiocarbon dates have yet to refine the sequence.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>The IIIb and IV phases have therefore been combined as one phase on this page. During this phase the population which had previously occupied the capital dispersed into smaller settlements throughout the valley and the valley became occupied by a series of militaristic ‘city states,<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> which lasted until the arrival of the Spanish in the 1520s.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>Population and political organization</dd>
<dd>As the Zapotec state was in a process of fragmentation into smaller polities, the actual extent of any polity in the Valley of Oaxaca is very difficult to determine for this period. <sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> Although the polity was politically fragmented, nobles continued to occupy hereditary positions of power, which were legitimated through their relationship with their ancestors.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> Nobles continued to have control over and exclusive access to  resources and exercised rights not available to commoners “Members of ruling houses, for example, had the right to engage in warfare, take captives, play the ballgame, and offer human sacrifices.”<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>The overall population of the valley grew during this period, although people were no longer unified under one polity. <sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> The population of the whole valley has been  estimated at 90,000-200,000 people. <sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup></dd></dl>

The archaeological data indicate that much of this architectural complexity was in existence by Monte Alban II (100 B.C. through A.D. 200). Many of these buildings do not appear to have been residential and most likely served an array of religious (e.g., the various structures associated with two-room temples), military (such as Building J and perhaps the Ballcourt), and other "administrative" functions (including a variety of other public/institutional buildings the functions of which are still unclear). At the same time, it is probably also appropriate to consider the quihuitao (royal palace) to be another example of a public/institutional building. Both the main candidate for a quihuitao at Monte Alban (the Patio Hundido complex, according to Flannery) and also the example recently excavated at El Palenque (which was probably the capital of a rival independent state polity in Late Formative times) near San Martin Tilcajete (see Spencer and Redmond 2004 in Lat Am Antiq, and Redmond and Spencer 2017 PNAS) were not associated with tombs like other elite (and non-elite) residences; also, both examples had "residential" as well as "ceremonial/governmental" components. Note that the El Palenque quihuitao is securely dated to the Late Monte Albán I phase (300-100 B.C.)'.<sup id="cite_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-60">[60]</a></sup>

These Zapotec kings were often shown paired with queens.
