<p>The Yemeni Coastal Plain or Plateau is the northwestern region of modern Yemen that lies between the Red Sea and the Yemeni Mountains. Here, we are interested in the phase of its prehistory known as the Late Bronze Age (c. 1200-801 BCE). Yemeni Bronze Age communities relied on farming and animal husbandry, though bronze itsems, shells, semi-precious stones, and obsidian all suggest that trade networks were well established at this time.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>
</p><p>No serious works on the estimates for the area and population in the Neolithic and Bronze Age Yemen.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> Similarly, no speculation could be found in the literature regarding possible forms of political organisation prevalent at the time; from an archaeological perspective. However, it is worth noting that some sites were larger than others, and that the larger sites differed from smaller ones in their layout as well as their size,<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> suggesting perhaps a hierarchical relationship between the two types. Moreover, some sites included buildings that were significantly larger than others, and that stood apart from the other buildings as well; though their precise function remains difficult to ascertain, certain features, such as benches along the walls, suggest public use.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>

Widespread refers to the degree of coverage a ritual has in a polity and therefore to the proportion of the overall population that participates in or observes a ritual. Keep in mind that it is possible that the ritual with the highest coverage is not necessarily a mass ritual performed at one location, but can be a ritual that is performed all over the polity and of which the aggregate of the audiences represent the largest degree of coverage.

</p><p>For the purposes of this project we define an institution as a system of social norms that governs the behavior of individuals in certain contexts, with social norms understood simply as socially transmitted rules of behavior. Institutions are also understood as being generally persistent across generations, changing only slowly over time although sometimes changing suddenly through some shock or radical social change. A classic example of an institution is marriage, which governs the behavior of the spouses in the context of their family and household. Particular norms within this institution describe the expected division of labor, rights and obligations of the partners, their children, and in-laws, etc. Because norms are socially transmitted rules, they are an example of a cultural element (by our definition, culture is any kind of socially transmitted information). There are other definitions of norms and institutions, but the one given here was chosen for its compatibility with the theoretical framework of cultural evolution (and this definition is not incompatible with alternative ones, e.g. institutions as alternative equilibria). It is often useful to distinguish formal from informal institutions. In the following, we will ask whether an institution is legally prescribed (part of a constitution or formal law code) or something that is an unwritten rule that, nevertheless, reflects the way things are done, and are expected to be done.
</p><p>We define 'elite' as the top social, political, economic, and/or religious members of society. In the codes below, when we say to code as 'equal to top nobility', we are referring to the society's elite groups and families. 'Higher than top nobility', then, refers to the ruling family, and 'lower than top nobility' refers to all people at a lower status than the elite groups and families.

<p>While the codes above reflect a legal or explicit right of some group to constrain the executive power, below code for non-formal limits. These include social or cultural norms which limit the action that can be seen as legitimately undertaken by the executive, for instance an unwritten restriction against an executive making changes to or decisions on religious matters. It is possible to code for all four combinations of absent/present along the formal/informal institution. So there could be the legal right to criticize a chief executive but it’s never used. Or, there may not be a law that specifies how the ruler is criticized, but there is an established practice of doing so. Where coding ‘present’ provide explanation and examples. Note that you should only code non-violent actions (so a rebellion that overthrows the head of state is not an instance of informal ‘impeachment’)

<p>In this section we are interested in whether religious or supernatural agents impose limits on executive power. These codes refer to both formal, legal restrictions as well as informal constraints including social or cultural norms which limit the action that can be seen as legitimately undertaken by the executive, for instance an unwritten restriction against an executive making changes to or decisions on religious matters. Explain in descriptive section whether the constraint was formal or informal. ‘Religious agents’ here refers to religious groups, their leaders, or even religiously motivated individuals who are not leaders (e.g., Buddhist monks, street preachers)

<dd> <b>♠ Constraint on executive by religious agents ♣ ♥</b>  absent/present/unknown</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Constraint on executive by religious institutions ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. This refers to religious practices or norms that work to constrain the activity of the executive. This differs from the above code in that this code refers to restrictions imposed without the need for religious ‘agents’ specifically to act. For example, witchcraft accusations or the threat of such accusations could serve to limit the activity of political actors and act as a normative-behavior reinforcement. Explain in paragraph what the institution is and which groups of people are constrained by it.</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Impeachment by religious agents ♣ ♥</b>  absent/present/unknown</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Subordination of the chief executive to a religious agent ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. For example, the rulers acknowledge that there is a higher power above them</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Motivation by belief in supernatural agent ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. In this position, code situations when chief executives take on personal costs or otherwise make prosocial or selfless actions where it is stated or believed to be because of internalized religious conviction. For example, a ruler dedicating war spoils to a temple rather than using them for personal benefit. Unlike the previous position (subordination), which can be theoretical, here we are looking for actual instances when leaders were motivated to do prosocial acts by religious considerations</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Customary mechanism ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. There is a broadly agreed-upon or customary mechanism (although perhaps not explicitly spelled out in law – see below) for power transfer. Explain how it was accomplished</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Legal mechanism ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. Provide details (e.g., specified in constitution)</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Number of power transitions ♣ ♥</b> All transfers of power of the chief executive/head of state, noting whether it was done according to an orderly, consensual mechanism, or as a result of contested action (e.g., rebellion, coup d’état). Enter the total number of transitions here and list each one in the paragraph. Note Dynastic transitions where applicable</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Number of contested transitions ♣ ♥</b> How many transitions were contested (out of the total entered above), regardless of which party won the contest (i.e. incumbent or contesting agent). 1. We do not count as a contested transition any challenge that begins after 365 days have elapsed of the new reign. Caveat: care must be taken to record cases just after the cut off. We want to know when the conflict started. The reign end date of the previous ruler only tells us when the contest ended. Though a major event (e.g. a battle) can occur one and a half years after the new king's coronation the infighting/contest that lead up to it often begins earlier, such as immediately after the accession, or sometime within the first year. That infighting can be ignored by any historian who wants to simplify the text to mention only the battle. 2. Multiple separate contests within the transition timeframe should be counted as ONE contested transition. (Do not take time searching for the details of multiple separate contests but if all the detail is present in the same text opportunistically record it in the description field). 3. A transition can be contested before the new ruler is officially crowned.</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Number of successful overturns ♣ ♥</b> How many contested transitions of power resulted in an overturn of the ruler. This includes breaks in the normal line of succession (i.e. a dynastic succession was broken, a different party or ethnic group took power, or a rebellion resulted in a change to the rules or procedures regarding powers transitions) or when a relative overturns the ruler unexpectedly within the expected line of succession. Note: There will often be 'succession crises' when there is no 'normal line of succession' so that there will be a 'contested transition' with no possibility of a successful overturn: i.e. 1. The dynasty ends with no heir (typical cause of a succession crisis); 2. The previous ruler has died and divided the kingdom between his sons (who then decide to fight for it all); 3. There is no formal succession procedure and every succession is a fight (e.g. Mamluk Sultanate). These cases should not qualify as a successful overturn as nobody is being overturned.</dd></dl>

</p><p><b>Authority over state-level administrators</b>
</p><p>These codes refer to the type of control that rulers or the executive branch of government exerts over its state-level administrators.
</p>
<dl><dd><b>♠ Direct ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. Direct means that the executive maintains tight control over the appointment, removal, assessment, and duties of state-level officials</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Indirect ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. Indirect means that the executive influences the activities of administrators (i.e. by ability to remove administrator from office, or by promoting certain religious or ethical norms that influence administrative behavior), but has not explicit legal authority to determine their actions. E.g. senatorial governors in the Roman Empire assigned to govern a province by the Emperor, but with little oversight once in place</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Diffused ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. Diffused means that administrators act largely on their own accord, whether they are aligned with the interests of the ruler or not. The executive retains only minimal control over the officials, typically informal pressure such as a broad agreement for reciprocal military, political, or economic aid (e.g. the control of feudal monarchs in Medieval Europe). This can include officials who are selected and removed with or without the executive's control (i.e. hereditary control of an office by a certain kin-group)</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Mixed ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. Some combination of the above. Explain</dd>

<dd><b>♠ Land ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. Land is when the bureaucrats live off land supplied by the state</dd>
<dd><b>♠ None ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. None is when the state officials are not compensated (example: in the Republican and Principate Rome the magistrates were wealthy individuals who served without salary, motivated by prestige and social or career advancement)</dd>

Corruption is defined as the use of public office for personal purposes (economic gain, political power, social prestige). If present, code for frequency as: infrequent &lt;10% of officials; widespread = 10-50%; pervasive &gt;50%; unknown</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Bribery ♣ ♥</b> This refers specifically to the economic aspect of corruption. It attempts to capture the estimated proportion of officials’ income that comes from bribes and ‘extra-legal’ sources (e.g., kickbacks). If present, code for frequency as: negligible (&lt;10%); significant (10-50%); majority (&gt;50%); unknown</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Abuse of power ♣ ♥</b> This refers to non-economic aspects of corruption. For example, officials can use their power to unjustly imprison or enslave others, expropriate land, destroy property, etc. If present, code for frequency as: infrequent &lt;10% of officials; widespread = 10-50%; pervasive &gt;50%; unknown</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Direct ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. Direct means that the executive maintains tight control over the appointment, removal, assessment, and duties of local-level officials</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Indirect ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. Indirect means that the executive influences the activities of local officials (i.e. by ability to remove administrator from office, or by promoting certain religious or ethical norms that influence administrative behavior), but has not explicit legal authority to determine their actions. This also includes cases where the executive maintains direct control over provincial-level or local level superiors such as governors or district chiefs who themselves maintain direct control over lower-ranking local officials, but the executive does not exert direct control over low ranking low-level officials</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Diffused ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. Diffused means that administrators act largely on their own accord, whether they are aligned with the interests of the ruler or not. The executive retains only minimal control over the officials, typically informal pressure such as a broad agreement for reciprocal military, political, or economic aid (e.g. the control of feudal lords in Medieval Europe). This can include officials who are selected and removed with or without the executive's control (i.e. hereditary control of an office by a certain kin-group)</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Mixed ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. Some combination of the above. Explain</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Governmental control ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. Can local-level officials be removed by a different governmental agency/body (e.g. judicial branch, or a specially appointed magistrate)?</dd>

<dd><b>♠ Land ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. Land is when the bureaucrats live off land supplied by the state</dd>
<dd><b>♠ None ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. None is when the state officials are not compensated (example: in the Republican and Principate Rome the magistrates were wealthy individuals who served without salary, motivated by prestige and social or career advancement)</dd>

<p><b>Pathologies</b>
</p>
<dl><dd> <b>♠ Corruption ♣ ♥</b> Is corruption of local bureaucrats widespread or systematic? Corruption is defined as the use of public office for personal purposes (economic gain, political power, social prestige). If present, code for frequency as: infrequent &lt;10% of officials; widespread = 10-50%; pervasive &gt;50%; unknown</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Bribery ♣ ♥</b> This refers specifically to the economic aspect of corruption. It attempts to capture the estimated proportion of local officials’ income that comes from bribes and ‘extra-legal’ sources (e.g., kickbacks). If present, code for frequency as: negligible (&lt;10%); significant (10-50%); majority (&gt;50%); unknown</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Abuse of power ♣ ♥</b> This refers to non-economic aspects of corruption. For example, local officials can use their power to unjustly imprison or enslave others, expropriate land, destroy property, etc. If present, code for frequency as: infrequent &lt;10% of officials; widespread = 10-50%; pervasive &gt;50%; unknown</dd></dl>
<p><b>♠ Professionalization of local bureaucracy ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. Are local-level administrators full-time professionals (as opposed to people who undertake administrative tasks in addition to other work and activities)?
</p>
<dl><dd><b>♠ modal number of years local bureaucrats spend in service ♣ ♥</b> are local-level officials typically life-long administrators, or is a short time spent in government service before pursuing other activities, such as private economic opportunities?</dd></dl>

</p><p><b>♠ Name of other significant religious or ideological systems ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> "[T]he sources available for the reconstruction of pre-Islamic Arabian society are not such as to inspire much confidence. Muslims refer to the pre- Islamic period as the jahiliyya, the “time of ignorance” before the coming of the Koranic revelation. From a historical rather than a theological viewpoint, the term is an apt one, although for entirely different reasons. Almost all of the Muslim sources on the pre-Islamic period and the years spanning Muhammad’s career are relatively late, having been written a century and a half or more after the events they purport to describe. (They were of course based at least in part on material which circulated orally much earlier.) In recent years, several scholars have cast serious doubt upon the accuracy of the traditional picture of pre- and early-Islamic Arabian society, much of it relying on those late Muslim sources. The problem with those sources, in a nutshell, is that they were put together and used by Muslims to settle later controversies and to justify retrospectively an Islamic Heilsgeschichte, and so reflect more what later Muslims wanted to remember than what was necessarily historically accurate. [...] At least one corner of Arabia supported an agricultural and citied civilization on a par with those of the Fertile Crescent. The southwestern corner of the peninsula, focused on the modern country of Yemen, was Arabia Felix, “fruitful” or “happy Arabia,” a land (unlike the rest of the peninsula) of significant rainfall and lush vegetation. In the centuries before the rise of Islam, its environmental conditions and agricultural and trading economy (situated as it was at a strategic point on the sea route from the Mediterranean to both India and East Africa) supported a material culture and political traditions much more like those of the rest of the Near East than those of central Arabia, and the religious situation there was markedly different than that elsewhere in the peninsula."<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup>

<p><b>Supernatural beings (e.g., gods, spirits, ancestors)</b>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>♠ Number of officially sanctioned supernatural beings ♣ polytheism ♥</b> "Up until about the fourth century AD almost all the inhabitants of Arabia were polytheists. [...] The patron deity ( shym ) of a people was of more immediate significance in south Arabia than the remoter figure of ‘Athtar. The four principal peoples had as their patrons Almaqah (Sabaeans), Wadd (Minaeans), ‘Amm (Qatabanians) and Sayin (Hadramites), and each people was collectively termed the ‘children’ of their respective patron deity. The last would be characterised as the ‘lord’ of the shrine that served as the cultic centre for his people (e.g. ‘Almaqah lord of Awwam’, the principal temple in Marib)."<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Omnipresent supernatural beings ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Omniscient supernatural beings ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Omnipotent supernatural beings ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></dd>
<dd><b>♠ High Gods (creator gods) ♣ active ♥</b> The following suggests that the gods were believed to intervene in human affairs, and that they were also somehow linked to group values, but there appears to be no explicit evidence that the gods specifically rewarded ethical behaviour and/or punished transgressions--indeed, it seems that punishments were taken care of by human authorities (and even here the areas in which the names of the gods were invoked seem to do mostly with administrative matters). "Up until about the fourth century AD almost all the inhabitants of Arabia were polytheists. We know many of the names of their deities, since the most common aim of Arabian inscriptions was to invoke the gods in some way, usually petitioning them or thanking them. But names alone do not tell us much, and the brevity of most of these texts makes it difficult for us to understand the nature and function of the gods or to comprehend what they meant to their worshippers. They are also frequently assigned epithets (compare Christian designation of Mary as ‘mother of God’, ‘the virgin’, etc.), but without the myths and narratives to decode them these are not usually very informative. Loosely, of course, the gods represented those forces that were important to the lives of their devotees but beyond their control: rain, fertility, health, love, death and so on. By seeking the favour of the gods, typically making some votive gift, one might thereby influence these forces. Thus one member of the northwest Yemeni tribe of Amir ‘dedicated to his lord Dhu Samawi in his temple . . . a bronze statuette of a she-camel that Dhu Samawi may grant him the wellbeing of himself and his children as well as the wellbeing and safety of his camel’ (Ja 2956). But how exactly this tribesman conceived of his divine patron and to what degree the latter affected his life we do not know. [...] The patron deity ( shym ) of a people was of more immediate significance in south Arabia than the remoter figure of ‘Athtar. The four principal peoples had as their patrons Almaqah (Sabaeans), Wadd (Minaeans), ‘Amm (Qatabanians) and Sayin (Hadramites), and each people was collectively termed the ‘children’ of their respective patron deity. The last would be characterised as the ‘lord’ of the shrine that served as the cultic centre for his people (e.g. ‘Almaqah lord of Awwam’, the principal temple in Marib). These patron deities played a vital socio-political role in that their cults served as the focus of a people’s cohesion and loyalty and functioned as an expression of communal will and activity. For example the tithes owing on land and its produce were paid to the gods (via their human servants), who also saw to its redistribution: Frankincense after being collected is conveyed to Shabwa on camels, one of the gates of the city being opened for its admission. The kings have made it a capital offence for camels so laden to turn aside from the high road. At Shabwa a tithe estimated by measure and not by weight is taken by the priests for the god they call Sayin, and the incense is not allowed to be put on the market until this has been done. This tithe is drawn on to defray what is a public expenditure, for actually on a fixed number of days the god graciously entertains guests at a banquet. (Pliny 12.63) Tithes exacted on the same traffic by the Minaean deities could be discharged by public works, such as construction of town walls, undertaken by the tithe-payers (e.g. M 29). In Qataban, when the king ‘requested’ a regulation dealing with water supplies, the promulgation of it was made in the name of the god Anbay (Ry 478). The shared cult of ‘Amm of Labakh enabled cooperation between a group of Qatabanian landlords and their tenants in far-off Dathinah (RES 3688- 89, 3691- 93). In Saba military campaigns were carried out ‘for Almaqah and the Sabaeans’ (e.g. RES 3945), and fines for all manner of offences were paid ‘to Almaqah and the kings of Saba’ (e.g. Ja 576). In other words it was the cult of the patron deity that allowed the community to function as a coherent entity (as opposed to a mass of discrete localised kinship groups), acting as a sort of social glue."<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup></dd></dl>
