The apogee of that movement was a water supply system called the gravitation scheme that reforming municipalities aspired to build. It entailed drastically reshaping landscapes in the hinterlands of cities by damming rivers, raising lakes, or flooding valleys and then piping water under pressure to sometimes distant cities; it also, promoters hoped, would reform urban environments and societies at the same time. Between 1840 and the end of the century, engineers in Britain executed it approximately one hundred times, but the gravitation scheme had a life beyond the bounds of Britain. In the second half of the nineteenth century, engineers—usually the very same individuals who had carried them out in Britain— introduced the scheme to cities such as Bombay, Colombo, Hong Kong, and Singapore. There, the gravitation scheme also had a transformative influence; it was a project of environmental and technical change that helped to solidify the modernizing colonial state.” <sup id="cite_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup></dd>

For the Mint itself the eighteenth century was a period of relative stagnation: British silver and copper coinage was in a poor condition and was in short supply. ... The end of the Napoleonic wars, however, was followed by currency reform and in 1816-17 recoinage in Britain. In 1818 private coins were made illegal. ... The installation of Boulton's steam-powered machinery, coupled with a French invention, the 'reducing machine', which reproduced original coin designs by machine rather than by hand engraving, enabled for the first time the mass production of high-quality and homogenous copper coins and transformed the Mint itself into an 'industrial concern'.

The last condition is quite as indispensable to the existence of a well-established currency as the former; and it is one that cannot be fuilly realized otherwise than by confining the issue of paper to a single source. It is easy to see that were paper issued only by the Bank of England, or some one source in London, and then only in exchange for bullion, the currency would be in its most perfect state, and would fluctuate exactly as it would do were it wholly metallic.

When the effects of this bullet were neither lethal nor so substantial that the victim bled to death, the splintered bones, rent skin and severed muscles often required amputation as the only remedy...Given that these injuries were more grievous than those which other armies had deemed necessary, it is worth examining why the British army decided to develop and use the Dum Dum bullet in the years 1895-9...few in the War Office believed that the Dum Dum bullet required further justification.

On this both Kitchener and the Mahdi would probably have agreed. Between the hunter and prey, the soldier and the skull, the collector and the collected, propriety required a parity of status. The Ashanti king acknowledged this when he kept Sir Charles McCarthy's skull as a ceremonial drinking-bowl. So did Sir Frederick Carrington in keeping the skull of someone he referred to as "Sandilli, chief of the Gaika nation" on the mantelpiece in his dining room...For this reason, the taking of African heads and skulls by the British military seems to have been carried out predominantly, though not exclusively, by members the officer class, and their victims tended to be similarly high ranking Africans" <sup id="cite_ref-136" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-136">[136]</a></sup>

Describing the actions of Neill's troops around Allahabad, one officer wrote: ‘Every native that appeared in sight was shot down without question, and in the morning Colonel Neill sent out parties of regiment [?) ... and burned all the villages near where the ruins of our bungalows stood, and hung every native that they could catch, on the trees that lined the road.

“By 1914 the weight and eﬀectiveness of ﬁrepower had increased greatly, communication systems had progressed to radio telegraphy, and air power was also beginning to be used in colonial wars. As a result numerically larger African armies were usually decimated in open battle by explosive shells, machine guns and rapid concentrated riﬂe ﬁre. Proportionately the slaughter was immense. At Atbara, in the 1898 campaign to conquer the Sudan, the Khalifa’s forces lost 7,000 killed to the British-Egyptian losses of some 600&nbsp;; later at Kurari (Omdurman) more than 11,000 Sudanese peasants were killed in battle against Kitchener’s forces which lost 140 men. The once powerful emirates of Northern Nigeria rapidly succumbed to superior British ﬁrepower. Sokoto, with an army variously estimated at 6,000 to 30,000 , but possessing few riﬂes, was defeated at Burmi in 1903 by a colonial force of under 500 men. The battle lasted ninety minutes; British casualties numbered a handful, the Sokoto dead lay in hundreds.” <sup id="cite_ref-141" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-141">[141]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Extermination ♣ present ♥</b> Australia “At the onset of British colonization in 1788, the continent’s Aboriginal people numbers about 500,000-750,000, by recent estimates. Just over a century later, fewer than 100,000 remained in 1901, the year of Australia’s federation. Most Aborigines perished from new diseases like smallpox, measles, and tuberculosis, and whites probably killed about 20,000 or more. Blacks also killed possibly 2,500 whites, mostly in isolated attacks, but the killings of Aborigines by settlers and troops, though sporadic, involved much larger numbers. Mass death from unwittingly introduced diseases is not genocide, yet the enormity of that loss cannot obscure the evidence of multiple deliberate killings and a series of genocidal massacres.”
e.g. Bathurst settlement “Of the estimated 3,000 Wiradjuri people, three clans totaling 500-600 lived here is mixed woodland and grassland…William Lawson Jr. wrote: ‘We have now commenced hostilities against them in consequence of their killing a great number of shepherds and stockmen, but afraid we shall never exterminate them, they have such an extensive mountainous country for them to flee from their pursuers’...The full Wiradjuri death toll during that year is difficult to determine. Prior to the conflict, in 1815, the three Upper Macquarie clans were estimated to number 500-600, and a July 1824 Wiradjuri assembly near Bathurst, 600-700. How many survived the bloodbath that followed is unclear. On December 11, Brisbane repealed martial law, offering Windradyne a pardon, and on December 28, Windradyne arrived in Parramatta with 140 members “of the Bathurst tribe.”…Historian R.H.W. Reece wrote that "there is reason to believe that every Aborigine who was physically capable of making the journey would have been present.” If so, in six months, Wiradjuri numbers had fallen from 600-700 to as few as 140, plus the elderly, sick, and infants. A surviving population of around 400, including wounded, may be close to the truth. Specific reports of clashes and massacres in 1824 suggest a total toll of over 100 Wiradjuri killed and probably twice that number.” <sup id="cite_ref-142" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-142">[142]</a></sup>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Kumbh Mela ♥</b> "The Magh Mela celebrates an annual auspicious astrological constellation, lasting about a month (coinciding with January-February), during which bathers acquire spiritual benefits by bathing in the triveni or sangam, the confluence of the Ganga, the Yamuna, and the invisible Saraswati rivers. Every twelve years, the mela is known as a Kumbh Mela and is vastly attended; in the intervening six years, the mela is known as Ardh (half) Kumbh (readers unfamiliar with the mela should turn to the appendix, where they will find a useful overview). Pilgrimage in Hindu traditions is not obligatory, but it is meritorious and desirable. In the case of the Kumbh, a bath in the triveni promises superlative benefits, chiefly immortality, but these are only on offer every twelve years; this relative rarity places certain compulsions on pilgrims to take the opportunity of a holy bath when it arises, because it 'may not be possible next time for a pilgrim, given the uncertainty of human life.'" <sup id="cite_ref-143" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-143">[143]</a></sup> The Haridwar Mela "was held annually in April, and every twelve years inflated to the status of Kumbh Mela as the new moon occurred with the sun and moon in Aries and Jupiter in Aquarius (Kumbha). The Haridwar mela was dominant in the British imagination primarily because its accompanying market was a magnet for traders and customers from all over the subcontinent and beyond. The East India Company promptly inserted itself into this strange tableau of commerce and worship, tolerating the latter to take advantage of the former. [...] "The first British account of the Kumbh Mela in Haridwar, published in the influential journal Asiatick Researches, describing the 1796 visit of Captain Thomas Hardwicke, remains seminal to understandings of the Kumbh. Hardwicke described the mela as a colorful but chaotic fair, a contradictory mix of devout religious observance and ruthless mercantile opportunity, governed by rival sects (akharas) of militant, unpredictable, and sometimes nude holy men. The scale of the 1796 Kumbh fair was estimated by Hardwicke, in consultation with a Gosain who had access to a register of taxes exacted from pilgrims, at two and a half million people. The mela turned to melee on the final day of the fair, when a large body of Udasis suddenly attacked 'with swords, spears and firearms, every tribe of Fakirs that came in their way,' indiscriminately slaughtering pilgrims, killing at least five hundred souls. The intervention of one Captain Murray, two companies of sepoys, and two six‐pounder cannons forced the attacking akhara into retreat."[...] "The next significant account of the Haridwar mela, buried in a seemingly interminable narration of a survey to discover the source of the Ganges and written by East India Company geographer Captain Francis Raper, was also published in Asiatick Researches. Since Hardwicke's visit, the Saharanpur district in which Haridwar lay had been ceded to the East India Company by the Marathas. Raper relates the 1796 experience and assures the reader that at the 1808 Kumbh Mela, 'to prevent a repetition of such outrages, the detachment assembled for the preservation of peace was this year of greater strength than usual.' "The relative safety of the regulated Haridwar mela in the early nineteenth century, in concert with a range of economic and social factors, encouraged more pilgrims to make the journey[...]." <sup id="cite_ref-144" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-144">[144]</a></sup></dd>

Instead of red, rectangular buildings, square doors, formal lines of booths, and, what is worse than all, the dark, dingy dress of the figures, … we have here domes, minarets, fanciful architecture, and a costume, above all, flaunting in colours, and formed, from the easy flow of its drapery, to adorn beauty and disguise deformity. As if on purpose to refute me, there are passing at this moment the most disgusting troop of fanatic fakirs, who, with neglected hair and beards, distorted limbs, long talon‐like nails, and hideously smeared visages and bodies, look more like wild beasts than human beings.

In her study of Ghatiyali pilgrims, Ann Gold relates that 'most villagers believe that pilgrimage imperils one's health,' noting that remarks on how ill, tired, and weak pilgrims appear are considered 'appropriate and standard greetings for a returning pilgrim.' This was even philosophically extended to include accidental death; the Hindi proverb mar jayenge tar jayenge ('if we die, we will attain salvation') served to comfort many who lost family members on pilgrimage.

As Davis recounts, 'in Puja, a worshipper invokes or invites the deity into some material form, most often an image or icon visually and symbolically representing the deity, and presents to him both material offerings such as food and clothing and devoted services such as the recitation of his praises, music, dance, and songs. Agama texts classify all these material and performatory presentations to the deity as "services" (Upacara). Vishnu and Siva, as gods simultaneously transcendent and immanent, enter into a variety of both anthropomorphic and aniconic objects so that their devotees may see them and make their offerings of homage.' "In Puja the divine service always takes place in reference to an altar upon which are placed statues or images (Murti) requiring regular worship. Puja in temples and shrines gradually developed into a complicated daily service that was enhanced during special monthly and seasonal observances. Puja is generally centered on pleasing the Lord in the temple with offerings of food, water, incense, flowers, fan, sweets, camphor, lamp wick, unguents, and conch. Music and devotional songs were key items in this arsenal of offerings. While many Pujas continued to include unaccompanied Stuti or Stotra (hymns of praise) to the deities in Sanskrit, they also contained more and more vernacular hymns and songs accompanied by musical instruments."<sup id="cite_ref-190" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-190">[190]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Friday prayer ♥</b> "The Friday prayer is a duty of the community; it contains a short sermon, khutba*, which consists of two parts. It gives some advice usually based on the Koran or the hadith, and a prayer for the ruler of the government. To be mentioned in the khutba meant to be the legitimate ruler. Women rarely attend the Friday prayer but prefer to pray at home.The daily prayers are explained in the Koran as acts of humility and adoration. At the end of the prayer the Muslim can mention his/her personal requests. While traveling or in war or under duress, one can perform the noon and afternoon or sunset and night prayers together. One also has numerous opportunities to perform additional prayers of two or more rak'a each, e.g., during solar or lunar eclipses; when performing the rain prayer; when entering or leaving the house or the mosque—in short, some pious Muslims use every opportunity to perform a brief salat. The belief in the purifying power of ritual prayer is intense; the Prophet compared it to a stream of water that washes off sins five times a day. The performance of the prayer at the prescribed time constitutes ideally a means of educating Muslims to punctuality, cleanliness, and, since there is no ranking in the mosque, equal participation in the life of the community. Prayer can also lead to ecstatic experiences, and when one observes a praying Muslim who is oblivious of everything around him and seems to have drawn himself, as it were, out of this world to stand humbly before the Lord, one realizes best whence Islam derives its vital strength.To perform the salat, a clean spot suffices, be it in the fields, in the train, or in one's shop or office. A small prayer rug guarantees the cleanliness of the place. However, even in the Prophet's lifetime a place for congregational worship was established, called masjid, "the place where one prostrates" (hence the word Mosque). The great mosque, where the Friday prayer is held and which was found in each quarter, is called jami'*, "the gathering [mosque]."Mainly in the eastern part of the Islamic world, one finds small open prayer places called musalla*, and for the gathering of large congregations at the two 'id*, the end of Ramadan and the Feast of Offerings, one sometimes uses an 'idgah*, a vast enclosure with a prayer niche."<sup id="cite_ref-231" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-231">[231]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Spring Festival ♥</b> The Spring Festival appears to be one of the oldest Hindu celebrations.<sup id="cite_ref-268" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-268">[268]</a></sup> Because it has changed through time and is performed somewhat differently in different regions, but no accounts appear to exist of how it was performed in this polity specifically, the ritual coded here is a generic, "essential" version. "With respect to the fundamental characteristics of the Vasantotsava as found in the above Sanskrit texts, we can fruitfully focus our attention in four general directions. Firstly, the Spring Festival crosses sectarian boundaries. It is a popular festival celebrated by several sects as well as outside any readily identifiable sectarian context. No main deity or group of deities is here the consistent object of devotion; the Vasantotsava may be celebrated by all, regardless of private or public devotional affiliations. Second, the element of fire appears in some context in almost all descriptions of this festival: it is a symbol of death, renewal, transformation and purification. Third, the significance of the marriage motif with respect to the Vasantotsava is indicated by a number of texts including the Bhavisya Purana (as previously noted). [...] Fourth and finally the rituals of the Vasantotsava revolve, to a greater or lesser extent, around sensuality. The festival is a fertility festival and erotic motifs from both the mortal and the immortal realms are freely combined with fertility motifs. These four components of the Spring Festival will be treated in turn in the sections that follow. "[...] "The eroticism of the spring celebrations as found in the Ratnavali is characterized by a certain amount of social freedom and licentiousness. Thus the Spring Festival is a peculiar mix of control and freedom: the festival occurs within the city under the auspices of kings and Brahmins and at the same time social barriers are purposefully broken down and the erotic permeates the ritual. The breakdown of social relationships is indicated by rituals such as playing 'Holi' (throwing colored powder), mixing of castes and men and women in the streets, sex, licence, and powder. Eroticism and sexual licence as brought out in the throwing of powder and dancing which comprise this festival reflect the sexual potency of the season." <sup id="cite_ref-269" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-269">[269]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b>♠ Duration ♣ 72 ♥</b> 3 days "Some texts, in fact, describe the Vasantotsava as lasting for more than one day.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Ashura ♥</b> Procession on tenth day of Muharram among Shi'a. "The most common ambulatory ritual observance is dasta, or procession. There is no doubt that the Hosayn dasta was influenced by ritual parades lamenting the unjust and sudden deaths of such heroes as Tammuz in Mesopotamia and Siavos in Transoxania. The dasta in Moḥarram and Safar developed from simple processions into complex rituals occurring annually among Shi'ite communities worldwide. The most notable feature of the dasta is the self-mortification of the participants in tandem with accompanying cymbals and drums. Marchers chant dirges and threnodies, curse the villains of Karbala (FIGURE 1). Canetti describes the dasta as “an orchestra of grief” (p. 150). [...] When Shi'ite Islam became the state religion in Persia in 907/1501, popular rituals including dasta helped to spread the faith across the Iranian plateau. Foreign residents who spent time in Persia during the 17th and 18th centuries have left very rich accounts of dastas they witnessed, providing a record of the development of this ritual’s pageantry. The majority of popular Shi'ite rituals are conducted in the open, in public spaces, and can be viewed by passers-by. Western visitors to Iran—diplomats, merchants, and missionaries—were fascinated with these rituals and have given us, from the early 17th century onward, quite extensive written accounts of what they saw. [...] A steady increase was observed in the number of participants in the dasta costumed to represent various characters and episodes from the battle at Karbala. Wheeled floats with living tableaux were constructed to pass in front of the multitudes of penitent spectators. A vivid description of the Moḥarram parades was made in 1737 by Thomas Salmons and Matthias Van Goch (pp. 249-53): 'Outstanding in the large public processions are the big theatrically arranged wagons showing scenes of his [Ḥosayn’s, P.Ch.] life and his deeds, his battles, and his death. These wagons are often pulled about accompanied by people, in armor, flags, and emblems of war of victory, depicting some of Hussein’s deeds. For example, a wagon representing the death of Hussein has a deck-like cover coated with sand to represent the arid battlefield. Underneath people are lying thrusting their heads, arms and hands through holes in the cover so they will lie on the sand above to appear as dismembered limbs sprinkled with blood or red paint and colored with a deathly pallor so as to look most natural. Hussein, pallid and bloody, is lying on the other wagon. Several living doves sit on his body, while others are nesting in his blood. After a while, the men under the cover release their bonds, two at a time, so that they can ‘fly to Medina’ to announce Hussein’s death to his sister. Wherever this wagon passes, the people set up such a wailing to show their grief in so many ways and with such conviction, imitation, and naturalistic representations that one wonders at their capacity to give vent to such appropriate signs of suffering so realistically. Their spirit shows through plainly in this impersonation, nor do they spare their bodies: in zeal or desperation, they shed their blood, wound themselves, or are wounded in fights with others; they carry out their intentions with such zeal that it sometimes leads to their own death. It is not possible to tell the difference between feigned dizziness, fainting, and the real thing. One must consider what the stricken people on these tragic wagons endure while presenting their limbs, decapitated heads, hands, and legs in such an uncomfortable position while lying there as if they were dead themselves. [They do this] in all kinds of weather during the processions. Still they suffer rather than move or do something which would disturb that verisimilitude which might be lost.'" <sup id="cite_ref-309" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-309">[309]</a></sup></dd>

Wherever this wagon passes, the people set up such a wailing to show their grief in so many ways and with such conviction, imitation, and naturalistic representations that one wonders at their capacity to give vent to such appropriate signs of suffering so realistically. Their spirit shows through plainly in this impersonation, nor do they spare their bodies: in zeal or desperation, they shed their blood, wound themselves, or are wounded in fights with others; they carry out their intentions with such zeal that it sometimes leads to their own death. It is not possible to tell the difference between feigned dizziness, fainting, and the real thing. One must consider what the stricken people on these tragic wagons endure while presenting their limbs, decapitated heads, hands, and legs in such an uncomfortable position while lying there as if they were dead themselves. [They do this] in all kinds of weather during the processions. Still they suffer rather than move or do something which would disturb that verisimilitude which might be lost.'" <sup id="cite_ref-338" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-338">[338]</a></sup></dd>

</p><p>For the purposes of this project we define an institution as a system of social norms that governs the behavior of individuals in certain contexts, with social norms understood simply as socially transmitted rules of behavior. Institutions are also understood as being generally persistent across generations, changing only slowly over time although sometimes changing suddenly through some shock or radical social change. A classic example of an institution is marriage, which governs the behavior of the spouses in the context of their family and household. Particular norms within this institution describe the expected division of labor, rights and obligations of the partners, their children, and in-laws, etc. Because norms are socially transmitted rules, they are an example of a cultural element (by our definition, culture is any kind of socially transmitted information). There are other definitions of norms and institutions, but the one given here was chosen for its compatibility with the theoretical framework of cultural evolution (and this definition is not incompatible with alternative ones, e.g. institutions as alternative equilibria). It is often useful to distinguish formal from informal institutions. In the following, we will ask whether an institution is legally prescribed (part of a constitution or formal law code) or something that is an unwritten rule that, nevertheless, reflects the way things are done, and are expected to be done.
</p><p>We define 'elite' as the top social, political, economic, and/or religious members of society. In the codes below, when we say to code as 'equal to top nobility', we are referring to the society's elite groups and families. 'Higher than top nobility', then, refers to the ruling family, and 'lower than top nobility' refers to all people at a lower status than the elite groups and families.

<p>While the codes above reflect a legal or explicit right of some group to constrain the executive power, below code for non-formal limits. These include social or cultural norms which limit the action that can be seen as legitimately undertaken by the executive, for instance an unwritten restriction against an executive making changes to or decisions on religious matters. It is possible to code for all four combinations of absent/present along the formal/informal institution. So there could be the legal right to criticize a chief executive but it’s never used. Or, there may not be a law that specifies how the ruler is criticized, but there is an established practice of doing so. Where coding ‘present’ provide explanation and examples. Note that you should only code non-violent actions (so a rebellion that overthrows the head of state is not an instance of informal ‘impeachment’)

<p>We are interested here in any systems of thought and behavior that can influence people's actions, which we term a <i>Normative Ideology</i>.  Normative ideologies are thought-systems concerned with the correct behavior of people, governments/leaders, and other groups (and particularly the relationships between these groups).
</p><p>Mainly, this will be a religious or ritual system. As usual, when we mention Religious or Ritual System our focus  is on the 'official cult', defined the same way as in the Rituals section:
With the official cult we refer to the set of collective religious practices that are most closely associated with legitimation of the power structure (including elites, if any). However, Normative Ideologies are not restricted to religious/ritual systems. They include other thought systems, such as philosophy or anything that prescribes a particular pattern of behaviour. An example is  classical Greek philosophy, such as the works of Plato and Aristotle, who were concerned with correct or moral behaviour and whose thoughts influenced the actual practice of several societies (the empire of Alexander the Great, notably).

</p><p><b>♠ Rulers are legitimated by gods ♣ present ♥</b> Coded for monarch. Most de facto legislative authority rested with Prime Minister, who was not seen as legitimated by God. Monarch inherited title by blood; members of parliament elected democratically, though throughout this period voting was restricted to relatively wealthy adult men.  Constitutional Monarchy. Hereditary monarchy retains limited executive powers, majority executive powers placed in hands of democratically-elected PM and the Houses of Lords and Commons. Franchise slowly extended to universal male suffrage for the Commons by the end of the period, and the Lords' veto power curtailed shortly before the end of the period, leaving most power in the hands of a democratically-elected Commons and PM.

For a Christian to pretend to add a second spouse while the rst was still living (with him or her) and to call that new union a marriage was a deliberate insult to Christ’s example and instruction. For a Christian believer or of cial to extend the de nition of marriage to include a second or third concurrent marriage was a deliberate insult to the sacramental symbolism of Christian marriage. It was tantamount to downing a beer and a sandwich and calling that the eucharist, or diving into a pond several times and calling that baptism writ large. This simply could not be. It was not only a “legal impossibility,” as Raymond of Penyafort had put it, echoing Roman law,130 but a grave spiritual offense, too. Medieval writers labeled such misuses of the concept and institution of marriage by Christians as “heresy,” “blasphemy,” and “desecration” - an insult to God and his sacraments. The Council of Trent later called it “heresy” deserving of the church’s “anathema.” “ <sup id="cite_ref-372" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-372">[372]</a></sup>

Being right with God was important for people, but that did not necessarily mean they (p.96) deferred to their ‘betters’ or even to clergy. The Bible and the Prayer Book read in church and at home, and sermons, reminded the rich of their responsibilities and the poor of their expectations. God, people believed, could and might intervene to punish or reward in this life individuals or, more worryingly, the nation. The godly therefore had a responsibility for the ungodly, whose impiety and immorality might incur divine wrath on the nation, in the form of defeat in war, invasion, and the imposition of oppressive, absolutist government."<sup id="cite_ref-393" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-393">[393]</a></sup> "For example, the Gospels attach the promise of a reward to love of enemies (Mt 5.46), almsgiving (Mt 6.1), forgiveness (Mt 6.15), fasting (Mt 6.18), faith (Lk 12.8), perseverance in the face of persecution (Mt 13.18), and following Christ (Mt 11.29)."<sup id="cite_ref-394" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-394">[394]</a></sup></dd>
