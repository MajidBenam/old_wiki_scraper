<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ building mortuary earthworks ♥</b> It is very difficult to establish which was the largest scale collective ritual performed in the American Bottom at this time. For one thing, this region was something of a backwater for most of its prehistory, which means that whatever evidence there is for ritual activity is usually too scarce to be very useful from a Seshat point of view. Secondly, even if we coded generic "Early Woodland" rituals (as suggested by our Cahokia expert, Peter Peregrine), most of what is known about Early Woodland ritual is heavily skewed towards mortuary customs--and, specifically, the mortuary customs of the Adena people, who did not inhabit the American Bottom at this time. However, the following quote does support the notion than certain mortuary rituals (perhaps the act of building a burial mound itself) required large numbers of participants.</dd>
<dd>"Many Archaic burials and cemeteries testify to the great symbolic importance of death and funerary rituals in eastern life. These mortuary rites assumed increasing complexity and importance during the Late Archaic, when the first small burial mounds appear. [...]</dd>
<dd>"[...]</dd>
<dd>"The idea of building earthworks was nothing new, witness the great earthen banks at Poverty Point in Louisiana, but it did involve the cooperative labors of many families over considerable periods of time, people to dig and pile up basketfuls of earth by the thousand, not only individual families but entire villages, perhaps gatherings of close kin or several neighboring communities. Judging from what we know of Late Archaic and Early Woodland subsistence, hunting, foraging, and cultivation were family activities, but activities, but activities that sometimes involved exchange of vital commodities between neighbors near and far. These same exchange networks may have helped foster elaborate communal burial cults involving the interment of kin group members and perhaps the commemoration of lineages and ancestors.</dd>
<dd>"During the Early Woodland times, and especially after 500 BC, burial mounds were an important part of mortuary ceremonialism from the western Appalachiands to the Mississippi Valley, and north into Wisconsin and Michigan (Griffin, 1978). But the most marked ceremonialism is found in the so-called Adena complex of the central Ohio Valley." <sup id="cite_ref-170" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-170">[170]</a></sup></dd>
