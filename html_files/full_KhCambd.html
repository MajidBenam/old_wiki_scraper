<p>The next three coding positions define the temporal bounds of the polity. These codes take into account that such temporal bounds may be fuzzy and allow us to capture this 'fuzziness.' For example, some polities such as the Medieval German Empire or China under the Zhou Dynasty began as reasonably coherent states, but with time gradually lost cohesion, the degree to which the center exercized control over regional subpolities. Because this process was gradual, there was no sharp temporal boundary. The 'Degree of centralization' variable allows to capture these transitions (by coding time periods when the polity transitions, for example, from a 'confederated state' to 'loose' and finally to 'nominal' degree of centralization. Similarly, polities may have a fuzzy starting date, if they originate as subpolities under a disintegrating overarching polity. These transitions are captured by the variable 'Supra-polity relations'.

Archaeologists consider this the end of the Classic Khmer period.'<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> 'During the early decades of the fifteenth century, the Angkor Empire started to decline, and it fell to the Thai in 1431.'<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> 'Ayutthaya reasserted itself as the dominant Thai state, signalling its new position by a successful attack on the Khmer capital at Lovek in 1594. In desperation, the Cambodian king appealed to the Spanish at Manila, asking for military assistance in exchange for submission to the Spanish Crown. With the failure of this effort there was nothing to stop continued Thai incursions and the eventual enforced submission of Cambodia to Ayutthaya's control.'<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> 'The very last Sanskrit inscription in ancient Cambodia dates to AD 1327, and describes the accession of a king named Jayavarmadiparameshvara. With this event, the Classic period of Khmer civilisation effectively some to a close. There is here called the 'Post-Classic', and by others the post-Angkorian or Middle Period of Cambodian history and culture, extends from that date until the establishment of the French Protectorate in 1863.'<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> 'Even worse for Cambodia, in 1594 Lovek fell to the Thai army after the king and his son had fled to Laos. The Thai capture of Lovek is commemorated in two Khmer legends.'<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> 'Cambodian history is normally divided into the pre-Angkor (third century to 802 CE), Angkor (802-1432), and post-Angkor periods. The pre-Angkor period is mainly known from seventh-century in- scriptions; Angkor epigraphy begins in the late ninth century. Thus there is a crucial gap in our sources during the critical transitional phase.'<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> 'But in the face of attacks from both Ayutthaya and the Cham, Suryavarman decided to retreat from the old site of Angkor and to move the capital to the area of Phnom Penh. After the fall of Cambodia, missions continued to arrive in China, in 1435, 1436, 1452, and 1499, indicating that the kingdom was still sufficiently integrated to be able to conduct foreign relations. The Angkor period, however, had come to an end.'<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> 'First and most dramatic, Angkor’s empire fell apart. During the second quarter of the 13th century Angkorian forces were withdrawn from Champa. By mid-century most of the peninsula, areas west of the Chaophraya river, and northern Thailand had broken away, to be followed shortly by Lopburi and other states in the Chaophraya plain. By 1297 Angkor was defending against Tai attacks from the west. After new Tai pressure forced what some his- torians claim was a temporary withdrawal from Angkor during the mid- to late 14th century (various dates between 1350 and 1389 have been proposed), Khmer rulers may have abandoned the great capital in the 1430s or 1440s in favor of Phnom Penh in the southeast. It is equally plausible that Angkor was never actually abandoned, but that a more powerful royal lineage established itself at Phnom Penh in ri- valry with the old Angkorian family.78 In either case, the 14th century enfeebled central power. Thus Angkor’s disintegration began some- what earlier but overlapped substantially with that of the Upper Burma state, whose problems began in the 1280s, which suffered a major military-political crisis in the 1360s, and which also limped along into the 15th century.'<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>

Indeed, it is altogether likely that after the time of Rajendravarman the kings of Angkor presided over a much more centralized regime than the Khmers had known before. Institutions of government embodied no principles of constitutional checks upon royal power beyond the notion of religious morality. An impulse to totalitarian government was present, and found expression whenever rulers found themselves temporarily without dangerous rivals still at large. We must remember, though, that this tate lacked all the advantages of modern communications and technology to assert its control in detail, and that all sorts of regional, personal and factional loyalties were liable to obstruct the impulse to totalitarianism before too long.'<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> 'Angkor under Suyavarman [II] was at the peak of its glory.

Such census registers were kept in Aymonier's day, and revised every three years.'<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> 'Because the Angkor kingdom commanded a significant army and a large centralized administrative apparatus and because thousands of workers were needed to build and maintain its enormous building complexes, it has been assumed that around the stone constructions of the palaces and temples a city with a substantial population must have existed.'<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>

At its peak, Angkor sprawled over nearly 1000 km2 [1] and may have housed more than three quarters of a million people [2,3]. The primary administrative centre in a kingdom that dominated most of mainland Southeast Asia by the 11th century CE, Angkor was the largest preindustrial city on Earth and remains the world’s largest archaeological site. The Angkor period is commonly understood to start in 802 CE with the proclamation of Jayavarman II as the chakravartin (universal-king) from a location in the Kulen mountains (Phnom Kulen), overlooking the vast alluvial plain where Angkor would begin to emerge in the following centuries (Figure 1). In doing so, Jayavarman confirmed himself as the great unifier; drawing Cambodia’s disparate polities together under the first ‘god king’ and establishing the Khmer state and the basis of its empire. Phnom Kulen was known as Mahendraparvata; ‘‘the hill of the great Indra’’. The extant history of Mahendraparvata is based on several inscriptions, the most well-known being an 11th century CE inscription (K.235) found at the Sdok Kak Thom temple, in eastern Thailand [4]. The inscription, dated to 1052 CE, outlines the lineage of a private family serving successive Khmer Kings for two and a half centuries, the first mentioned being Jayavarman II.' <sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> 'With the fading of the ANGKOR era, Cambodia shifts capitals south to Lovek, then to Udong, and finally to PHNOM PENH.This period also sees the waning of HINDUISM and the rise of THERAVADA BUDDHISM.'<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>  '944 Rajendravarman II returns the capital to Angkor.

<dl><dd>This polity covers the post-Angkor period of Cambodia's history from the early 15th to the end of the 16th century CE. In 1432, the magnificent city of Angkor was sacked by the forces of King Trailok ‒ of the increasingly powerful Thai Kingdom of Ayutthaya ‒ who carried off the Khmer royal regalia as a symbol of their victory.<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup> A Khmer royal presence continued at Angkor in reduced form until around 1504, when the rulers retreated to a site near Phnom Penh on the Mekong River, southeast of Tonlé Sap Lake.<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup> However, Thai strength in the region continued to grow at the expense of the Khmer court, and in 1594 the then-capital Lovek was also attacked by the Thais, forcing the Cambodian king to flee to Laos.<sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Due to the Angkor kings' waning fortunes and endemic warfare with Ayutthaya,<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup> it is difficult to identify the 'peak' of this polity. Indeed, the post-Angkor period is sometimes referred to somewhat dismissively as the 'Middle Period' of Cambodian history,<sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup> but it should be noted that this term tends to also encompass the span of time between 1594 and the establishment of the French Protectorate in 1863.<sup id="cite_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<dl><dd>Although centralized Khmer power was much weaker than in former centuries, and very few inscriptions survive to throw light on political organization,<sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup> Khmer royals did still rise up periodically to assert their authority. For instance, historical accounts indicate that a king called Ang Chan reconquered Angkor in the 16th century and built a golden palace.<sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup> Meanwhile, the new capital on the lower Mekong was international in outlook, with quarters for Malay, Chinese and Japanese traders,<sup id="cite_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup> and some post-Classic Khmer kings had Japanese and Portuguese guards in their entourage.<sup id="cite_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>More generally, this period was characterized by increasing commercial, religious and political connections within mainland Southeast Asia and greater integration into global trade networks,<sup id="cite_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup> especially after the arrival of the Portuguese in 1511.<sup id="cite_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup> Wars between mainland Southeast Asian rulers did not preclude the development of a common, 'hybrid' culture among the wider population.<sup id="cite_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup> Likewise, one reason for the relocation of the Khmer capital (in addition to Thai attacks and drought coupled with 'intense monsoons')<sup id="cite_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-57">[57]</a></sup> was likely 'a desire for greater participation in seaborne trade'.<sup id="cite_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup></dd></dl>

</p><p><b> ♠ Polity Population ♣ [750,000-1,000,000] ♥ </b> Inhabitants at peak. Sources mention population drop in the 1400s - so probably fewer people during this period. These sources refer to Classic Angkor and not the post-Classic period.  'At its peak, Angkor sprawled over nearly 1000 km2 [1] and may have housed more than three quarters of a million people [2,3].' <sup id="cite_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup> 'With a fluctuating but persistent political dominance that extended from the ninth to the fourteenth centuries, it is hardly surprising that Angkor could built a temple enclosure (Angkor Wat) the size of central Tikal (Figure 11.11) and create a low-density urban complex with a water management network that spread across nearly 1,000 km^2 of intermeshed urban-rural landscape. That landscape could have fed between 300,000 and 750,000 human beings (see Fletcher et al. 2003:117 for assessment by Lustig).'<sup id="cite_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-60">[60]</a></sup> 'Angkor. It is now clear that the temple complex was the centre of an enormous dispersed city, home to up to one million inhabitants, making it the largest city of antiquity. '<sup id="cite_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-61">[61]</a></sup> 'Although it is likely that Groslier’s original population estimate was too high, Angkor was probably the largest pre-industrial city in the world. The most recent archaeological work indicates that one million is a reasonable estimate of the city’s size.'<sup id="cite_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-62">[62]</a></sup> 'Acker has given detailed consideration to the area that could have been irrigated, the water requirement, likely yields, and the location of the barays relative to one another and the land below them. His calculations were based on Groslier’s estimate of a population at Angkor in the vicinity of 1,900,000 people, of whom 600,000 were supported by 86,000 hectares (215,000 acres) of irrigated rice fields. In the dry season, a hectare would require 15,000 cubic meters (525,000 cu. ft.) of water. Assuming all the major barays at Angkor were full to a depth of three meters (9.9 ft.), they could have supplied 7,000 hectares (17,500 acres). If they yielded 1.46 tons of rice per hectare and annual consumption was 220 kilograms (484 lbs.) of rice per capita, the dry season yield would have maintained about 44,500 people, about 2.5 percent of the estimated population. This calculation is based only on the amount of water available when the barays were three meters deep. It does not take into account the possibility that the barays were constantly replenished with water from the Siem Reap River throughout the dry season. There is also the possibility that the reservoirs were used to supplement water supplies to the fields when there was insufficient rainfall during the wet sea- son. If so, then a further 9,000 metric tons (9,900 tons) over and above anticipated wet-season production could have been obtained, making the total irrigated yield 19,200 tons, sufficient to feed nearly 100,000 people.'<sup id="cite_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-63">[63]</a></sup> 'At its peak, the population of the impe- rial core may have exceeded 1.5 million.'<sup id="cite_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-64">[64]</a></sup> 'At its height, Angkor was the largest premodern settlement in the world, a city of more than 700,000 spread over a larger area than modern Los Angeles. Its crowning achievement was Angkor Wat, built at the kingdom’s height in the early twelfth century. Topped by five towers, arranged in an “X” pattern like the dots on a die, Angkor Wat was designed as a microcosmic representation of Mount Meru, the center of the universe in Hindu and Buddhist cosmology. This vast complex, still the largest religious building in the world, remains a powerful representation of Angkor’s military, artistic, and economic might, as well as the absolute rule of the God Kings, who were said to “eat their kingdom,” ruling with an iron fist.'<sup id="cite_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup> The figure was probably smaller toward the 1400s when the Phnom Penh area became the centre of the kingdom of Cambodia. 
</p><p><b> ♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ unknown ♥ </b>In the 17th century, in the area of Phnom Penh there were around 5,000 Chinese merchants, 1200 Portuguese, and other communities of Malay, Cham, Siamese, plus local population<sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup> . Van der Kraan estimates a total of 1 million in the whole of Cambodia<sup id="cite_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup> . Since Oudong (the capital) and Phnom Penh were in this area, it is likely that a large portion of the population lived there.
</p><p><b>♠ Largest communication distance ♣ 210 ♥</b> in kilometers. 'According to George Groslier, and in the atlas of Lunet de Lajonquiere, there is visible evidence of six major arteries in the system, as follows: [...] Angkor to Phimai, crossing the Dangrek Range: 210 km (130 miles).'<sup id="cite_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-68">[68]</a></sup> 'From the capital city, Angkor, there were at least two roads to the east and two to the west. One of the latter ran across the Dangrek Mountains to Phimai, and another went due west toward Sisophon, which means toward the only lowland pass from Cambodia into eastern Thailand in the direc- tion of Lophburi or Ayutthaya.Toward the east, one road has been traced almost to the Mekong, and according to an inscription in which these roads are described, it may have continued as far as the capital of Champa.'<sup id="cite_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-69">[69]</a></sup> 'Moreover, given the maximum extent of the Angkorian Empire, at over 350 km from the centre, a single communication may have taken one to two weeks to reach the recipient, rendering administered prices difficult to sustain for extended periods.'<sup id="cite_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-70">[70]</a></sup> 'At its zenith, Angkor was to control an empire that stretched from the South China Sea to the Isthmus of Kra and the Andaman Sea, and northwards into what is today Laos. As historians Ian Mabbett and David Chandler have pointed out, many of the subjects of this vast empire lived at remote distances to the capital city; even if they had obtained permission to travel, an elephant journey of only 50 miles from Battambang to Angkor would have taken five days, as it still did in the 19th century.'<sup id="cite_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup> Angkor after the 1400s was probably reduced to the space currently occupied by Cambodia. So the figure may work for the beginning of the Post-Angkor period, but not for the end. It is more likely that for later periods the largest communication distance between the capital and the provinces would have been between the area of Phnom Penh and Sisophon, around 366km.

'At any rate, administrative divisions were standardized. On one widely shared interpretation the designation of many territories as visa where previously there had been praam indicated that formerly autonomous princely fiefs were integrated as provinces. It appears that the former was primarily a geographical term, while the latter came to refer to a specific administrative division, possibly equivalent to a province.' In the thirteenth century, Chou Ta-kuan writes that there were over ninety provinces, each with a fortified citadel. At the level of the locality, there officials whom he called maichiech in the villages, possibly equivalent to me grok, custodians of settlements. Village elders, gramavrddha, are mentioned in the epigraphy, and appear to have had official responsibilities such as delivering criminals, suitably caged, into the custody of royal officials.'<sup id="cite_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-72">[72]</a></sup> 'With distance from Angkor, the inscriptions appear to diminish in number in two stages, consistent with three decreasing levels of influence. Frequencies remain fairly constant up to about 150 km. Beyond this distance, there are fewer inscriptions to 350 km, and after that there are almost none.108 The shapes of the curves may also be a function of the pattern of settlement. For example, the dip in the 25-50 km interval may be related to the proximity of the Tonle Sap Lake, the associated swamps and the Kulen Hills, where there are few temples, while at 150 km the Dangrek Mountains could have affected settlement patterns. It may also be partly due to the existence of modern political boundaries and a potential for Khmer sites and inscriptions in Laos, Vietnam and Thailand to be less frequently recorded or published than those inside Cambodia.'<sup id="cite_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-73">[73]</a></sup> See also Lustig's (2009) six classes of inscription 'density'<sup id="cite_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-74">[74]</a></sup>

<dl><dd>'Post-Classic Cambodia was an absolute monarchy, headed by the king (raj in Sanskrit and Plai, scads in Khmer), whose power in theory had no limit, only the monks being exempt from his authority. On this individual were bestowed numerous titles, such as 'Raised above Heads', 'Supreme Refuge', 'the Master of the Lower Surface', and so on. The king was the supreme landowner, and all the holdings of those who died went to him by escheat; but the real wealth of his royal domain lay among the alluvial margins of the main rivers and their islands, where rice fields were annually fertilized by rich deposits of mud (the some kind of situation on which the economic power of the pharaohs of Egypt and the Olmec rulers of Mexico had depended). Once crowned, the sdach was a sacred being, filled with what anthropologists call mana. Etienne Aymonier tells us: "Inviolable, he is henceforth the object of a cult pushed to adoration. No one is permitted to address a word to him or lay a hand on his sacred person; only his principal wives, by softly caressing his feet, dare to awaken him on urgent matters. His personal name which is never again pronounced is replaced by an equivalent which had been, according to custom, borrow from the ordinary tongue. He eats alone, surrounded outside by young pages, the sons of mandarins, and inside, by some favourites who serve him and who are in attendance at his meal, while keeping a respectful distance. At his audiences, which he gives seated cross-legged, princes, mandarins, and subjects remain crouching on their knees and elbows, their hands joined at the height of the forehead, which they knock on the ground three times at the beginning and end of the season."'<sup id="cite_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-76">[76]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p><b> ♠ Religious levels ♣ 6 ♥ </b> levels. 'Because all the Classic inscriptions deal with matters that are fundamentally religious in nature [...] we have much information on the central religious hierarchy, but little about the secular one. [...] The religious authorities and functionaries in the royal court were certainly almost entirely Brahmin caste [Level 2], although some priests in the provinces and villages [Level 1] may not have been so. Most of them may have received the honorific Khmer title of sten an, reserved for learned men. We already run across the purohita [Level 5]. In peninsular India,this Sanskrit word indicated a family priest or chaplain; in Classic Angkor, this important individual was the chaplain and chief priest of the king and, at least accordant tot he self-serving steal, was a hereditary officer charged with maintaining the cult of the devajara [Level 6]. The Sanskrit title of hotter or 'sacrificer' occurs frequently in the texts; this is also supposed to indicate 'royal chaplain' - but the exact scope of the term is unclear since while the royal hotar of the devaraja was a hotar, there were other hotter. Most of these may have had important administrative roles [Level 4]. There were many religious functionaries who received the Sanskrit title of acharya, a learned priest who acted as teacher and spiritual guide; or pandit, someone versed in sacred lore; or of upadhyaya, a teacher and preceptor leaned in the vedas. As with many Classic Khmer titles, there is little information on whether these were or were not interchangeable. [Level 3]'<sup id="cite_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-77">[77]</a></sup> Coe (2003), citing Zhou, states, 'The highest dignitaries use palanquins with golden shafts and four parasols with handles of gold [Level 5]; those next in rank have a palanquin with golden shafts and two golden-handled parasols [Level 4]; then come those entitled to one palanquin with gold shafts and one golden-handled parasol [Level 3]. Further down the line come those permitted only a silver-handled parasol [Level 2], and there are others who use a palanquin with silver shafts [Level 1]... All parasols are made of red Chinese taffeta...'

According to David Chandler, 'Though the king, who led his country into battle, sometimes engaged his chief enemy in single combat, Khmer military strength rested on the junior officers, the captains of militia. These men commanded the loyalty of peasant groups in their particular locality. If the king conquered a region, a new captain of militia would be enrolled and put under an oath of allegiance. The captains were simply headmen of the outlying regions, but their connection with the king enhanced their status. In time of war they were expected to conscript the peasants in their district and to lead them to Angkor to join the Khmer army. If the captains disobeyed the king they were put to death. The vast majority of the Khmer population were of the farmer-builder-soldier class.'<sup id="cite_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-79">[79]</a></sup> 'One major feature of the 'imperial state' was its maintenance of a large court and a corps of officials.

The khlon rajakarya was responsible for the administration of 'royal work', probably corvee among other things. The tamrvac was an inspector; the officials who swore allegiance to Suryavarman I had this title, for example. The gunadosadarsin (assessor of virtues and defects) was concerned with temple property. A variety of functionaries were called khlon (inspector) and had responsibilities in various areas such as grain, temple dues, management of religious foundations and several aspects of court proceedings. Revenue was usually in kind, being paid in grain, but some special districts paid in other commodities such as honey and wax. There is evidence that some of the categories in which officials were placed were not types of professional specialisation but divisions of the government service placed under the patronage of particular chiefs belonging to the royal family, a system that was indeed known in later centuries.

Angkor has a sizeable bureaucracy staffed by officials of many sorts. Like so much about the Khmer kingdom in ancient times, the structure of government and the categories of the civil service are known to us through temple inscriptions, which frequently name various types of official or local dignitary in listing those present to witness the formal demarcation of land bestowed upon religious foundations; they mention a variety of grades and titles, some of them obscure. The khlon rajakarya was responsible for the administration of 'royal work', probably corvee among other things. The tamrvac was an inspector; the officials who swore allegiance to Suryavarman I had this title, for example. The gunadosadarsin (assessor of virtues and defects) was concerned with temple property. A variety of functionaries were called khlon (inspector) and had responsibilities in various areas such as grain, temple dues, management of religious foundations and several aspects of court proceedings. Revenue was usually in kind, being paid in grain, but some special districts paid in other commodities such as honey and wax. There is evidence that some of the categories in which officials were placed were not types of professional specialisation but divisions of the government service placed under the patronage of particular chiefs belonging to the royal family, a system that was indeed known in later centuries. Some of the groups of dignitaries in named in the inscriptions, again, appear to have been the bearers of hereditary privileges in the royal household; the term varna, for example, designates any of a number of orders of dignity, which have such official functions as religious teachers, performers of rites, door guardians, garden keepers, palace servants, bearers of flywhisks, and artists.'<sup id="cite_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-94">[94]</a></sup>

For example, the purohita and the yājaka usually seem to have been hereditary officials and a single family was said to have been in charge of the devarāja cult for a period of 250 years (ibid., 24-25). A number of positions close to the kings (purohita, hotar, guru, ācārya and guṇadośadarśi) are referred to in Angkorian period inscriptions written by officials. These tend to be Sanskrit terms which had religious connotations, but as Vickery (2002: 93) points out, some of these became secular, as in India, and perhaps were so in Cambodia from the start.

At this point, every person would also choose a particular mandarin or even high official in the capital as his patron. With this personage, who was not necessarily connected with the client's territory, there were mutual obligations: the client owed the patron deference, and respect, services, occasional labour, and the usual small gifts, while the latter gave aid and protection (even legal) to the freeman and accommodation when he had to travel to the capital.

From the new map an outline can be provide of the development of the network between the 8th-9th and the 14th centuries. Each large extension of the network tapped water from a succession of natural rivers flowing from NE to SW. Each river was further north and was tapped further to the west. The network had five major components - E-W embankments that trapped water flowing from the north and northeast; N-S channels that eventually delivered water to large reservoirs (baray); the baray and the large temple moats; embankments and channels oriented from NW to SE that could distribute water back from west to east across the slope of the land; and channels oriented towards the southwest which could dispose of water rapidly to the lake, the Tonle Sap.

Inscriptions make reference to transport by boat. <sup id="cite_ref-145" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-145">[145]</a></sup> Ports were undoubtedly used, but unlike the monumental ports of the Mediterranean, the structures in Cambodia must have been more modest if we look at how port areas are organized nowadays in the Mekong. The drastic water level changes prevents the construction of fixed structures, therefore the ports may have been composed of stilted buildings, floating platforms and elevated trackways from the platforms to the shore or from boats to the shore. (RA's doctoral fieldwork observations). Perhaps the largest ports were built by the state, but smaller transit points for riverine trade would have probably been organized by local communities, as they wouldn't require great investments. (RA's guess). Other researchers have suggested that there were no ports: '[...] Cambodia had no deep-water port of its own until the 1950s'<sup id="cite_ref-146" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-146">[146]</a></sup> 'Given the location of Angkor in relation to Chinese or Cham ports, some or much of the reported trade was probably overland rather than via coastal ports.'<sup id="cite_ref-147" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-147">[147]</a></sup> It could be argued that the type of boats used in Cambodia do not require deep ports, but larger boats are documented in the bas-reliefs of Angkor <sup id="cite_ref-148" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-148">[148]</a></sup>. Even though there may not have ventured into the Tonle Sap lake, the large planked vessel represented in the Bayon indicates that large vessels arrived in Angkorian ports. Similarly, ethnographic data shows an extensive use of boats for transport, so even if the coastal trade may have been limited, as Lusting suggests, trade using inland waters must have been necessarily conducted. (RA's doctoral fieldwork observations). Furthermore, in 1644 the Dutch were able to go up to Oudong in the Tonle Sap river with their large ships, where they recorded seeing two Portuguese yatchs and several Chinese junks <sup id="cite_ref-149" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-149">[149]</a></sup>.

Where formalised roads were constructed radiating from the capital, they were important for the state. Given the seemingly abrupt endings of some, they appear to have served primarily to access Angkor’s hinterland (Section 3.3.1).'<sup id="cite_ref-221" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-221">[221]</a></sup> 'The nature of state control of Khmer territories varied according to distance from the capital, and over the Angkorian period.

The ruling elites owed their position to birthright and the lower orders by and large accepted their status as natural, particularly as it was closely bound up with the religious idea of one’s station in this life being a reward or punishment for deeds in past lives. Liberty was an alien condition beyond the social imagination, without words to express it, although some ‘plebeian’ revolts do appear to have broken out before being brutally suppressed. The doctrine of reincarnation at least held out the promise of better luck next time, if one had lived an honest, obedient and virtuous life. As we shall see, life for the common people and slaves was onerous indeed and legends such as the Churning of the Sea of Milk gave hope to the downtrodden. This legend, depicted on the bas-reliefs of Angkor Wat, shows lines of people pulling a rope backwards and forwards, looped around a pole which is resting on the back of Kurma the tortoise. The aim of the exercise was to recover lost objects from the sea, foremost of which was ambrosia, the gift of immortality. Ambrosia also meant prosperous times, ample food, and well-deserved rest after the rigours of labour in the fields or construction sites. The strict stratification of Khmer society was reflected in the division of the common people themselves into different categories; the knum who were bound to the monasteries, temples and religious orders; the peasants or the soldier-builder-farmer class; and slaves.'<sup id="cite_ref-336" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-336">[336]</a></sup>

The influence of some officials seems to have been curtailed after 1080 CE through the loss of their political and economic privileges. An alternative hypothesis is that immunities were curbed some time around 1050 CE and this contributed to the dissatisfaction of elites, leading to a revolt. There are, in any case, very few inscriptions by officials from 1080 CE. Either any new privileges granted to royal supporters were no longer written in temple inscriptions, or, with the loss of immunities, there was less incentive to establish foundations (Sections 8.3; 8.7).'<sup id="cite_ref-337" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-337">[337]</a></sup>

Following these structural changes, the Mandala model, with overlapping and changing loyalties, could no longer be applicable. Rather than seeking independence or new alliances, leaders of successful coups might aim to gain control at the centre. Thus, according to Kulke (1986: 12-13) the aims of both Sūryavarman I and Sūryavarman II, in their respective struggles for supremacy were neither to defeat or destroy the Angkor kingdom, but to conquer the already firmly established centre, and facilitate greater stability of the outer core areas.'&lt;/ref&gt;(Lustig 2009, p. 50)&lt;/ref&gt; 'Further on [on a bas-relief at Bayon] there is fighting between Khmer combatants indistinguishable in appearance one from another.

Neither patrilineal nor matrilineal descent was a dominating principle of legitimacy. [...] [A]s C.

Perhaps they date even earlier, as evidence of an Austro-Asiatic group has been found in western Thailand in Kanchanaburi Province near the village of Ban Kao, dating from Neolithic times (10,000 B.C.E.). Archaeological remains indicate that a Mon civilization based on Theravada Buddhism was present in northeast Thailand up to around the early ninth century, when it was overtaken by the Khmers of Angkor expanding from central Cambodia at the beginning of the reign of Jayavarman II (770/790/802?-834 C.E.).'<sup id="cite_ref-343" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-343">[343]</a></sup> 'As always happened in the centuries-long conflict between the Khmers and the Chams, the submission was only temporary.

In the central region, Angkor’s extraordinary size and the natural tension between the Mekong and Chaophraya basins ensured that Angkor’s domain would remain di- vided until the late 1700s. Although 14th- and 15th-century polities in the central mainland preserved Angkorian motifs, the novel power of Tai- speaking immigrants and of Theravada Buddhism and the persistence of Mon traditions in the Chaophraya basin encouraged Angkor’s heirs to develop an ethnic and cultural profile substantially different from that of Angkor itself.'<sup id="cite_ref-346" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-346">[346]</a></sup> 'But in great stretches of the central mainland ethnicity and language, at first among elites and eventually among the lowland population at large, gradually changed from Mon and Khmer to Tai.

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from military ♣ absent ♥</b> 'All such leaders were tied to the overlord by webs of family, marriage, and patronage whose instability ensured constant fluctuations in the center’s territorial influence. Reliable royal control in the sense of resource exaction was therefore confined to the capital zone, which nor- mally included the empire’s most populous districts but which might not exceed a 60-mile radius. In Pagan, Angkor, and to a lesser extent perhaps early Champa and Dai Viet, temples and monasteries served simultaneously as agencies of agricultural reclamation, ritual validation, and intra-elite alliance. Because these wealthy, self-regulating religious institutions helped to stabilize labor and to concentrate resources, they tended to compress and, in some ways, to obviate royal administration. Nonetheless, the ruler remained indispensable as ritual intermediary between kingdom and cosmos, as military leader, and as coordinator of temple as well as secular patronage. Thus, while accepting that these were weak forms of the genus, we can still recognize charter-era entities as “states” according to Charles Tilly’s minimalist definition: “coercion- wielding organizations that are distinct from households and kinship groups and exercise clear priority in some respects over all other orga- nizations within substantial territories.”45'<sup id="cite_ref-518" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-518">[518]</a></sup></dd>

Indeed, it is altogether likely that after the time of Rajendravarman the kings of Angkor presided over a much more centralized regime than the Khmers had known before. Institutions of government embodied no principles of constitutional checks upon royal power beyond the notion of religious morality. An impulse to totalitarian government was present, and found expression whenever rulers found themselves temporarily without dangerous rivals still at large. We must remember, though, that this tate lacked all the advantages of modern communications and technology to assert its control in detail, and that all sorts of regional, personal and factional loyalties were liable to obstruct the impulse to totalitarianism before too long.'<sup id="cite_ref-519" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-519">[519]</a></sup></dd>

However, the content of the Khmer inscriptions differ markedly from the Sanskrit ones. They are not addressed to gods, but to a temporal audience: authorities and officials, relatives of the founders, and in their broad imprecations, to the world in general. The authors tend not to express a political agenda here, in that they do not praise or assert power. The Khmer inscriptions seem more like legal documents - they often record the history of endowments made to foundations and they establish the ownership of land, setting out the rights of the foundation and the founder’s family. Vickery (1985) has suggested that many such texts in the 10th and 11th centuries have a certain political agenda on the part of the authors, who often appear to be concerned with their claims to titles and land. The texts may list and describe in detail the property of the foundation, record the donors, the circumstances under which land was acquired, the price paid, and settlement of disputes by courts. They may note the weight, quantity and material of temple ‘treasure’ or objects used in exchanges, the rice production of foundation lands, sometimes their location and dimensions. Requirements for continuing support for divinities and temple personnel may be set out and personnel might be listed, sometimes by name, gender, dependents, duties or place of origin, or else as totals. The texts may also refer to imposts or immunities granted to the foundations. The king is frequently acknowledged in inscriptions authored by individuals other than rulers, and a date is often recorded. The king is depicted as having a key role in state administration, establishing inquiries and being at least nominally responsible for legal decisions, ordering building works to be initiated, etc. There is an emphasis on the role of the ruler or of his predecessors in giving land, granting permission to purchase it or materially supporting the foundation, presumably placing the founder and his relatives under some future obligations. The authors record the merit, accrued by the ruler through his generosity, which is mostly dealt with poetically in the Sanskrit texts. Inscriptions written by rulers in Old Khmer are edicts relating mostly to matters of law, temple administration or land allocation and taxation. The texts are somewhat formulaic, though of varying length. Presumably, wealthier temples had more resources warranting recording, and had more literate scribes to produce the texts.'<sup id="cite_ref-573" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-573">[573]</a></sup>

The rice plain- based state elites of Java, Angkor, Dai Viet, and Ayudhya shared land control with rival landed elites and institutions. Some of the competing institutions had been created by the state’s elite to reinforce the state’s legitimacy. For example, temples and temple networks were heavily endowed with economic resources by pre-1500 rulers. Initially this patronage returned merit and bestowed superior status on the state elite, but over time the continuedendowment of temples had the capacity to concentrate in temples income rights exceeding those of the state. A network of temples could—and in the case of the Burmese state of Pagan did—use their wealth and their control over large segments of the state’s land and labor to influence if not dictate state policy (Aung Thwin: 1991).'<sup id="cite_ref-574" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-574">[574]</a></sup>'</dd>

Because the Brah- min ritual office of Purohita was passed matri- lineally from a man to his sister’s son and much was made of this inheritance pattern, some outsiders have assumed that all Khmer kinship was based on matrilineal descent.

A history of women in ancient Southeast Asia remains to be written, however. Inscriptions indicate that in pre-Angkorian Cambodia (during the seventh and eighth centuries), women held posi- tions of power. At least two queens ruled independently, and in other polities they occupied positions of great authority. In the Angkorian period, no queens are attested, but royal genealogies indicate that claimants to the throne could appeal to descent through the female line to establish their legitimacy. In most of ancient Southeast Asia, people recorded their descent through both the maternal and paternal lines. Philosophical and reli- gious systems stressed the complementarity of the two sexes rather than the dominance of one over the other. There were regional differences in this pattern. Women are less prominently mentioned in sources from Burma, Thailand, and Vietnam, possibly due to stronger influences from India and China in these areas, or perhaps because of the different cultural predispositions in Austronesian as opposed to Austroasiatic speakers.'<sup id="cite_ref-579" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-579">[579]</a></sup> 'While the overarching social structure of Khmer society was and in many ways continues to be hierarchical and centralized, in their daily lives kin groups and residential patterns were more important to most Khmers than their far- away relationships with the god-king, nobility, priests, or other social superiors.

Children born to monastery slaves would generally become slaves in their turn (Leclère 1890, 279). Monks could also become pagoda slaves if found guilty of com- mitting a variety of oaenses, including killing and stealing sacred objects. For fornication, adultery, incest, bestiality, administering a drug to bring about an abortion, falsely claiming to have achieved various spiritual powers, plus a num- ber of other heinous oaenses, the monk was obliged to become a slave in a royal monastery (Leclère 1890, 241-242).'<sup id="cite_ref-587" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-587">[587]</a></sup> 'Marriage among the Khmers is generally monogamous today, but in the past Khmer kings were generally polygynous and took their various wives from different regions of the kingdom in an effort to unify their far- flung territories.

This manpower seems to have been largely supplied by the institution of slavery, a practice that survived in Cambodia in one form or another down to the beginning of the twentieth century. The Khmer word “kñur” possesses the semantic resonances to justify its translation by the term “slave,” but one must be aware of potential anachronism. Western notions of freedom and slav- ery may not always be appropriate in judging the institutions of medieval South-east Asia (Ebihara 1984, 290-291), and as Vickery (1998, 226) has observed, the old inscriptions never make reference to “explicitly free commoners.” Given this background, is it reasonable to suppose that because the kñur were not free, they must have been slaves? Jacques (1975) has suggested that they were not, for slaves would never have had their names engraved on temple records, nor would they have been allowed to defile the temple precincts.82 We need to know far more about the nature of old Khmer society and its notions of property in particular before the matter can be more precisely resolved, but for the purposes of this discussion I shall accept the translation of “kñur” as “slave,” subject to these qualifications and for want of a better alternative.'<sup id="cite_ref-655" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-655">[655]</a></sup> 'It might have been expected that, with the fall of Angkor and the adoption of the new tradition of Theravada Buddhism, the practice of monastic slavery would have come to an end. However, this was far from the case. We know that, in Sri Lanka, medieval Theravada kings such as Aggabodhi IV (r. 658-674) had donated slaves and endowed land for the upkeep of the sangha. The same prin- ciple applied in Cambodia. According to a manuscript once housed at Wat Sam- bok ([Keo-Han 1951], King Paramaràja VIII [r. 1659-1672]) decreed that 40 fam- ilies of condemned persons forced into corvée for the king (neak na) and “slaves of the Buddha” (pol preah) be responsible for the upkeep of the monastery and a large stùpa in perpetuity.

Children born to monastery slaves would generally become slaves in their turn (Leclère 1890, 279).

There was no standing army - in times of war, the patron was expected to muster a force of his clients, and place himself or an officer designated by the king at the head. The arms that they bore were substantially like those wielded by Classic warriors, with the addition of firearms and canon (after 1600). Again the principle of five ruled, as there were five corps: the vanguard, the rear guard, the right flank, the left flank, and the central corps or main body of the army, where the king kept himself with his war elephants. These animals were strengthened magically from time to time by bring sprayed with water mixed with human bile (or so say our sources); magical ideas also led the warriors to cover themselves with protective amulets.

<p><b>♠ Rulers are legitimated by gods ♣ present ♥</b> 'Since the emergence of Theravada Buddhism as the dominant religious tradition, the Cambodian king has been regarded as “one who has merits” (neak mean bon), a notion connected to the doctrine of karma, which sees present worldly merit as the result of the accumulation of beneficial deeds in previous existences. Kingship was largely hereditary, yet the practice of primogeniture was not always applied. It seems that “election” of a new king by a committee of royal family members, senior officials, and monks probably predates the modern period (Osborne 1973, 169). In the Theravada ideology of kingship the right to rule is a consequence of spiritual maturity. From this perspective, the prerogatives of the king, once appointed, may not easily be challenged by thisworldly considerations, such as political expediency. The king also possesses the power to “master the earth spirits” (Forest 1980, 57). Therefore he may bend the forces of nature to his will. In this way rain will fall at the correct time, good harvests are guaranteed, and calamity is avoided. The king’s possession of a set of powerful fetish weapons, most likely fashioned toward the end of the Angkorian period (Boisselier 1966, 357), reinforced this supernatural authority.<sup id="cite_ref-672" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-672">[672]</a></sup> 'Here are the most salient traits of the Post-Classic: [...] The monarch no longer a chakravartin, but merely the king of Cambodia.'<sup id="cite_ref-673" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-673">[673]</a></sup> 'There was a watershed, dated to the year 802, whereby a series of competing polities were joined into one enduring and powerful central state. This transition involved a process of contralization instituted by the overlord Jayavarman II (ruled 802 to 834). Jayavarman seems to have identified a means of unifying formerly competing overlords that was rooted first in military conquest, then by placing his followers in positions of authority. This had the effect of establishing a central rule through replacing independent polities by provinces. He also must have appreciated the importance of stressing the mystical properties of kingship by instituting the cult of the kamraten jagat ta raja, meaning "the god who is king." Deification of the ruler, linked with vesting the rights to consecrate a new god-king in successive members of a given family, meant that the succession should be assured. Remarkably, the ensuing five centuries witnessed a considerable degree of legitimacy in the succession, being largely confined to members of the aristocratic lineage of Aninditapura.'<sup id="cite_ref-674" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-674">[674]</a></sup> 'In the Angkor Cambodia realm, a symbolic ‘‘Mount Mahendra/Meru’’ temple mountain became the ritual home of the devaraja in the cult of Jayavarman II in the early ninth century—a cult that inclusively incorporated and subordinated worship of local deities to the king’s worship of Siva (see chapter 6). As the traditional abode of ancestor spirits, mountains were already considered sacred by indigenous tradition. By patronizing the external god Siva, who was known in Indian philosophy as the Lord of the Mountains and for his association with fertility, the kings reinforced their local stature. It remained for Cambodian kings to link themselves ritually with this mountain, the domicile of the ancestors and Siva, and thereby make a profound statement about their ability to guarantee the flow of life-power from the realm of the ancestors—and Siva—to their subjects.'<sup id="cite_ref-675" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-675">[675]</a></sup> 'Post-Classic Cambodia was an absolute monarchy, headed by the king (raj in Sanskrit and Plai, scads in Khmer), whose power in theory had no limit, only the monks being exempt from his authority.

The king was the supreme landowner, and all the holdings of those who died went to him by escheat; but the real wealth of his royal domain lay among the alluvial margins of the main rivers and their islands, where rice fields were annually fertilized by rich deposits of mud (the some kind of situation on which the economic power of the pharaohs of Egypt and the Olmec rulers of Mexico had depended).

<p><b>Supernatural Enforcement of Morality</b>
</p>
<dl><dd>For this section, include any type of supernatural punishment or reward either in this lifetime (e.g., curses, good fortune) or in the afterlife (e.g., hell, reincarnation). This includes generalized impersonal punishment/reward (e.g., karma, mana) as well as punishment by specific supernatural beings. Include specific details of the nature and extent of punishment/reward in the description. Code “compound” moral actions (e.g., filial piety = kin + respect) in multiple categories as necessary. Morality categories are based on Moral Foundations Theory (Haidt &amp; Graham, 2007) and Morality-As-Cooperation theory (Curry, 2016).</dd>
<dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement against harm ♣ present ♥</b> “The heart of Buddhist spiritual life, whether lay or monastic, is puṇya (Pali puñña ). This term is usually translated as ‘merit’ and refers to certain significant kinds of action that are regarded as auspicious and potent deeds. Essentially, merit is good ‘karma’ ( karman/kamma)&nbsp;: wholesome ( kuśla/kusala ) deeds which plant seeds that bear fortunate and pleasant fruits, whether in this life or lives to come, and thereby create conditions for further meritorious action in the future. These are the kinds of action that conduce to the development of the qualities of the eightfold path. Moreover it is making merit that binds the lay and monastic communities together. The traditional ‘bases of merit’ are generosity (dāna), ethical conduct ( śīla/sīla ), and meditation ( bhāvanā ). [...]The practice of good conduct takes the form of commitment to the five precepts usually recited in conjunction with the three refuges: (1) to refrain from harming living creatures, (2) to refrain from taking what is not given, (3) to refrain from sexual misconduct, (4) to refrain from false speech, (5) to refrain from intoxicants that cause heedlessness (see pp. 170- 2). In addition the lay disciple may on special occasions (traditionally the full moon ‘observance’ days) or for longer periods take the eight precepts, replacing the third precept (refraining from sexual misconduct) with complete sexual abstinence and adding (6) refraining from eating after midday, (7) refraining from attending entertainments and using perfumes, etc., and (8) refraining from using luxurious beds.”<sup id="cite_ref-731" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-731">[731]</a></sup> “The nature of bad action is usually illustrated by reference to a list of the ten courses of unwholesome action ( karma/kamma-patha ) which consist of three bodily courses of action (taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct), four vocal courses of action (lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech, frivolous speech), and three mental courses of action (covetousness, ill-will, wrong view). [...] Essentially the psychological states that motivate the ten unwholesome courses of action- strong greed, hatred, and delusion -lead to rebirth in the unhappy destinies or ‘descents’: in a hell realm, as a hungry ghost, an animal, or a jealous god. In fact rather a precise correlation exists here: dominated by greed one becomes a hungry ghost, a class of beings ever discontent and anguished because of being unable to satisfy their greed; dominated by hatred one enters one of the hell realms where one suffers terrible pain; dominated by ignorance one becomes an animal ruled by the instincts of food and reproduction.” <sup id="cite_ref-732" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-732">[732]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of fairness ♣ present ♥</b> “In the cosmology set out above, karma functions as the elevator that takes people from one floor of the building to another. Good deeds result in an upward movement and bad deeds in a downward one. Karma is not a system of rewards and punishments meted out by God but a kind of natural law akin to the law of gravity. [...] Buddhists speak of good karma as ‘merit’ (puñña, Sanskrit: puṇya), and much effort is expended in acquiring it. Some picture it as a kind of spiritual capital-like money in a bank account-whereby credit is built up as the deposit on a heavenly rebirth. One of the best ways for a layman to earn merit is by supporting the order of monks. This can be done by placing food in the bowls of monks as they pass on their daily alms round, by providing robes for the monks, by listening to sermons and attending religious services, and by donating funds for the upkeep of monasteries and temples.” <sup id="cite_ref-733" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-733">[733]</a></sup>  “The nature of bad action is usually illustrated by reference to a list of the ten courses of unwholesome action ( karma/kamma-patha ) which consist of three bodily courses of action (taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct), four vocal courses of action (lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech, frivolous speech), and three mental courses of action (covetousness, ill-will, wrong view).

<dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of in-group loyalty ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> “As mentioned before, the development of a loving mind towards all beings, whether friend or foe, is the aim of one of the meditative practices of early Buddhism (see above p. 53f ). In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsāric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f ). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21).” <sup id="cite_ref-742" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-742">[742]</a></sup> “[...] Buddhism maintained a fairly flexible posture vis-a-vis competing religions and never sought to require laity to identify themselves exclusively as Buddhist or to rely singularly on the Buddhist clergy for all their spiritual needs.” <sup id="cite_ref-743" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-743">[743]</a></sup></dd>

Some texts affirm that even killing in self-defence, or in defence of family or friends, is wrongful, and in general an attitude of non-resistance in the face of violence is commended. The commentary to the Dhammapada relates how on one occasion when the Buddha's kinsmen, the Sakyas, were under attack, they allowed themselves to be slaughtered rather than break the First Precept.

The dominant Khmer kinship pattern is one that has confused outsiders for many decades. Because the Brahmin ritual office of Purohita was passed matrilineally from a man to his sister’s son and much was made of this inheritance pattern, some outsiders have assumed that all Khmer kinship was based on matrilineal descent. This idea has not been borne out by research, which clearly indicates no organized kin groupings beyond the nuclear family such as exist in any lineage system; all individuals recognize both their mother’s and father’s relatives equally. Each individual shares rights and responsibilities with a bong p’on or circle of relatives gained through bilateral descent and marriage.

It was held that the person in the wrong would always develop an illness, such as catarrh, fever or ulcers. The penalties for convicted malefactors were often draconian. For the gravest crimes the punishment was death, possibly by decapitation with a sharp sword, as in the 19th century, but it was possible for felons to be buried alive.'<sup id="cite_ref-804" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-804">[804]</a></sup></dd>
<dd> <b>♠ punishment of elites ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Unclear. This variable is meant to reflect whether or not religious agents (e.g. priests, monks) had the power to punish moral transgressions independently of the state. Of the following quotes, collected by a previous RA, two suggest that Cambodian people believed that moralistic punishment came from supernatural beings, not religious agents, and one seems to refer to much more recent trends in Khmer culture. 'Angkor, in common with most state societies throughout recorded history, was never a democracy and although social stratification in Cambodia has never been as rigid as the caste system of India, there was little social mobility. The ruling elites owed their position to birthright and the lower orders by and large accepted their status as natural, particularly as it was closely bound up with the religious idea of one’s station in this life being a reward or punishment for deeds in past lives. Liberty was an alien condition beyond the social imagination, without words to express it, although some ‘plebeian’ revolts do appear to have broken out before being brutally suppressed. The doctrine of reincarnation at least held out the promise of better luck next time, if one had lived an honest, obedient and virtuous life. As we shall see, life for the common people and slaves was onerous indeed and legends such as the Churning of the Sea of Milk gave hope to the downtrodden. This legend, depicted on the bas-reliefs of Angkor Wat, shows lines of people pulling a rope backwards and forwards, looped around a pole which is resting on the back of Kurma the tortoise. The aim of the exercise was to recover lost objects from the sea, foremost of which was ambrosia, the gift of immortality. Ambrosia also meant prosperous times, ample food, and well-deserved rest after the rigours of labour in the fields or construction sites. The strict stratification of Khmer society was reflected in the division of the common people themselves into different categories; the knum who were bound to the monasteries, temples and religious orders; the peasants or the soldier-builder-farmer class; and slaves.'<sup id="cite_ref-805" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-805">[805]</a></sup> 'In addition both Buddhist beliefs about attaining merit through avoiding telling lies, stealing, drinking alcohol, or killing and beliefs in supernatural retribution in the form of illness or other misfortune also kept most Khmers within the bounds of acceptable community behavior.

<p><b>♠ Funding for festivals ♣ present ♥</b>  Zhou Daguan discusses how noble families funded grand public festivals. 'These people always take as their first month the tenth Chinese lunar month. This month they call jia-de [kia-to] [P: (Khmer) katik), from Sanskrit kartikka]. In from of the royal palace a big platform is set up which can accommodate more than a thousand persons, and is embellished with lanterns and flowers. In front, at a distance of twenty fathoms [Rather less than 40 m], by means of wooden posts put on end, a high platform is built, in the same shape as the scaffoldings bed to build a stupa [Yang (1994), citing Xia (1981) and the Shoufu A text, indicates that the character for stupa should read that for "erect", and the phrase should read "in the same shape as the scaffoldings to erect a pagan", not notes that the meaning of pagan is uncertain], and more than twenty fathoms high. Each night three, four, or even five or six are built. Rockets and fireworks are placed on top. The cost of this is borne by the provinces and princely households. At nightfall, the sovereign is invited to witness the spectacle. The rockets are fired off and the fireworks lit. The rockets can be seen for more than a hundred li away; and the [scaffolding for the] petards is as big as ballistae [an exaggeration], and their explosions shake the whole city. The mandarins and nobility provide candles and areca [nuts]; their expenses are considerable. The sovereign invites foreign ambassadors to witness the spectacle. This goes on for a fortnight, and then everything stops.'<sup id="cite_ref-818" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-818">[818]</a></sup>

"La découverte par notre équipe de crânes avec des signes de thalassémie, dans les sépultures du XVIe siècle de la chaîne des Cardamomes, est une preuve, indirecte certes, mais formelle de la présence de paludisme dans l’ancien Cambodge. L’Osteoarchaeology Research Group que j’ai fondé en l’an 2000 à Singapour, financé par le National Geographic, a mené une expédition dans la chaîne des Cardamomes au Cambodge en 2003. Les études des squelettes, conservés dans des jarres, ont démontré des cas d’anémie hémolytique, probablement de la tha- lassémie bêta, avec des signes physiques et radiologiques indiscu- tables au niveau des crânes. Il est connu que les sujets porteurs de cette maladie génétique des globules rouges sont plus résistants à la malaria. Ces mêmes preuves ostéoarchéologiques ont été démontrées dans la Rome ancienne. Ce qu’il reste à faire, c’est d’appliquer cette méthode paléopathologique sur les squelettes de la région angkorienne de l’époque historique considérée dans notre recherche sur la médecine angkorienne du XIIIe siècle." <sup id="cite_ref-830" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-830">[830]</a></sup></dd>

Because the exemptions to the foundations were given in perpetuity, the total of all the taxation immunities granted would have had a cumulative impact on the finances of the Khmer state (Sahai 1977b: 134). The impact of this is known for other states, which encouraged the establishment of religious institutions through gifts of land and tax exemptions, or allowed merchants to profit from tax farming.'<sup id="cite_ref-836" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-836">[836]</a></sup></dd>
