'The first inscription in the Khmer language, heavily influenced by Sanskrit vocabulary, is dated AD 612 and comes from Angkor Borei; in the following century there were many more. But the details of political geography in each generation are obscure. For some of what we know, we are again indebted to Chinese sources, which speak of a Khmer state called 'Chen-la' (Zhenla). it is not clear what this name represents, but it is clearly an attempt to represent a foreign name with Chinese symbols.'<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> 'Akin to the MONS of Burma, the KHMERS established CHENLA, which enla- compassed modern Cambodia and northeast Thailand.'<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> 'The term Chenla, a Chinese name, was used from the seventh century C.E. to refesetr to the territory of modern Cambodia and northeast Thailand. Modern historians have also applied the term to the period of Cambodian history from the seventh to early ninth centuries C.E. The origin of the name is unknown. According to Sui shu (History of the Sui Dynasty, 581-618 C.E.), Chenla was a former vassal of the kingdom of Funan, and it gradually grew in power until King She-to-ssu-na of Chenla was able to assert his independence and conquer Fu- nan.'<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> 'Chinese records spoke of Land CHENLA and Water CHENLA, the former accessible overland and the latter reached by sea.'<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> 'At the beginning of the eighth century, in 711 and 717 C.E., two embassies from Chenla were received at the court of the Tang dynasty, together with embassies from a kingdom named Wentan. The Chiu T’ang shu (Old History of the Tang Dynasty) stated that from 706 C.E., Chenla was divided into two parts: Water Chenla and Land Chenla. Land Chenla was also called Wentan, and this kingdom sent three further embassies in 753 or 754, 771, and 799 C.E. An itinerary has survived from the end of the eighth century, describing an overland voyage to Wentan across the mountains from the re- gion of modern Hà T|nh in north-central Vietnam.The precise route of this journey is uncertain, but one of the destinations may have been the ancient city and temple site at Vat Phu in southern Laos. It is probable that the story of the division of Land and Water Chenla originated from the realization by the Tang court that the territory of Chenla comprised at least two major kingdoms—one that could be reached by sea, the other reached overland.'<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> 'Chenla is a name derived from Chinese historical records often used to describe an essentially protohistoric period dated between AD 550 and 800 that followed seamlessly from late prehistory.'<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>

<p><b> ♠ Duration  ♣ 550-825 CE ♥ </b> 'Chenla is a name derived from Chinese historical records often used to describe an essentially protohistoric period dated between AD 550 and 800 that followed seamlessly from late prehistory.'<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup>
</p><p>This period begins in 611 CE, approximately the year that the reign of Is(h)anvarman I, who eventually absorbed the Funanese polity into Chenla, began.
</p><p>This period ends in 803 CE, approximately the year that the Chenla period ended with the establishment of early Angkor in 802 CE, as attested in an inscription (the Sdok Kak Thom), which notes that the king (Jayavarman II) conducted a ceremony to free Cambodia from Java by declaring himself the universal monarch (chakravarti).
</p><p>'In the 6th century Southeast Asian shipping to China linking China, Southeast Asia, and India began to shift from coastal sailing along the shores of Vietnam, Cambodia, and the peninsula, to a direct route across the South China Sea from Indonesia to southern China and northern Vietnam. Funan, the coastal polity dependent on maritime trade, apparently collapsed and was replaced in Cambodia by an entity known to the Chinese as 'Chenla', a state, or group of states, or pon-led communities based on the control of land and people, and extracting wealth from agriculture, and possibly inter-community trade, with little involvement in maritime activities.'<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> 'The term Chenla, a Chinese name, was used from the seventh century C.E. to refer to the territory of modern Cambodia and northeast Thailand.

At this level there was no sign of Hinduism or Buddhism. [...] The second phase, from the fourth to the seventh centuries, is still categorised as "Funan" and bears witness to the adoption of the Indian religions, while the third, which can the called the Zhenla period, begins in the seventh century.'<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> 'The division of CHENLA weakened the KHMERS, and their power dissipated in the ninth century when rivals from island Southeast Asia began to encroach on the East- West trade.'<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> 'As the Chinese perceived the situation, Funan in the seventh century was conquered by Zhenla, located in the hinterland. The History of the Sui says Zhenla was originally Funan’s vassal, located southwest of Linyi.'<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> 'The Chenla states that rose and fell between 550 and 800 were essentially agrarian, and their economy revolved around the temple.'<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> 'During the eighth century, the number of inscrip- tions fell markedly, and the historic record became thin. This does not necessarily imply cultural decline.

</p><p><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ confederated state ♥ </b> 'Many historians believe that for virtually all of the 'Chen-la' period there was no one major kingdom of the Khmers but an arena of principalities in competition. Thus, at one extreme we have before us the suggestion in the Chinese sources that the Khmers were subjects of a single unitary state, Chen-la, which spilt into two for a period in the eighth century, and at the other we have the view of 'Chen-la' as an area of competing transient chiefdoms. It is clear at least that certain kings were able to assert their control over a great part of the Khmer territory, and it has recently been suggested by Michael Vickery that there was indeed for most of the seventh and eighth centuries just one main centre of power.'<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> Coedes and other scholars have called attention to a passage in the early eighth-century 'History of the Sui Dynasty' that may be a specific reference to this cult [i.e., the cult surrounding Lingaparvata centred at the temple complex of Wat Phu]. In speaking of 'Zhenla' it states: "Near the capital is a mountain named Ling-jia-bo-po, on the summit of which a temple is constructed, always guarded by five thousand soldiers and consecrated to the spirit named Po-do-li, to whom human sacrifices are made. Each year, the king himself goes to this temple to make a human sacrifice during the night. It is thus that they honour the spirits." According to Coedes, a long-time believer in the reality of 'funan' and 'Zhenla', Champassak was the place where the ruling dynasty of 'Zhenla' originated, and Wat Phu was the first capital of what he took to be a unitary state--a view not accepted by modern scholarshi [...] As for the human sacrifice mentioned in the Chinese annals, this was not entirely absent in Cambodia before the French Protectorate -- for instance, right up until the mid-nineteenth century, humans were crushed alive under the gate foundations of every fortified enclosure, of which they became the guardian spirits.'<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> 'Although the Chinese histories mentioned two distinct kingdoms in the eighth century, the study of Sanskrit and Old Khmer inscriptions has revealed a far more complex political struc- ture, with largely autonomous city-states controlling particular areas of rice-growing land or particular stretches of the Mekong Valley. The rulers of these city-states were only the most conspicuous and sometimes arbitrary represen- tatives of a highly stratified and largely perma- nent local bureaucracy, whose members enjoyed inherited status and performed particular duties within the society. It was clearly exceptional for a large number of city-states to be combined under one ruler, and only rarely were embassies sent to China as a mark of this status (or of the ambition to achieve it).'<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> 'The question is whether Chenla was a unified state, or whether Cambodia was divided into a number of principalities in the sixth, seventh and eighth centuries; probably the latter is the case. As Vickery points out, there was an ‘explosion’ of Khmer epigraphy from the seventh century, with the earliest recorded Khmer stone inscription dating from 612 AD at Angkor Borei. None of this refers to what the Chinese called Chenla. Probably, the decline of Funan was relative, with power devolv- ing to a multiplicity of petty kingdoms along the Mekong.'<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> 'Chinese histories record that a state called Chenla sent an embassy to China in 616 or 617 C.E. The History of the Sui Dynasty (Sui-shu) noted that Chenla was originally a vassal of FUNAN in Cambodia, but under its ruler Citrasena conquered Funan and gained independence. Sub- sequent references described further missions to the Chinese court; the descriptions give the impression that it was a unified state under a king, which had defeated and absorbed Funan. During the early eighth century, the his- tories record that Chenla was divided into two states, labeled Land Chenla and Water Chenla, respectively.'<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup>&nbsp;:'An inscription from the small sanctuary of Kdei Ang illustrates how original documents provide an insight into the actual transition from Funan to Chenla. Written in 667 C.E., the inscription names successive members of an elite family of court officials. It begins with Brahmadatta, a retainer of King RUDRAVARMAN of Funan (c. 514-50). His maternal nephews, Dharmadeva and Simhadeva, served the kings Bhavavarman and Mahendravarman. Simhavira, a maternal nephew of Dharmadeva, was an official under King Ishanavarman (r. c. 615-37). Finally, Simhadatta served King JAYAVARMAN I (c. 635-80). This dynasty of rulers is the major, but not only, evidence for central royal authority. However, by following the rulers’ history, it is possible to trace the development of increasingly central- ized state authority. '<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> 'ISHANAVARMAN OF CHENLA seems to have exercised author- ity over a wide area, as many regional leaders acknowl- edged him as their overlord. One text from 250 kilometers (150 mi.) south of his capital records how the local mag- nate Ishanadatta referred to the heroic and illustrious Ishanavarman. An inscription from ISHANAPURA itself describes the valor and military prowess of Ishanavarman, a king “who extended the territory of his parents.” He was succeeded by his son, Bhavavarman II, about whom little is known except that from the region of Ishanapura he continued to maintain control over most if not all of his father’s fiefs. It is intriguing that a series of inscriptions dating to his reign record foundations by local leaders without any reference to this king, a situation that might well indicate their independence. Jayavarman I was the great-grandson of Ishanavarman. His inscriptions indicate the tightening of central power and control over a considerable area, the creation of new titles and admin- istrators, and the availability of an army, the means of defense and destruction. A text described how King Jayavarman’s commands were obeyed by “innumerable vassal kings.” Jayavarman also strengthened the legal code: “Those who levy an annual tax, those who seize carts, boats, slaves, cattle, buffaloes, those who contest the king’s orders, will be punished.” New titles were accorded highly ranked retainers who fulfilled important posts in government. One lineage held the priestly posi- tion of hotar. Another functionary was a samantagajapadi, chief of the royal elephants, and a military leader; the dhanyakarapati would have controlled the grain stores. The king also appointed officials known as a mratan and pon to a sabha, or council of state. Another inscription prescribes the quantities of salt to be distributed by barge to various foundations and prohibits any tax on the ves- sels going up- or downriver. Thus Jayavarman I intensi- fied royal control over dependent fiefs begun by his great-grandfather, Ishanavarman. Thereafter this dynasty loses visibility, although the king’s daughter, Jayadevi, ruled from a center in the vicinity of ANGKOR.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> 'There was no single state or ruler at this time, but rather a series of competing micro city states.'<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> 'Both must be treated with caution, for if the Chinese texts were our only source of information, we would assume that a state called Chenla existed in this area'<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup> 'Their contents inform us on two vital issues. The first is the use of official titles, such as President of the Royal Court, which was located at a centre called Purandarapura. Another prescribed punishment for those who disobey a royal order. Two brothers of high social standing were appointed to a variety of posts: officer of the royal guard, chief of rowers, military chief, and governor of Dhruvapura. Another highly-ranked courtier became chief of elephants, reminding us of the traditional role of elephants in warfare. A further text mentions a chief of the royal grain store. These high officials were rewarded with honorific symbols, such as a parasol embellished with gold. The trends already evident under Ishanavarman were greatly strengthened under his great grandson: with Jayavarman I, we can identify the establishment of a state. It was, however, ephemeral. Only one inscription of his daughter Jayadevi survives. Thereafter, the dynasty disappears from the historic record.'<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup> 'We should not be deluded by Chinese references to a state of Chenla. Wolters (1974) and Dupont (1943-6) have both shown convincingly that hegemony over most Chenla centres was the exception rather than the rule, and may have been achieved only briefly unde rIshanavarman and more firmly by his great grandson Jayavarman I.'<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup>

"Mahendravarman claimed victories in a series of short Sanskrit inscriptions set up in the Mun Valley to the north, but these need not imply more than raiding expeditions with no long-term territorial gain. ISHANAVARMAN OF CHENLA seems to have exercised authority over a wide area, as many regional leaders acknowledged him as their overlord. One text from 250 kilometers (150 mi.) south of his capital records how the local magnate Ishanadatta referred to the heroic and illustrious Ishanavarman. An inscription from ISHANAPURA itself describes the valor and military prowess of Ishanavarman, a king “who extended the territory of his parents.” He was succeeded by his son, Bhavavarman II, about whom little is known except that from the region of Ishanapura he continued to maintain control over most if not all of his father’s fiefs. It is intriguing that a series of inscriptions dating to his reign record foundations by local leaders without any reference to this king, a situation that might well indicate their independence. <sup id="cite_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-83">[83]</a></sup>

<p>'Throughout the pre-Angkor period there is no reference to any political or administrative entity higher than the pura (with the possible exception of three nagara, whose rank relative to pure is not known), of which some thirty are names in the inscriptions. Sauk and drama are also named, the latter as subordinate to a pure, but the relationship between pure and souk is not certain. Chiefs of pure other than the king bore Khmer titles, mratan klon, and possibly kurun, in Sanskrit svami or isvara ('lord', 'king') of their pure, the latter probably a higher rank than the former.'<sup id="cite_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-85">[85]</a></sup> 'Jayavarman I was the great-grandson of Ishanavarman. His inscriptions indicate the tightening of central power and control over a considerable area, the creation of new titles and admin- istrators, and the availability of an army, the means of defense and destruction. A text described how King Jayavarman’s commands were obeyed by “innumerable vassal kings.” Jayavarman also strengthened the legal code: “Those who levy an annual tax, those who seize carts, boats, slaves, cattle, buffaloes, those who contest the king’s orders, will be punished.” New titles were accorded highly ranked retainers who fulfilled important posts in government. One lineage held the priestly position of hotar. Another functionary was a samantagajapadi, chief of the royal elephants, and a military leader; the dhanyakarapati would have controlled the grain stores. The king also appointed officials known as a mratan and pon to a sabha, or council of state. Another inscription prescribes the quantities of salt to be distributed by barge to various foundations and prohibits any tax on the ves- sels going up- or downriver. Thus Jayavarman I intensi- fied royal control over dependent fiefs begun by his great-grandfather, Ishanavarman. Thereafter this dynasty loses visibility, although the king’s daughter, Jayadevi, ruled from a center in the vicinity of ANGKOR.'<sup id="cite_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-86">[86]</a></sup> 'Men of high status with the title pon are often mentioned for their role in temple manage- ment. Inscriptions indicate that they could donate com- munal land to the temple and organize their kin to produce surpluses.'<sup id="cite_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-87">[87]</a></sup> 'The inscriptions reflect a social organisation with a vrah kamraten an at its apex. This Khmer title may be translated as ruler, or king, but it was also applied to gods, suggesting that the king was at least semi divine. Personal names of rulers ended with the Sanskrit title -varman. Hence the name Isanavarman means prote ́ge ́ of Siva or Siva’s shield. There was no single state or ruler at this time, but rather a series of competing micro city states. Some inscriptions record a local hegemon appointed over a dependent centre by a king. Others name a local ruler but no such dependency. Vickery (1998) has extracted from the available texts the divisions of the population below these rulers. Pon was a title accorded a person of high status, who exercised authority over temples and their sustaining populace. It is important to appreciate that the temple was not just an institution for the worship of an indigenous god or a Hindu deity, but it fulfilled the role of a community ritual and economic centre, to which donations of land, workers and domestic stock including cattle and buffalo were directed. The personnel included dancers, singers and officiants, as well as weavers, spinners, leaf sewers, potters and field workers. The surpluses of cloth, precious metals, ceramics and foodstuffs including rice were available for the pon to deploy to maintain the non-productive section of the community, exchange with other elite leaders, and accumulate for such social purposes as feasting. These texts describe the pon as being in charge of water reservoirs, which are often cited when designating rice field boundaries. Thus a web of social and economic characteristics identified in the Chenla texts resonate with the late prehistoric Iron Age: elite individuals, weavers, potters and smiths, as well as bounded rice fields and water control.'<sup id="cite_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-88">[88]</a></sup> 'Their contents inform us on two vital issues. The first is the use of official titles, such as President of the Royal Court, which was located at a centre called Purandarapura. Another prescribed punishment for those who disobey a royal order. Two brothers of high social standing were appointed to a variety of posts: officer of the royal guard, chief of rowers, military chief, and governor of Dhruvapura. Another highly-ranked courtier became chief of elephants, reminding us of the traditional role of elephants in warfare. A further text mentions a chief of the royal grain store. These high officials were rewarded with honorific symbols, such as a parasol embellished with gold. The trends already evident under Ishanavarman were greatly strengthened under his great grandson: with Jayavarman I, we can identify the establishment of a state. It was, however, ephemeral. Only one inscription of his daughter Jayadevi survives. Thereafter, the dynasty disappears from the historic record.'<sup id="cite_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-89">[89]</a></sup>

As the complexity of the religious system grows, it is likely that there would be more religious levels that would lead into Angkor's 6 religious levels.

<p>'Because all the Classic inscriptions deal with matters that are fundamentally religious in nature [...] we have much information on the central religious hierarchy, but little about the secular one. [...] The religious authorities and functionaries in the royal court were certainly almost entirely Brahmin caste [Level 2], although some priests in the provinces and villages [Level 1] may not have been so. Most of them may have received the honorific Khmer title of sten an, reserved for learned men. We already run across the purohita [Level 4]. In peninsular India, this Sanskrit word indicated a family priest or chaplain; in Classic Angkor, this important individual was the chaplain and chief priest of the king and, at least according to the self-serving Sdok Kak Thom stela, was a hereditary officer charged with maintaining the cult of the devajara. The Sanskrit title of hotar or 'sacrificer' occurs frequently in the texts; this is also supposed to indicate 'royal chaplain' - but the exact scope of the term is unclear since while the royal purohita of the devaraja was a hotar, there were other hotars [Level 3]. Most of these may have had important administrative roles. There were many religious functionaries who received the Sanskrit title of acharya, a learned priest who acted as teacher and spiritual guide; or pandit, someone versed in sacred lore; or of upadhyaya, a teacher and preceptor learned in the vedas [Level 2]. As with many Classic Khmer titles, there is little information on whether these were or were not interchangeable.'<sup id="cite_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-90">[90]</a></sup>

His inscriptions indicate the tightening of central power and control over a considerable area, the creation of new titles and admin- istrators, and the availability of an army, the means of defense and destruction. A text described how King Jayavarman’s commands were obeyed by “innumerable vassal kings.” Jayavarman also strengthened the legal code: “Those who levy an annual tax, those who seize carts, boats, slaves, cattle, buffaloes, those who contest the king’s orders, will be punished.” New titles were accorded highly ranked retainers who fulfilled important posts in government. One lineage held the priestly position of hotar. Another functionary was a samantagajapadi, chief of the royal elephants, and a military leader; the dhanyakarapati would have controlled the grain stores. The king also appointed officials known as a mratan and pon to a sabha, or council of state. Another inscription prescribes the quantities of salt to be distributed by barge to various foundations and prohibits any tax on the ves- sels going up- or downriver. Thus Jayavarman I intensi- fied royal control over dependent fiefs begun by his great-grandfather, Ishanavarman.

Two brothers of high social standing were appointed to a variety of posts: officer of the royal guard, chief of rowers, military chief, and governor of Dhruvapura. Another highly-ranked courtier became chief of elephants, reminding us of the traditional role of elephants in warfare. A further text mentions a chief of the royal grain store. These high officials were rewarded with honorific symbols, such as a parasol embellished with gold. The trends already evident under Ishanavarman were greatly strengthened under his great grandson: with Jayavarman I, we can identify the establishment of a state. It was, however, ephemeral.

Jacq-Hergoualc’h (2007: 85) states that ‘perhaps these animal figures corresponded to the desire of the warriors to place themselves under the protection of this or that revered animal’. It may be that these animals are regional or clan signifiers. At Phum Snay buffalo iconography was very common, especially in the form of finger rings, on bronze bells and on epaulettes.

<p><b> ♠ Standing armies ♣ present ♥ </b> 'Jayavarman I was the great-grandson of Ishanavarman. His inscriptions indicate the tightening of central power and control over a considerable area, the creation of new titles and admin- istrators, and the availability of an army, the means of defense and destruction. A text described how King Jayavarman’s commands were obeyed by “innumerable vassal kings.” Jayavarman also strengthened the legal code: “Those who levy an annual tax, those who seize carts, boats, slaves, cattle, buffaloes, those who contest the king’s orders, will be punished.” New titles were accorded highly ranked retainers who fulfilled important posts in government. One lineage held the priestly posi- tion of hotar. Another functionary was a samantagajapadi, chief of the royal elephants, and a military leader; the dhanyakarapati would have controlled the grain stores. The king also appointed officials known as a mratan and pon to a sabha, or council of state. Another inscription prescribes the quantities of salt to be distributed by barge to various foundations and prohibits any tax on the ves- sels going up- or downriver. Thus Jayavarman I intensi- fied royal control over dependent fiefs begun by his great-grandfather, Ishanavarman. Thereafter this dynasty loses visibility, although the king’s daughter, Jayadevi, ruled from a center in the vicinity of ANGKOR.<sup id="cite_ref-250" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-250">[250]</a></sup>

The territory was reconquered by Jayavarman I in the mi to late 7th century. <sup id="cite_ref-274" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-274">[274]</a></sup> <i>What is the full reference for O'Reilly 2007?</i>

<dl><dd>'Conflict has also been identified in the Late Iron Age, and this too is documented in a text that describes how King Jayavarman I (‘victorious shield’) went to war in the autumn, when his enemy’s moats were dry. There is a series of inscriptions by a man named Citrasena, later King Mahendravarman (‘shield of the great Indra’), recording his campaign up the course of the Mun River, one which might well be linked with the abandonment of Late Iron Age sites in that region and absorption of the population into new centres.'<sup id="cite_ref-293" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-293">[293]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>'These surviving texts are probably the tip of the iceberg, for many other instances of conflict will not have been recorded. Thus, these three protohistoric centuries witnessed the extremely rapid rise of ruling elites claiming divine titles, the establishment of hereditary inequality on an intense scale, and warfare designed to take territory and place trusted followers into new administrative centres. Interpretation of this period as one characterised by warfare and the rise and fall of competing microstates is supported by the records of Tang Dynasty tribute missions from Southeast Asia (Smith 1979). During the first half of the seventh century, 20 microstates sent 41 missions. The next 50 years saw 28 missions from 14 microstates, and in the first half of the eighth century, the number of named polities fell to 5, and the number of missions rose to 29. One inference is that the number of independent microstates fell through a process of conquest and consolidation. Some of these have been identified as being located in north-west Cambodia by Wolters (1974).'<sup id="cite_ref-294" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-294">[294]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ unknown ♥</b> Coedes and other scholars have called attention to a passage in the early eighth-century 'History of the Sui Dynasty' that may be a specific reference to this cult [i.e., the cult surrounding Lingaparvata centred at the temple complex of Wat Phu]. In speaking of 'Zhenla' it states: "Near the capital is a mountain named Ling-jia-bo-po, on the summit of which a temple is constructed, always guarded by five thousand soldiers and consecrated to the spirit named Po-do-li, to whom human sacrifices are made. Each year, the king himself goes to this temple to make a human sacrifice during the night. It is thus that they honour the spirits." According to Coedes, a long-time believer in the reality of 'funan' and 'Zhenla', Champassak was the place where the ruling dynasty of 'Zhenla' originated, and Wat Phu was the first capital of what he took to be a unitary state--a view not accepted by modern scholarshi [...] As for the human sacrifice mentioned in the Chinese annals, this was not entirely absent in Cambodia before the French Protectorate -- for instance, right up until the mid-nineteenth century, humans were crushed alive under the gate foundations of every fortified enclosure, of which they became the guardian spirits.'<sup id="cite_ref-302" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-302">[302]</a></sup></dd>

<p>Code the variables below for the most widespread collective ritual of the official cult. Widespread refers to the degree of coverage a ritual has in a polity and therefore to the proportion of the overall population that participates in or observes a ritual. Keep in mind that it is possible that the ritual with the highest coverage is not necessarily a mass ritual performed at one location, but can be a ritual that is performed all over the polity and of which the aggregate of the audiences represent the largest degree of coverage.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ funerary practices ♥</b>  Vickery concluded, in his 1998 analysis, that the pre-Angkor religious thought and practice could not be reconstructed at all: "it must be emphasized that the intention of this chapter is not to describe the 'religion' of pre-Angkor Cambodia, or Khmer religion, a task which may be impossible on the extant evidence." Apparently, the inscriptions available are not concerned with the description of the cults, as they deal with practical matters. <sup id="cite_ref-303" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-303">[303]</a></sup> Some aspects are known through the material culture: in early Funan the dead are no longer inhumated, but cremated.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ puja ♥</b> O'Reilly recalls that there are several vishnuite sects in Chenla, and the most widespread would be that of Pancaratra. Strict adherence to this sect would require honoring the god five times a day. <sup id="cite_ref-305" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-305">[305]</a></sup> This appears to be a form of puja. The puja is a Hindu ritual that involves making offerings (water, unguents, sandalwood paste, incense, food, honey, valuable objects, dairy products) to an image of the deity, and bathing it, as well as chanting, and sharing small quantities of food with other participants <sup id="cite_ref-306" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-306">[306]</a></sup>.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ mourning ♥</b> Contemporary Chinese sources provide the following brief description of Chenla mourning rituals. "Funerals are conducted in this way: the children of the deceased go seven days without eating, shave their heads as a sign of mourning and utter loud cries. The relatives assemble with monks and nuns of Buddha or the Hindu Priests, who attend the deceased by chanting and playing various musical instruments. These corpses are burned on a pyre made of every kind of aromatic wood; the ashes are collected in a gold or silver urn to be thrown into deep water. The poor use earthenware urn, painted in different colors. There are also those who content to abandon the body in the mountains, leaving the job of devouring it to the wild beasts." <sup id="cite_ref-349" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-349">[349]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ partible inheritance ♣ present ♥</b> 'This local system of ritually empowered chieftainship changed with the rise of maritime trade, because the trade provided opportunities to accumu- late wealth beyond the scope of the pon’s traditional share of communal pro- duction. This further enhanced the importance of family ties, while structuring them in new ways. The traditional system was a matrilineal one in which inheritance passed from the father’s brother (the uncle) to the sis- ter’s son (the nephew); a man never inherited from his father (Vickery: 1998, 19, 23). By contrast, new externally derived wealth could be passed directly to the chief’s own children or parceled among a network of client chiefs. While traditional wealth and production were subject to group/familial rights, the newer goods were subject to personal rights of possession. Thus, the new wealth from outside the community could be used to support personal author- ity over traditional community entitlements, and it enabled creation of broad alliance networks and concentrations of power that might sustain seizures of land and manpower.'<sup id="cite_ref-462" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-462">[462]</a></sup></dd>

Productive lands of all sorts were also donated to the temple, and agricultural khnum worked rice fields, orchards, plantations, market gardens and pastures. They took care of coconut and areca palms, and of domestic animals (elephants, buffalos, oxen, and goats). The more talented and fortunate among them were engaged in cooking, weaving, grinding, spinning, singing and dancing, playing musical instruments, grooming the king's elephants and moulding statues.'<sup id="cite_ref-514" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-514">[514]</a></sup></dd>

References: Humans were sacrificed during the construction of defensive structures and placed under them such that their souls would protect particularly vulnerable areas, such as gates and at the corners of walls. 'Near the capital was a mountain with a temple on the summit, guarded by 1,000 soldiers, where human sacrifices were made to the local spirit. It has been speculated that the place that the Chinese source refers to lies in the vicinity of Wat Phu, now in Laos.'<sup id="cite_ref-524" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-524">[524]</a></sup> Coedes and other scholars have called attention to a passage in the early eighth-century 'History of the Sui Dynasty' that may be a specific reference to this cult [i.e., the cult surrounding Lingaparvata centred at the temple complex of Wat Phu]. In speaking of 'Zhenla' it states: "Near the capital is a mountain named Ling-jia-bo-po, on the summit of which a temple is constructed, always guarded by five thousand soldiers and consecrated to the spirit named Po-do-li, to whom human sacrifices are made. Each year, the king himself goes to this temple to make a human sacrifice during the night. It is thus that they honour the spirits." According to Coedes, a long-time believer in the reality of 'funan' and 'Zhenla', Champassak was the place where the ruling dynasty of 'Zhenla' originated, and Wat Phu was the first capital of what he took to be a unitary state--a view not accepted by modern scholarship. [...] As for the human sacrifice mentioned in the Chinese annals, this was not entirely absent in Cambodia before the French Protectorate -- for instance, right up until the mid-nineteenth century, humans were crushed alive under the gate foundations of every fortified enclosure, of which they became the guardian spirits.'<sup id="cite_ref-525" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-525">[525]</a></sup> Here is a description of description of a similar practice in nearby Burma: 'Human sacrifices at the city gate. — There prevailed in Burma a very gruesome practice&nbsp;: that of crushing to death a man or woman under the massive teak post erected near each gateway, and at the corners of the walls when a new city was founded. The custom of sacrificing human beings at the foundation of a city for the purpose of rendering it secure and impregnable was not, as a matter of fact, confined to Burma, but seems to have, in ancient times, been common in many countries, not excluding Europe. Such a practice, though, on the one hand, absolutely antagonistic to the fundamental tenets of Buddhism and to its spirit, is, on the other hand, perfectly in accordance with the pre-Buddhistic beliefs of the Burmese who, notwithstanding the introduction now secular, into their midst, of the softening influence of the great Indian sage's religion, have, on the whole, always adhered to their primitive spirit-worship. Buddhism could not, any more than in other countries, oust it, but managed wonderfully to live peacefully side by side with it. The Burmese have always believed, in common with all Mongoloid tribes and some other races, that the spirits of persons who have suffered a violent death haunt the place of their execution or murder; that is, they become nats (spirits). One of the peculiarities of these nats is that they resent strongly their place of abode being meddled with or in any way molested, and inflict dire injuries upon those who dare disturb it. Hence the belief that the disembodied spirits of persons buried alive under the gate-posts, or at the corners of the ramparts, provide an adequate and not to be despised security to the city against any possible foe. And this protection was extended, not only to the fortifications, but also to any particular building under which one or several persons had been buried: the Palace, for instance. The spots preferred for such executions were the corners and the gates, as being the most vulnerable points in the defences. A most gruesome feature of these quasi-ritual murders was that a woman in an advanced state of pregnancy, as near as possible to her term, was by far preferred; the idea no doubt being that, in such a case, two birds, if such an expression may be used in such a connection, were killed with one stone, that is, that, while only one person was actually sacrificed for the common weal, two spirits watched over the gate. These horrible ceremonies were as a rule well prepared beforehand. The court astrologers, either Indian or, more generally, Manipuri brahmins, had to fix a lucky day, determined by astrological calculations, and to determine certain signs by which the person or persons to be sacrificed and who were best fitted for the future service required of them could be, without great difficulties, recognized; the fact is, the signs were so general and could apply to so many that it was, after all, trifles of daily occurrence that designated the victim, and so, everyone had a pretty equal chance, among at least a certain class, of being dragged away to his death. Perhaps the most common sign, not unfrequently mentioned in the chronicles, was that the person to be apprehended would come on such a day, at about such an hour from such a direction, carrying such or such a thing (e.g. a tray, etc.) or (if a woman) she might simply be with child. It has already been said how, in founding a new city and building a new palace, the Burmese scrupulously adhered to ancient plans, precedents and traditions; it was, therefore, to be expected that, at the foundation of the city of Mandalay this ancient method of securing protection for and the impregnability of the new capital would be resorted to. And it is what actually happened although the king, a devout Buddhist, the monks, and even the officials, have strenuously denied it, as abhorrent to the tenets of Buddhism;. moreover they seem to have had, it is but right to say, but little or nothing to do in this ghastly business, which was always arranged by the Manipuri brahmins, the court astrologers, acting, it is true, up to the Indo-Chinese superstition. Lieut. General Fytche, in. his "Burma, Past and Present," expressly says that twelve men were caught, bound and crushed one under each of the twelve gates. But popular memory goes much further and assures us that the number of victims sacrificed at the foundation of Mandalay was fifty-two men, women and children; three were buried under the post near each of the twelve gates of the city walls, one at each corner of those walls, one at each corner of the teak stockade, one under each of the four entrances to the Palace, and four under the principal or Lion Throne.1 The native chronicles are significantly silent on these horrors. Together with the poor wretches who were done to death at the corners of the fortifications, large jars of oil glazed within and without, covered with great care, and so disposed that no injury could come to them, were also buried. The purpose of these oil jars being buried was, it is said, to ascertain whether their watchfulness over the city was continued by the spirits of the victims; for it sometimes relaxes, and may even come to an end and in such a case new victims would be required. The watchfulness remains unabated so long as the oil remains intact.'<sup id="cite_ref-526" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-526">[526]</a></sup> Coedes and other scholars have called attention to a passage in the early eighth-century 'History of the Sui Dynasty' that may be a specific reference to this cult [i.e., the cult surrounding Lingaparvata centred at the temple complex of Wat Phu]. In speaking of 'Zhenla' it states: "Near the capital is a mountain named Ling-jia-bo-po, on the summit of which a temple is constructed, always guarded by five thousand soldiers and consecrated to the spirit named Po-do-li, to whom human sacrifices are made. Each year, the king himself goes to this temple to make a human sacrifice during the night. It is thus that they honour the spirits." According to Coedes, a long-time believer in the reality of 'funan' and 'Zhenla', Champassak was the place where the ruling dynasty of 'Zhenla' originated, and Wat Phu was the first capital of what he took to be a unitary state--a view not accepted by modern scholarship. [...] As for the human sacrifice mentioned in the Chinese annals, this was not entirely absent in Cambodia before the French Protectorate -- for instance, right up until the mid-nineteenth century, humans were crushed alive under the gate foundations of every fortified enclosure, of which they became the guardian spirits.'<sup id="cite_ref-527" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-527">[527]</a></sup> Vickery also posited in 1998 that in inscription K.258A there may be a reference, albeit questionable, to human sacrifices: "In certain other Mon-Khmer languages, /sit, sot/ means die, kill, or to be finished [...] We may be faced with human sacrifice, although the evidence is too little and too vague to be sure. [...] At least this reveals one more category of dependent personnel, the lowest, who were really owned and could be dedicated as property, perhaps even sacrificed. <sup id="cite_ref-528" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-528">[528]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<p><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of monogamy ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Regarding Hinduism more generally, rather than how it may have been practiced in Cambodia specifically: “Notwithstanding the Hindu ideal of monogamous marriage as a saṃskara, a one-to-one union for life, traditional Hindu law clearly permitted polygamy to men in certain situations and on certain grounds. In this, Hindu law is similar to Islamic law in approach, as well as to Chinese law and African laws, all of which tolerate polygamy to some extent. Meyer (1952: 108) wrote that (p.378) polygamy in India is ‘as old as the hills and does not form the slightest offence in the Brahmanic system’, although since Vedic times monogamy is seen as the ideal. This is confirmed by Mitra (1965: 49) with quotes from earlier sources, to the effect that ‘the fundamental conception of marriage was monogamous and not polygamous’. M. Basu (2001: 28)summarizes the traditional position: ‘Vedic literature generally endorsed monogamy and [it] was considered the best practice of the highest virtue. However, polygamy was also in practice, especially among the nobles. A number of such instances of polygamy are available not only in later Vedic literature, but also in the Rig Veda.’” <sup id="cite_ref-565" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-565">[565]</a></sup>

These virtues that are said to be common to all humans are known as sadharana (common) or sanatana (eternal) dharma. For example, the Law of Manu (X:63) argues that non-injury, truth, not stealing, purity and control of the senses summarise dharma for the four castes. Elsewhere Manu (VI:91- 2) asserts that avoiding backbiting, hypocrisy, greed, infatuation, anger and discontent is approved dharma for all the stages of life. The problem is that there are different views as to what the actuality of universal dharma is. Radhakrishnan, for example, argues for a sanatana dharma, based upon Advaita Vedanta thought, that is said to be present in all religious traditions. It is a kind of perennial philosophy that is at the heart of every religious tradition not just at the heart of the Hindu tradition. Others concentrate upon a universal dharma within the Hindu tradition itself but there is no absolute consensus as to what it is. Nevertheless, in theory, the ethical virtues of compassion, generosity, gratitude, and non-violence are universally regarded by most Hindus.” <sup id="cite_ref-569" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-569">[569]</a></sup> "The Hinduism that flourished in Southeast Asia emphasized reincarnation, the accumulation of a balance sheet weighing the consequences of an individual’s actions through the procession of lives (karma), the impermanent nature of reality, ritual practices, hereditary social classes (called in India the caste system by later observers), and the powerful role of the priestly caste, known as brahmans." <sup id="cite_ref-570" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-570">[570]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<p><b>♠ Human sacrifice ♣ [2-5] ♥</b> The exact nature of the victim is unknown, but Chinese accounts record the existence of sacrificial practices in this ritual.Coedes and other scholars have called attention to a passage in the early eighth-century 'History of the Sui Dynasty' that may be a specific reference to this cult [i.e., the cult surrounding Lingaparvata centred at the temple complex of Wat Phu].

<p><b>Supernatural beings (e.g., gods, spirits, ancestors)</b>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>♠ Number of officially sanctioned supernatural beings ♣ polytheistic ♥</b> "According to one popular formula, there are 330 million gods in Hinduism. Nevertheless, most Hindus have believed that there is ultimately one deity, and that the diversity of other gods are his or her emanations or manifestations, representing his or her agency in particular contexts. [...] The three gods most commonly worshipped as the ultimate in Hindu traditions are Viṣṇu, Śiva, and the Goddess, variously called Devī, "Goddess," and Śakti, "Power." This triad of deities must be distinguished from an overlapping group of three deities who are conceived in the Purāṇas and other authoritative traditions to perform particular cosmic functions-Brahmā, who creates the universe anew in each vast cosmic cycle, and also, in some accounts, bestows the Veda upon humanity; Viṣṇu, who preserves the universe by intervening to rectify problems through his avatāras, "descents" or "incarnations"; and Śiva, who destroys the universe at the end of each cosmic cycle. [...] [W]hichever deity is conceived as the ultimate is understood to be the source who emanates the others, both the triad who perform the aforementioned cosmic functions and lower supernatural beings, and thus to be the ultimate agent in their actions. [...] There are numerous other important deities besides those frequently conceived as a monotheistic ultimate. One of the most important of these is Ganeṣa, a son of Śiva with the head of an elephant, believed to be a protective figure that removes obstacles. Another is Hanumān, the monkey-god who helped Rāma in his battle against Rāvaṇa, idealized for his devotion to Rāma and Sītā. Other deities important in particular regions include the South Indian Ayappa, regarded as the son of Śiva and a female avatāra of Viṣṇu; and smallpox goddesses such as the North Indian Śitalā." <sup id="cite_ref-590" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-590">[590]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Omnipresent supernatural beings ♣ inferred present ♥</b> "Each Purana tends to focus on a specific deity as the Supreme Being responsible for creating and ordering the world.

He sees the entire universe, the sun, stars, and planets, and all the people gathered on the battlefield within the body of Krishna. Krishna tells him that everything that exists is part of himself, but that he is not limited to everything that exists.

By the law of karma, every thought, word, and deed carries with it a like reaction. Beings are born, live, die, and are reborn based on their actions. Every good deed brings a reward, and every bad deed a punishment. The terms 'reward' and 'punishment' are deceptive, however; for karma is not seen as a set of rewards and punishments doled out by a just God, but in impersonal terms, as the working of natural law. Karma attracts reactions to moral agents like an ethical law of gravity. Benevolent actions produce good results for the person who engages in them. Similarly, actions intended to cause suffering will lead to suffering for those who commit them." <sup id="cite_ref-593" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-593">[593]</a></sup></dd></dl>

The Kshatriyas have traditionally been seen, again in theory if not always in practice, as the rulers who maintain society, uphold dharma and protect the householder system. They built and sponsored temples, protected their subjects and their deities and, to that extent, the Brahmins recognised a ruler's overlordship. However, the kingly role in ruling and guardianship duties involved more 'polluting tendencies' than were usual in a Brahmin's life. The Brahmins have had a dual role in society. Those who are active priests in temples have engaged in functions that involve being given gifts by worshippers and such temple priests are more involved with lower castes. Paradoxically Brahmins who are versed in promoting scholarship and in advancing religious learning but who do not act as serving priests are, in general, more widely admired because they have less contact with the public.

According to Dumont, in addition to the distinctions already outlined that fit varnas and jatis into hierarchies, another must be added. This distinction takes caste hierarchical divides beyond the kind of class distinctions found in eighteenth-century Britain or in the Ancien Regime in Europe, by stressing the opposition between purity and pollution. Caste difference, according to this classification, goes beyond class differences into this other realm of ritual purity and pollution. The Brahmins are the highest and purest varna, and the Dalits are the lowest, in that they are outside varna and are impure altogether. The other varnas rank in between. Pollution occurs in different ways. It occurs through bodily contact of one sort or another, with menstrual cycles, through birth and death, through emissions such as faeces, urine and saliva, and through contact with night-soil, dirty clothes, unswept rooms and so on. Thus marriage and sex have to function within the correct set of jatis in the correct varna. Polluting jobs such as laundering and sweeping are done by people of lower castes so that the blood of people of higher castes can remain 'pure'. Equally menstrual activity among older women makes them more 'impure' than men or pre-menstrual virgins, and therefore women are more polluting than men. They will thus often live semi-separately while menstruating, during which time they will also avoid going to the temple and therefore 'polluting' the gods. Furthermore, untouchable Dalits were prohibited from entering many temples before the post-Independence freedom-of-temple-entry legislation and even now they are kept out of some temples in many villages. [...] It is also true to say that Dumont's thesis suffers from exaggeration and other matters are important in discussing caste. Nevertheless, there is at least an element of truth in the notion that purity and pollution has relevance in any discussion of caste." <sup id="cite_ref-612" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-612">[612]</a></sup> "The Hinduism that flourished in Southeast Asia emphasized reincarnation, the accumulation of a balance sheet weighing the consequences of an individual's actions through the procession of lives (karma), the impermanent nature of reality, ritual practices, hereditary social classes (called in India the caste system by later observers), and the powerful role of the priestly caste, known as brahmans." <sup id="cite_ref-613" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-613">[613]</a></sup></dd>

The householder’s business is the maintenance and support of those in the other three stages of life: the students who have not yet entered into the world of work, the retirees who have seen the birth of grandchildren and spotted their first gray hairs, and the renunciants, those who have left behind not only the world of work and material possession but who have also left behind family and self-interest for a life focused on spiritual freedom. Householders are the ones with material wealth, and their responsibility, their dharma, is to share it with others. [...] The link between the world of the householder and the world of the renunciant is gift giving - dana. The classic image is of the renouncer with the begging bowl, making the rounds for alms. On a daily basis, in Hindu society, food is given to sannyasins and sadhus, the world renouncers who have "cast off" from the settled world of "this shore."<sup id="cite_ref-617" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-617">[617]</a></sup> However, no evidence could be found for actual enforcement of this behaviour--e.g. punishment for not giving food to renouncers.

Villagers’ visions were preeminently local, but according to O. W. Wolters, Khmer courtiers and priests saw themselves living in a Hindu universe. The elite focused on universal gods, chiefly Siva and Vishnu, whereas the mass of smallholders and bondsmen normally propitiated local spirits, the nak ta, including departed ancestors, village tutelary deities, and guardians of trees, caves, and fields, the generic equiva- lent of the Burmese nats or the Siamese phi.62 Aristocrats and brahmins used Sanskrit for votive and aesthetic expression, while the vernacular was restricted to mundane records. From the earliest period Sanskrit massively invaded Khmer, but there was no reverse influence, and lit- erate poetry remained exclusively Sanskrit; before the 15th century, in fact, literate literary production in Khmer does not seem to have ex- isted.63 “Mandarins” and “men of letters,” Zhou Daguan noted, had their own speech.64 Excruciatingly detailed symbolism made temples like Angkor Wat into architectural codes about the fate of the cosmos - but only the initiated could decipher these codes.65 Now it is true that indigenous beliefs and Indian concepts often interrogated one another: local spirits acquired Hindu names or statues, Siva lingas entered village shrines, and lower spirits did homage to higher Indic ones.66 Yet, within this loosely unified world view, the powers and territorial responsibili- ties of Indic guardian spirits, no less than the language used to address them, remained separate from the realm of nak ta spirits to which popu- lar strata owed primary allegiance. If propitiation of village spirits and court divinities reflected a common psychology and similar rules, each ritual sphere was autonomous.67 Precisely for this reason - in contrast to later Theravada practice but in common with Pagan custom - the court made no effort to influence, much less control village rituals or religious personnel. Without normative texts or a unified monastic structure, how could one conceive of local orthodoxy? The assumption that multiple spiritual forces had legitimate, yet dis- crete realms also explains the remarkable fluidity and tolerance of elite religion. Even where the central shrine was dedicated to a particular deity or bodhisattva, surrounding galleries and shrines normally held images of divinities of other sects. Although Saivism normally domi- nated, the relationship between Saivite, Vaishnava, and Buddhist cults was labile, and (apart from the reign of Jayavarman VIII, said to be a fierce opponent of Buddhism) all traditions were assured of some royal patronage.'<sup id="cite_ref-670" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-670">[670]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>'Like Pagan, Angkor was an unstable solar polity. So too, despite differences between the increasingly Theravada culture of Pagan and the Hindu tradition of Angkor, in both realms textual knowledge and detailed Indic ritual remained an elite monopoly, while religious observance at all levels was syncretic and fluid.'<sup id="cite_ref-671" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-671">[671]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<p>NOTE ON THE DATA USED IN THIS SECTION (RA): The changing social and environmental structure during this time may have influenced the level of violence in the area. The occupation at Phum Snay coincides with time the Funan polity was beginning to decline in the south, while the northern Chenla period was gaining power (O'Reilly, 2007). The unstable environment during the late Iron Age (Boyd &amp; McGrath, 2001b), probably increased stressors for people as availability of food and water resources would have been limited and unpredictable. Evidence from the increased amount of violence at Phum Snay suggests a significant change to the social structure at the site during this period. The Phum Snay community may have been forced to fight against elements of the Chenla period since the eventual Chenla model encompassed the geographical location of Phum Snay.<sup id="cite_ref-672" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-672">[672]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>Mortality</b>
</p>
<dl><dd> <b>♠ Life expectancy ♣ unknown ♥</b></dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Infant mortality ♣ high ♥</b> Neolithic populations witnessed an increasing fertility rate coinciding with an increase on agricultural reliance. Fertility rates can be determined using the juvenile - adult ratio and mean child mortality rates (e.g. Domett &amp; Tayles, 2006a). There was an increase of fertility in prehistoric Vietnam (Domett &amp; Oxenham, 2011; McDonell &amp; Oxenham, 2012; Oxenham et al., 2008), specifically during Neolithic Vietnam (Willis &amp; Oxenham, 2013), which consequently appears to correspond to a decline of health. Oxenham et al. (2006, p. 283) suggests a decline of oral health with the intensification of agriculture. Evidence of increased fertility is noted at such sites as Khok Phanom Di (Tayles, 1999) and Man Bac (McDonell &amp; Oxenham, 2012; Oxenham et al., 2008), and rates of increased child mortality during this period also suggest an increasing population (Jackes, 1994), also evident in Ban Non Wat’s population. [...] In addition, Halcrow et al. (2008) suggest a large number of infant deaths take place at or around the time of birth at the Neolithic site of Khok Phanom Di. These maternal complications might be linked with the decline of oral health and corresponding poor health, especially by younger females during the Neolithic.<sup id="cite_ref-673" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-673">[673]</a></sup></dd></dl>

"Increasing interactions between groups from widespread locations and increasing population densities into the late Iron Age suggest  repercussions on health. Evidence suggests communities in the Iron Age expanded trade networks. Extreme long-distance trade continued into the Iron Age between locations as far apart as Southeast Asia, India, China and Rome (Higham, 2004), and continuing its extensive networks into the late Iron Age (Reinecke et al., 2009).

Extreme long-distance trade continued into the Iron Age between locations as far apart as Southeast Asia, India, China and Rome (Higham, 2004), and continuing its extensive networks into the late Iron Age (Reinecke et al., 2009).

She had one of the shortest statures ever recorded for prehistoric Southeast Asia at only 143.5cm; the shortest being a female from Khok Phanom Di at 141cm (Tayles, 1999). Analysis of her dental health showed the highest amount of linear enamel hypoplasia of all the Ban Non Wat women examined, which would have affected her around 2.5-3 years of age. Perhaps unfavourable conditions within her original community led to her departure, such as malnutrition or disease, as she displays evidence of poor health. Her ill health might have continued into young adulthood, as she died at a young age. Alternatively, she may have been forced to relocate communities, or left the area for marriage purposes. However, it appears she may have integrated well into the Ban Non Wat community based on her mortuary goods and treatment." <sup id="cite_ref-676" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-676">[676]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<p><b>♠ Wages ♣ present ♥</b>the most complex rendering of monetary values in eight century Cambodia os also found in K726, each transaction consisting of four basic components -the object acquired, the services rendered in exchange, and the price expressed as value of silver and cloth. the complexity of these transactions probably has to do with the fact that ricefields were being exchanged for services -oblations to the god and labor- rather than readily quantifiable objects. <sup id="cite_ref-698" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-698">[698]</a></sup>

Although this references are from the late Funanese period, it suggests that there was a developed exchange system that equated the value of items in reference to cloth and silver. In this case we know that an undetermined amount of paddy (unmilled rice) given in exchange for a piece of land had the equivalent value of 5 ounces of silver and 1 yau of double cloth. <sup id="cite_ref-700" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-700">[700]</a></sup>.
