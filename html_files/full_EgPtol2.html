<dl><dd>The Ptolemaic Kingdom (or Empire) was one of the successor states to the Macedonian Empire created by the conquests of Alexander the Great in the late 4th century BCE. When Alexander died in Babylon in 323, Ptolemy, as one of his most favoured generals and bodyguards, was appointed satrap (governor) of Egypt, Libya and parts of Arabia.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> The next few decades after 323 were characterized by incessant warfare between those who wished to maintain the unity of the Macedonian Empire, nominally still intact,<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> and those who aspired to rule their own kingdoms independently.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> Ptolemy was firmly on the separatist side, and in 305 BCE he successfully declared himself king of Egypt. In doing so, he became Ptolemy I Soter ('the saviour')<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>, founder of a powerful dynasty (sometimes known as the Lagides, after his father Lagos)<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> that was to rule Egypt for almost three centuries.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Ptolemy I and his successors had expansionist ambitions, seeking to carve out more and more territory for their new kingdom, often at the expense of the other kingdoms that had splintered from Alexander's empire, especially the Seleucid Kingdom of the Middle East.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> At its greatest extent, the Ptolemaic Empire reached as far south as Lower Nubia (southern Egypt), west to Cyrenaica (modern-day Libya), east to Cyprus, Syria, Phoenicia and Asia Minor (Turkey), and north into the Aegean.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> In the words of one researcher, Egypt became for the first time a true 'Mediterranean power' under its new Macedonian rulers.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The peak of the Ptolemaic period is generally considered to correspond to the reigns of the first three Ptolemies in the 3rd century BCE.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> We divide the kingdom into two polities: the first begins with Ptolemy I's accession in 305 and ends with the Battle of Raphia in 217. In this battle, Ptolemy IV defeated the Seleucid king Antiochus III, who had invaded Ptolemaic-controlled lands in Palestine.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> The late 3rd and early 2nd centuries saw conflict within the ruling family and revolts by the Egyptian population, representing an 'age of crisis' between two periods of relative stability.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> Our second polity runs from 217 up to the famous suicide of Cleopatra VII, the last ruler in the Ptolemaic line, and the Roman annexation of Egypt in 30 BCE.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> Overall, the Ptolemies were a successful dynasty: in concert with their expansionist policies, they managed to transform Egypt ‒ and the new city of Alexandria in particular ‒ into the cultural and economic centre of the Hellenistic world.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p><i>Population and Political Organization</i>
</p>
<dl><dd>The Ptolemies were the longest-lived foreign dynasty ever to rule Egypt.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> They presided over a 'double society', portraying themselves as Graeco-Macedonian kings to the many resident Greeks and divine pharaohs to the 'native' Egyptian population.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> Greeks and Egyptians were subject to different judicial systems and Greeks tended to dominate the highest echelons of society.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> Alexandria, built as an ideal Greek-style Hellenistic city with its magnificent library, stadium, theatre, gymnasium and lighthouse, was always set apart from the rest of the country.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> Over time, however, and especially from 200 BCE onwards, the boundaries between 'Greek' and 'Egyptian' became blurred.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The chief aim of government was to draw as much revenue ‒ in money and in wheat ‒ as possible from the population, and for this reason the burden of taxation was heavy.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> The Ptolemies left many Pharaonic Egyptian institutions intact, such as the temple hierarchy with its priests and scribes. However, they used state functionaries and tax farmers to divert more and more wealth from temples, agricultural estates, especially those of granted to soldiers (known as cleruchs), and ordinary peasant farmers to the royal coffers.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> Egypt under the Ptolemies also became more outward-looking, extending commercial and political power into the Levant, the Black Sea and the shores of the Mediterranean as far west as Sicily.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The population of Egypt during the Ptolemaic period has been estimated at around 4 million people in the 3rd century BCE, of which between 5 and 10 percent were Greeks.<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> The total population of the entire Ptolemaic Empire may have reached 7 million.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<b> ♠ Religious levels ♣ 1 ♥ </b>
</p><p>There were many different sizes/classes of temples and a multi-level prestige hierarchy. However, a prestige hierarchy does not represent hierarchical levels of authority within a religious organization. The code therefore might look like this "5 King, 4 High Priest of Ptah of Memphis, 3 regional chief priest, 2 Lector Priest, 1 Wab priest"  but in fact these were only titles; the lower ranked priests were independent and did not take orders from those higher in rank. Since this code does not code prestige hierarchy only hierarchical levels of authority we code 1.
</p><p>Certain priesthoods, e.g. the High Priest of Ptah at Memphis, exerted considerable political influence. Functioned as a virtual centralized priesthood in Egypt; several of the synodal meetings of priests from throughout Egypt met at Memphis, from which emanated the trilingual decrees, e.g. the Rosetta Stone. These priests were closely associated with the priests at Letopolis. See D. Thompson, Memphis under the Ptolemies. 2d. ed. Princeton, 2012.
</p><p>The dynastic cult was founded by Ptolemy II. The annually selected priesthoods of the cult were based in Alexandria, and later also in the southern capital at Ptolemais. Within the dynastic cult there is not much of a hierarchy as there is not a command structure. The Egyptian cults are completely separated. Here each temple functions autonomously. There is a clear hierarchy within each temple.
</p><p>Alexandria: "In the religious sphere, there is evidence - as Arrian observed (3.1.5) - for the worship of the Olympian and other Greek gods, as well as the "Egyptian" gods, especially Sarapis. Of the Olympian gods, the worship of Dionysos, Demeter, and Aphrodite in particular received royal support. There is also evidence for a founder cult of Alexander and a (dynastic) cult of Alexander and the Ptolemies. The priests of the latter were eponymous priests. In addition, we know of, among other things, cults of individual dynastic members, such as that of Ptolemy Soter (the Ptolemaieia), Berenike (a temple - the Berenikeion), Ptolemy Soter and Berenike (the "Theoi Soteres"), Arsinoe Philadelphos (the Arsinoeia), Ptolemy Philadelphos and Arsinoe (the "Theoi Adelphoi"), and the commemoration of Philadelphos's birthday (the Basileia). Although evidence is sparse, it is clear that - as was usual in Greek festivals - competitions and processions were an important part of the various cults. The best attested is, of course, the great procession of Ptolemy Philadelphos." <sup id="cite_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-57">[57]</a></sup>

It is very difficult to provide one set of data for this variable. First of all there is a crucial difference between the standing army and the cleruchs. The core of the standing army was formed by the cavalry, although there was also an important navy component. The cleruchs counted both cavalry and infantry. Do we need to code for all these components separately? Secondly, we need to take into account the Egyptians within the army. The Egyptians were at the same time separated from the Greeks as integrated within the same army. Thirdly, the Ptolemaic army was subjected to important changes over the course of the period. We therefore need time sensitive data. Joe will get back to us about these questions after having consulted with his former postgraduate student.

</p><p><b> ♠ Professional Lawyers ♣ present ♥</b> present: 168-30 BCE
</p><p>Professional advocates are certainly documented in the second century bc. Among the more noteworthy aspects of the technical details revealed in a famous Demotic archive are the proceedings of a trial held at Asyut in the middle of the second century bc is the complexity of the Ptolemaic legal system. That complexity was caused by two main factors. First, the bureaucratic system operated in two languages, Greek and Demotic. Greek, or at least officials with Greek names, dominated state administrative offices (e.g.  the epistates, the stratêgoi) while Egyptians, and the Egyptian language, dominated local temple administration. It is all of this complexity that I think provides us with one of the most interesting historical facts coming from this archive. The judges asked Chratianch the plaintiff: "Is there a man who speaks for you?" A man appears, with a non-Egyptian name, to answer a few technical points on behalf of the plaintiff. He was not a guardian (or a kurios in the Greek sense) because he would have been identified as such. Rather he is simply called a man, but it is difficult not to conclude that he was in fact functioning as an advocate on behalf of the woman. On an unrelated petition on the verso of the text that records the trial and its outcome, Tuot son of Petihor was specifically mentioned as an advocate for the priests of Isis at Aswan. This same man may have been involved in the recorded trial, and indeed this archive may have been his. Much is uncertain. But if it is a Ptolemaic institution, a second question emerges. Was it merely the result of the complexities of the Ptolemaic system, or did it develop under Greek influence? Finally, it seems clear that such reports of trials and the use of advocates, better documented from the Roman period, have their origin in the Ptolemaic bureaucratic administration of trials (Joe will write a paragraph with more details).

<p>"Ptolemy II went so far as to establish a four-yearly festival called the Ptolemaieia (probably in 279/8 BC) ... this festival was intended to be equal in status to the Olympic Games themselves. We are particularly well informed on a spectacular piece of grand theatre organized on behalf of Ptolemy II, which illustrates the lengths and expense to which these rulers would go to impress their Graeco-Macedonian audience. Callixeinus of Rhodes describes in very great detail a pompe, "procession", performed in the city's stadium and, as a preamble, tells of a remarkable pavilion constructed in the palace area that was intended to house a great symposion, "drinking party", for the most distinguished guests. This structure was remarkable for its size and splendour and contained many extraordinary features: enormously expensive and lavish fittings and equipment, a remarkable variety of animal pelts of unusual size, rich floral embellishment that would not have been possible anywhere else in the world, and sculptures and paintings of the highest quality and value. In addition, this structure was designed to make statements about Ptolemaic kingship: it combined at several points Greek and Egyptian motifs, gave prominence to the Ptolemaic healdic eagle linking the family with Zeus, insisted on the military aspects of Ptolemaic kingship, and asserted links with Dionysus and Apollo. The procession of Dionysus, which this remarkable structure was meant to service, continues the same propaganda line ... the dynasty's affinities with the god; the wealth of the kingdom is heavily emphasized in the copious references to the valuable commodities to which it had access such as frankincense, myrrh, saffron, and gold, as well as to Egypt's agricultural productivity. Access to remarkable animals in great quantities ... the military might of Egypt is powerfully impressed on the spectator by the participation of a force of no fewer than 57,600 infantry and 23,200 cavalry ... large-scale removal of Egyptian monuments to Alexandria..." <sup id="cite_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-83">[83]</a></sup>

In the new garrisons in the south these professional soldiers were infantrymen called misthophoroi ... a term normally used in third-century papyri only in combination with other military terms ... second-century misthophoroi were recruited within Egypt and had not experienced the international battlefield... were no longer trained like their predecessors, so their bargaining power was consequently lower."  <sup id="cite_ref-149" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-149">[149]</a></sup>
</p><p>The sources of the recruits were very mixed. The cavalry in the professional army came from a high status background. Foreign mercenaries (especially Greeks and Idumaeans) served as archers and spearmen. The cleruchs were land-owning part-time soldiers. An Egyptian contingent was mobilized after 217bc. Privateers were recruited into the navy.
</p><p>Mercenaries: Galatian Celts, Cretan, Jewish, Anatolian, Ethiopian and Nubian, Roman - need to check.
</p><p><br>
<b> ♠ Procurement of equipment and animals ♣ by soldiers; by the state ♥ </b>
</p><p>Equipment and animals provided by the state. "Cavalrymen obtained their horse from the state, most often probably by buying them with the state's help... the Ptolemies generally provided the military equipment."<sup id="cite_ref-150" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-150">[150]</a></sup>
</p><p>The professional soldiers, presumably mercenaries and the cleruchs supplied their own equipment and horses. There is no data on the Egyptian contingent.
</p><p>In the 3rd century BC elephants were captured locally (African bush elephants). Asian elephants (in smaller numbers) were probably bred in captivity in Memphis, where the elephants were kept. Indian mahouts were in charge. The procurement of the elephants was a 100% state-originated and funded. As a ballpark estimate we can assume there were approximately a 100 elephants.

</p><p>The largest scale collective ritual of the dynastic cult was the Ptolemaieia. A major festival introduced by Ptolemy II (285-246 BC) to honour his parents, Ptolemy I and Berenike I<sup id="cite_ref-158" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-158">[158]</a></sup>.

The foundations of the cult were laid by Ptolemy I (305-282 BC) when he elevated Alexander the Great to the level of gods and announced his priest, the so-called eponymous priest, as the highest priest in the land. By associating himself with the cult of Alexander, Ptolemy procured divinity for himself and for the Ptolemaic dynasty. Later, Ptolemy II (282-246 BC) placed his parents as "saviour gods", whereas the king and his sister-wife Arsinoe II (317-268 BC) were declared the "brother-sister loving" gods.
</p><p>The festival followed the model of the major festivals of the Greek world celebrated at Olympia in honour of Zeus.

The audience was the whole polity, the highly ranking distinguished invited guests from all over the Greek world and the occasional tourists.[EWA: every 5th year, and rephrase for the whole polity, replace by Alexandria focused]. It was celebrated in Alexandria every four years. The festival was perhaps first celebrated in the winter of 279-278 BC, marking the penteteric anniversary of the death of Ptolemy I<sup id="cite_ref-162" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-162">[162]</a></sup>.
</p><p>The most frequent widespread collective ritual that is emblematic of the polity as a whole is the ritual performed daily as part of the dynastic cult. These rituals were performed in both Greek cities. The precise details of the ritual are unknown. However, we can assume that the ritual was similar to the rituals performed in Egyptians temples for the Egyptian gods. In most Egyptian temples a ritual (e.g. the waking up of the god) was performed three times a day. It is very likely that the statue of the king received the same treatment. These rituals were not a public event, but took place inside the temple with only a few people present. (However, again, the fact that the data on this topic is very patchy has to be kept in mind here).
</p><p>Comment from Joe: I would be helpful if we got an indication of the kind of scale of the ritual we need to look at. Is a ritual performed daily in several temples for a handful of people but for the good of the public the kind of ritual we want to get at? For example, the Ptolemaiea also springs to mind as probably the collective ritual that is most emblematic for the polity as a whole. This ritual included several hundred thousands of people (including diplomats from all over the Greek world) for which enormous displays were organized, including a very strong presence of the army. However, this ritual took only place every five years.
</p><p>Comment from Harvey: Daily ritual as part of the dynastic cult is a good choice. The worry seems to be whether it is sufficiently 'collective' but for my purposes what really matters is that there were mechanisms to police the orthopraxy. Doing the ritual in groups would have helped with that - i.e. it would be easy to spot deviations from the authorised procedural rules. But other mechanisms could also have been in play - e.g. the presence of ritual experts/authorities or texts detailing the correct way of doing it. I think the presence/absence of orthopraxy checks should really be another variable and can then drop the word 'collective' from this ritual frequency variable.
</p><p>Dynastic festival (Comment: The funeral of the Apis cult involved a lot of mourning, but this is definitely not the most frequent collective ritual emblematic for the polity as a whole.)
We have no information at all regarding the potential euphoric or dysphoric nature of the rituals performed as part of the dynastic cult. participants in the rituals were solely of Greek ethnicity ♥

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Khoiak ♥</b> "Osiris, the primary deity of the dead and the legendary first ruler of Egypt, was a god who symbolized eternal rebirth through the story of his own resurrection. His festival was celebrated in the fourth month of inundation, from the twelfth to the thirtieth day, when the Nile receded and crops began to sprout - a potent natural symbol of resurrection. The festival is known as Khoiak, after the name of the month in which it was celebrated. It is known from Middle Kingdom texts (the Ikhernofert stela and texts of King Neferhotep) and from a great number of private stelae and Middle Kingdom monuments from Abydos. Though we lack the overall 'script' for the festival, because the earlier records refer only to isolated events, later records, including Roman-era texts from the walls of the rooftop chapels of the Temple of Hathor at Dendera (Fi. 21), provide a fuller account of the Khoiak festival. "[...] "Unlike the localized Opet or Decade festivals, which were celebrated only in Thebes, the Khoiak Festival was celebrated throughout the country. The broad geographic spread of the festivities commemorated the dispersal of the parts of Osiris's body across all parts of Egypt. [...] "The festival had two major components, both of which provided opportunities for public participation. The first part of the festival was a dramatic reenactment of the death and resurrection of Osiris and the defeat of his foes. This was performed before the public, much like a Christian passion play. [...] The religious drama followed a set script, laid down on a papyrus scroll that kings could cite to prove the authenticity of the festivals they held.  [...] The second aspect of the festival was the manufacture, procession, and ceremonial internment of Osiris figurines. New images of Osiris, his ennead (the eight gods associated with him), and the jackal god Wapwawet were made, and sacred boats, sledges, and shrines were constructed to convey the divine statues through the necropolis. "During the festival, the king was supposed to play the role of Horus, the faithful son who avenged the murder of Osiris. However, Middle Kingdom accounts indicate that the king appointed a surrogate to represent him during the festival, just as the First Priest of the god acted on behalf of the king in daily temple rituals (see Chapter 3). At Abydos, the priests claim to have played the role of deities, but we do not know whether they donned costumes or simply stood as representatives of the gods. Some parts of the ritual enactment took place in the temple to which the public had no access. Other parts took place where the gathered crowds could watch and participate. "The festival began with the arrival of the royal delegation. Within the dark confines of the Osiris Temple, a priest offered myrrh, wine, and other 'divine products' to 'Osiris, in all his identities.' The official Ikhernofert claimed that within the temple of the statue of Osiris was embellished with lapis, turquoise, gold, and 'all precious stones' and was clothed with garments. The statue was then placed in a new naos of gold, silver, copper, <i>sesnedjem</i>-wood, and cedar. Construction of the naos and of the god's boat was overseen by Ikernofert himself. "These preliminary acts complete, the procession set out from the temple and made itself visible to the waiting throngs. It set out through the necropolis, led by the statue of Wepwawet (especially appropriate, because his name means 'Opener of the Ways'), who acted as the protector of the gods. Dramatic tension was fueled by a reenactment of the attack on Osiris by the company of Seth, which retold the story of Osiris's murder on 'the sandbanks of Nedit.' [...] One can imagine the screams and groans from the assembled onlookers as the two factions clashed and Osiris was slain. As in passion plays, this sequence always concluded with the triumph of good, as the priest representing Horus defeated Seth's company. In his speech of victory, he proclaimed: 'I avenged Wennofer (Osiris) on that day of great fighting, and I felled all his enemies in the sandbanks of Nedit.' "The victory of Horus was followed by a 'great procession' simulating the sorrowful funeral of Osiris. [...] "Once at the tomb of Osiris, participants enacted the funeral rites and recited an invocation to Re - 'Come down to me!' - to bring the life-giving forces of the sun back to the dead god. Several references to dancing suggest that some of the ritual dance, perhaps to celebrate the victories of Horus and Thoth, was performed. Finally, the procession returned to the Osiris Temple, and the statue of the god was restored to its shrine. "The public participated in the festivals of Osiris through their observation of the procession presented during Khoiak but also in more personal and intimate ways, especially through the creation and manipulation of images of the mummiform god. [...] "Some of these figurines were made during the Khoiak Festival, kept for a year, and then ritually buried, whereas others became a part of an individual's funerary equipment." <sup id="cite_ref-177" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-177">[177]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ daily offering ♥</b> "The daily offering ritual was performed in every functioning temple three times a day, in imitation of human meal times. [...] The offering ritual is known from the Old Kingdom, from the Pyramid Texts and the economic records of Neferirkare at Abu Sir, and it continued to be the essential temple ritual throughout Egyptian history. "The ritual consisted of the physical maintenance of the god, followed by the presentation of food and drink. All ritual actions were made in the name of the king, and it is he who is shown in the temple reliefs, although in reality a priest acted in his stead. Each morning as the sun rose, the temple staff would assemble for duty. The daily ritual involved a variety of ranks of priests - <i>wabs</i>, lector priests, and God's Fathers are specifically mentioned. The Chief Priest would be specially purified in a section of the temple called the <i>per duat</i> or 'the house of morning.' There, he washed his body with water, was purifed with incense, and rinsed his mouth with natron. Texts record, 'There was performed for him all ceremonies that are performed for the king,' transforming him from a priest into a proper surrogate for the king. He then joined the other priests, who had also undergone purification. They gathered the materials needed for the ritual and proceeded to the temple's sanctuary. Before entering, they began a series of recitations that accompanied their preparations - the utterance for lighting the fire; the utterances for taking the incense, putting the brazier on the censer, and putting incense on the fire; and, finally, the 'utterance for advancing to the holy place.' The sense that the ritual was in theory performed by the king is evidence in the Chief Priest's first ritual words: 'It is the king who sends me.' "Each step of the ritual was highly symbolic, referred to mythic events, and was accompanied by a set liturgy. To begin the ritual, the priest awakened the god who slept in the sealed shrine. Holding a candle, he entered the sanctuary, chanting, 'Awake in peace! May your awakening be peaceful!' He broke the seals of the door bolts of the shrine, and drew back the bolts - an action that was equated with removing the fingers of Seth from the eye of Horus. The priest then 'opened the sight of the god' as he swung open the doors of the shrine, and he 'kissed the ground,' prostrating himself before the god's shrine. Each ritual step was punctuated with a specific recitation and an offering of incense and adoration of the deity. In preparation for removing the god from his shrine, the priest scattered pure white sand on the floor of the sanctuary, symbolizing the mound of creation from which all life sprang. He then recited a liturgy for 'Laying Hands Upon the God,' and removed the statue from the shrine, placing it on the sand. After more purifications, the priest removed the deity's outer linen garments and jewelry and wiped away the unguents from the previous day's ritual. Once the statue was suitably cleansed, the priest offered the god lengths of red, white, and green cloth that symbolized the blood of Isis, the uraeus, and fertility. This was followed by the presentation of green and black eye cosmetics. The god was adorned with bracelets, a broad collar, and anklets, and given the appropriate scepters and headdress. The statue was then wrapped in his 'great garment', probably a linen wrapper such as those that were found with the divine statues in the tomb of Tutankhamun. "Now fully awakened and ready for the day, the god was presented with flowers, food, and drink. Economic texts specify that the food offerings consisted of grain, vegetables, wine, and cuts of meat and fowl. When the god was considered to be done, an interval that is not specified in the texts, the food was taken away and the god was readied for sleep. After further purifications, the god was returned to his shrine, the doors closed and seal. As a final ritual, the king performed the 'Bringing of the Foot,' in which he grasped a broomlike <i>had</i>-plant and backed out of the sanctuary, sweeping his footprints from the room. This procedure not only left the sanctuary in good order, but, it was believed, also prevented evil from approaching the god, presumably by following the footprints of the priest-king. "A version of this ritual was repeated at midday and in the evening. The evidence for how elaborate these other two daily rituals were is inconclusive, but it is clear that the morning service was the most complete. The evening service may have been essentially food offerings, but the shrine was not opened, and the activity took place in the antechamber rather than directly before the god." <sup id="cite_ref-215" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-215">[215]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Symposia ♥</b> The most euphoric collective ritual of Ptolemaic Egypt was the drinking-symposia. The symposium was a collective after dinner ritual for men which focused mainly on communal drinking<sup id="cite_ref-255" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-255">[255]</a></sup>. Symposia occurred at both royal and private levels <sup id="cite_ref-256" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-256">[256]</a></sup>. Groups of nobles, highly ranking army officers, court members and wealthy individuals would gather in the evening either in the royal palace or an elite house to mainly drink wine, yet the gathering served as a social forum for elite men to debate, plot, boast, and revel with others. They were frequently held to celebrate the introduction of young men into society. Symposia were also held to celebrate other special occasions, such as victories in athletic and poetic contests. Through this ritual elites affirmed their status and class unity<sup id="cite_ref-257" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-257">[257]</a></sup>. Drinking-symposia was practised by the Greek elites in Ptolemaic Egypt. For example, a great mass of East Greek imported pottery and decorated <i>kylix</i> cups retrieved from Naukratis, the Greek settlement established by the Ptolemies, which suggests that drinking symposia took place there<sup id="cite_ref-258" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-258">[258]</a></sup> Also early third century papyrus from Elephantine in Upper Egypt, records symposia as a living practice <sup id="cite_ref-259" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-259">[259]</a></sup> The ritual involved mainly excessive drinking of wine mixed with water.  The symposium was inaugurated by a libation and unmixed wine tasting, then three bowls of wine were mixed; delicacies were served, hymns were sung, a myrtle branch being passed from singer to singer. Other features of the symposium included sympotic table talks, reclining on couches, homosexual courtship, drinking contests such as flicking wine from cup. Hosts provided attractive flute girls and cup-bearing boys to amuse the guests and respectable women were excluded<sup id="cite_ref-260" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-260">[260]</a></sup>. It is important to recognise that the drinking of wine was associated with Dionysus and immoderate drinking of wine was considered as a tribute to him. Thus, the effect of wine of the symposium participants was important. The wine expressed the qualities of Dionysus and his power to inspire and raise the spirits. Through the growing intensity of the wine, the advancing stages of drunkenness revealed the attributes of the god himself. The stages of intensity range from well being to love to desire to wantonness to deeds of violence. However, the amount and strength of wine drunk was regulated by the host <sup id="cite_ref-261" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-261">[261]</a></sup>. Following the symposium, participants would go out in the streets as revellers, acting out the madness that accompanies the drinking of Dionysus wine. They were accompanied by slaves with torches and perhaps bars. They would parade through the streets insulting the people that they passed in a state of ritual inversion<sup id="cite_ref-262" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-262">[262]</a></sup>.  NOTE: another candidate for most euphoric is the procession of Hathor. The most euphoric collective ritual was the annual marriage procession of Hathor of Dendera to Edfu. These two temples are approximately 80 miles apart from each other. This procession attracted large crowds who came from all over Upper Egypt. Note: Manning comments: "Most widespread??"<sup id="cite_ref-263" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-263">[263]</a></sup> The activities involved were seeing the god (who is normally hidden), drinking, eating, singing, dancing. We know that there was special food to be had. There were no special activities of a sexual nature.</dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ mystery cults ♥</b> Most dysphoric ritual during the Ptolemaic period are perhaps the mystic rituals linked with what is known today as mystic cults. These mystic rituals are associated with a number of deities such as Demeter, Dionysus, the Great Gods, the Mother, the Mistress, Isis and Mithras<sup id="cite_ref-267" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-267">[267]</a></sup>. The rites were normally carried by night, and in secret. They involved dysphoric features of frightening and disorienting, rapid movement between dark and light, loud music and other noise<sup id="cite_ref-268" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-268">[268]</a></sup>. The cults were open to everyone to take part in once they were initiated. Initiations were performed as a rite of passage by specialists who acquired copies of ritual texts and other sacred objects. Initiators were often treated with respect among society <sup id="cite_ref-269" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-269">[269]</a></sup> These cults were characteristic of the Hellenistic world, yet, little is known about how these rites were developed and practised during the Ptolemaic period. Evidence show that mysteries were introduced to Ptolemaic Egypt from as early as Ptolemy I(305-282 BC). The king is said to have invited Timotheus, a member of the Eumolpidae, one of the priestly families of the mystic cult of Eleusis, to come to Alexandria in order to introduce mystic rituals there <sup id="cite_ref-270" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-270">[270]</a></sup> This theory could be supported by the existence of a suburb called Eleusis in Ptolemaic Alexandria which suggests mystic rites were perhaps performed in the cosmopolitan city. The two main mystic cults which could be more closely linked to Ptolemaic Egypt are those of Dionysus and Isis. During the reign of Ptolemy IV (221-205 BC) a decree was issued controlling the activities of individuals who performed mystic rites for Dionysus<sup id="cite_ref-271" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-271">[271]</a></sup>. The document reveals the existence of private religious practitioners related to the mystic rites of Dionysus. In this decree the individuals involved in Dionysus' mystic cult are asked to register themselves in Alexandria and declare from whom they have learnt the rites or received the sacred objects as far as three generations back, and hand in a sealed copy of their sacred text. This decree reveals the state's attempt to monitor the rites and guarantee its authenticity by tracing its origin either through the texts or the individuals who have passed it on to others<sup id="cite_ref-272" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-272">[272]</a></sup>. Yet, apart from this decree no other evidence of the msytic cult of Dionysus in Ptolemaic Egypt has been found. On the other hand, plentiful of evidence for the cult of Isis have been retrieved from all over the Mediterranean world, yet little clear evidence for the nature of the cult could be established <sup id="cite_ref-273" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-273">[273]</a></sup>. It is possible that mystery cult of Isis started during the third century when the goddess was introduced to Asia Minor as well as other Greek islands associated with Serapis. Serapis was a newly developed god by Ptolemy I  which provided linkage between Osiris and Apis. The spread of the cult of Isis around the Greek world was closely linked to the political and military activities of the Ptolemaic kings, it would generally have been city councils rather than individuals who were responsible for the introduction of the Isis cult. Thus, due to the political motives behind the spread of the Isis cult outside Egypt  not all her cults could qualify as being mystic <sup id="cite_ref-274" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-274">[274]</a></sup>. Information on the mystic rites of Isis in Egypt only became available during the Roman period <sup id="cite_ref-275" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-275">[275]</a></sup>. NOTE: alternative ritual army/mystery cults. There are no known polity wide dysphoric collective rituals. The most dysphoric collective ritual shared by most people will be some temple-wide rituals (e.g. drinking rituals). The frequency of these rituals is unknown. The only direct evidence about these rituals is some graffiti left at rooftops and other places. These rituals are not unique to Ptolemaic Egypt, but are common in the entire Hellenistic world. Also, as army cults (e.g. Isis cult) were widespread, it is safe to assume that in this context  dysphoric rituals took place. However, there is no information on specific rituals in such army groups. The mystery cults were open for all to participate in the worshiping. The initiates, which constitute a much smaller group, however, were usually recruited from the (lower) elite. Any information about the mystery cults is mere guesswork. In order to make participants more receptive we assume that discomfort must have taken place. This discomfort might have taken the form of being terrified, frightened, and might have been heightened through sleep deprivation and fasting. Whipping, burning, physical pain, or even touching, did not take place. We have no information on the costs of participation. We can deduce that there was a time commitment involved and there are some mentions of a fee to be paid in some of the mystery cults. Regarding hierarchy: this probably can go: This is difficult to measure in detail. We know that the mystery cults had hierarchical priesthoods (e.g. there were seven grades of initiation within the Mithras cult, also several levels within the Isis cult). We have no information on the question whether the mystery cults were organized in a uniformly manner over the different geographic centres of the cult. As mentioned before the initiates came largely from the (lower) elite, while worshiping more generally was open to all. The overlap between these two groups is not necessarily large.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> frequency of rituals must have varied according to the mystic cult of each deity for example a yearly festival took place in Athens for Eleusis mystic rites<sup id="cite_ref-276" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-276">[276]</a></sup>.

There is only one exception but it is an important one: mystery cults, very popular in Hellenistic times, were surprisingly open to initiating all comers.

<p><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of inequality ♣ present ♥</b> “The philosophers taught a universalizing frame of reference so they encouraged people to look on each other as equals. But as we saw with slavery, this did not translate into actual social change or even recognizing a need to break down categories. The only example I can think of is again Musonius Rufus who advocated a version of male and female equality (in education, for example). He was against double standards of sexual morality for men and women. Traditional Greek religion reinforced all kinds of social distinctions. Foreigners could not worship in most civic cults of another city without a special permission, women were restricted to certain well-defined roles in certain cults, and on and on.

</p><p><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of monogamy ♣ present ♥</b> “Greek culture as a whole was monogamous in the sense that a man was expected to have only one wife at a time (the wife being the bearer of his legitimate heirs). However, exceptions were permitted among powerful men for dynastic reasons, especially during the Hellenistic period (Alexander is a good example, and also the Ptolemies). And throughout Greek history, even ordinary men could have a concubine (pallakis), visit prostitutes, conduct affairs with boys, etc. There was no presumption of male sexual fidelity as a part of the marital state. That was strictly for wives. It was considered in bad taste to keep a concubine in the same house as one’s wife, but that was just about the only restriction. In general, the philosophers said that sexual desire was something men must suppress in order to achieve the good life; they thought that friendship was the most important value and it should always take precedence over sex. [...] The bottom line is that monogamy was the cultural expectation (supported by religion in the sense that even Zeus and Poseidon and Hades only had one wife each). The philosophers did not make much headway in changing this, and where they did, it was more in favor of abstinence (either with or without marriage) than of polygamy.” <sup id="cite_ref-368" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-368">[368]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Ideology reinforces prosociality ♣ present ♥</b> “The philosophers taught various versions of the Golden Rule, whereas traditional Greek morality said it was best to help one’s friends and harm one’s enemies. The only philosopher I can think of who specifically advocates “helping people” over “living luxuriously” is the Stoic Musonius Rufus from the first century CE, but he may have been an innovator in that respect. In general the Greeks had no religious or philosophical teachings to compare with Jewish and Christian teachings about almsgiving, gleaning, or caring for “widows and orphans.” Greek cities sometimes gave stipends to orphans if their fathers had died in battle defending the city.  The most important traditional religious teaching on this subject was that the gods required people to treat “strangers and suppliants” well. That is, you should assist strangers who come to your door in need (and definitely not harm them). You can see this when Odysseus disguised as a beggar receives hospitality (Homer was a basic school text in the Hellenistic period) or in the Hellenistic myth of Baucis and Philemon, a very poor elderly couple who received two strangers and gave them hospitality. The strangers turned out to be Zeus and Hermes, who rewarded the couple. The belief that the gods “tested” humans by coming down to earth was common Hellenistic Asia Minor, where Paul and Barnabas were mistaken for Zeus and Hermes in disguise (Acts 14). Hellenistic philanthropy was closely tied to piety because the benefactions were usually things like sponsoring a festival or enhancing a sanctuary. Sponsoring a festival meant entertainment and free food distribution, but the main goal was not necessarily to help the poor—it was more to enhance the public good. I think it is very likely that the teachings of philosophers encouraged these sorts of activities, but of course the donors also benefited from increased prestige.” <sup id="cite_ref-369" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-369">[369]</a></sup>

A bad man (κακὸς ἀνήρ‎) does not follow justice (δίκη‎) with his mind, and acts immorally; he represents a source of religious pollution and danger for his community. Just as Hesiod connects the bad man with injustice and religious danger, so he presents moral righteousness and adherence to justice (δίκη‎) as coexisting with ritual correctness. Gregory Nagy points out that in Op. 336-41, a passage which follows the lines quoted above, the moral correctness of δίκη‎ is ‘programmatically re-enforced by the ritual correctness of the just man’:26 Perses is again reminded that gods punish unjust deeds (ἄδικα ἔργα‎; vv. 325-34), and that he should often sacrifice purely and cleanly to the deathless gods and propitiate them often with libations and incense (vv. 336-41). Religious correctness is thus laid out as avoiding unjust deeds and as honouring the gods with sacrifices and libations.//"In vv. 325-34 the following deeds are listed as unjust (ἄδικα ἔργα‎): gaining wealth by force, stealing, or deception; wronging a suppliant or a guest; engaging in illicit sexual intercourse; offending orphans or aged parents. These offences span both the social and religious spheres. This is stressed at the end of the passage, where Hesiod states that such deeds provoke the anger of Zeus himself, who inflicts grave punishments (vv. 333-4). Effectively, Zeus holds the transgressor in <i>agos</i>. To sum up, in Hesiod’s poem, justice is represented as a goddess and as a law given to humans by Zeus. It governs all social and religious relationships; it encompasses religious correctness. Moral goodness equals adherence to justice, whereas ‘badness’ (κακία‎ or κακότης‎) is equal to injustice and religious transgression."<sup id="cite_ref-401" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-401">[401]</a></sup> "In all levels of the divine hierarchy and throughout Egyptian society there existed the unifying concept of balance and harmony.

The failure to achieve the required state of purity results in the failure of the ritual. A graver and more serious offence is committed when someone crosses the river without prayer and the ritual washing—then the gods are not only irate, but also keen to punish. This makes sense: the rivers are divinities, and by entering them humans establish a particularly close contact with the divine. It is one of the basic premises of Greek religion that gods abhor pollution, which is why ritual cleansing is a necessary prerequisite for every ritual action. This would imply that entering a river requires a particularly stringent adherence to ritual purity, while avoiding this purification inspires a particularly harsh punishment—a punishment for jeopardizing the god’s own purity.

<dl><dd><b>♠ care/harm ♣ present ♥</b> “The philosophers taught various versions of the Golden Rule, whereas traditional Greek morality said it was best to help one’s friends and harm one’s enemies. The only philosopher I can think of who specifically advocates “helping people” over “living luxuriously” is the Stoic Musonius Rufus from the first century CE, but he may have been an innovator in that respect. In general the Greeks had no religious or philosophical teachings to compare with Jewish and Christian teachings about almsgiving, gleaning, or caring for “widows and orphans.” Greek cities sometimes gave stipends to orphans if their fathers had died in battle defending the city.  The most important traditional religious teaching on this subject was that the gods required people to treat “strangers and suppliants” well. That is, you should assist strangers who come to your door in need (and definitely not harm them). You can see this when Odysseus disguised as a beggar receives hospitality (Homer was a basic school text in the Hellenistic period) or in the Hellenistic myth of Baucis and Philemon, a very poor elderly couple who received two strangers and gave them hospitality. The strangers turned out to be Zeus and Hermes, who rewarded the couple. The belief that the gods “tested” humans by coming down to earth was common Hellenistic Asia Minor, where Paul and Barnabas were mistaken for Zeus and Hermes in disguise (Acts 14). Hellenistic philanthropy was closely tied to piety because the benefactions were usually things like sponsoring a festival or enhancing a sanctuary. Sponsoring a festival meant entertainment and free food distribution, but the main goal was not necessarily to help the poor—it was more to enhance the public good. I think it is very likely that the teachings of philosophers encouraged these sorts of activities, but of course the donors also benefited from increased prestige.” <sup id="cite_ref-426" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-426">[426]</a></sup></dd>

The rule of law was the most widely respected principle, starting from the time of the early Greek law codes in the Archaic period, when the culture moved from “self-help” family vigilantism and rival strongmen to a system in which men were expected to rely on the state to punish crime and decide civil disputes. Then it was a case of how widely power would be distributed among the citizens—in a kingship, an oligarchy or a democracy. The tyrannos or tyrant early on got a bad reputation precisely because he put himself above the law. During the Hellenistic period, the big problem was how to distinguish between legitimate rulers and tyrants, who were to be despised. Generals were constantly freeing states from the “tyrannies” imposed by their previous rulers and being hailed as saviors. There is much discussion in the literature of how Hellenistic cities reconciled the contradiction between the “freedom” they so highly valued and their obedience to a king. The kings permitted favored cities to self-govern (within certain limits), and this is what they considered “freedom,” quite different from the true autonomy of a Classical polis.” <sup id="cite_ref-428" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-428">[428]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ purity ♣ present ♥</b> “As I have suggested at the beginning of this paper, the idea that a ritually cleaned body cannot free a person from guilt and cannot be a sufficient require- ment for a harmonious relationship between mortals and immortals can be un- derstood as an implicit criticism of rituals. We have already seen that Euripides, one of the most sensitive and innovative intellectuals of the Classical period, criticized both the undifferentiated application of the ritual of supplication and the lack of a distinction between a pure body and pure thoughts. This suggests that the development of the idea of the purity of the mind and its priority over the purity of the body was part of a more general process of fundamental changes in the perception of rituals in Classical and Hellenistic Greece. This process leads from the traditional view that ritual actions are effective when correctly performed to the idea that a ritual’s efficacy depends (also) on the moral and other justifications of the individual who performs it. We may observe this process from the late fifth to the third centuries BCE in measures for the exclusion of criminals from asylum, in the development of a new type of curses, in moral requirements for initiation into mystery cults, and more generally in a tendency towards a priority of the word and the thought over the ritual action.” <sup id="cite_ref-429" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-429">[429]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ kinship ♣ present ♥</b> “Piety required respect for one’s parents, especially in regard to making the annual offerings once they were dead. To mistreat a parent or neglect a parental tomb was a sign of moral depravity. Greek city-states legislated that children owed their parents food, lodging and burial (this goes back to Solon, the first lawgiver at Athens); those who failed in this duty could have their citizenship rights revoked. The worst crimes imaginable were incest with a parent and killing one’s own parent. Killing one’s own child did not carry the same weight of horror, although any kin-murder was considered more serious than murder of non-kin. The expectations for ritual purification after killing made these types of distinctions, and they could be regarded as a form of “regulation.” The Greeks recognized both written and unwritten laws. In general, the need to obey and respect parents was much, much stronger than any parental obligation to a child. Greek fathers throughout antiquity had the right to “expose” offspring they rejected at birth, which meant abandoning the infant either in the wild or in a place known to be used for that purpose, where it might or might not be picked up by slave traders. This did not count as murder, although once the infant was acknowledged by the father and accepted into the household, that would be a different matter. The Kyrene religious law code of the 4th century BCE says that “a man is bound as far as his brother’s children,” meaning that religious obligation (such as paying a fine levied for religious offense on a nephew) extended that far, and only on the paternal side.” <sup id="cite_ref-430" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-430">[430]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ bravery ♣ present ♥</b> “Yes, this was definitely a “promoted value.” The Greeks called it either andreia (lit. “manliness”) or arete(“excellence”). A boy’s first school text was the Iliad, and he had to memorize long passages and write them out (or suffer beatings). As you know, this text is much concerned with the display of manly prowess in combat, which was the ultimate test of andreia. Evidence of cowardice (such as wounds taken in the back, or throwing away a shield in order to run) could ruin a man’s reputation in life or death. Plutarch wrote a book “On the Arete of Women,” in which he describes women who behaved in unexpectedly brave ways (usually by showing physical courage, fighting invaders, or counseling their men against cowardice). Some citations from the Hellenistic author Polybius: 5.111: King Attalus brought Gauls over from Europe as mercenaries because of their reputation for andreia. 6.46: [Citing unnamed sources] ‘For [they say that there are] two things on which the safety of a commonwealth depends,—andreia in the face of the enemy and concord at home.’ 27.8 [Deliberations by the Macedonian general Perseus after a victory]: ‘after this taste of Macedonian andreia, the Romans will be much more careful in the future not to impose an unjust or harsh burden upon the Macedonians.’” <sup id="cite_ref-431" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-431">[431]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ respect for property ♣ present ♥</b> “I recommend the chapter “Greek law in the Hellenistic period” in M. Gagarin ed. The Cambridge Companion to Greek Law (2005). There is also a chapter on family and property law. In general, there was great respect for property and a great concern for handing down property from one generation to another through the institution of marriage. First cousin, half-sibling and uncle-niece marriages were permitted or even required for heiresses, in order to keep property within the paternal family. The Romans noticed this Greek habit of endogamy and disapproved of it. Daniel Ogden’s bookGreek Bastardy may also be of help here. Zeus Herkeios was one of the gods who protected the household and its stores from robbers; there were many gods of this kind.” <sup id="cite_ref-432" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-432">[432]</a></sup></dd></dl>
