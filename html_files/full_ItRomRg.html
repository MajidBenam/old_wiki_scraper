<dl><dd>The Regal Period refers to the period at the end of the Iron Age during which Rome developed as a uncleared settlement in the heart of Latium (modern-day Lazio), ruled over by 'Etruscan kings'. Although there is archaeological evidence for the permanent occupation of Rome from the Iron Age 'centuries before' the city's mythic foundation date of 754 BCE,<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> perhaps from as early as 1000 BCE,<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> we have chosen to begin this polity in 716, with the traditional death date of the city's legendary founder Romulus.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> The city prospered during this time, which saw the development of many of the institutions - political administration, legal system, religious practices - characteristic of the later Roman Republic. The last king, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus (534-509 BCE), was expelled from Rome for his and his family's tyrannical excesses. In his place, the leading Roman elites established an aristocratic city-state, ushering in the Republican period.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p><i>Population and political organization</i>
</p>
<dl><dd>By end of the Regal Period, Rome was a well-developed city-state, boasting civic infrastructure (marsh drainage, roads), political institutions (assemblies, Senate), monuments (temples), and a powerful military. It held at least one third of the area of Latium vetus (Old Latium)<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> and had a population of 20,000-50,000 people.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>According to legend, Rome became a city when the eponymous founder Romulus slew his twin brother Remus, both outcasts from a nearby Latium settlement, in a contest over where to found their new city. Numa Pompilius (r. 715-673 BCE), of Sabine origin, was the next king. Pompilius is traditionally credited with establishing 'all the major religious institutions of the state, including the calendar and the priesthoods'.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> Starting with Tarquinius Priscus (r. 616-579 BCE), Rome was ruled by a series of kings of Etruscan descent, who could thus draw on the legacy of this powerful and complex culture from north-central Italy (around modern-day Etruria). The Roman king served as chief legislator, military commander, highest judge and chief priest.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> Archaeological remains found on the Palatine Hill dating to the late 8th century BCE suggest that the king lived in a palace from the earliest times. Rome's relationship with other settlements in Latium, particularly on military matters, were important.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> The hereditary clan system (<i>gens</i>) formed the basis of the Roman nobility,<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> likely serving first as the king's advisors, although administrative structures gradually became more institutionalized (for example, through the establishment of a formal senate and voting assemblies) throughout the late 8th and 7th centuries BCE.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The city of Rome, with a population somewhere between 14,000 and 57,000 during this period, fared well in military and economic terms. Several kings claimed important victories over nearby settlements in Latium and Etruria, expanding Rome's sphere of influence and establishing economic connections throughout central Italy. The Via Salaria ('salt road') and the Sacra Via in Rome were in existence from the beginning of the Roman Kingdom<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> - although at this time the roads would not have been paved. A port known as Caere was situated 50 kilometres northwest of Rome.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> The first bridge, thought to be the Pons Sublicius, may have been built in 642 BCE under Ancus Marcius.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> Roman kings also reclaimed marshland and carried out drainage works.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup></dd></dl>

</p><p><b> ♠ Professional priesthood ♣ inferred present ♥ </b> Early Roman cults were funded by regular public offerings, large individual donations, and payment for services. The hierarchy could also profit from land ownership. Professionalism of the priesthood likely pre-dates the Roman era as similar patterns are evident in Greek and Egyptian civilization. When the state provided gifts, it was often in the form of a lavish construction, such as a new temple. Examples: priests of Isis were "full-time religious professionals" <sup id="cite_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup>

<p><b> ♠ Full-time bureaucrats ♣ absent ♥ </b> Before the Roman Principate there was no formal bureaucracy. The old Roman treasury - the aerarium Saturni - was housed in the basement of the Temple of Saturn <sup id="cite_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup>  The state treasury of the Roman Republic was kept in the custody of the priesthood inside the temple of Saturn, and was managed by elected aristocratic officials called quaestors.<sup id="cite_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-60">[60]</a></sup> Work on this temple is only thought to have been begun by the last king of the Regal Period, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus. During the Roman Kingdom, therefore, the treasury must have been held somewhere else; one might speculate within the court of the monarch. King Servius Tullius (578-535 BCE) - presumably with the resources of his court - may have used this to administer the first census of Rome.
</p><p><b> ♠ Source of support ♣ none ♥ </b> Bureaucrats came from the aristocratic class and were not paid.
</p><p><b> ♠ Examination system ♣ absent ♥ </b> There was no examination system.
</p><p><b> ♠ Merit promotion ♣ absent ♥ </b> Roman administration was typically formed out of a class of hereditary aristocrats. Within the army, distinctions between classes of legionary and distinctions between age and experience were not eliminated until Marius in 105 BCE. <sup id="cite_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-61">[61]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Specialized government buildings ♣ present ♥ </b> The first senate building, the Curia Hostilia, existed from about 600 BCE. <sup id="cite_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-62">[62]</a></sup> The first paving of the Roman Forum occurred around 575-625 BCE. <sup id="cite_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-63">[63]</a></sup> The first coin minted in Rome occurred about 269 BCE (one in Neapolis produced coins slightly earlier, around 281 BCE) and the first state archives was created in 78 BCE.

<p><b> ♠ Formal legal code ♣ [present; absent]: 716-600 BCE; inferred present: 600-509 BCE ♥ </b> A formal legal code was first founded in the Twelve Tables of 450-449 BCE. Law thereafter was based on precedent. Our sources of knowledge of Roman law include the forensic speeches of Cicero; the Institutes of Gaius textbook (from 160 CE); and, much later, the sixth century CE Corpus Ius Civilis of Justinian. Wax tablets and papyri (contracts and wills etc.) also provide information on Roman law. <sup id="cite_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-64">[64]</a></sup> However, before this time restrictions on funerary extravagance, from the start of the 6th century, may suggest the Twelve Tables laws (of the Early Republic) codified an existing body of law and legal practices. <sup id="cite_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup> At which time in the history of the polity did it become present?

Local magistrates dealt with local matters, provincial governors dealt with provincial matters, and the praetors often dealt with cases in Rome. The Roman people could be duly convened as a final court of appeal in cases involving citizens.
</p><p><b> ♠ Courts ♣ absent ♥ </b> During the Roman Dominate administration of justice was "thoroughly bureaucratized" and "regular courts, special courts were established to deal with particular matters and categories of persons." <sup id="cite_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup> Before this time there was no specialised court building. Courts could be held in the basilicas<sup id="cite_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-68">[68]</a></sup> (introduced by the 3rd Century BCE<sup id="cite_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-69">[69]</a></sup>) where a provincial governor could an hold audience or in the Roman forum. Basilicas were multi-purpose buildings a place for banking and money-changing and town hall activities. The forum was a multi-purpose building which had existed since the Roman Kingdom.
</p><p><b> ♠ Professional Lawyers ♣ absent ♥</b> Law specialists first existed during the Principate when they commanded fees for their expertise. We know this because Emperor Claudius attempted to "limit the fees of advocates, which had become intolerably heavy" to protect "women and other helpless litigants from the rapacity of their lawyers." <sup id="cite_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-70">[70]</a></sup> The first law school in Rome, for persons who wished to pursue career in the Imperial civil service, was established late second century CE. "Professional" lawyers replaced orators during the Roman Dominate period.<sup id="cite_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup>

[...] Curiously enough the leaders of the revolt were themselves close relatives of the tyrant (cf. above, p. 123). [...] The king, who was conducting a war against Ardea, hastened back to Rome on hearing news of the coup, but found the gates barred against him; meanwhile the leaders of the revolt went to Ardea and won over the army, which expelled the king's sons. Brutus and Tarquinius Collatinus became the first consuls, and Brutus made the people swear never again to tolerate a king and to punish with death anyone who tried to restore the monarchy."<sup id="cite_ref-185" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-185">[185]</a></sup>

It was once generally thought that 'Faliscan' was a separate language, but a recently discovered inscription has shown that some of the morphological peculiarities of Faliscan were also characteristic of the language spoken at Satricum, a Latin community some 80 kilometres to the south.

Around 120 Etruscan texts survive from the seventh century BC, and a further 800 or so can be dated to the sixth and fifth centuries.

The area was sprinkled with milk by women. We know also that the festival ends with a huge bonfire, which could portend evil, such as when it forked in two before Pharsalus.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Saturnalia ♥</b> This festival occurred "on December 17, when the senators performed a mass animal sacrifice at the temple of Saturn, and afterward there was a huge banquet to which everyone was invited. The rest of the week was taken up with non-stop parties and feasts. All shops, law courts, and schools were closed. Normal moral restraints were loosened and everyone was expected to engage in all forms of revelry and fun. This was the only time of year when people were legally allowed to gamble in public. Bands of revelers ran through the streets drinking and shouting 'lo Saturnalia.' "Some of the customs of this festival involved inversions in status. Thus, for one day of the week, slaves were treated as equals, and often at the banquet that day, masters would wait on their slaves and serve them their food. During the festival, everyone wore liberty caps, symbolizing either that for the moment everyone was equal or that everyone was expected to behave with freedom and abandon. Each family would select a princeps, or "leader," of the Saturnalia, who presided over the parties. Often this was someone normally of low status, such as a child. Another custom of the Saturnalia was exchanging gifts. People gave dolls made out of clay to children and wax candles to their friends." <sup id="cite_ref-342" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-342">[342]</a></sup> NB This is a description of how this festival would have been celebrated in much later times--descriptions of earlier versions of the festival could not be found. Moreover, the Vinalia and Parilia festivals would also have featured euphoric elements <sup id="cite_ref-343" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-343">[343]</a></sup>, but the Saturnalia appears to be better known.</dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Lemuria ♥</b> "Unlike the <i>Parentalia</i> festival, there seems to be no public celebration during the Lemuria, which makes the festival stand out against the others. [...] Our knowledge about the <i>Lemuria</i> festival is very limited. It seems to be an exorcism of sorts, an expulsion of ghosts from the house. The majority of information about the festival comes from Ovid's <i>Fasti</i>, an elegiac poem which was published in AD 8. [...] The only other information we have comes from inscriptions of state calendars, where the <i>Lemuria</i> is listed, as Ovid confirms, as taking place over three days in May, and is marked as 'N', a <i>dies Nefasti</i>, which prohibited marriage on this day and meant that temples and law courts were closed, and that the Senate were not to assemble. [...] <i>Lemures</i> is another term for the dead. It is thought to denote a 'terrifying and malicious' ghost. [...] Ovid says that the ritual takes place at midnight, and the worshipper, commonly identified as the <i>Paterfamilias</i>, rises. He goes barefoot, and makes a 'sign with his thumb in the middle of his closed fingers', and washes his hands. He then accepts black beans, turns his face away, and throws them away. He says 'These I cast: With these beans I redeem me and mine,' nine times, then washes his hands with water. He clashes bronze pots and says nine times, 'Ghosts of my fathers, go forth'." <sup id="cite_ref-379" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-379">[379]</a></sup>.</dd>

The relationship between a patriarch and his family is a relationship of mutual obligations, and this is how the Romans understood the monarchy. In early Roman society, however, the father exercised incredible authority over the family. The father could sell his children into slavery (or could kill them if he could justify it). This arbitrary power was limited: before a father sold or killed his children, he was required to consult with the family and with the public. While the father was not allowed to kill or sell his wife, he was allowed to divorce her; this was allowed, however, only in the most extreme circumstances. In addition, the father served as the priest of the family. In many ways, the Roman monarch followed this model of power: absolute but limited by the people, their welfare, and tradition. The monarch served as a legislator, as the head of the military, as the head of the judiciary, and as a chief priest to the people.

<p><b>♠ State-level administrators ♣ present ♥</b>
</p><p>the 753-509 BCE period saw the increasing hierarchization of the Roman polity. An apparent feature of this social process in Rome "and Latium more generally" was the emergence of "two distinct groups"<sup id="cite_ref-466" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-466">[466]</a></sup>: a "gens-based aristocracy and the settled, proto-urban and urban populations".<sup id="cite_ref-467" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-467">[467]</a></sup> The settled population initiated developments as it was likely present before the mobile, tribal aristocracy: its curiate system of government is thought to have "represented the archaic urban settlement of Rome".<sup id="cite_ref-468" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-468">[468]</a></sup> Some consider early Rome similar to a Greek polis<sup id="cite_ref-469" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-469">[469]</a></sup> but this Hellenistic influence should not be confused with a (presumably separate) "Hellenization of Rome" which occurred in the late fourth, early third BCE.<sup id="cite_ref-470" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-470">[470]</a></sup> The earliest polity had an assembly with senior magistrates<sup id="cite_ref-471" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-471">[471]</a></sup> and is considered a Kingdom (with local Latin or Sabine kings) lack of evidence means precise details are not available and conclusions are somewhat guesswork.
</p><p>An important point is that "the urban community at Rome may have begun to develop a distinct, community-based identity from the eighth century onwards"<sup id="cite_ref-472" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-472">[472]</a></sup> well before it acquired the institutions for which it became famous. Certainly, however, by 6th CE the distinctive Roman polity that was to be the basis of the Roman Republic was beginning to form. The period of Etruscan monarchs, beginning with Lucius Tarquinius Priscus from 616 BCE, appears to represent the time of an additional step-up in hierarchization of the Roman polity, when its two constituent groups (to be known as patricians and plebians) became ever more distinguishable. The first senate building, the Curia Hostilia, existed from about 600 BCE.<sup id="cite_ref-473" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-473">[473]</a></sup>
</p><p>The late Roman Kingdom saw the first paving of the Roman Forum around 625-575 BCE<sup id="cite_ref-474" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-474">[474]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-475" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-475">[475]</a></sup> as well as large building projects such as the Cloaca Maxima, Circus Maximus and the Temple of Jupiter. Following Etruscan king Priscus, king Servius Tullius instituted some revolutionary reforms which included a new legislative assembly that cemented the power of the aristocracy. In addition to the comitia curiata which was likely "a purely patrician body"<sup id="cite_ref-476" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-476">[476]</a></sup> he "created the form of suffrage known as the comitia centuriata, a method of voting based on property qualification: i. e., in the comitia centuriata all Roman citizens voted; but their votes were grouped in classes according to their property holding."<sup id="cite_ref-477" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-477">[477]</a></sup> In this comitia centuriata, which was probably was the legislature of the late Roman Kingdom (as it was later in the early Republic), votes were "proportionate to wealth."<sup id="cite_ref-478" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-478">[478]</a></sup> In terms of the flora of state institutions in the Late Roman Kingdom we have "an executive, priestly and judicial head, the Rex or king; his cabinet or advisory council, the Senatus, or Senate".<sup id="cite_ref-479" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-479">[479]</a></sup> The priesthood and top juditical authority was not at this time separate from the executive. There certainly was no central bureaucracy either - this did not emerge in the Roman world until the Roman Principate when salaried officials worked in the Imperial Bureaux (scrinia)<sup id="cite_ref-480" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-480">[480]</a></sup>, although king Servius Tullius - presumably with the resources of his court - managed to administer the first census of Rome. During the Republic period the state treasury was held in the temple of Saturn, controlled by elected quaestors under the supervision of the Senate<sup id="cite_ref-481" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-481">[481]</a></sup> but this building did not exist during the Roman Kingdom so probably neither did elected quaestors. Usually dated to c500 BCE, work on the temple of Saturn is thought to have been begun by the last king Lucius Tarquinius Superbus. If the Roman Kingdom had a treasury it must have been held somewhere else at this time; one might speculate within the court of the monarch.

For all the accounts we have of Rome's earliest history are found in writers (Dionysius amongst them) who lived in the first Century B.C. or later - more than 600 years after the dates usually given to the reigns of Romulus and Numa. None of our sources is contemporary with the events they describe. Nor could their authors have read any such contemporary accounts on which to base their own: so far as we know, there were no writers in earliest, regal Rome; there was no account left by Numa, say, of his religious foundations. [...] Judged by our own Standards of historical 'accuracy', these ancient accounts of early Rome and its religion are inadequate and misleading; they construct an image of a relatively sophisticated society, more like the city of the first Century B. C. than the hamlet of the eighth Century. Projections of the contemporary world back into the distant past, they are more myth than history. " <sup id="cite_ref-599" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-599">[599]</a></sup> "Recent work, particularly in archaeology, has cast doubt on the idea of an early, uncontaminated, native strand of genuine Roman religion; and it has suggested that, rather than seeing pure Roman traditions gradually polluted from outside, Roman religion was an amalgam of different traditions from at least as far back as we can hope to go. Leaving aside its mythical prehistory, Roman religion was always already multicultural." <sup id="cite_ref-600" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-600">[600]</a></sup> "Much of the evidence for the early history of the Roman gods remains tantalizing. But it is possible to offer a rough outline of their place in the life of Rome: closely involved in the political and military activity of the city, they are seen as forces outside the human Community with whom the man of learning and skill, knowing the rules, traditions and rituals, can negotiate and communicate (and if necessary assuage); the activities of the city's leaders on the city's behalf could hardly be conceived except in the context of such a procedure of negotiation and Joint action; divine benevolence (secured by human effort) was essential to the success of the State; Rome's history in other words was determined by the actions of men and gods together." <sup id="cite_ref-601" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-601">[601]</a></sup>

In the most extreme case, in face of a disaster in battle, the general even could dedicate himself and the legions or the enemy to the gods of the dead and to the Earth, in a ceremony known as devotio. In effect, he made himself sacred, the property of the gods (sacer), rather like a sacrificial victim; he then had to mount a horse and rush precipitately to his death on the enemies' spears. This is first reported as having happened in 340 B.C., when the consul Decius Mus offered his own life; some accounts have his son and grandson follow his example a generation and two generations later. Here the consul's death obviously counted as the fulfilment of the vow, though in that respect the sequence of events was different from usual - since the vow had to be fulfilled before the gods had had the opportunity to do their part. If the consul failed to die, according to Livy, an over-life-size image was buried in the earth, evidently as an attempt to fulfil the unsatisfied vow." <sup id="cite_ref-610" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-610">[610]</a></sup> <i>Warfare didn't ramp up until Republic period.
