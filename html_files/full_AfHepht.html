<b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ nominal; confederated state ♥ </b>
</p><p>The Hepthalites were one group of a series of nomadic tribal confederations that are sometimes referred to as the White Huns. The evidence seems to indicate that they were a second wave of Hunnish migration. Commentators at the time differ as to what the structure of the group was and to what degree they differed from the other nomadic peoples of the area. The Byzantian commentator  Procopius of Caesarea stressed that, 'They are not nomadic like the other Hunnish peoples, but have long since settled on fertile land.' He further explained that unlike the other peoples of central asia, the Hepthalites were, 'ruled by one king and possess a legal state structure, observing justice among themselves and with their neighbours in no lesser measure than the Byzantines and Persians.' <sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>

Every morning they first go outside [of their tents] and pray to [the] gods and then take breakfast.’ For the Chinese observer, the heaven god and the fire god were evidently foreign gods.

In 532 CE India was lost after a successful rebellion. In 557 CE - 561 CE the Sasasanids annexed substantial territories, and in 565 CE the Goturks claimed the remainder and took a number of successor kingdoms as vassals.

</p><p>There seems to have was a great deal of autonomy in the Hepthalite kingdoms. This was the case in Chaganiyan, on the upper and middle reaches of the Surkhan Darya. There is some speculation that local administrative structures were maintained, but this does not have enough evidence for anything beyond the extraction of tribute. There is also some limited evidence of the titles of officials from gemstones. <sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup>
</p><p>Small family landholdings
</p>
<dl><dd> Fraternal polyandry marriage "it was the custom for women to adorn their hats with horns, one per husband." "If a man had no brothers he would often adopt another man so as to be able to marry." More recently Tibetans who practiced this form of marriage did it "to make sure that small family landholdings did not have to be divided among brothers. Instead all male offspring remained on their parents' land and worked it together as a single landholding. This system also limits population growth significantly since each generation produces the children of only one woman instead of offspring from the wives of all brothers." However, since the Hephthalite nomads did not have family farms they may have practiced this form of marriage for keeping the herds together and population control. Chinese records don't mention status of the presumably many unmarried Hephthalite women.<sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<b> ♠ Religious levels ♣ 1 ♥ </b>
The city of Balkh had about 100 Buddhist monasteries and some 3,000 monks. Outside the town was a large Buddhist monastery, although this description occurs after the area had been conquered by the Turks. Buddhism, Zoroastrianism,  Christianity, a Sun cult and some kind of sky and fire worship are also attested. However, we have no information as to what the Hepthalites practiced, and whether this had a hierarchical structure.  <sup id="cite_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup>

During the siege of Heraklia in 803, however, stone balls wrapped in linen and covered with burning naphtha were hurled by mangonels against the ramparts. The fire would cling to the stones and cause them to burst. From that time onwards, the caliphate employed corps of naphtha-throwers and the Muslim fleets were provided with it as well. In order to protect themselves, people covered flammable materials with newly flayed animal skins and those who handled the naphtha wore clothes saturated with talc. Naphtha-filled glass grenades appeared first in 934, unless in that year the weapons were actually incendiary javelins, but the use of fire grenades was firmly established a few years later. ... The latest historian of Greek fire, Maurice Mercier, admits that during the thirteenth century, people began to use grenades filled with mealed gunpowder, called 'Syrian jugs', which had a most explosive force.<i> <sup id="cite_ref-115" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-115">[115]</a></sup></i></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ No Roz ♥</b> No Roz was "the most joyous and beautiful of the Zoroastrian feasts, a spring festival invested with especial religious significance.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ banquet ♥</b> The Hephthalite fortress of Bakalyk-Tepe, built between the fifth and the sixth centuries CE, contains a room whose walls are ornamented with a mural depicting a rich banquet. Little is known about ritual practices unique to the Hephthalite Empire, and this mural is the only remaining document of a euphoric ritual. It depicts 47 people, both men and women, including servants. Many of the guests hold cups and goblets likely containing "a beverage made from grapes, pressed under the floor and kept in large vessels", that is, perhaps, wine, or a wine-like substance (it is curious that the source would use so many words instead of simply saying "wine"). The servants hold fans. All guests look ethnically alike, except for a woman who may be a visitor from China. The presence of bells and ornaments in the shape of fierce mythological creatures suggest an attempt at warding off evil spirits. The room in which the mural was found also offers details on this ritual: it contains remains of an altar, as well as "[d]ifferent vessels, cups, plates, lamps, parts of wooden musical instruments,buttons and medallions" and the jaw bones of dogs, "seeds of plants, kernels of peaches, pistachioes, almonds, grapes,melons and raisins" and the remains of "silk and wool of two kinds colored with crimson and yellow colors" All this confirms the lavishness of these banquets, and the altar and jaw bones suggest its religious significance: offerings may have been made to deities. Some sources believe the ritual was part of a fertility cult. <sup id="cite_ref-349" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-349">[349]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ mourning ritual ♥</b> Very little is known about the ritual practices most common in the Hephthalite Empire, and there is almost no information on dysphoric rituals. It is possible that Ajivika Hinduism was practiced in the parts of Northern India where the Hepthalites held their sway, but, given the Empire's significant geographic range and diversity of religious practices, painful Ajivika initiation ordeals, though no doubt dysphoric, would not be very representative of ritual in the Empire as a whole. The closest thing to a dysphoric ritual that is unique to the Hephthalite Empire is one succinctly described by an early sixth-century Chinese source, the <i>Liangshu</i>: "When a parent dies, the child will cut off one of his ears." The source also implies that this act occurs during the deceased's burial, and that it is not followed by any other ritual or prolonged period of mourning: "As soon as the burial is over, things go on as normal". <sup id="cite_ref-389" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-389">[389]</a></sup></dd>

<p><b>♠ RA ♣ Enrico Cioni ♥</b>
</p><p><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b>
</p><p><b>Description of the Normative Ideology</b>
</p><p>"Information about the religion of the Hephthalites is provided by the Chinese sources. Sung Yun reports that in Tokharistan ‘the majority of them do not believe in Buddhism. Most of them worship wai-shen or “foreign gods”.’ He makes almost identical remarks about the Hephthalites of Gandhara, saying that they honour kui-shen (demons). The manuscripts of the Liang shu (Book 54) contain important evidence: ‘[the Hephthalites] worship T’ien- shen or [the] heaven god and Huo-shen or [the] fire god. Every morning they first go outside [of their tents] and pray to [the] gods and then take breakfast.’ For the Chinese observer, the heaven god and the fire god were evidently foreign gods. We have no evidence of the specific content of these religious beliefs but it is quite possible that they belonged to the Iranian (or Indo-Iranian) group.
</p><p>"Although Sung Yun states that the Hephthalites did not believe in Buddhism, Buddhist religious establishments flourished in Tokharistan and other areas. In India, however, the Hephthalites showed intolerance towards Buddhist religious establishments. It may be supposed that the beliefs of the local subject populations - including Buddhism - gradually began to gain ground among the Hephthalites. Various forms of Zoroastrian beliefs were widespread in Central Asia and northern and western Afghanistan in competition with Buddhism. There were also many adherents of Hindu beliefs in Afghanistan and in Tokharistan. Lastly, Manichaeism had taken firm root and Christianity was spreading.
</p><p>"Chinese sources provide the following account of the funeral rites mentioned above: ‘if a man dies, a wealthy family will pile up stones to form a house [to keep the corpse]; a poor family will dig the ground for burial. The articles of everyday use are buried with the dead.’ Another source describes a third type of burial: ‘In burying the dead, the coffin is laid in a wooden case. When a parent dies, the child will cut off one of his ears.’ It is known, however, that various types of burial structure, including small, surface-level stone houses, pit graves and wooden coffins, were employed at the same period in Ferghana; hence the hypothesis that these Chinese accounts are actually descriptions of life in Ferghana.
</p><p>"Polyandry was the Hephthalites’ most noteworthy social custom. Brothers had one wife in common and the children were considered as belonging to the oldest brother. The number of ‘horns’ on a married woman’s headdress corresponded to the number of her husbands. This custom was practised in ancient times among the Central Asian Saka people, the Massagetae (Herodotus, I, 216); in medieval Afghanistan (according to al-Biruni); and among present-day Tibetans." <sup id="cite_ref-436" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-436">[436]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Rulers are legitimated by gods ♣ inferred present ♥</b> When sacking neighboring groups, the Hephthalite rulers took symbols of religious power to legitimate their own power.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Number of officially sanctioned supernatural beings ♣ [monotheistic; polytheistic] ♥</b> "Summarizing, in the Hephthalite state was several religions: Buddhism, Zoroastrism, Christianity (basically Nestorianism), Manichaeism, Hinduism, as well as pagan views (the worship of the Sky, Fire). The Hephthalites held various religious views. It is difficult to say if one of religion  dominated, because of the controversial nature of the sources. It seems that different religions co-existed and religious tolerance was characteristic in the Hephthalite empire, as it was later for the Turks and the Mongols in the time of Chingis khan." <sup id="cite_ref-509" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-509">[509]</a></sup> In Hinduism: "According to one popular formula, there are 330 million gods in Hinduism. Nevertheless, most Hindus have believed that there is ultimately one deity, and that the diversity of other gods are his or her emanations or manifestations, representing his or her agency in particular contexts. [...] The three gods most commonly worshipped as the ultimate in Hindu traditions are Visnu, Siva, and the Goddess, variously called Devī, "Goddess," and Sakti, "Power." This triad of deities must be distinguished from an overlapping group of three deities who are conceived in the Puranas and other authoritative traditions to perform particular cosmic functions - Brahma, who creates the universe anew in each vast cosmic cycle, and also, in some accounts, bestows the Veda upon humanity; Visnu, who preserves the universe by intervening to rectify problems through his avataras, "descents" or "incarnations"; and Siva, who destroys the universe at the end of each cosmic cycle. [...] [W]hichever deity is conceived as the ultimate is understood to be the source who emanates the others, both the triad who perform the aforementioned cosmic functions and lower supernatural beings, and thus to be the ultimate agent in their actions. [...] There are numerous other important deities besides those frequently conceived as a monotheistic ultimate. One of the most important of these is Ganesa, a son of Siva with the head of an elephant, believed to be a protective figure that removes obstacles. Another is Hanuman, the monkey-god who helped Rama in his battle against Ravana, idealized for his devotion to Rama and Sīta. Other deities important in particular regions include the South Indian Ayappa, regarded as the son of Siva and a female avatara of Visnu; and smallpox goddesses such as the North Indian Sitala." <sup id="cite_ref-510" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-510">[510]</a></sup> In Buddhism: “There are numerous Higher Gods, but these are remote and sublime beings who have little involvement in human affairs. Nevertheless, they are subject to karma and are eventually reborn like everyone else.” <sup id="cite_ref-511" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-511">[511]</a></sup> In Zoroastrianism: "Zarathustra had a particularly close relationship with Ahura Mazda, from whom he received revelatory visions (daēna-). His vision, expressed in the Gathas, included a radical transformation of traditional beliefs. In place of the pantheon he elevated Ahura Mazda to a position of supremacy that approaches monotheism and surrounded him with a group of abstract entities, the Amesa Spentas, all of whom perpetuate key concepts of Iranian religion as hypostases of Ahura Mazda."<sup id="cite_ref-512" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-512">[512]</a></sup> In Manichaeism: "The approximately forty Manichean gods and goddesses mentioned in doctrinal and hymnic texts seem to bear witness to a markedly polytheistic theology. [...] But even the Manichean myth itself makes it clear that there is, strictly speaking, only one eternal and all-embracing god, limited only by the Evil, namely the Father of Greatness. All the other deities, whether they are specified as gods or merely called angels, are no more than his “evocations.” (Text T. II K. 2a, A. von Le Coq, ed., 1911 [1912], p. 22, calls the Father of Greatness the elder brother and sister of all the other gods.)"<sup id="cite_ref-513" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-513">[513]</a></sup></dd>

[...] Thus, [for example,] Krishna [...] is a form of the supreme God who creates, maintains, and destroys the universe. In the Bhagavad Gita , Arjuna is permitted to glimpse Krishna’s cosmic form. He sees the entire universe, the sun, stars, and planets, and all the people gathered on the battlefield within the body of Krishna.

These are the kinds of action that conduce to the development of the qualities of the eightfold path. Moreover it is making merit that binds the lay and monastic communities together. The traditional ‘bases of merit’ are generosity (dana), ethical conduct (sila/sila ), and meditation (bhavana ). [...]The practice of good conduct takes the form of commitment to the five precepts usually recited in conjunction with the three refuges: (1) to refrain from harming living creatures, (2) to refrain from taking what is not given, (3) to refrain from sexual misconduct, (4) to refrain from false speech, (5) to refrain from intoxicants that cause heedlessness (see pp. 170- 2). In addition the lay disciple may on special occasions (traditionally the full moon ‘observance’ days) or for longer periods take the eight precepts, replacing the third precept (refraining from sexual misconduct) with complete sexual abstinence and adding (6) refraining from eating after midday, (7) refraining from attending entertainments and using perfumes, etc., and (8) refraining from using luxurious beds."<sup id="cite_ref-539" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-539">[539]</a></sup> "The nature of bad action is usually illustrated by reference to a list of the ten courses of unwholesome action (karma/kamma-patha)which consist of three bodily courses of action (taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct), four vocal courses of action (lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech, frivolous speech), and three mental courses of action (covetousness, ill-will, wrong view).

The just, whom God will gather to His right, receive 'life everlasting', the merciless, however, who stand to His left, 'shall go into everlasting punishment' (Matt. 25:46).

In Buddhism: "As mentioned before, the development of a loving mind towards all beings, whether friend or foe, is the aim of one of the meditative practices of early Buddhism (see above p. 53f ). In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsaric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f ). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21)." <sup id="cite_ref-584" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-584">[584]</a></sup> "[...] Buddhism maintained a fairly flexible posture vis-a-vis competing religions and never sought to require laity to identify themselves exclusively as Buddhist or to rely singularly on the Buddhist clergy for all their spiritual needs." <sup id="cite_ref-585" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-585">[585]</a></sup> In Manicheism: “Like the Elect, the Manichaean Hearers ought to observe a number of religious rules.

The Kshatriyas have traditionally been seen, again in theory if not always in practice, as the rulers who maintain society, uphold dharma and protect the householder system. They built and sponsored temples, protected their subjects and their deities and, to that extent, the Brahmins recognised a ruler’s overlordship. However, the kingly role in ruling and guardianship duties involved more ‘polluting tendencies’ than were usual in a Brahmin’s life. The Brahmins have had a dual role in society. Those who are active priests in temples have engaged in functions that involve being given gifts by worshippers and such temple priests are more involved with lower castes. Paradoxically Brahmins who are versed in promoting scholarship and in advancing religious learning but who do not act as serving priests are, in general, more widely admired because they have less contact with the public. Thus Brahmins who are not priests can be more akin to those renouncers engaged in lifelong learning and spirituality, rather than in the hurly-burly of householder life.

According to Dumont, in addition to the distinctions already outlined that fit varnas and jatis into hierarchies, another must be added. This distinction takes caste hierarchical divides beyond the kind of class distinctions found in eighteenth-century Britain or in the Ancien Regime in Europe, by stressing the opposition between purity and pollution. Caste difference, according to this classification, goes beyond class differences into this other realm of ritual purity and pollution. The Brahmins are the highest and purest varna, and the Dalits are the lowest, in that they are outside varna and are impure altogether. The other varnas rank in between. Pollution occurs in different ways. It occurs through bodily contact of one sort or another, with menstrual cycles, through birth and death, through emissions such as faeces, urine and saliva, and through contact with night-soil, dirty clothes, unswept rooms and so on. Thus marriage and sex have to function within the correct set of jatis in the correct varna. Polluting jobs such as laundering and sweeping are done by people of lower castes so that the blood of people of higher castes can remain ‘pure’. Equally menstrual activity among older women makes them more ‘impure’ than men or pre-menstrual virgins, and therefore women are more polluting than men. They will thus often live semi-separately while menstruating, during which time they will also avoid going to the temple and therefore ‘polluting’ the gods. Furthermore, untouchable Dalits were prohibited from entering many temples before the post-Independence freedom-of-temple-entry legislation and even now they are kept out of some temples in many villages. [...] It is also true to say that Dumont’s thesis suffers from exaggeration and other matters are important in discussing caste. Nevertheless, there is at least an element of truth in the notion that purity and pollution has relevance in any discussion of caste." <sup id="cite_ref-602" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-602">[602]</a></sup> In Zoroastrianism: "Be that as it may, another division of hell appears in the Arda Viraz Namag (The Book of the Righteous Viraz).

In Buddhism: "In marked contrast to the view of Islam about the fate of warriors who die in a holy war, the Buddha expresses the view in the Sutta Nipata (Sn.iv.308-11) that soldiers who die in battle go not to a special paradise but to a special hell, since at the moment of death their minds were bent on killing. Some texts affirm that even killing in self-defence, or in defence of family or friends, is wrongful, and in general an attitude of non-resistance in the face of violence is commended. The commentary to the Dhammapada relates how on one occasion when the Buddha's kinsmen, the Sakyas, were under attack, they allowed themselves to be slaughtered rather than break the First Precept. Other examples in the Jatakas and elsewhere speak of princes and kings who renounced their thrones rather than resorting to violence to defend their kingdoms." <sup id="cite_ref-605" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-605">[605]</a></sup> In Manicheism: “The clerics followed five very restrictive regulations, handed down in several versions in Western and Eastern Manichaean sources.

Thus purified they were able to fulfill their religious duties, which they did exclusively. [...] Negligence of the religious commandments could have drastic consequences for their status within the Manichaean community and especially for the future fate of the soul: hierarchical debasement, exclusion from absolution, excommunication and consequently the imprisonment of the Light particles of the soul in the Bolos, the final prison of Matter.”<sup id="cite_ref-606" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-606">[606]</a></sup> “Manichaean ethics demanded from the believers to keep the so-called “three seals”: of the mouth, of the hands, and of the lap. They consisted in purity of thoughts and words, food instructions, avoidance of any activities that could harm the Living Soul, which is the divine Light fettered in every part of the material world, and chastity. By this, many kinds of occupations people used to earn their living, especially within the fields of agriculture, warfare, hunting, and craft, were regarded as aggressive against the Light, whereas those within the fields of commerce, finance, administration and book production were considered as harmless.”<sup id="cite_ref-607" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-607">[607]</a></sup> In Christianity: Sexual purity.

Then, after a certain amount of time, the individual would be reborn on earth once again. The mechanism that regulated this system was karman, a word that literally means "action." Every action must have an effect. So, the effects of one’s actions in life determine what one will experience after death, and what kind of life one will have in the next birth.
