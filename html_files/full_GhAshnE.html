Initially Europe’s main interest in the country was as a source of gold, a commodity that was readily available on the coast in exchange for such European exports as cloth, hardware, beads, metals, spirits, arms, and ammunition. This gave rise to the name Gold Coast, by which the country was known until 1957. In an attempt to preserve a monopoly of the trade, the Portuguese initiated the practice of erecting stone fortresses (Elmina Castle, dating from 1482, was the first) on the coast on sites leased from the native states. In the 17th century the Portuguese monopoly, already considerably eroded, gave way completely when traders from the Netherlands, England, Denmark, Sweden, and Prussia-Protestant sea powers antagonistic to Iberian imperial pretensions-discovered that the commercial relations developed with the Gold Coast states could be adapted to the export of slaves, then in rapidly increasing demand for the American plantations, as well as to gold trading. By the mid-18th century the coastal scene was dominated by the presence of about 40 forts controlled by Dutch, British, or Danish merchants. The presence of these permanent European bases on the coast had far-reaching consequences. The new centres of trade thus established were much more accessible than were the Sudanese emporia, and this, coupled with the greater capacity and efficiency of the sea-borne trade compared with the ancient overland routes, gradually brought about the reversal of the direction of the trade flow. The new wealth, tools and arms, and techniques and ideas introduced through close contact with Europeans initiated political and social as well as economic changes. The states north of the forest, hitherto the wealthiest and most powerful, declined in the face of new combinations farther south. At the end of the 17th century, the Akan state of Akwamu created an empire that, stretching from the central Gold Coast eastward to Dahomey, sought to control the trade roads to the coast of the whole eastern Gold Coast. The Akwamu empire was short-lived, but its example soon stimulated a union of the Asante (Ashanti) states of the central forest (see Asante empire), under the leadership of the founding Asantehene (king) Osei Tutu.

</p><p><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ quasi-polity ♥ </b> Multiple, sometimes short-lived, Akan states governed the coastal area in the colonial period: 'The Portuguese first arrived in 1471 and later built a trading post at Elmina in 1486.

The districts of Axim, Ahanta, Fanti, and others were, previous to the year 1700, considered to be commonwealths; whereas Commenda, at that time a very populous district, Effutu or Fetu, Asebu, and Accra, were of the first kind. Henry Meredith, whose work was published in 1811, describes the governments along the coast as partaking of various forms. At Appolonia it was monarchical and absolute; in Ahanta it was a kind of aristocracy; but in the Fanti country, and extending to Accra, it was composed of a strange number of forms; for in some places the government was vested in particular persons, whilst in others it was in the hands of the community. What struck him as strange in the Fanti districts was that they frequently changed their form of government on certain occasions by uniting together under particular persons for their general safety, giving implicit [Page 26] obedience to their leaders; but as soon as the object of their union was attained, they reverted to their independent units. What is undoubtedly true is, that for very many years the Fanti town and village communities have enjoyed independence in a greater degree than any other tribes on the Gold Coast. In Appolonia one finds that so much authority was vested in the Omanhene that writers frequently thought his power was absolute. But on examining the constitutions of these places, they will be found to be sprung from the same root; the monarchical form of government so mentioned is what is common in Wassaw and other inland districts, and the republican is simply the constitution of some of the sea-coast towns close to European settlements and forts. These coast towns are communities whose government is based on the system already described; the president is Ohene, and his office is elective. Each town is divided into several parts, for fighting purposes, called companies (Asafu). One of these companies acts as the Gyasi to the Ohene. The Tufuhene is responsible for the good order of all the fighting men; the orders of the Ohene and his council are communicated to them by the Tufuhene.' <sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>

Moreover, they attempted to exercise in these coast towns jurisdiction over all civil and criminal matters, and assumed the power of life and death. In spite, however, of these oppressive measures, they were compelled to, and did pay, every year to the local rulers and their people, the rents for their forts and other establishments; nor could they wholly deter the people from trading or otherwise dealing with other European traders, against whom the Dutch now took extreme measures as enemies and interlopers.' <sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>

<dd><b> ♠ succeeding (quasi)polity  ♣ Ashanti Empire ♥ </b> The Union founded after Osei Tutu's military victory against the Denkyira incorporated a set of allied sub-polities under the overall authority of the Asantehene based at Kumasi: 'In the aftermath of the Denkyira war the military coalition of states was transformed into a political union.' <sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> For Hayford, this union was essentially a confederation of several 'imperia in imperio' under the paramount authority of the Asantehene: 'The Native State, in its highest development, is to be found where a number of considerably important communities combine and own allegiance to one central paramount Authority. Such Authority is the King, properly so called. Thus in Ashanti, before the breaking up of the Court at Kumasi, there were the Manpons, the Juabins, the Kokofus, the Beckwas, the Adansis, and several other large and important communities, owning allegiance to the stool of Kumasi as the paramount stool of all Ashanti. Each of these important communities, when regarded with respect to the entire State, was a sort of imperium in imperio-in fact, several distinct native states federated together under the same laws, the same customs, the same faith and worship, the people speaking the same language, and all owning allegiance to a paramount king or president, who represented the sovereignty of the entire Union.' <sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> For Arhin, the 'official', confederated character of the Ashanti Union was increasingly eroded before the onset of British colonial rule, with the Asantehene seeking to concentrate power in Kumasi: 'Formally the Asante lived within a system of decentralized ‘patrimonialism’: that is to say, under the authority of hereditary rulers selected by the heads of the constituent units of the  oman, the localized matrilineages, the villages and the districts who were, in the main, a gerontocratic body. The members of the various units also enjoyed rights of use in land. But the political history of Asante, from the beginning of the eighteenth century to the eve of colonial rule, was the history of the erosion of these political and economic rights. It was a history of the increasing personalization of power at the expense of the holders of hereditary authority and also of commoners.' <sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd>The gold-producing region between the Comoé and Volta rivers has been inhabited by Akan-speaking people since the 13th century CE.

<dl><dd>In 1701, the Asante rebelled against the dominant Denkyira state and formed a confederacy of Akan states who accepted Asante rule.

<p><i>Population and political organization</i>

<dl><dd>During the pre-Asante period, each Akan state consisted of a single kingdom ruled by an <i>omanhene</i>, which literally translates to 'state-chief'.<sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup> This king came from a royal clan, and was elected by various officials, most notably the <i>ohemmaa</i> ('queen-mother'), who was a senior woman of the clan. The king was a sacred person who could not be observed eating or drinking; nor could he be heard to speak or be spoken to.<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>After 1701, political organization within the region became far more bureaucratic and specialized. Kumasi became the capital of the union of Asante states and the seat of the empire. Appointed officials began to replace those wielding hereditary authority, and a treasury partly operated by literate Muslims was created.<sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup> However, while bureaucrats ran many of the day-to-day operations of the empire, the authority of the king was still absolute.<sup id="cite_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup></dd></dl>

</p><p>Most authors recognize both towns and villages, the latter growing out of small micro-settlements founded by family groups: 'It is interesting to think that these small nations of the Gold Coast, each consisting of a few towns and villages with a bare handful of population, have been so highly successful in maintaining this well-developed form of self-government. The Akan nations, with all the disadvantages of lack of transferring thought by any means other than speech, and in the absence of any proper medium of communication, have been able to march abreast of the times, adhering to their ancient, but by no means archaic, form of self-government.' <sup id="cite_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup> 'Most of the towns scattered over the whole of Guinea have grown from villages originally founded and occupied by single family groups. As each family gets larger and the households increase in number, the village community grows, and its general affairs are guided and controlled by the patriarch of the family, who, now headman of the [Page 4] village, is assisted by a council composed of the eldest members of each family group or household, and other fit and proper persons, who are generally old men.' <sup id="cite_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup> 'The Penin of the subsequent settlers exercises similar rights over his own people, and as the household grows larger so is that Penin assisted by a person “sitting behind” him. The founder of the village or his successor is now called Odzikuro (owner of the village), who, in looking after the village affairs, is assisted by the Penin of the new [Page 7] settlers, and thus arises the village council. The different family groups become the village community, and in all public matters the village council, composed of the Penin of each important household, acts, the Odzikuro being president of such council. The members of the village council have a spokesman (Kyiami, a linguist), whose office is hereditary, but is traced in the male line, for a son succeeds as linguist his father, and not his uncle. Land in possession of the founder of the village is family stool property. Land cleared and occupied by subsequent settlers who have joined the founder is the property of the subsequent settlers. Land acquired by the founder and the settlers together is held by the village community, and becomes attached to the stool of the person for the time being head of the village. All the inhabitants of the village have each of them a proportionate share in such lands as common property, without any possession or title to distinct portions. From the moment a tribal community settles down finally upon a definite tract of land, the land begins to be the basis of society in place of kinship. The Odzikuro, with the village council, has the control of such land, but each person has the right to cultivate any portion of it, and having done so or settled on it, he may not be removed by any single individual unless the council so decrees.' <sup id="cite_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup> 'Suppose the original founder of the village to be a junior member of the family, whose elder brother was the family stoolholder; there still will be seasons when he and those under him would have to take part in observing the annual custom of the family stool, and participate in the family festival. And where there are several subordinate branches of a similar nature, the stoolholder of the original family acquires a greater importance and influence, and is termed Ohene - a term which has been rendered indifferently in English, king, caboceer, head chief, chief, and even headman. The Ohene will now have under him ( a) his family: comprising (i.) members under his immediate control, and (ii.) subordinate family groups that have branched off from the parent family; ( b) settlers: (i.) family groups in the same village as the Ohene, and (ii.) family groups sprung from the aforesaid and living in other places. In addition to individual persons enjoying his protection, there may be among his retinue a whole family or village community, to or for whom money loans have been given. These swell the retinue of the Ohene, and are included in his own bodyguard (Gyasi), a portion of the fighting men of the village community. Like the others, the headman of the protected family or community attends the annual festival of the Ohene, and to the tribunal of the Ohene these vassals have the right to appeal. Moreover, the oath of the stool of the Ohene is binding on them. The whole community is now likened to a body of which the Ohene supports the head, and the next in authority to him the foot. The Ohene of the oldest ancestry and most powerful becomes by election or tacit consent of the other Ahenefu of the district or country Omanhene, that is, a king. In reference to his own particular jurisdiction he is Ohene, and as such he may not interfere in the domestic [Page 9] affairs of any other fellow-ohene, so far as they do not injuriously affect the district as a whole.' <sup id="cite_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup> According to Sarbah, Fante communities enjoyed a greated degree of autonomy than other Akan settlements: 'According to some ancient writers, there are two forms of government at the Gold Coast, namely, Monarchical and Republican.

Moreover, they attempted to exercise in these coast towns jurisdiction over all civil and criminal matters, and assumed the power of life and death. In spite, however, of these oppressive measures, they were compelled to, and did pay, every year to the local rulers and their people, the rents for their forts and other establishments; nor could they wholly deter the people from trading or otherwise dealing with other European traders, against whom the Dutch now took extreme measures as enemies and interlopers.' <sup id="cite_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup> 'The government of the sea-coast communities is a variation of the general system which has been described. This variation has been caused by frequent intercourse with European traders and the accumulation of wealth by means of lucrative trade. Ancient travellers who wrote described only what they saw in the coast towns. From these men one learns that, over two centuries ago, at seedtime farmers marked out for farming their plots of land, situate usually on rising grounds near the towns and villages. The next step was to obtain the permission of the Ohene or his officers in charge of the land, after permission had been granted, to pay the usual rent. The head of the family, assisted by his wives, children, and any slaves he might possess, prepared the ground for sowing. When the day of sowing arrived, the farm belonging to the village, or town chief, was first sown by all the people, and the others followed in due course. † This custom has continued to modern times with slight modifications. A few years ago the sum of half a crown was paid to landowners on asking for a plot of land to farm on for one season, but within the last two years this sum has been raised to ten shillings; in some instances, such as for land near the large towns, as much as a pound has been paid.' <sup id="cite_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup>

</p><p>According to Sarbah, Akan polities of the time shared many structural commonalities when it comes to political organization: 'The common origin of the inhabitants of the Fanti districts, Asanti, and wherever the Akan language is spoken, has been already shown. † The Customary Laws of the inhabitants of these places are in the main identical, and the national constitutions resemble each other in many points, although Asanti military organization had been [Page 3] developed in a greater degree. In fact, while the Fanti communities were gradually bringing under their sway smaller states, the Asanti king by conquests was extending his power over many lands. At one time all countries from Cape Mount in Liberia to the western boundary of Dahomey were, with few exceptions, under Asanti jurisdiction.' <sup id="cite_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-61">[61]</a></sup> But polities differed in the degree of popular participation: 'According to some ancient writers, there are two forms of government at the Gold Coast, namely, Monarchical and Republican. The districts of Axim, Ahanta, Fanti, and others were, previous to the year 1700, considered to be commonwealths; whereas Commenda, at that time a very populous district, Effutu or Fetu, Asebu, and Accra, were of the first kind. Henry Meredith, whose work was published in 1811, describes the governments along the coast as partaking of various forms. At Appolonia it was monarchical and absolute; in Ahanta it was a kind of aristocracy; but in the Fanti country, and extending to Accra, it was composed of a strange number of forms; for in some places the government was vested in particular persons, whilst in others it was in the hands of the community. What struck him as strange in the Fanti districts was that they frequently changed their form of government on certain occasions by uniting together under particular persons for their general safety, giving implicit [Page 26] obedience to their leaders; but as soon as the object of their union was attained, they reverted to their independent units. What is undoubtedly true is, that for very many years the Fanti town and village communities have enjoyed independence in a greater degree than any other tribes on the Gold Coast. In Appolonia one finds that so much authority was vested in the Omanhene that writers frequently thought his power was absolute. But on examining the constitutions of these places, they will be found to be sprung from the same root; the monarchical form of government so mentioned is what is common in Wassaw and other inland districts, and the republican is simply the constitution of some of the sea-coast towns close to European settlements and forts. These coast towns are communities whose government is based on the system already described; the president is Ohene, and his office is elective. Each town is divided into several parts, for fighting purposes, called companies (Asafu). One of these companies acts as the Gyasi to the Ohene. The Tufuhene is responsible for the good order of all the fighting men; the orders of the Ohene and his council are communicated to them by the Tufuhene.' <sup id="cite_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-62">[62]</a></sup> In general, public office was attached to stools: 'Before proceeding further, it is necessary to explain the origin of stools, whether family or public. Where the head of a family has more than one stool, he may give one to a member of the family on appointing him the Penin of a junior branch of the large family. The person so appointed thereby acquires possession of all the goods, chattels, and lands appurtenant to that stool. His own property becomes stool property, and is merged in whatever is given him. The children of the last stoolholder call him father, and the widows become his wives; each woman can, however, obtain her freedom on repayment of the Consawment money, that is, dowry. But a new stool is created in this wise: when the family of a man of wealth or influence on his death so will, they create a family stool which is named after the deceased. For this purpose the favourite chair of the deceased, generally a small one, which was in constant use by him, is cleaned, then rubbed all over with the blood of sheep, and finally smeared with a mixture of soot and eggs. The stool is afterwards wrapped in some skin and safely kept. During this consecration, libation is made and prayers are freely offered for the prosperity of the family, and that its members may, in time to come, attain greater influence and prominence. These stools are added to from time to time, but count is made of only the prominent ones. Too often the name of the original founder of the family is dropped for that of one of his successors of greater eminence. When an old stool is so decayed that it ought to be destroyed, it is burnt, and the ashes thereof are made into a paste with oil, blood, eggs, and other substances. The paste is then daubed on a new stool, which is [Page 13] consecrated as a family stool and named after the old one. When an old stool is lost a new one is specially made and consecrated.' <sup id="cite_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-63">[63]</a></sup> Akan polities were ruled by an Omanhene, assisted by multiple officials and councillors, including a female equivalent of his (Ohema): 'Omanhene is the head of the national life, and naturally president of the rulers of the people assembled either as a court for deciding cases or for legislation. The district, taken as a whole, is likewise considered as a body, whereof the Omanhene supports the head, and the next man in authority to him carries the foot. By virtue of his office, Omanhene has the right to be carried by four men or more, and uses three or more canopy umbrellas. At his installation a small sword, the insignia of his office, is handed to him, and he enjoys several other privileges. He is the commander-in-chief of all the fighting men of the district. His bodyguard and the immediate fighting men are called Gyasi. He is almost invariably a member of the Domtsifu or Intsin Company. Tufuhene is the man whose duty it is to command the fighting-men (from tuu, “to throw, e.g., arrows, etc.;” hence etuo, itur, “a gun”); a fighting leader, or commander. In some districts, and especially in the coast towns, Tufuhene is the next man in authority after Ohene.' <sup id="cite_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-64">[64]</a></sup> 'The several Akan peoples each consist of a single kingdom ruled by a king, OMANHENE (lit. "state-chief"). The king comes from whatever clan provides the royal line in a particular kingdom, and is chosen in rotation from one of this clan's kingly lineages (there are often other, non-kingly, lineages within a royal clan). He is elected by various officials, of which the most important is the OHEMMAA (or similar terms; lit. "woman-chief" and usually translated in the literature as "queen-mother") although she is typically not the actual mother but a senior woman of the clan, who "knows" genealogy and may have her own court and be assisted by various officials. Criteria for the selection of a king include assumed competence, general personality, and the fact that kingly lines usually rotate in providing the king. Once selected, the king is "enstooled"-that is, seated upon the stool of kingship. His former status is annulled symbolically, his debts and lawsuits are settled, his clothing and personal possessions st ored; he is then symbolically reborn and given the identity of one of his forebears. He assumes the royal name and title borne by that previous ruler. A king has his palace, in which work members of his court. Details vary considerably, but, in general, the royal officials comprise several categories: those from the royal clan itself; those representing the remainder of the people; and ritual officials, drummers, and others who were considered the "children" of the king, being recruited from many sources, including royal slaves, and often observing patrilineal descent. The king is a sacred person. He may not be observed eating or drinking and may not be heard to speak nor be spoken to publicly (speaking only through a spokesman or "linguist," OKYEAME). He is covered from the sky by a royal umbrella, avoids contact with the earth by wearing royal sandals, and wears insignia of gold and elaborate and beautiful cloth of royal design. In the past, an Akan king held power over the life and death of his subjects and slaves. These powers were eroded during colonial rule, but today an Akan king remains extremely powerful, representing his people both politically an d ritually and acting as a focus for the identity of his kingdom. By far the most powerful is the king of Ashanti, who has the largest of all the Akan kingdoms, the Asantehene at Kumasi.' <sup id="cite_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup> Councillors supported the ruler in his duties, but could also contain autocratic ambitions: 'The Council of the people is the only effective instrument or body which tempers the will or power of the ruler. For no discreet or wise ruler would undertake any matter of importance affecting his people, until it has been discussed at length in council, where freedom of speech and the publicity thereof give every facility for the expression of public opinion. In fact, it is the duty of every ruler first to summon his councillors, and then his people, when an occasion arises, in the same way as the head of a family calls the senior or elder members of his family and confers about the affairs and other business of the family. The principle is the same; the application thereof is only a matter of degree. The representative character of a councillor is well understood and appreciated by the people. The expression generally used by old councillors and other public men whose influence has waned, who are not considered to reflect current public opinion, or who do not command public confidence, is as follows: “Nya Oman ese nidu wont[unavailable]t[unavailable] n'anan mu,” meaning “the representatives of the people for the time being should not be interrupted too much nor without very good reason.”' <sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup> Regional government and belonging to social categories operated through clan membership: 'Every aboriginal inhabitant of this country is a member of some clan, the relationship to which is traced through the mother. Take the case of a man who is about to build a separate home or settle on some portion of land of the tribe or clan: he will be accompanied by his wives, if any, also his mother, brothers, unmarried sisters, nephews and nieces who have left their fathers. The land on which this man with his people will settle may be either a portion of the virgin forest or where he had been farming before. When the brothers marry their wives join them, but their children are not members of this family. As the household increases and multiplies new houses are set up. In this smallest family group the Penin, or Egya, is the natural guardian of every member. The land on which the members dwell is family property. The Penin, as head [Page 5] of the family, represents all the members, holding and administering the property as a trustee for himself and them. If the family is so wealthy as to hold slaves and pawns (Ahubafu), they reside with their masters. When this family unit has grown large it is usual to appoint a person to “sit behind” the Penin. He must be a fit and proper person, generally one of the heritable blood relations (Dihyi); in some instances, however, a bondsman is selected. This second man acts as the spokesman of the Penin, assists him in settling disputes, takes a prominent part at the annual observance of the stool, or other festival, when, in the presence of the whole family, he makes the libation and offers the family sacrifice with prayers to the spirits of the departed ones.' <sup id="cite_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup> Villages were governed by councils of elders or 'patriarchs': 'Most of the towns scattered over the whole of Guinea have grown from villages originally founded and occupied by single family groups. As each family gets larger and the households increase in number, the village community grows, and its general affairs are guided and controlled by the patriarch of the family, who, now headman of the [Page 4] village, is assisted by a council composed of the eldest members of each family group or household, and other fit and proper persons, who are generally old men.' <sup id="cite_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-68">[68]</a></sup> As micro-settlements grew into villages, leadership would adjust accordingly: 'The Penin of the subsequent settlers exercises similar rights over his own people, and as the household grows larger so is that Penin assisted by a person “sitting behind” him. The founder of the village or his successor is now called Odzikuro (owner of the village), who, in looking after the village affairs, is assisted by the Penin of the new [Page 7] settlers, and thus arises the village council. The different family groups become the village community, and in all public matters the village council, composed of the Penin of each important household, acts, the Odzikuro being president of such council. The members of the village council have a spokesman (Kyiami, a linguist), whose office is hereditary, but is traced in the male line, for a son succeeds as linguist his father, and not his uncle. Land in possession of the founder of the village is family stool property. Land cleared and occupied by subsequent settlers who have joined the founder is the property of the subsequent settlers. Land acquired by the founder and the settlers together is held by the village community, and becomes attached to the stool of the person for the time being head of the village. All the inhabitants of the village have each of them a proportionate share in such lands as common property, without any possession or title to distinct portions. From the moment a tribal community settles down finally upon a definite tract of land, the land begins to be the basis of society in place of kinship. The Odzikuro, with the village council, has the control of such land, but each person has the right to cultivate any portion of it, and having done so or settled on it, he may not be removed by any single individual unless the council so decrees.' <sup id="cite_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-69">[69]</a></sup> 'In the small settlement which has so grown into a village community there will be subordinate stools belonging to the junior families, which are offshoots of the parent family. The holders reside in the village or in its neighbourhood, and are usually members of the village council. It will be found that the headman of the village community is generally a member of the family which founded the village, and has succeeded to that post by virtue of his right as head of the founder's family; but inasmuch as he rules over the whole community, the inhabitants, through the village council, have the right to reject any one proposed as headman if deemed unsuitable for the post, and, passing over the original family, can select a fit and proper person [Page 8] from another family whose connection with the village is ancient. And so all things being equal, preference is given to families according to priority of settlement.' <sup id="cite_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-70">[70]</a></sup> The headmen of multiple lineage branches would assume the position of clan-chief or district ruler (Ohene): 'Suppose the original founder of the village to be a junior member of the family, whose elder brother was the family stoolholder; there still will be seasons when he and those under him would have to take part in observing the annual custom of the family stool, and participate in the family festival. And where there are several subordinate branches of a similar nature, the stoolholder of the original family acquires a greater importance and influence, and is termed Ohene - a term which has been rendered indifferently in English, king, caboceer, head chief, chief, and even headman. The Ohene will now have under him ( a) his family: comprising (i.) members under his immediate control, and (ii.) subordinate family groups that have branched off from the parent family; ( b) settlers: (i.) family groups in the same village as the Ohene, and (ii.) family groups sprung from the aforesaid and living in other places. In addition to individual persons enjoying his protection, there may be among his retinue a whole family or village community, to or for whom money loans have been given. These swell the retinue of the Ohene, and are included in his own bodyguard (Gyasi), a portion of the fighting men of the village community. Like the others, the headman of the protected family or community attends the annual festival of the Ohene, and to the tribunal of the Ohene these vassals have the right to appeal. Moreover, the oath of the stool of the Ohene is binding on them. The whole community is now likened to a body of which the Ohene supports the head, and the next in authority to him the foot. The Ohene of the oldest ancestry and most powerful becomes by election or tacit consent of the other Ahenefu of the district or country Omanhene, that is, a king. In reference to his own particular jurisdiction he is Ohene, and as such he may not interfere in the domestic [Page 9] affairs of any other fellow-ohene, so far as they do not injuriously affect the district as a whole.' <sup id="cite_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup> 'An Ohene is entitled to ride in a palanquin carried by two men and attended by two canopy umbrellas. An Odzikuro is the headman of a village. Penin is an elder, generally an old man of experience. Sahene is a man appointed to conduct war. A Safuhene is a captain of a company, and in some instances is a stoolholder. In fact, among the Akanfu, that is Asanti, Wassaw, Assin, Akim, and such like, each Ohene of the several towns and districts is referred to as the Safuhene of his Omanhene. The Gyasi are the bodyguard of an Ohene or Omanhene. They comprise, first, the blood relatives, especially the children and grandsons of the Ohene, and are called Bogyadom ( bogya, “blood”; dom, “troop”), who have the immediate custody of the stool; secondly, certain Asafuhenefu, with their men; thirdly, personal servants and domestic attendants (Gyasifu).

They are "fed" at shrines in the form of blackened stools of wood and kept in the "stool rooms" in palaces and houses. Traditionally, the stools were anointed with human blood, gunpowder, and spider webs, and given alcoholic drink; human sacrifices are no longer made. Each kingdom and town has, or had in past years, an annual purification ritual, known as ODWIRA, in which the king, the office of kingship, the kingdom, and the town are purified of the pollution of the preceding year; this is often known in the literature as a "yam festival."'<sup id="cite_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-75">[75]</a></sup> In Fante communities, high-ranking priests played a prominent role in the polity: 'The object, however, of this work is not to deal with religious theories, deities, or matters of belief. In the Fanti districts, with their numerous free and independent communities, the priests who officiated at the shrine of Nanaam (that is ancestors), the national deities, situate at Mankesim, exercised large powers and wielded great [Page 52] influence, so much so that the opinion has been expressed that the high priest, a Braffo, was the sovereign ruler of the Fanti people. The physician was so often a priest that it is not surprising to discover him possessed of much influence; but this much may be said, the priests did not rule the people. The general name for God is Nyankupon (Nyankrupon according to the Akanfu), meaning the Only One, than who none is greater, or, as others say, the Great Friend. Nyankupon is invisible. He lives above the heavens, and the winds are His messengers. The common saying is, “Speak to the winds, and God will hear thee.” This word has different pronunciations, and the difficulty of finding its root may be through this cause. Rain is called Nyankum; rainbow is nyankunton. Nyan is to awaken, and it has been suggested that probably Onyan (the awakener) was an old name for the sky. One is rather inclined to form the opinion that Nyankupon is not derived from ye, meaning to do, act, create, as some say. This subject is certainly interesting, and requires further study and much thinking over.' <sup id="cite_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-76">[76]</a></sup>

In addition, there have been continual threats from the Islamic peoples of the southern Saharan fringe. Essentially all these conflicts have been over monopolies in trade, first across the Sahara with northern Africa and, in later centuries, across the Atlantic with the countries of Europe and the Americas. Warfare has historically been a central institution, a means of extending territory and controlling external trade. The Akan state was typically divided into five or six military formations or "wings," each under the authority of a wing chief. Beneath the wing chiefs, who are chosen by the king, are the chiefs of the main towns of a kingdom. The latter are from the town's ruling line.' <sup id="cite_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-77">[77]</a></sup> 'It must be admitted that the origin of our State government and the principles on which it was founded, being solely military in character, one should feel content to accept the fact that the whole structure of the civil government we enjoy to-day is the result of martial adventures. This being so, it is only natural that people whose powers are clearly labelled as “military commanders”, etc., should exercise civil powers when the fruit of their labours bring peace. In almost all the Akan institutions, from the lowest servant to the highest officer, there is scarcely any whose civil powers are not based on military appointments.

A stoolholder may be appointed a councillor, and his successor, when deemed a fit and proper person, follows him in his office. When a person becomes a councillor he is considered as promoted, therefore he severs his connection with his company, and must not take an active part in the management of the affairs of the company.

Lands cleared by the companies belong to them. The lands of the companies do not belong to the Ohene, for there are town lands, family lands, and stool lands. The Ohene has no right to ordinary tribute, and the public-stool income is derived from fines, penalties, and court fees. In this also the jurisdiction is personal. The Tufuhene, the councillors, and captains of the companies take part in the election and installation of a new Ohene. Before them he takes his oath of office, and if any lands are attached to the town stool, he holds them in trust for the public. The succession generally follows the common rule, but in some places it is the son who succeeds, not the brother or nephew. The townspeople can pass over the person nominated by the family and elect some other suitable person instead. They may also remove the Ohene, if found unfit to rule them any longer; in either of which events the town sword and stool, with all the public property thereunto appurtenant, are vested in the town council, whose duty it is to take them from the deposed ruler or his family and give them to the person appointed as new ruler or manager during the interval.' <sup id="cite_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-85">[85]</a></sup> 'Each subordinate ruler, correctly the captain-chief (Safuhene), of the Omanhene, owns a stool of his office, commands the fighting men of, and rules, his district.

<p><b> ♠ Occupational complexity ♣ absent ♥ </b> Sarbah's comments seem to suggest that at the time, most people were subsistence farmers rather than traders or craftsmen: 'Persons wishing to reside in the village, or on the land adjacent thereto, must obtain the permission of the first settlers, and join the other inhabitants of the village in tilling the farm of the Penin. * This usage was observed in 1600 by Artus, who writes, “No man claimeth any land to himself; the king keeping all the woods, the fields, and lands in his hands; so that they neither sow nor plant therein but by his consent and license, which, when they have obtained, and have a place permitted them to sow their corn in, then they go with their slaves and burn the woods, trees, roots, and shrubs to the ground; after this they take their long chopping knife, which they call Coddou, and scrape up the ground about a foot deep, and let it lie eight or ten days; when they have all tilled their ground, every man takes his seed upon their Sunday, that is, as you shall hear anon, our Tuesday, the better the day the better the deed: and goeth to the king's house, where they serve first, and then (after a treatment of a sod goat with palm-wine, to which they sit and sing about the burnt roots in the honour of their Fetisso, or God, that their corn might grow well and prosperously upon earth) to their neighbours, whose allotment they husband by turns until [Page 6] the whole country is sowed.” Coddou means the act of farming; the error was easily made by the ancient writer. He saw a man with a cutlass, and pointing to it, the owner probably said, “Mi dzi ri kodow” (“I am going to farm with it”- dow means to till, to farm, or cultivate); or perhaps the writer saw an elder hand a hoe to his servant, and heard him say, “Kodow, go and till the ground with it,” and he jumped into the conclusion the phrase meant a chopping knife. By the same error the trade wind was called “Agom bretou,” although what the fishermen meant was, “The wind will be freshening soon,” that is, “Ehum ri betu.”' <sup id="cite_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-87">[87]</a></sup> 'An account given by Loyer, a Roman Catholic priest, who laboured about the year 1700, somewhere in the Beyin district of Appolonia, throws further light on the subject. He says that at the seed-time, which is twice a year, the king goes in person to the fields, which his slaves till, as they are bound to give free labour for a day or two at such seed-time. These men work in the presence of the king, and he treats them with palm-wine. At the time of harvest, which is thrice a year, that is in December and January for rice, August and September for maize, February and March for millet, all his subjects assist to reap the crops, the king setting them an example by cutting two or three handfuls. Each reaper keeps for himself one-third of the produce of one sheaf in three. Loyer also found that the king's authority over the poor and slaves was absolute, but the caboceers, or great men of affluence, and owning many slaves, were not so submissive, and were only bound to attend and assist at the public palavers and councils and join the king's forces against a common foe.' <sup id="cite_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-88">[88]</a></sup>

</p><p><b> ♠ Professional priesthood ♣ inferred present ♥ </b> Full-time specialists Priests and spirit mediums communicated with deities and other spirits: 'Indigenous Akan religion is based upon the worship of a High God, various spirits or deities, and ancestors. The High God-known as Onyame, Onyankopon, and by other names-is the Creator, now otiose; Asase Yaa, the goddess of the earth, accompanies him. The ancestors live in the land of the dead and may demand offerings, in the past including those of slaves.' <sup id="cite_ref-109" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-109">[109]</a></sup> 'Spirits or deities are many, and the living can communicate with them through prayer, sacrifice, and possession. Each has its own OSOFO, or priest; an OKOMFO is a living spirit medium who interprets the words of a spirit who is consulted to remove sickness and human disasters.' <sup id="cite_ref-110" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-110">[110]</a></sup> Rulers and royal lineages were closely connected to the cult: 'The royal ancestors are at the heart of the ritual protection of a kingdom. They are "fed" at shrines in the form of blackened stools of wood and kept in the "stool rooms" in palaces and houses. Traditionally, the stools were anointed with human blood, gunpowder, and spider webs, and given alcoholic drink; human sacrifices are no longer made. Each kingdom and town has, or had in past years, an annual purification ritual, known as ODWIRA, in which the king, the office of kingship, the kingdom, and the town are purified of the pollution of the preceding year; this is often known in the literature as a "yam festival."'<sup id="cite_ref-111" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-111">[111]</a></sup> In Fante communities, high-ranking priests played a prominent role in the polity: 'The object, however, of this work is not to deal with religious theories, deities, or matters of belief. In the Fanti districts, with their numerous free and independent communities, the priests who officiated at the shrine of Nanaam (that is ancestors), the national deities, situate at Mankesim, exercised large powers and wielded great [Page 52] influence, so much so that the opinion has been expressed that the high priest, a Braffo, was the sovereign ruler of the Fanti people. The physician was so often a priest that it is not surprising to discover him possessed of much influence; but this much may be said, the priests did not rule the people. The general name for God is Nyankupon (Nyankrupon according to the Akanfu), meaning the Only One, than who none is greater, or, as others say, the Great Friend. Nyankupon is invisible. He lives above the heavens, and the winds are His messengers. The common saying is, “Speak to the winds, and God will hear thee.” This word has different pronunciations, and the difficulty of finding its root may be through this cause. Rain is called Nyankum; rainbow is nyankunton. Nyan is to awaken, and it has been suggested that probably Onyan (the awakener) was an old name for the sky. One is rather inclined to form the opinion that Nyankupon is not derived from ye, meaning to do, act, create, as some say. This subject is certainly interesting, and requires further study and much thinking over.' <sup id="cite_ref-112" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-112">[112]</a></sup> This seems to suggest a degree of professionalization.

<p><b> ♠ Full-time bureaucrats ♣ absent ♥ </b> Full-time specialists The Omanhene was chosen from royal lineages and assisted by multiple officials: 'The several Akan peoples each consist of a single kingdom ruled by a king, OMANHENE (lit. "state-chief"). The king comes from whatever clan provides the royal line in a particular kingdom, and is chosen in rotation from one of this clan's kingly lineages (there are often other, non-kingly, lineages within a royal clan). He is elected by various officials, of which the most important is the OHEMMAA (or similar terms; lit. "woman-chief" and usually translated in the literature as "queen-mother") although she is typically not the actual mother but a senior woman of the clan, who "knows" genealogy and may have her own court and be assisted by various officials. Criteria for the selection of a king include assumed competence, general personality, and the fact that kingly lines usually rotate in providing the king. Once selected, the king is "enstooled"-that is, seated upon the stool of kingship. His former status is annulled symbolically, his debts and lawsuits are settled, his clothing and personal possessions st ored; he is then symbolically reborn and given the identity of one of his forebears. He assumes the royal name and title borne by that previous ruler. A king has his palace, in which work members of his court. Details vary considerably, but, in general, the royal officials comprise several categories: those from the royal clan itself; those representing the remainder of the people; and ritual officials, drummers, and others who were considered the "children" of the king, being recruited from many sources, including royal slaves, and often observing patrilineal descent. The king is a sacred person. He may not be observed eating or drinking and may not be heard to speak nor be spoken to publicly (speaking only through a spokesman or "linguist," OKYEAME). He is covered from the sky by a royal umbrella, avoids contact with the earth by wearing royal sandals, and wears insignia of gold and elaborate and beautiful cloth of royal design. In the past, an Akan king held power over the life and death of his subjects and slaves. These powers were eroded during colonial rule, but today an Akan king remains extremely powerful, representing his people both politically an d ritually and acting as a focus for the identity of his kingdom. By far the most powerful is the king of Ashanti, who has the largest of all the Akan kingdoms, the Asantehene at Kumasi.' <sup id="cite_ref-113" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-113">[113]</a></sup> Councillors aided the Omanhene in judicial matters, but there was no formalized system of examination or merit promotion for them: 'But as a man attracts the favourable attention of the observant ones of his tribe, as he more and more impresses the people by his ability in their public gatherings, by the soundness of his opinion, by the depth of his knowledge of the customary laws and traditions, by his skill in public debate, by his keen interest in public affairs, by his bravery or warlike qualities, or by some other qualifications, he acquires public influence, and is accepted, in a greater or less degree, as a public man, representative of a portion of the community. Success in trade, or other personal attributes, are likewise qualifications for this post. The position of such a person is definitely confirmed when the head ruler with his council invites him to be a councillor. Attending an Omanhene or Ohene are always to be found some councillors, who assist him in hearing and determining lawsuits and administering justice. In the town of the [Page 11] Omanhene these men perform many of the duties of officers, who in European countries are known as ministers of state. It is worthy of note that, as a general rule, a Tufuhene is not a member of the Council (Begwa) of the Ohene or Omanhene.' <sup id="cite_ref-114" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-114">[114]</a></sup> Much public authority was attached to stools: 'Before proceeding further, it is necessary to explain the origin of stools, whether family or public. Where the head of a family has more than one stool, he may give one to a member of the family on appointing him the Penin of a junior branch of the large family. The person so appointed thereby acquires possession of all the goods, chattels, and lands appurtenant to that stool. His own property becomes stool property, and is merged in whatever is given him. The children of the last stoolholder call him father, and the widows become his wives; each woman can, however, obtain her freedom on repayment of the Consawment money, that is, dowry. But a new stool is created in this wise: when the family of a man of wealth or influence on his death so will, they create a family stool which is named after the deceased. For this purpose the favourite chair of the deceased, generally a small one, which was in constant use by him, is cleaned, then rubbed all over with the blood of sheep, and finally smeared with a mixture of soot and eggs. The stool is afterwards wrapped in some skin and safely kept. During this consecration, libation is made and prayers are freely offered for the prosperity of the family, and that its members may, in time to come, attain greater influence and prominence. These stools are added to from time to time, but count is made of only the prominent ones. Too often the name of the original founder of the family is dropped for that of one of his successors of greater eminence. When an old stool is so decayed that it ought to be destroyed, it is burnt, and the ashes thereof are made into a paste with oil, blood, eggs, and other substances. The paste is then daubed on a new stool, which is [Page 13] consecrated as a family stool and named after the old one. When an old stool is lost a new one is specially made and consecrated.' <sup id="cite_ref-115" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-115">[115]</a></sup> We follow Arhin Kwame's characterization of this system as 'patrimonial' rather than 'bureaucratic' (see the Ashanti Period sheet).
</p><p><b> ♠ Source of support ♣ governed population; land ♥ </b> Rulers and other patrimonial officials traditionally controlled lands and received tribute: 'In ancient times the Omanhene held the whole unoccupied land in his territory as trustee for the people, and as they increased so this public land was brought under cultivation. The chiefs of the different towns were actually placed in charge of the unoccupied land in the districts, or were considered as caretakers for the Omanhene. When a tribe was conquered it became subject of the conqueror's stool; these people continued to hold and enjoy the lands under cultivation; but used forests and unoccupied land as public property attached to the [Page 16] stool of the Omanhene. * Besides the public land, the Omanhene has attached to his stool family land in the [Page 17] occupation of his family; his subsequent deposition does not affect the possession of the family. The Omanhene can live and reside and farm on any unoccupied part of his territory without the leave or permission of the sub-ruler, who holds it as caretaker, but he cannot sell or lease it without the concurrence of such sub-ruler. He is entitled to an Ebusã of the sub-ruler's Ebusã. His immediate followers or household servants may mine for him, but no tribute is payable to the sub-ruler. The subordinate captains (Safuhene, pl. Asafuhene) are bound to obey the commands of the Ohene and pay tribute to him of all gold gotten from gold workings. It is not usual to pay Ebusã to the Ohene or Safuhene on the ordinary [Page 18] washing for alluvial gold. Ebusã is only paid when work is being done in a goldfield, or when one has found an unusually large quantity of gold or discovered a large nugget, or persons are systematically mining.' <sup id="cite_ref-116" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-116">[116]</a></sup> But the role of territoriality different among the individual Akan states: 'In the Fanti system allegiance is personal, but in the Asanti it is personal and territorial combined. ‡ The head ruler is not necessarily the owner of any land in his jurisdiction; e.g., Ohene Tchibu, of Asin Yankumasi, owns no land, and is a tenant of Abesibro, his captain; so also is Ohene Aka Ayima, of Beyin in Appolonia, by the [Page 25] judgment of Mr. Justice Nicoll, declared to own no land in his district-at least he did not lead evidence to show the land in question was his. In the case of Ohene Tchibu, the explanation is, that his ancestors fled to Fantiland for protection from the north side of the Pra in the kingdom of Asanti. The greater part of the Asinfu settled on lands within the jurisdiction of the head ruler of Abura, who became their feudal superior. * Many of the Asinfu continued to work on their lands across the river Pra, and held them. Among such is Akessi of Fumsu, until, by an order of the Executive Council of Gold Coast, an arbitrary boundary was fixed, and the possessions of the Asinfu, Denkerafu, and others, trans-Pra and trans-Ofin, were declared Asanti territory in the district of Adansi, and this in spite of the fact that Yamsu village, the stool of which was the subject of the case, Ghambra v. Ewea, † is situate on the Adansi side of the Ofin.' <sup id="cite_ref-117" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-117">[117]</a></sup> Rulers also expropriated different kinds of fees and rents: 'The above in battle array follow the Asamanfu forces in the same order. Next to them are the headmen, household, and the Gyasi of Busumtwi district. It will be found that, besides acting as the body-guard, some of them have certain duties to perform; the Gyasi of Busumtwi guard the royal burial-place, and Nuama, the Captain of Ankobia, guards a sacred place called Asaman Kama Bura, which is a lake. The Omanhene is entitled to one-third of all rents, fees, and tributes of any Asamanfu ruler, whereas in the case of the Gyasi ruler, not only does he take a half, but he must be a party to any contract affecting land in the district. The general rule in all these cases is, that an occupier of any land who is a subject of the [Page 24] stool does not pay rent, but only renders service if residing near the stoolholder or a reasonable distance from him. Whenever there is a stool debt he is bound to pay his share of the contribution for its settlement.' <sup id="cite_ref-118" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-118">[118]</a></sup> 'The government of the sea-coast communities is a variation of the general system which has been described. This variation has been caused by frequent intercourse with European traders and the accumulation of wealth by means of lucrative trade. Ancient travellers who wrote described only what they saw in the coast towns. From these men one learns that, over two centuries ago, at seedtime farmers marked out for farming their plots of land, situate usually on rising grounds near the towns and villages. The next step was to obtain the permission of the Ohene or his officers in charge of the land, after permission had been granted, to pay the usual rent. The head of the family, assisted by his wives, children, and any slaves he might possess, prepared the ground for sowing. When the day of sowing arrived, the farm belonging to the village, or town chief, was first sown by all the people, and the others followed in due course. † This custom has continued to modern times with slight modifications. A few years ago the sum of half a crown was paid to landowners on asking for a plot of land to farm on for one season, but within the last two years this sum has been raised to ten shillings; in some instances, such as for land near the large towns, as much as a pound has been paid.' <sup id="cite_ref-119" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-119">[119]</a></sup>

The proceedings are somewhat like a drumhead court-martial. An Asafu trial is so expensive to the litigants that no one appeals to such tribunal if he can possibly avoid doing so.

</p><p><b> ♠ Professional Lawyers ♣ absent ♥</b> Plaintiffs presented their case themselves and took oaths rather than being aided by an advocate: 'As far back as 1600 the practice has been that, in ordinary cases, every man tells his tale by turns without interruption before the judge, who decides after hearing both sides. On the conclusion of the complainant's or plaintiff's statement, the linguist, turning to the defendant, says to him, “Wu nsem pa,” that is, “Such is your good report”-an ironical expression, meaning, “That is what you call good conduct; pray, what have you to say?” for every man is presumed innocent and expected to conduct himself properly, so that a report of his doings may deserve praise, not censure. The defendant having made his defence, questions are put to the parties, who are now allowed, if they so desire, to question each other. By such means the facts or points in issue are made clear. The endeavour is [Page 37] to discover a person admitted by the persons to be present, and who is put forth by them as worthy of credit. After this each party calls his witnesses. When a witness, through sickness or other good reason, is unable to be present, a linguist is sent with the parties or their representatives to him for his statement, and this is repeated to the court. After the parties have made their statements, questions may be put to them by the president and councillors. What a party does not deny he is taken to affirm, especially when this is specially brought to his notice by any member of the court and it is not met. A party may or may not call his witnesses, but if the right is waived, it is no ground for a rehearing. When an accused person demands leave to swear the big oath, or appeal to the gods-‘misire ntam, misire abusum”-libation is quickly made by him and the linguist. The form repeated by the accused is somewhat thus: “As soon as I in my defence speak falsely or act deceitfully, kill me, my god.” The linguist follows him at once thus: “Should you say what is untrue, or practise the slightest deception in your defence, may the god (Katawiré, or other god named) strike you dead.” Sometimes, however, the linguist simply says, “If you speak falsely, may this oath kill you” (“nsiw nk[unknown] wu,” hence “enchiou-keu ou,” in ancient books of travel, erroneously called the oath administered at every trial in Gold Coast). One may correct the present mistake, which confuses the gods ( abusum) with charms ( esuman). Busum is a god visible or invisible. Suman is a charm, an object which can be handled, generally a dangerous or poisonous concoction. Suman is properly called fetish, a word which comes from what the Portuguese explorers used to designate the objects they supposed the Africans worshipped, and in which they were shrewd enough to recognize a certain similarity to their own little images and relics of saints, namely, Feitiço. In criminal cases man and wife may give evidence either for or against each other, so long as they take the oath or fetish to testify [Page 38] truthfully. The evidence, however, of a woman against her husband is viewed with great disfavour. In civil cases objection is usually taken, and therefore it is not accepted, unless no other evidence is available. The statement of a man's mother, brothers, or sisters is not received as evidence, but as a part of his own statement, because of the identity of interest and their joint liability for costs of the suit.' <sup id="cite_ref-133" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-133">[133]</a></sup>

In 1471 he directed that the coast-line should be discovered as it lay. This was done by Joao de Santaren and John de Scobar, who, skirting the coast past what is now Liberia, rounded Cape Palmas, went as far as the island of St. Thomas, and on the return voyage discovered Odena in five degrees of latitude. Fernando Po island was discovered in 1472 by Fernando da Poo. And so much gold was found at Odena that they called that port El Mina, afterwards known as the Castle, or Mina.

<dd><b> ♠ food storage sites ♣ present ♥ </b> Sarbah mentions urban storage facilities: 'On the 21st of February he sent one of his men with attendants to King Abaan, whose town was about four leagues up-country, where was stored a large quantity of corn and millet. This town is described to be as large as the London of that period. It was guarded every night, and to warn the watchmen, cords were stretched across the roads and paths leading to it. Attached to the cords were bells, which give the alarm. In addition to these cords, nets were hung over the few entrances, and were so contrived as to fall on any person endeavouring to steal into the town. Four hours after their arrival in the morning, these men were sent for by the king at nine o'clock, “for there may no man come to him before he be sent for,” nor was it customary in that country to offer their presents to the ruler until they had visited him thrice. On the last visit, after the king had accepted their presents, he drank palm-wine with them. The king, we are informed, used a cup of gold, and when he drank, the people cried all with one voice, “Abaan, Abaan,” with certain other words. “The king drinks; and when he had drunk, then they gave drink to every one, and that done, the king licensed them to depart; and every one that departeth from him boweth three times towards him, and waveth with both hands together, as they bow and do depart. The king hath commonly sitting by him eight or ten ancient men with grey beards.”' <sup id="cite_ref-136" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-136">[136]</a></sup> Sarbah also speaks of quasi-feudal arragements in some polities: 'In the Fanti system allegiance is personal, but in the Asanti it is personal and territorial combined. ‡ The head ruler is not necessarily the owner of any land in his jurisdiction; e.g., Ohene Tchibu, of Asin Yankumasi, owns no land, and is a tenant of Abesibro, his captain; so also is Ohene Aka Ayima, of Beyin in Appolonia, by the [Page 25] judgment of Mr. Justice Nicoll, declared to own no land in his district-at least he did not lead evidence to show the land in question was his. In the case of Ohene Tchibu, the explanation is, that his ancestors fled to Fantiland for protection from the north side of the Pra in the kingdom of Asanti. The greater part of the Asinfu settled on lands within the jurisdiction of the head ruler of Abura, who became their feudal superior. * Many of the Asinfu continued to work on their lands across the river Pra, and held them. Among such is Akessi of Fumsu, until, by an order of the Executive Council of Gold Coast, an arbitrary boundary was fixed, and the possessions of the Asinfu, Denkerafu, and others, trans-Pra and trans-Ofin, were declared Asanti territory in the district of Adansi, and this in spite of the fact that Yamsu village, the stool of which was the subject of the case, Ghambra v.

<p><b> ♠ Symbolic buildings ♣ inferred absent ♥ </b> Symbolic buildings were present during the Ashanti period: 'Periodically the King would venture from the sprawl of buildings which constituted the palace, perhaps to be carried in his palanquin to the mausoleum of his ancestors at Bantama, a couple of miles or so away, or to sit in state on one of a number of special platforms positioned through the city. There, surrounded by chiefs and court officials, he would ritually drink palm wine, greet visitors to the capital and hand out doles of gold-dust.'<sup id="cite_ref-138" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-138">[138]</a></sup> Some buildings erected for the Asantehene combined functions associated with royal display, public ceremonial, storage of state wealth, and reception of high-status guests: 'The Aban does not seem to have been used regularly as a royal residence; possibly it was too small to hold the hordes of attendant minor officials. It does not seem to have influenced political life in any major way except in so far as it demonstrated the King's power and willingness to innovate and to impress European missions which were received there. Freeman visited it in 1841 and noted thirty-one gold-handled swords and several gold-decorated calabashes displayed in one room, while in another room the King and some of his senior councillors were sitting, surrounded by various items of glass and other exotic valuables. One function of the place was as a treasure storehouse, and especially for those exotic items which were not absorbed into the established system of regalia or used for display.' <sup id="cite_ref-139" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-139">[139]</a></sup> Further information on earlier Akan coastal towns is needed.

<dl><dd><b> ♠ Roads ♣ inferred absent ♥ </b> The Ashanti empire relied on a road network: 'A full history of the great-roads ( nkwantεmpon) of Asante has yet to be written. Rather more is known about the southern routes than the northern, since European merchants on the Gold Coast were keenly interested in the matter and made many relevant entries in their journals. Yarak has suggested that the roads from Kumase to Axim via Denkyera, Wasa and Aowin, and from Kumase to Elmina via Denkyera and Twifo, were already in use in the first decade of the eighteenth century. Security was a constant problem on both. L. F. Rømer, a Danish factor on the eastern Gold Coast in the 1730s and 1740s, commented on the matter. In the mid-1740s he thought it likely that, because of marauding, the Asante ‘will create another road to the western forts on the seacoast’. He was later to report that this happened. ‘They have got a road open,’ he wrote, ‘from their country to Elmine [Elmina], Cap Cors [Cape Coast], and the forts which lie west of Elmine.’ It may be that this was the great-road via Asen and the Fante country to Anomabo, whence it was a short journey along the beach to the headquarters of the British at Cape Coast and of the Dutch at Elmina. If so, the Dutch could have regarded it as no more than a temporary solution to their problem of communications with Kumase. In the 1750s the Asante and Dutch authorities were involved in intensive negotiations to improve security on the old westerly routes.' <sup id="cite_ref-140" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-140">[140]</a></sup> Further information on earlier Akan coastal towns is needed.

In their simplest form the temples were small rectangular buildings, entered by steps, the outer surfaces decorated with low reliefs and covered with red and white clay. More usually they consisted of a number of units around a court. Here male priests would periodically carry the god's shrine on their heads, becoming possessed and showing their powers to see, say and do things beyond the abilities of ordinary mortals.' <sup id="cite_ref-142" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-142">[142]</a></sup> It is assumed here that shrines and temples were present prior to the Ashanti expansion as well.</dd>
<dd><b> ♠ Burial site ♣ inferred present ♥ </b> According to Ashanti period material, burial sites were located towards the fringes of human settlements, separate from living quarters: 'A village proper is distinguished from less permanent settlements as much by social complexity as by sheer size. Nearly all established villages are occupied by a number of distinct matrilineal groups, perhaps as many as five or six. This allows local intermarriage and permits the local burial of the dead, for in most areas the task of digging the grave and performing essential parts of the funeral is done by people from a different lineage. Today the final break between a sub-lineage and its parent lineage and village of origin is usually signalled by a decision not to bury its dead there or to participate in, and contribute to, funerals there.' <sup id="cite_ref-143" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-143">[143]</a></sup> The same is assumed here for earlier burial sites.</dd>

As for Azambuja, just as Gomez in the last year of his contract in 1474 was created a nobleman and given by his sovereign a new coat of arms with the title Da Mina, and was made a member of his council, for having developed the Guinea trade, even so did Azambuja, on his return, after serving two years and seven months in Gold Coast, receive the special mark of his royal master's favour.' <sup id="cite_ref-145" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-145">[145]</a></sup> We gave no material on comparable enclosures constructed by Akan polities.</dd>

The chiefs of the different towns were actually placed in charge of the unoccupied land in the districts, or were considered as caretakers for the Omanhene. When a tribe was conquered it became subject of the conqueror's stool; these people continued to hold and enjoy the lands under cultivation; but used forests and unoccupied land as public property attached to the [Page 16] stool of the Omanhene. * Besides the public land, the Omanhene has attached to his stool family land in the [Page 17] occupation of his family; his subsequent deposition does not affect the possession of the family. The Omanhene can live and reside and farm on any unoccupied part of his territory without the leave or permission of the sub-ruler, who holds it as caretaker, but he cannot sell or lease it without the concurrence of such sub-ruler. He is entitled to an Ebusã of the sub-ruler's Ebusã. His immediate followers or household servants may mine for him, but no tribute is payable to the sub-ruler. The subordinate captains (Safuhene, pl. Asafuhene) are bound to obey the commands of the Ohene and pay tribute to him of all gold gotten from gold workings. It is not usual to pay Ebusã to the Ohene or Safuhene on the ordinary [Page 18] washing for alluvial gold. Ebusã is only paid when work is being done in a goldfield, or when one has found an unusually large quantity of gold or discovered a large nugget, or persons are systematically mining.' <sup id="cite_ref-146" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-146">[146]</a></sup> 'In all the sea-coast towns the head ruler collected or received one-fourth part of the fish caught by fishermen.

Finders of large nuggets were bound to send the same to the head ruler on penalty of capital punishment. Three hundred years ago persons who recovered gold by mining or otherwise could not retain for their own use more than a half.

The former was fixed - [unavailable]hyε - at a notional twenty days from Kumase. The mental map of Greater Asante as a month reflected, it may be supposed, a rational recognition of reality: that without any major change in the speed of communications, no lands more distant than a month from Kumase, in and out, could effectively be administered even though they might be subdued for the duration of a campaign.' <sup id="cite_ref-151" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-151">[151]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b> ♠ Articles ♣ present ♥ </b> Colonial trade was mostly carried out through barter: 'The sole reason for the presence of Europeans in West Africa was, and is even now, principally Trade, and for the purposes of trade only were forts built and settlements founded, and the power and jurisdiction of the local rulers subsequently undermined. * The trade consisted mostly in barter or exchange, nor was the sale of slaves inconsiderable.' <sup id="cite_ref-165" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-165">[165]</a></sup> 'The government of the sea-coast communities is a variation of the general system which has been described. This variation has been caused by frequent intercourse with European traders and the accumulation of wealth by means of lucrative trade. Ancient travellers who wrote described only what they saw in the coast towns. From these men one learns that, over two centuries ago, at seedtime farmers marked out for farming their plots of land, situate usually on rising grounds near the towns and villages. The next step was to obtain the permission of the Ohene or his officers in charge of the land, after permission had been granted, to pay the usual rent. The head of the family, assisted by his wives, children, and any slaves he might possess, prepared the ground for sowing. When the day of sowing arrived, the farm belonging to the village, or town chief, was first sown by all the people, and the others followed in due course. † This custom has continued to modern times with slight modifications. A few years ago the sum of half a crown was paid to landowners on asking for a plot of land to farm on for one season, but within the last two years this sum has been raised to ten shillings; in some instances, such as for land near the large towns, as much as a pound has been paid.' <sup id="cite_ref-166" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-166">[166]</a></sup> The same is true of exchanges within Akan communities: 'The manner in which the ruler of a town four centuries ago derived revenue by means of tithes from his people is thus quaintly described by Artus. “When they have used the land and their harvest done, then they sell part of their corn to other men, who are not able to sow it, and by that means get a good quantity of gold; they give some to their king for rent of his land, and carry it home to his house, every one as much as he thinketh good. For there is no certain sum appointed for them to pay, but every one giveth according to his ability, and the quantity of ground that he hath used, and bringeth it unto the king, so that he hath at least five or six bendas of gold of them at one time; which they carry altogether to their [Page 29] king, who welcometh them for this Dache, * or gift; and for their labours giveth them their bellies full of meat and drink, and that they pay to the king for the farm of his lands and no more.”' <sup id="cite_ref-167" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-167">[167]</a></sup> 'In all the sea-coast towns the head ruler collected or received one-fourth part of the fish caught by fishermen. Tolls were collected on traders passing through the district; he was also entitled to receive tribute of a third, and in some cases of a fourth, of gold recovered by mining, rubber, and other products. Finders of large nuggets were bound to send the same to the head ruler on penalty of capital punishment. Three hundred years ago persons who recovered gold by mining or otherwise could not retain for their own use more than a half. The Ohene is also entitled to receive the tail of every elephant slain in his district, and he alone can use it.

<dd><b> ♠ Tokens ♣ inferred present ♥ </b> Some of the Ashanti period material describes cowrie shells: ‘Tramma means literally cowries, the small shells from the Indian Ocean which, by the route from the north, found their way all over West Africa, and to this day may be seen used for small change in the native markets. The word came to be applied to a sale of movable or immovable property in the following manner. No contract of sale was valid in olden times unless a payment called tramma had been made. Tramma was the name derived from that sum, additional to the selling price, which was set aside and given to the witnesses of the transaction. It was a fixed proportional amount, and, at least for certain specified articles, seemed uniform, e.g. the tramma on the purchase of a cat-the old Ashanti bought cats as repositories of their okra or breath-was always a pesewa, about 1 d.; for a female slave, ntaku-anan, about 2 s.; for a male slave, ntakumiensa, [Page 235] 1 s. 6 d. In the case of such purchases no part of the tramma could be used by vendor or purchaser, and it was said that if a purchaser used any of it to buy food with it for his purchase, the slave or cat would die. This tramma may perhaps be called ‘earnest money’, but it was not originally paid to the vendor. If the transaction was afterwards repudiated, the receivers of the tramma were the witnesses to vouch for the transaction. The word therefore came to be used to designate a sale outright as opposed to awowa, ‘pledge’, or in case of land, ‘mortgage’.’ <sup id="cite_ref-169" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-169">[169]</a></sup> We have assumed those to be in use prior to Ashanti rule as well.</dd>
<dd><b> ♠ Precious metals ♣ present ♥ </b> Gold served as an important basis for trade and was taxed by the rulers: 'In ancient times the Omanhene held the whole unoccupied land in his territory as trustee for the people, and as they increased so this public land was brought under cultivation. The chiefs of the different towns were actually placed in charge of the unoccupied land in the districts, or were considered as caretakers for the Omanhene. When a tribe was conquered it became subject of the conqueror's stool; these people continued to hold and enjoy the lands under cultivation; but used forests and unoccupied land as public property attached to the [Page 16] stool of the Omanhene. * Besides the public land, the Omanhene has attached to his stool family land in the [Page 17] occupation of his family; his subsequent deposition does not affect the possession of the family. The Omanhene can live and reside and farm on any unoccupied part of his territory without the leave or permission of the sub-ruler, who holds it as caretaker, but he cannot sell or lease it without the concurrence of such sub-ruler. He is entitled to an Ebusã of the sub-ruler's Ebusã. His immediate followers or household servants may mine for him, but no tribute is payable to the sub-ruler. The subordinate captains (Safuhene, pl. Asafuhene) are bound to obey the commands of the Ohene and pay tribute to him of all gold gotten from gold workings. It is not usual to pay Ebusã to the Ohene or Safuhene on the ordinary [Page 18] washing for alluvial gold.

Windham was outrageously incensed because he was associated with Pinteado, a wise, discreet, and sober man, who for his skill in sailing, being as well an expert pilot as a [Page 65] politic captain, was sometime in great favour with the King of Portugal, and was one of the gentlemen of the king his master's house. The ships traded along the Gold Coast, and got as much as an hundred and fifty pounds' weight of gold. Against the advice of Pinteado, Windham insisted on proceeding to Benin, where they met with great disaster; for here Windham, Pinteado, and almost two-thirds of the crew, died of fever. The large quantity of gold brought to England by these ships undoubtedly stirred up and encouraged others to venture forth.' <sup id="cite_ref-173" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-173">[173]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b> ♠ Foreign coins ♣ inferred absent ♥ </b> Sarbah mentions foreign coinage, but it is not quite clear whether this was used extensively by Europeans when trading with Akan partners: ‘Following the early voyages already mentioned, a royal chartered company, formed in 1618, founded the first British settlement in Gold Coast at Kromantin. In 1662 a second company was formed, and during its existence De Ruyter, the famous Dutch admiral, took the British fort at Kromantin, but was repulsed when he attacked the castle of Cape Coast. This Anglo-African company not only exported woolen and other English goods to the value of about £75,000 a year, but it also supplied a large number of slaves to the American plantations, and the slave trade became so lucrative that, although slaves were sold at a very fair price, credit of £100,000 and upwards was often given to the planters until they could conveniently pay. It was therefore to the great advantage of these European traders to foster dissension and disunion among the Africans, to instigate them to constant hostilities, and to encourage raiding expeditions, so as to keep up the supply of war captives and other prisoners for sale. Seeing that the company imported not only a great quantity of ivory, camwood, and much gold dust, but that they also, in the reign of James II., frequently coined at a time from thirty to forty thousand guineas bearing the image of an elephant, the accursed slave trade could not be justified. This company was succeeded by the Royal African Company of England in 1672, which steadily fostered and extended British interest along the coast; but on the abolition of its exclusive privileges, it was finally dissolved in 1752, when a trading corporation was created. The membership of this, however, was open to all British traders on payment of a fee of two pounds. The statutes 23 George II. c. 31 and 25 George II. c. 40, which created the new company of merchants trading to Africa, also authorized Parliament to subsidize it every year; this was done up to the year 1821, when by statute 1 &amp; 2 George IV. c. 28 it was dissolved, and all its possessions became vested in the Crown as a portion of the West African [Page 77] settlements, the seat of government being then at Sierra Leone.’ <sup id="cite_ref-174" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-174">[174]</a></sup> We have provisionally assumed European currencies to not be in widespread use in Akan-European trade relations. This is open to re-evaluation.</dd>
<dd><b> ♠ Indigenous coins ♣ absent ♥ </b> Rule-breakers were fined in gold or kind rather than indigenous coinage: 'By virtue of his position, all penalties for breach of the [Page 30] tribal or public oath are collected for and paid to the Ohene, in addition to certain court fees, such as Asida, or Atingé. In former times the Ohene of every large town was entitled to fine strangers entering his town bearing arms without his permission so to do. Fines are paid for accidental homicide; such as carelessly wounding a person taking part in the chase. A person found guilty of criminal intercourse with a married woman is liable to pay to the injured husband a fine of two ounces of gold (benda), that is, £7 4 s. In cases of theft the guilty offender is made to restore to the owner the stolen article or its value, and to his ruler he pays a fine. Where a thief is unable to restore a priceless article, he is killed, and his nearest blood relatives are fined, and, if unable to pay, are sold for the amount. The amount of a fine for theft does not depend so much on the value of the article as upon the nature thereof; e.g. it is not considered theft for a starving man to steal any foodstuff to appease his hunger. Among a people who have been accustomed to have all things in common, the sensibility of many persons to the criminality of theft is not so great as in Europe. In the old settlements, however, the standard of morality in this respect is steadily rising.' <sup id="cite_ref-175" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-175">[175]</a></sup></dd>

According to several Portuguese writers including de Barros, Alphonso, the king of Portugal, farmed out in 1469 for five years the Guinea trade to one Fernando Gomez, at the rate of five hundred ducats, or about £138 17 s. 9 d.; the said Gomez having undertaken on his part to explore five hundred leagues, that is, three hundred miles each year, starting from Sierra Leone. In 1471 he directed that the coast-line should be discovered as it lay. This was done by Joao de Santaren and John de Scobar, who, skirting the coast past what is now Liberia, rounded Cape Palmas, went as far as the island of St. Thomas, and on the return voyage discovered Odena in five degrees of latitude. Fernando Po island was discovered in 1472 by Fernando da Poo. And so much gold was found at Odena that they called that port El Mina, afterwards known as the Castle, or Mina. These men also found gold at Chama, and it is said that Gomez opened a gold-mine at Approbi near Little Kommenda, the Aldea des Terres of the Portuguese." <sup id="cite_ref-215" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-215">[215]</a></sup> "The relations between the Dutch and the people of Elmina and elsewhere were harmonious for some time, but when the English began to increase their trade, and sought to build factories and forts, the Dutch, becoming alarmed, changed their former politic conduct into one of harsh severity, took stringent measures, and devised means to deter the inhabitants from dealing with their competitors in the trade. Therefore they set up small forts at Boutri, Chama, Cape Coast Castle, Anumabu, Kromantin, and Accra, on the pretence that they were necessary to protect the inhabitants against attacks and raids by the inland people. The unlawful seizure by the Dutch of the English fort at Kromantin was one of the causes leading to the war between England and Holland in 1666, during which the Dutch fleet sailed up the Thames." <sup id="cite_ref-216" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-216">[216]</a></sup> An Akan ruler captured a Danish fort at the end of the 17th century, but returned it after successful negotiations: "The narratives of the travellers of those days show that the natives did not tamely submit to any oppressive measures, whether from the Dutch, Danish, or English. On one occasion the people of Elmina confined the Dutch Governor-General and his garrison in the castle for ten months. The Danes were amongst the early settlers at Accra, and seemed to have got on well with their customers. But about the year 1693, finding their trade much diminished through Dutch competition, they advised their landlord and his people not to trade with them. When an attempt was made to enforce this advice, the African ruler, by name Asamani, and people, attacked the Danes and seized their fort, situate four miles to the east of James Town, with all the merchandise therein contained, including much treasure, which Asamani appropriated to his own use. On the fort he planted his flag, white, with an African brandishing a scimitar painted in the middle; and from its sixteen guns he exchanged salutes with passing ships, in addition to firing volleys-as much as two hundred on one occasion-in honour of his visitors.

Every male person able to bear arms is bound to serve his country, and each fighting man [Page 28] provides himself with arms and ammunitions, as well as provisions, at his own expense.' <sup id="cite_ref-219" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-219">[219]</a></sup> “In some towns there are as many as seven companies, members of which reside not only in the town, but also in the neighbouring villages. Lands cleared by the companies belong to them. The lands of the companies do not belong to the Ohene, for there are town lands, family lands, and stool lands. The Ohene has no right to ordinary tribute, and the public-stool income is derived from fines, penalties, and court fees. In this also the jurisdiction is personal. The Tufuhene, the councillors, and captains of the companies take part in the election and installation of a new Ohene. Before them he takes his oath of office, and if any lands are attached to the town stool, he holds them in trust for the public. The succession generally follows the common rule, but in some places it is the son who succeeds, not the brother or nephew. The townspeople can pass over the person nominated by the family and elect some other suitable person instead. They may also remove the Ohene, if found unfit to rule them any longer; in either of which events the town sword and stool, with all the public property thereunto appurtenant, are vested in the town council, whose duty it is to take them from the deposed ruler or his family and give them to the person appointed as new ruler or manager during the interval.' <sup id="cite_ref-220" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-220">[220]</a></sup> This material suggests that troops were drawn from the male population rather than a trained corps of professional soldiers. The importance of blood-relatives of the ruler in his guard militates against its characterization as a corps of military specialists.

On the second attack they were successful, and the 29th August, 1637, saw the castle of Elmina fall, having been given up to the Dutch, who five years afterwards, that is, on the 9th January, 1642, subdued Fort St. Antonio, the next important Portuguese station.

<p>A collective ritual is a ritual in which two or more people participate. With the official cult we refer to the set of collective ritual practices that are most closely associated with legitimation of the power structure (including elites, if any).

</p><p>Note: The Yam and Apo festivals as well as the Monocot ceremony were imported from the Ashanti-period sheet (GhAshnL). It remains to be confirmed whether these rituals indeed predated the Ashanti expansion. We have provisionally presumed this to be the case.
</p><p>The following descriptions were extracted from the eHRAF Culture Summary for the Akan: 'Indigenous Akan religion is based upon the worship of a High God, various spirits or deities, and ancestors. The High God-known as Onyame, Onyankopon, and by other names-is the Creator, now otiose; Asase Yaa, the goddess of the earth, accompanies him. The ancestors live in the land of the dead and may demand offerings, in the past including those of slaves.' <sup id="cite_ref-246" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-246">[246]</a></sup> 'The Akan have largely been Christian since the nineteenth century, except for most kings, who have had to retain their indigenous religious status and practices. European Christian missions were highly successful, bringing not only Christianity but also education, and most Akan have been literate for a long time. Islam has a long history among the Akan, having been introduced by early traders from the north. Royalty made use of Muslim scribes for court duties. The Akan have a long history of "prophets" of many kinds-Christian, Muslim, and "heathen"-and of separatist Christian movements. All these various forms of religious belief and activity exist side by side, and most people have recourse to all of them, according to their particular needs and wishes.' <sup id="cite_ref-247" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-247">[247]</a></sup> 'Spirits or deities are many, and the living can communicate with them through prayer, sacrifice, and possession. Each has its own OSOFO, or priest; an OKOMFO is a living spirit medium who interprets the words of a spirit who is consulted to remove sickness and human disasters.' <sup id="cite_ref-248" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-248">[248]</a></sup> 'The royal ancestors are at the heart of the ritual protection of a kingdom. They are "fed" at shrines in the form of blackened stools of wood and kept in the "stool rooms" in palaces and houses. Traditionally, the stools were anointed with human blood, gunpowder, and spider webs, and given alcoholic drink; human sacrifices are no longer made. Each kingdom and town has, or had in past years, an annual purification ritual, known as ODWIRA, in which the king, the office of kingship, the kingdom, and the town are purified of the pollution of the preceding year; this is often known in the literature as a "yam festival."' <sup id="cite_ref-249" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-249">[249]</a></sup> 'Sickness is attributed to organic causes, preordained destiny, angry ancestors, witchcraft, and anti-social behavior. Herbalists have reliable cures for organic illnesses. Herbalists with knowledge of witchcraft and priests deal with psychosomatic illnesses. Warren (1973, no. 29) makes an interesting point that social stress can weaken a person's natural resistance to any one of a number of internal malarial and intestinal parasites, resulting in illness. The priest seeks to identify and remedy the social disturbance that causes the stress.' <sup id="cite_ref-250" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-250">[250]</a></sup> 'At death one's blood (MOGYA) turns into a ghost (SAMAN) and enters the spirit world (SAMANDO) where it awaits reincarnation.

The funeral consists of five stages: i) washing the corpse, ii) pre-burial mourning, iii) internment, iv) post-burial mourning, and v) periodic mourning. At death the family is notified and the corpse is washed three times. This is followed by three (formerly seven) days of mourning, which includes fasting and the singing of funeral dirges. The body is interred and a public mourning for friends and relatives ensues, involving dancing and drumming.

</p><p>We should code for 'indigenous' rather than Muslim ritual as the former appears to have been more wide-spread in pre-colonial times, although the boundaries between the two were more fluid than this categorization allows for.
</p><p>Rattray provides a description of some stool rituals from the colonial period: As soon as my eyes grew accustomed to the light, I saw at the end of the room, opposite to the door, a long low platform, raised about three feet off the ground, made of upright poles with cross sticks laid upon them. Upon this table or rack were set the ancestral stools, as yet invisible, for all were covered with one large coarsely woven native cloth called nsa. The head stool-carrier came forward and removed the covering. There were thirteen blackened stools, many crumbling to pieces with age. Each stool lay upon its side, the seat facing towards us. They were caked with clotted blood, [It may be as well to place upon record the fact that the blood with which these ancestral stools are clotted was never that of a human sacrifice as is so often erroneously supposed. An Ashanti whom I once questioned on this point asked me how I could ask such a foolish question when I knew well that the flesh of the sacrifice was afterwards partaken of. There is one apparent but not real exception, the stool ( not an ancestral stool) brought from Gyaman by Yim Aware which was really a suman or fetish. Upon this formerly a mulatto's blood was sprinkled. Nowadays a brown sheep is sacrificed upon it and the flesh is not eaten by those taking part in the ceremony.] and pieces of fat could be seen round the centre supports of many of them. (For photographs of smoked stools, see Figs. 34 and 35, which were those at another Adae). <sup id="cite_ref-252" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-252">[252]</a></sup> 'The thirteen stools were in three rows. Two brass bells were the only other contents of the room.' <sup id="cite_ref-253" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-253">[253]</a></sup> 'On Monday, a most impressive rite took place. About 6 p.m. all the local gods, the shrines of which were permanently housed in the Ta Kese or other local temples, were formed up outside the Ta Kese house. Leading the procession were the shrines of fourteen lesser gods, carried upon the heads of young boys, and immediately behind these was Ta Kese and Ta Kwesi, each under its own enormous umbrella. On top of the shrines of these last-named deities were red fez caps-the badge of the Mohammedan in these parts. [I was told by some that this was to signify a victory over some Mohammedan chief in one of the wars of the past, and by another that it signified that the Allah of the Mohammedan was just the same as the 'Nyame of the Ashanti.] Priests covered in white powdered clay and in white skirts were in attendance. One man carried a very large branch of the tree the Ashanti call summe (Costus sp.). [Much used in religious ceremonies, the smell of the tree is sometimes said to drive away ghosts.] The blackened stools of former priests were also carried in the procession' <sup id="cite_ref-254" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-254">[254]</a></sup> 'Many in the procession carried cow-tail switches and guns.

On every occasion upon which a drummer is about to drum for the first time on a particular day, the following little ceremony takes place. Some wine or other spirit is brought in a cup, [Page 264] and the drummer, bending over his drums, pours a few drops upon the edges and addresses them as follows: ‘ Tweneboa Kodia, Kodia Tweneduru, gye nsa nom.

An interesting rite was next described which had not been recorded in connexion with other enstoolments so far noted, although it may very possibly have taken place. It was as follows: On that day the Barimfo (Mausoleum attendants) took white calico and mashed plantains ( eto) and dressed the gyadua (trees) in the town. A sheep was also sacrificed beneath the oldest gyadua (tree) and the eto placed on its roots while the following words were spoken: Gye eto ne ogwan yi di, na boa Ohene foforo yi ma no nkye, nya sika; mma n'ani mfura; mma n'aso nsi; mma no kote nwu; ma mmawofo nwo mma; ma kuro yi die edan nsi da, edan nsi ho; mma Ohene mfom; mma no manfo mpa n'aba. ‘Receive this eto and sheep and partake, and help this new Chief and let him have long life; let him get gold-dust; do not allow his penis to die; allow the bearers of children to bear children; let houses stand where no house stands; do not let the Chief commit mistakes; do not permit his people to fall from him like branches.’' <sup id="cite_ref-258" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-258">[258]</a></sup>
</p><p>Given the increased regional integration brought about by the Ashanti expansion, some of Rattray's material may not apply to the pre-colonial period. More information on changes in ritual practice from the pre-Ashanti to the Ashanti periods is needed.
</p><p>Wilks gives an account of regal ceremonies and comments on some Ashanti innovations on the 'native' Akan system: 'In Kumase Apafram Memeneda (“Mimida”) and Apafram Kwasiada - Apafram Saturday and Sunday - fall within the cycle of the great annual festival of the Akan known as Odwira because it is a rite of purification ( dwira), but known to Europeans in the nineteenth century as “the Yam Custom” because it also has to do with the harvest. The concern with the well-being of the nation is expressed in an oration made by the incumbent Asantehene.' <sup id="cite_ref-259" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-259">[259]</a></sup> 'The Apafram is embedded within the older Odwira festival. It has to do with the bonds between the Asantehene and those from whom he expects allegiance. On Apafram Memeneda the amanhene of the Asanteman entered Kumase with much pomp and circumstance. They were received at Apremoso, the Place of the Cannons, so named from the guns captured in the Denkyira war (and now, such are the turns of fortune, the site of the central police station). One by one the dignitaries renewed allegiance to the Asantehene, swearing on swords of state appropriate to their rank. The proceedings often lasted well into the night. The next day, Apafram Sunday, the skulls of slain enemies were brought to the palace from Bantama (the town of the Konti), and the Apafram from Asafo (that of the Akwamu). The rites that followed were not open to the public. Rattray obtained a description of them from a “white haired Ashanti friend.” The Asantehene “discarded his gorgeous robes and dressed himself in Kyenkyen (bark cloth), the garb of the poorest slave in the realm.” He then smeared the odwira suman, that is, the Apafram, with a red dye and gave it new yams and wine Osei Tutu Dwira, The Odwira of Osei Tutu, gye nsa nom. receive wine and drink it. Ohene biara a ompo se Any King who does not like osom me no, to serve me, Ma me nya no menku no, Let me get the chance of killing him Mfa ne ti mmeto to mu. And put his head into you. The ceremony thus inverts that of the previous day; on Apafram Saturday the amanhene publicly acknowledge that they serve the Asantehene; on Apafram Sunday the Asantehene privately communed with the suman on the fate of those who compromised their allegiance.' <sup id="cite_ref-260" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-260">[260]</a></sup> 'The institution of the Apafram, and its incorporation into the Odwira, appears then to be the event which signalled the creation of the Asanteman, underwriting (as it were) the unity of Osei Tutu, in his new role as Asantehene, and the rulers of the “five” states that had joined the coalition against Denkyira. The matter was addressed in a document prepared [Page 117] “THE GREAT ANNUAL FESTIVAL OF THE AKAN KNOWN AS ODWIRA.” ASANTEHENE OSEI TUTU KWAME PRESIDING OVER THE ODWIRA IN KUMASE, 1817. THE FLAGS OF ASANTE'S TRADING PARTNERS, BRITAIN, THE NETHERLANDS AND DENMARK, ARE DISPLAYED. T. E. Bowdich, Mission from Cape Coast Castle to Ashantee (London, 1819). [Page 118] by the Edwesohene and others in 1933, having to do with the imminent restoration of the Asante “Confederacy”: 'This occasional meeting at Kumasi for the observance of the Odwira custom was the beginning of what was later to be subordination to the Kumasi Stool, and since that time Kumasi has ever continued to be the central meeting place of the Ashanti Chiefs. From the foregoing it would be seen that the meeting at Kumasi was decreed by Komfuo Anotchi [Okomfo Anokye] after the fall of Denkyira. This occasional meeting was turned to mean subjection.'  “The Ashantis”-thus HAK-“became the most powerful of all the other countries around it.” True, but it was still to be a long haul.' <sup id="cite_ref-261" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-261">[261]</a></sup>
</p><p>The above passages do not constitute complete descriptions of the respective rituals, but indicate on which pages or in which chapters relevant material can be found.
</p><p>'The object, however, of this work is not to deal with religious theories, deities, or matters of belief. In the Fanti districts, with their numerous free and independent communities, the priests who officiated at the shrine of Nanaam (that is ancestors), the national deities, situate at Mankesim, exercised large powers and wielded great [Page 52] influence, so much so that the opinion has been expressed that the high priest, a Braffo, was the sovereign ruler of the Fanti people. The physician was so often a priest that it is not surprising to discover him possessed of much influence; but this much may be said, the priests did not rule the people. The general name for God is Nyankupon (Nyankrupon according to the Akanfu), meaning the Only One, than who none is greater, or, as others say, the Great Friend. Nyankupon is invisible. He lives above the heavens, and the winds are His messengers. The common saying is, “Speak to the winds, and God will hear thee.” This word has different pronunciations, and the difficulty of finding its root may be through this cause. Rain is called Nyankum; rainbow is nyankunton. Nyan is to awaken, and it has been suggested that probably Onyan (the awakener) was an old name for the sky. One is rather inclined to form the opinion that Nyankupon is not derived from ye, meaning to do, act, create, as some say. This subject is certainly interesting, and requires further study and much thinking over.' <sup id="cite_ref-262" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-262">[262]</a></sup> 'From the information at our disposal, we now know that the Ashanti makes a distinction between the following: the okomfo(priest); the sumankwafo or dunseni (the medicine-man); and the Bonsam komfo (witch-doctor). The word okomfo, without any further qualification refers to a priest of one of the orthodox abosom (gods). We see, however, that a witch-doctor is allowed [Page 40] the same name as a kind of honorary title or degree, being known as a Bayi 'komfo (a priest of witchcraft). Again, the ordinary medical practitioners are never termed akomfo; they are sumankwafo, dealers in suman; or dunsefo, workers in roots; or odu'yefo, workers in medicines.' <sup id="cite_ref-263" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-263">[263]</a></sup> 'The Priest generally invests his practice with a certain amount of secrecy. He pretends to hold communion, not in a spiritual sense, but in a matter-of-fact way, with the spirits of the dead, and he will often bring you back a message from a dead friend, if desired. When a priest is called in from a distance to attend a case, he will generally tell the friends of the patient much about the family history, and indicate that a deceased relative is troubling the patient for some act of disobedience. The deceased relative must accordingly be propitiated. How does he come to know the history of the family to which he is a stranger? There is a Guild of Priests in the country to which all Priests belong, whose members are absolutely faithful to one ànother. Upon the [Page 107] arrival of the Priest in the town where his attendance is required, he immediately goes to meet his brother Priest, or some student of the Priest, if he is out of town, who gives him all the information he requires, and which he subsequently puts to such effective use. The people understand the deception, but they never expose it; for the Priest's office is a sacred one, and they philosophically look to the spiritual side of things and not to the letter.' <sup id="cite_ref-264" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-264">[264]</a></sup>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Yam Festival ♥</b> Akan communities celebrated the annual yam harvest with a public festival. 'An annual custom is always held in connection with the first fruits of each staple crop such as yam. The general name for a festival is Afahyε (afa, “festival”; hyε, “fix a day”). The chief's and head priest's house and things are refurbished [Page 35] by singing old women, the blackened stools are taken to the stream and sprinkled with water; pieces of sacrificed and new food crops are put on each stool. The spirits are invoked to start the new year and make it a good one, the new year beginning at different times in different localities.' <sup id="cite_ref-265" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-265">[265]</a></sup>//'The Akan annual yam festival, a purificatory ceremony lasting one-two weeks usually in September or October, is called Odwira, meaning “to purify/cleanse”. (It is sometimes also called apafram). It is similar to the Apo in that all disputes are settled, bringing harmony back to the town. The central part of the festival is the re-purification of the stools and the abosom shrines. It is a festival involving remembrance of the dead, harvest, and thanksgiving.' <sup id="cite_ref-266" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-266">[266]</a></sup>//The Yam Festival is also known as Odwira Festival in the literature: 'The Odwira Festival is the most important yearly celebration among the Ashanti people. It is held in autumn, the time when new yams are ready. They cannot be eaten until the second day of the festival, when they are paraded through the streets. The whole festival lasts for five days is celebrated slightly differently in each community. Throughout the festival, music and drumming abound. On the first day the path leading towards the chief's burial is cleaned. On the second day priests make offerings at the burial chambers and a great yam parade takes place. On the third day people mourn and fast. On the fourth a splendid feast for everyone in the community is held at the local chief's house. That night, everyone stay indoors, to avoid catching sight of the chief's thrones, symbols of the dead men's spirits, which are carried to the river to be ceremonially washed. On the fifth and final day, chiefs and other important clan members dressed in their best, parade through the town in a  grand procession to pay homage to the senior local chief. Some are carried shoulder high on litters and shaded with brilliantly coloured umbrellas. Then people play music and dance late into the night.'<sup id="cite_ref-267" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-267">[267]</a></sup>//Warren provides a description of the relevant narratives and proceedings among the Techiman-Bono:'The other major annual Bono Festival is the Yam Festival ( henerεk dibayerefoforo: literally, the chief is going to eat new yams). The myth explaining the origin of the festival states that when the Techiman-Bono people came from the cavern at Amowi, Onyame pointed out forest yams (aha bayere). Seeing that bush pigs and elephants had eaten some of the yams, they cooked a few and saw that the yam was good food. They gave some to their chief, who also enjoyed it. After that, they began to celebrate on an annual basis the day on which they first found yams. After their chief died, they fed his soul (saman) yams on the same day. Later the Bono began to plant yams, and the yam became the most important staple in the Bono diet. Every farmer celebrates the festival to thank Onyame after the harvest. The living and the deceased are all invited to share in the abundance. Every Bono chief and priest celebrates a yam festival, but before the celebrations begin, a man from the village of Kenten whose title is Akokohwedeε (woodhen) first tastes the yam. When he sees that the yam is ripe, early in the morning on the traditional day called Fodwo he informs the god Taa Mεnsah that the yam is ready to be prepared for εto (mashed yams mixed with palmoil).' <sup id="cite_ref-268" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-268">[268]</a></sup>//'The Taa Mεnsah deity celebrates his yam festival on Fodwo, a Monday.

After the yam is hung, children may begin to eat new yam and the elders can [Page 57] [Page 58] begin to eat aso bayere (one species of yam). In the evening on Fodwo, the god Taa Mεnsah is prepared to eat yam after being carried on the main street from one end of the town to the other end three times and consulted. After this, the god informs the manhene that he is about to eat yam and the manhene gives the god permission to eat the yam. The manhene sends a yam to the god and it is always this yam which is cooked as εto and placed on the shrine. The next day, Tuesday, the manhene sends a sheep and wine to the god.' <sup id="cite_ref-269" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-269">[269]</a></sup>//'Two weeks after the Taa Mεnsah Yam Festival, the yam festivals for the Queenmother, the Adontenhene, and the Nifahene are celebrated on a Monofie, a Friday.

Fofie, another Friday, is the yam festival day for the manhene, the Gyaasehene, the Ankbeahene, and the Barimhene. The manhene provides about six sheep and a cow for his own yam festival.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Apo Festival ♥</b> The Apo Festival was celebrated annually and included carnivalesque elements: 'Many festivals exist among the Akan; their foundations and functions are found in the traditional religion. The Apo festival is celebrated yearly among the Brong; it is a feast of eight days duration in which complete lampooning liberty (in the form of song) of both superiors and inferiors (without punishment) is given. The people explain that if one's sunsum is hurt, the body becomes ill; often ill health is caused by evil and the hatred another person may have for you. In like manner, if you have a hatred for someone, it affects your own sunsum, so this time is set aside to allow any man to tell any other man what has offended him. This frees the spirit, and both sunsum become relaxed. During this festival there is theoretical sexual license; this isn't really taken [Page 33] Scene at a Festival [Page 34] advantage of since traditional court action can be initiated after the eight day festival. Punishment is therefore deferred until the rites are over. Should an aggrieved party take action he forfeits the right to investigation, to satisfaction, and he is also heavily fined. During this period all the priests and priestesses of the area are present with their shrines; they touch each shrine with every other one to re-establish communications which might have been lost. The major gods are taken to the river and cleansed of all evil. On the eighth day everyone makes a concerted effort to drive all evil from the area. Around twenty-five distinct Apo songs are sung, and there is a specific Apo dance for the festival.' <sup id="cite_ref-317" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-317">[317]</a></sup>//Purification is a major element in the rituals performed: 'The festival period is, in fact, a period of coming together in which the people from all over the Techiman traditional area, including well-wishers and invitees from other states, meet in the capital to display the traditional Bono culture through singing, dancing, and drumming. The manhene and his elders, through the Barimhene, purify the soul of King Ameyaw (the chief defeated by the Asante in 1723), adorn his grave with the royal regalia of the incumbent manhene, recall the deeds that Ameyaw performed for the State (man), and present drinks, sheep, and food to his soul and those of the other ancestral chiefs of the Techiman-Bono State. Finally, the Apo is a period during which the shrines of various gods and goddesses are purified. The shrine of the main deity in Techiman Township, Taa Kεse (Taa Mεnsah), is, at this time, purified at the River Agyentoamu during the last hour of the celebration; this serves as a sign of the completion of the Apo Festival.' <sup id="cite_ref-318" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-318">[318]</a></sup>//The festival also served as a check on authority and as a forum for the resolution of mutual resentment: 'The functions of the Apo festival seem to be four: (1) psychological release, (2) a forum for public opinion, (3) a means to periodically check those in authority, (4) a method of enforcing sanctions of behaviour.' <sup id="cite_ref-319" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-319">[319]</a></sup> According to Warren, the restoration of amicable relations is one of the major purposes of the festival: 'This festival allows every person resident in Techiman Traditional State, without regard to class, creed, ethnic group, or race, eleven days of liberty to lampoon, in the form of songs and proverbs, the faults and malpractices of any other person, including those in authority-especially the manhene and his divisional chiefs. In addition, the people may sing the praises of those in authority in appreciation of worthy achievements so as to encourage them to even greater deeds. During this period it is strictly forbidden to fight in any way. The emphasis of the festival is upon the removal of bitterness and misfortune in the State. After all personal grudges, faults, and hatreds are sung and spoken out amicably, the end result is renewed peace and harmony among the Techiman inhabitants; the spirit (sunsum) of the [Page 56] state is cleansed after all the unspoken interpersonal bitternesses are voiced.' <sup id="cite_ref-320" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-320">[320]</a></sup></dd>

Adae means “place for rest” or “lying down”; no work is done on these days when the living recall the deeds of the deceased and solicit them for mercy and favours. The blood of sacrificed sheep is smeared by hand on the ancestral stools (human blood is never spilled on shrines); a libation is poured on each stool. The offering, excluding the omentum, is removed in the evening by the stool-carriers. Everyone entering the stool room removes his shoes, and bares his shoulders as a sign of humbleness before the superior spirits. Many ceremonies such as this Adae follow a forty-two day cycle. The details vary from area to area; the Brong propitiate both the Samanfo and the bosom at the Adae while the Ashanti only propitiate the Samanfo.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣  ♥</b> Healing ritual in ecstatic churches. <b>This ritual is awaiting an expert check to decide whether it should be coded here or not</b> Healing and possession rituals are also described in the colonial-era sources. But these seem to describe movements that emerged as a response to the colonial encounter, which is was some sources insinuate. We are thus unsure about making inferences in this case and have left the variables uncoded. We have nevertheless provided some descriptive paragraphs in case a 'predecessor' can be identified.//'A spirit may take possession of a man and he may appear to have gone mad, and this state may last sometimes even for a year. Then the priest of some powerful god may be consulted and he may discover, through his god, that it is some spirit which has come upon the man (or woman). The one upon whom the spirit has come is now bidden to prepare a brass pan, and collect water, leaves, and ‘medicine’ of specific kinds. The possessed one will dance, for sometimes two days, with short intervals for rest, to the accompaniment of drums and singing. Quite suddenly he will leap into the air and catch something in both his hands (or he may plunge into the river and emerge holding something he has brought up). He will in either case fold this thing to his breast, and water will be at once sprinkled upon it to cool it, when it will be thrust into the brass pan and quickly covered up. The following ingredients are now prepared: clay from one of the more sacred rivers, like the Tano, and the following medicinal plants and other objects: afema [Justicia flavia], Dama Bo [Abras precatorius]; the bark of the odom, a creeper called hamakyem, leaves and bark of a tree called domine, another creeper called hamakyerehene, any root that crosses a path, a projecting stump in a path over which passers-by would be likely to trip, also roots and stumps from under water, the leaves of a tree called aya-those are chosen which are seen to be quivering on the tree even though no wind is shaking them-the leaves, bark, and roots of a tree called Bonsam dua (lit. the wizard's tree), a nugget of virgin gold (gold that has been in use or circulation must not be used), a bodom (so called aggrey bead), and a long white bead called gyanie. The whole of these are pounded and placed in the pan, along with the original object already inside, while the following incantation or prayer is repeated: [...] ‘Supreme Being, upon whom men lean and do not fall, (whose day of observance is a Saturday). Earth Goddess, (whose day of worship is a Thursday), Leopard, and all beasts and plants of the forest, to-day is a sacred Friday; and you, Ta Kwesi (the particular god for whom in this case the shrine was being prepared), we are installing you, we are setting you (here), that we may have long life; do not let us get “Death”; do not let us become impotent; life to the head of this village; life to the young men of this village; life to those who bear children, and life to the children of this village. ‘O tree, we call Odum Abena, (to whom belongs the silk cotton tree), we are all calling upon you that you may come, one and all, just now, that we may place in this shrine the thoughts that are in our heads. ‘When we call upon you in the darkness, when we call upon you in the sunlight, and say, “Do such a thing for us”, you will do so. ‘And the laws that we are decreeing for you, you, this god [Page 149] of ours, are these-if in our time, or in our children's, and our grandchildren's time a king should arise from somewhere, and come to us, and say he is going to war, when he tells you, and you well know that should he go to the fight he will not gain the victory, you must tell us so; and should you know that he will go and conquer, then also state that truth. ‘And yet again, if a man be ill in the night, or in the daytime, and we raise you aloft and place you upon the head, and we inquire of you saying, “Is So-and-so about to die?”, let the cause of the misfortune which you tell him has come upon him be the real cause of the evil and not lies. ‘To-day, we all in this town, all our elders, and all our children, have consulted together and agreed without dissent among us, we have all united and with one accord decided to establish your shrine, you, Ta Kwesi, upon this, a sacred Friday. ‘We have taken a sheep, and a fowl, we have taken wine, we are about to give them to you that you may reside in this town and preserve its life. From this day, and so on to any future day, you must not fly and leave us. From this day, to any future day, you, O Tano's fire, in anything that you tell us, do not let it be a lie. Do not put water in your mouth and speak to us. To-day you become a god for the chief, to-day you have become a god for our spirit ancestors. Perhaps upon some to-morrow the Ashanti King may come and say, “My child So-and-so (or it may be an elder) is sick”, and ask you to go with him, or may be he will send a messenger here for you; in such a case you may go and we will not think that you are fleeing from us. And these words are a voice from the mouth of us all.’ <sup id="cite_ref-417" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-417">[417]</a></sup>//'The various sacrifices are then made, and in each case the blood is allowed to fall upon the contents in the brass pan.' <sup id="cite_ref-418" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-418">[418]</a></sup>//'I have had many similar accounts of the consecration of a new shrine as the temporary home of a new manifestation of a spirit universal and always present, but not subject to control.' <sup id="cite_ref-419" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-419">[419]</a></sup>//'An Akan priest, okomfo, dancing in a state of possession [Page 29] main shrine who remit one-third of their profits to Akonnedi Some of the functions of these priestesses are the diagnosis and prescription of action for innumerable ills, mostly done while possessed. Western medicine is not incompatible with this type of tradition, since the ills treated here are sometimes psychical treated by means of supernatural powers or occult forces invoked by a priest (abosom okomfo) and sometimes physical i.e. bacterial diseases, treated by herbal medicine administered by a herbalist (odunsifo). These shrines are important in regulating social behaviour. A person may invoke the shrine in an oath, an extra-judicial outlet for emotions. The public is forced, then to take cognizance of a problem not within the bounds of the courts.' <sup id="cite_ref-420" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-420">[420]</a></sup>//'Much traditional medical treatment is of a religious nature. Traditional explanations of sicknesses, besides purely organic causation familiar to westerners, include preordained destiny, retribution of angered ancestors, witchcraft and sorcery, the result of anti-social behaviour on the part of the sufferer. This supernatural aspect of the Akan theory of medicine helps maintain a balanced mental and social health. The diagnosis of those illness attributed to spiritual causes is the determination of social wrongs and the cure involves the righting of that wrong. Many Akan live in a delicate equilibrium with disease parasites (e.g. malarial and intestinal [Page 30]' <sup id="cite_ref-421" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-421">[421]</a></sup>//'A Priest, okomfo, sitting inside his shrine [Page 31] worms), any social stress in the form of human hatreds or jealousies tends to weaken the person's natural resistance to such parasites. The importance of the priest in seeking out and curing the social disturbance is thus of paramount importance in removing the stress and allowing the patient to move back into an equilibrium with his parasites.' <sup id="cite_ref-422" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-422">[422]</a></sup>//'The folk healers of the sick can thus be classified into three groups: (1) the herbalist (dunsini), (2) the herbalist who also deals in charms for witchcraft (abirifo; bayi/bonsam okomfo) and (3) the priest (bosomfo okomfo) who has a knowledge of herbs, charms for witchcraft, and is the attendant of a god (bosom). Nature is revered by these people, but it is also used to man's satisfaction.' <sup id="cite_ref-423" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-423">[423]</a></sup> 'When an Ashanti falls ill, and the sickness does not yield to the ordinary household remedies (really household magic), or cannot be diagnosed, it then becomes necessary to call in a doctor. The doctor, as we have already seen, may be either what we should call a general practitioner, or a specialist. The Ashanti word for the former is Sumanni (pl. Sumankwafo), or sometimes Oduruyefo, and for the latter Bonsam 'Komfo. The exact derivation of these terms is interesting. Sumanni is just one who deals in suman, i. e. charms. If we studied his methods superficially, we should say he was a herbalist, and so he is, in so far as he works with leaves and roots and plants; but there is this great difference-his medicines are not efficacious because of their antitoxic properties, but because of their magic properties. The disease, for which he sets out to prescribe, is itself caused by superhuman agencies, and can only be cured by similar counter-measures. [Page 148] It is spirit acting upon spirit, not antitoxin upon toxin. There are many allied diseases in the spiritual pharmacopoeia, with all of which the sumankwafo are capable of dealing. There is one, however, which he cannot treat, the most dreaded scourge in Africa, a malady which I suppose it is no exaggeration to state has taken toll of tens of thousands of lives-i.e. witchcraft. Against this disease the Ashanti calls in the specialist, the Bonsam 'Komfo. Now okomfo is really a priest, one upon whom akom (possession) may come, and Bonsam is a male witch. I have already dealt with the craft of witch-doctors, or white witches, or whatever we may decide to call them, and we have seen how an analysis of their title explains the source of their inspirations, for these are men who have learned to use and control black magic in order to defeat black magic. As a general rule their methods of treatment are indirect, for they strive to cure the patient by stamping out the cause of the disease at its source, i. e. the discovery and exposure and killing of the witch. This quest, as we shall see presently, does not end with the death of the doctors' patient, for this ‘priest of the powers of evil’ will even call the spirit of the dead man, whom he has been unable to cure, to help him in his search for the murderer.' <sup id="cite_ref-424" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-424">[424]</a></sup>//'A man or woman who is ill may also consult a priest of one of the many abosom (gods) as to the nature, cause, and probable ending of his sickness, and in many cases is informed by the god, through the medium of its mouthpiece the priest, that ‘ samanfo ye fwe fwe wo’ (‘the spirits of your ancestors are seeking for you’). This affords us a further clue as to another possible source of sickness and death.' <sup id="cite_ref-425" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-425">[425]</a></sup>//'Townspeople come and ‘drink the medicine’ at a cost of about a shilling a head and as many fowls as need be. The candidate for protection must cut the throat of a fowl and fling the dying bird before the shrine. If the bird dies breast upwards the gift is accepted by the god: if the back is upwards the gift is rejected and the candidate is not approved by the god. The rejected suppliant then publicly confesses a few sins and tries again. He repeats this till his gift is accepted. He then drinks the ‘medicine’-which consists of water ceremonially treated by the priest-sometimes takes a herbal bath or is marked on the face with spots of white clay, and is then secure against witchcraft, bad medicine, theft and adulterous intrigue. Any one who tries to bewitch him, harm him magically, rob him or entice away his wife will be ‘caught by the medicine’. He himself must practise neither witchcraft, bad medicine, theft nor adultery or he too will be ‘caught’. Any one so ‘caught’ is smitten with sickness: if he confesses quickly and is taken to the shrine and cleansed, he recovers; if not, he dies.' <sup id="cite_ref-426" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-426">[426]</a></sup>//'Many a morning does the word go round a town, ‘The medicine has caught somebody’, and the victim is carried to the shrine. Often this victim is a thorough-going neurotic, more often than not he has a rankling guilt-complex and is greatly benefited, if not cured, by confession. Often an astonishing tale of misdemeanours emerges. Nearly always venereal disease is somewhere at the bottom of the tales of marital unhappiness, envy and neurosis.' <sup id="cite_ref-427" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-427">[427]</a></sup>//'Workers of ‘bad medicine’ are also often ‘caught by the medicine’. I have seen at the shrines amazing collections of apparatus ( suman) handed over by penitents. These include suman designed to cause other peoples' death, to cause accidents with cutlasses, hoes and motor-lorries, to ‘suck away’ others' money and enrich the suman-owner, to cause others' wives to leave them and to make others unsuccessful in obtaining wives.' <sup id="cite_ref-428" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-428">[428]</a></sup>//'The shrines are thus the resort of mental patients in every stage of unbalance. Sometimes reports of their dramatic behaviour are circulated outside. District Officers and other Europeans are prone to put the cart before the horse and accuse the ‘fetish’ of ‘having a bad effect on people’. For instance, one woman patient on her way home from a shrine, committed an indecent act which would have surprised no one familiar with any of the standard works on psychopathology, but which, coming to official ears, was described as an ‘indecent ceremony’ and assumed to be part of the unwholesome ritual of the ‘fetish’. In actual fact the shrine-keepers themselves are quite as much shocked by indecorous behaviour as any European could be-in many cases more so. I recall a shrine-keeper whom I found one day anxiously purifying his shrine and his whole village with sacrifices because a woman patient had subjected him to the same fantastically indecent insult, identical in all its details, which Professor Jung, as he relates, once suffered at the hands of a woman patient. The Professor was, however, less horrified than was the shrine-keeper.' <sup id="cite_ref-429" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-429">[429]</a></sup>//'We now turn to individual protection by “medicines”. Akropong students have written: “Some protective ‘medicines’ may be in the form of black powder injected into the body through vaccination or ‘drunk into the body’ with water. It is believed that these ‘medicines’ make your blood bitter so that no witch cares to taste it. For infants, the powder is put into a cream and the child's body is painted with it about twice a day”. “Some of the powder is mixed with palm wine and drunk”. “The black powder is filled into little bags or bottles carried on the body or round the neck”, “tied into a handkerchief and put under the beds and pillows”. “Medicated or herbal water is used for bathing in order to make the flesh bitter and nasty to the taste”. “Small cuttings, in groups of three or five, are made on all the joints and the ‘medicines’ are rubbed in, thus making one bold to withstand the witches”. “Powder mixed with oil is smeared on the body of a sick person”. Universal powders are generally sold by the anti-witchcraft doctors or medicine men, but one need not necessarily be a specialist in witchcraft in order to do so; they are just “house medicines” like cough syrups. The marks of the cutting for “vaccination” against witchcraft can be seen on many people on the wrist, while little bottles containing the powders can be seen hanging round the necks of many children. They are not only used against witchcraft, but for other “medical” reasons, and there are many different kinds of black powders (boto).' <sup id="cite_ref-430" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-430">[430]</a></sup>//'Powders can be used to protect communities as well as individuals: “A whole community is protected through the bosomfoo (priest of a tutelar spirit) who may place some ‘medicine’ upstream of the water supply of the town. As both witches and non-witches drink from the same stream, they all come under the control of the cult, and a practising witch will be checked from the start”. This type belongs to the anti-witchcraft shrines.' <sup id="cite_ref-431" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-431">[431]</a></sup>//'The idea of some of these medicines is “to drive out witchcraft by witchcraft”, e.g. a Ewe one, made from the feathers of a bird which was really a transformed witch: “Some people catch ‘witchcraft’, burn it and prepare medicine with it. Anyone who is injected with this medicine gains immunity from witch attack. When the ‘agent of witchcraft’ is caught, in the form of a bird or in any other guise, he is killed and the witch dies”. Rev. Spieth tells of a Ewe medicine made from seven torches, seven shells, a black fowl, a small pot of palm wine and a toad. This is smeared over the patient's body, making it slippery and magically immune to witchcraft. It would seem to be a method of healing the patient from witchcraft possession.' <sup id="cite_ref-432" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-432">[432]</a></sup>//'In another case the reason for acquiring a new tutelar spirit was the illness of a chief which could not be cured by the local priests. This typical case has been well described by catechist J. P. Atiemo in the Christian Messenger of 1909. The local priests, instead of being killed for failing to cure the chief, as would have happened in the old days, before “the knife was lost” (i.e. the old customs prohibited by the Government), proclaimed that [Page 110] “their obosom had told them the town was full of witches and that they should therefore obtain ‘a medicine’ against them”. Messengers were sent to Nkoranza for permission to bring the “Barakune” or “Witchkiller” (Okum abayifo) shrine into town. (Sometimes a chief even applied to the District Commissioners “for a road pass for his fetish man in Car No. XX travelling to Bole”, because the chief said “I am sending this man to bring me something very necessary for my town's welfare”, or “to wash away the evil fate in the state”.)' <sup id="cite_ref-433" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-433">[433]</a></sup>//'The week's festivities being over, the time had come when Barakune could at last enter K. Each one had to go individually to the person carrying the “medicine”. He would be told: “I bring you Kune” to which he had to answer: “I receive him and drink his medicine”.' <sup id="cite_ref-434" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-434">[434]</a></sup>//'This old ceremony of “drinking obosom”, falsely translated as “drinking fetish” is “a potion drunk when swearing an oath of allegiance or mutual fidelity” (Christaller) attested for since the earliest times of contact between Europeans and Africans in Ghana. This drinking of medicine at anti-witchcraft shrines, also arises from the ancient healing practices of imbibing medicated water and is some sort of an ordeal. By drinking the medicine the person is brought into close contact with the anti-witchspirit, and the medicine is then “in him”; if he were doing evil or practising witchcraft, the “medicine” or the spirit would “catch him”.' <sup id="cite_ref-435" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-435">[435]</a></sup>//'These potions were, and are of varied composition. According to Rev. Lädrach, that of Aberewa consisted of “an evil smelling concoction of rats, snakes, mice, lizards, spiders, kola nuts, pepper, herbs, bark, etc.”, and also contained “blood of sacrificed fowls and sheep.

People suddenly falling ill might realize that they had sinned against a taboo or were “caught” because they had attacked somebody who was protected by a shrine. Or perhaps a local shrine, acting as a sort of “general practitioner” might tell them that such and such a spirit had caught them. Only then may they consult the anti-witchcraft shrine concerned. A student described the “catching” as follows: “When a person is a witch, Tigare's priest overhears it. He possesses a magic padlock, strengthened with blood, which he holds in his hand. He murmurs the name of the suspected witch three or seven times and ‘locks her up’ with the key. The person so padlocked in spirit becomes fever stricken…if the suspect has been a Tigare adherent, he is at once hurried to the shrine…”.' <sup id="cite_ref-437" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-437">[437]</a></sup>//'A full confession must always precede the healing. The methods of the shrines for the curing of incipient witches and the driving away of witchspirits, are basically the same as those applied by herbalists specializing in the combating of witchcraft, who are frequently invoked by people believing themselves to be forced against their will into becoming witches.' <sup id="cite_ref-438" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-438">[438]</a></sup>//'This neurotic state of fear is much more difficult to cure than the full blown witch state, and in severe cases can even produce hysteric blindness and lameness.

At midnight he had to proceed in utter darkness to the town rubbish heap, and bath in the water. This had to be done on seven consecutive nights, the climax of the treatment coming when the anti-witchcraft doctor tore off the person's cloth and burned it, all tendency towards witchcraft in the patient thus being destroyed. A new cloth was then given to him, and two fowls were sacrificed and shared by patient and anti-witchcraft doctor in a hearty meal of rejoicing.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ ♥</b> Anti-witchcraft shrine-related cults: <b>This ritual is awaiting an expert check to decide whether it should be coded here or not</b>.Exorcism of witch spirits before the Kune shrine; Healing and possession rituals are also described in the colonial-era sources, but some sources maintain that these practices were a response to the colonial encounter rather than an element of 'traditional' Akan practice. We have therefore decided not to code for these in the pre-Ashanti period. We have nevertheless included some descriptive paragraphs, in case a pre-colonial predecessor can be identified: 'A spirit may take possession of a man and he may appear to have gone mad, and this state may last sometimes even for a year. Then the priest of some powerful god may be consulted and he may discover, through his god, that it is some spirit which has come upon the man (or woman). The one upon whom the spirit has come is now bidden to prepare a brass pan, and collect water, leaves, and ‘medicine’ of specific kinds. The possessed one will dance, for sometimes two days, with short intervals for rest, to the accompaniment of drums and singing. Quite suddenly he will leap into the air and catch something in both his hands (or he may plunge into the river and emerge holding something he has brought up). He will in either case fold this thing to his breast, and water will be at once sprinkled upon it to cool it, when it will be thrust into the brass pan and quickly covered up. The following ingredients are now prepared: clay from one of the more sacred rivers, like the Tano, and the following medicinal plants and other objects: afema [Justicia flavia], Dama Bo [Abras precatorius]; the bark of the odom, a creeper called hamakyem, leaves and bark of a tree called domine, another creeper called hamakyerehene, any root that crosses a path, a projecting stump in a path over which passers-by would be likely to trip, also roots and stumps from under water, the leaves of a tree called aya-those are chosen which are seen to be quivering on the tree even though no wind is shaking them-the leaves, bark, and roots of a tree called Bonsam dua (lit. the wizard's tree), a nugget of virgin gold (gold that has been in use or circulation must not be used), a bodom (so called aggrey bead), and a long white bead called gyanie. The whole of these are pounded and placed in the pan, along with the original object already inside, while the following incantation or prayer is repeated: [...] ‘Supreme Being, upon whom men lean and do not fall, (whose day of observance is a Saturday). Earth Goddess, (whose day of worship is a Thursday), Leopard, and all beasts and plants of the forest, to-day is a sacred Friday; and you, Ta Kwesi (the particular god for whom in this case the shrine was being prepared), we are installing you, we are setting you (here), that we may have long life; do not let us get “Death”; do not let us become impotent; life to the head of this village; life to the young men of this village; life to those who bear children, and life to the children of this village. ‘O tree, we call Odum Abena, (to whom belongs the silk cotton tree), we are all calling upon you that you may come, one and all, just now, that we may place in this shrine the thoughts that are in our heads. ‘When we call upon you in the darkness, when we call upon you in the sunlight, and say, “Do such a thing for us”, you will do so. ‘And the laws that we are decreeing for you, you, this god [Page 149] of ours, are these-if in our time, or in our children's, and our grandchildren's time a king should arise from somewhere, and come to us, and say he is going to war, when he tells you, and you well know that should he go to the fight he will not gain the victory, you must tell us so; and should you know that he will go and conquer, then also state that truth. ‘And yet again, if a man be ill in the night, or in the daytime, and we raise you aloft and place you upon the head, and we inquire of you saying, “Is So-and-so about to die?”, let the cause of the misfortune which you tell him has come upon him be the real cause of the evil and not lies. ‘To-day, we all in this town, all our elders, and all our children, have consulted together and agreed without dissent among us, we have all united and with one accord decided to establish your shrine, you, Ta Kwesi, upon this, a sacred Friday. ‘We have taken a sheep, and a fowl, we have taken wine, we are about to give them to you that you may reside in this town and preserve its life. From this day, and so on to any future day, you must not fly and leave us. From this day, to any future day, you, O Tano's fire, in anything that you tell us, do not let it be a lie. Do not put water in your mouth and speak to us. To-day you become a god for the chief, to-day you have become a god for our spirit ancestors. Perhaps upon some to-morrow the Ashanti King may come and say, “My child So-and-so (or it may be an elder) is sick”, and ask you to go with him, or may be he will send a messenger here for you; in such a case you may go and we will not think that you are fleeing from us. And these words are a voice from the mouth of us all.’ <sup id="cite_ref-441" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-441">[441]</a></sup>//'The various sacrifices are then made, and in each case the blood is allowed to fall upon the contents in the brass pan.' <sup id="cite_ref-442" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-442">[442]</a></sup>//'I have had many similar accounts of the consecration of a new shrine as the temporary home of a new manifestation of a spirit universal and always present, but not subject to control.' <sup id="cite_ref-443" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-443">[443]</a></sup>//'When he first started behaving strangely no one could decide whether he was mad or whether “an obosom wanted to come”, though it seems certain that the strange behaviour came in fits and starts. He often flung off his clothes, strode about naked and staring and made attempts to run to bush. Sometimes he seized hold of a passing sheep, cut its throat, carried the carcase to the abonsam stone, and came back, remaining quite mute the while. On recovery from the attacks he remembered nothing of his actions and was startled when told of them. In some of his attacks he would career wildly up and down the town, gibbering an unintelligible “language”. Sometimes he had ten or a dozen attacks in one day: he told me, “It hardly left me alone long enough to let me eat.” He was taken to all the country's most famous oracles and medicine-men for diagnosis and treatment and cost his kinsmen, in all, about £300 before one medicine-man diagnosed “a very strong obosom, too big for us to control” and recommended a visit to the shrine at Mframaso. This was made. The old priest of Mframa was then alive and he not only endorsed the diagnosis but undertook to keep the youth under his care, train him and, after training, help him to set up in practice in Nsuso. The old priest accepted nothing for his training, board and lodging, but said he could pay off his debt when he started to work.' <sup id="cite_ref-444" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-444">[444]</a></sup>//'At the shrine the possessed priest questions the supplicant as he does those who complain simply of physical sickness, and if he elicits family strife and anxiety he advises concerning it. If the supplicant is on good terms with his wife, he usually brings her with him. If she is absent the priest asks why. A goldsmith whose wife had refused to come with him was told, after answering leading questions about her, “She is the cause of your plight. Leave her and take a better woman.” When the supplicant is paranoid and says, “People envy me and want to keep me down”, or, “Please kill the person who is doing this to me”, or, “Witches have caused people to dislike me”, the priest usually falls into step, diagnoses witchcraft or bad medicine and gives a reassuring promise of protection. He makes no identification of the witch or medicine-maker, but simply says, “The cause is among your own kinsmen”, or, “There are witches in your house.”' <sup id="cite_ref-445" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-445">[445]</a></sup>//'Most commonly the deity diagnoses witchcraft. The witches have stolen away the supplicant's womb or penis-that is the spiritual counterpart of the organ-and have either eaten it (in which case there is no hope) or broken it in pieces, or hidden it in a river. The supplicant is told to lay his need before the deity, make a sacrifice to the river in which the damaged organ is hidden, and the deity will do his best to repair and restore it. Sometimes the sufferer is told that no evil has been at work: his childlessness is “from God” and is his destiny ( nkrabea). Occasionally, but not often, the supplicant is told to carry out some unusual ritual, such as bringing the obosom a live cat-fish, or a live cat or a doll whose calico wrapping is taken into the sanctuary for special rites: it is then hoped that the obosom will intercede with his father, the Supreme God, and get the supplicant's destiny changed.' <sup id="cite_ref-446" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-446">[446]</a></sup>//'When a supplicant comes asking for the deity's protection the priest usually finds out first whether this is simply a prudent precaution-an insurance policy, as it were-or whether the supplicant is in specific anxiety. When the supplicant offers a cow or any more valuable gift than the usual sheep in return for a year's protection, he is certain to be unusually worried. If the supplicant comes alone he is asked why the husband or wife is absent. The questioning technique is the same as that [Page 123] The questioning technique is the same as that employed in investigating anxiety-begotten illnesses and the same kind of fears are laid bare. Where there is family or marital disharmony and suspicion the supplicant usually fears that the adversary will employ bad medicine against him. The priest generally discovers who started any such dispute and if the supplicant himself is at fault he is told he will get protection conditionally on making amends.' <sup id="cite_ref-447" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-447">[447]</a></sup>//'Workers of ‘bad medicine’ are also often ‘caught by the medicine’. I have seen at the shrines amazing collections of apparatus ( suman) handed over by penitents. These include suman designed to cause other peoples' death, to cause accidents with cutlasses, hoes and motor-lorries, to ‘suck away’ others' money and enrich the suman-owner, to cause others' wives to leave them and to make others unsuccessful in obtaining wives.' <sup id="cite_ref-448" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-448">[448]</a></sup>//'The shrines are thus the resort of mental patients in every stage of unbalance. Sometimes reports of their dramatic behaviour are circulated outside. District Officers and other Europeans are prone to put the cart before the horse and accuse the ‘fetish’ of ‘having a bad effect on people’. For instance, one woman patient on her way home from a shrine, committed an indecent act which would have surprised no one familiar with any of the standard works on psychopathology, but which, coming to official ears, was described as an ‘indecent ceremony’ and assumed to be part of the unwholesome ritual of the ‘fetish’. In actual fact the shrine-keepers themselves are quite as much shocked by indecorous behaviour as any European could be-in many cases more so. I recall a shrine-keeper whom I found one day anxiously purifying his shrine and his whole village with sacrifices because a woman patient had subjected him to the same fantastically indecent insult, identical in all its details, which Professor Jung, as he relates, once suffered at the hands of a woman patient. The Professor was, however, less horrified than was the shrine-keeper.' <sup id="cite_ref-449" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-449">[449]</a></sup>//'The week's festivities being over, the time had come when Barakune could at last enter K.

A student described the “catching” as follows: “When a person is a witch, Tigare's priest overhears it. He possesses a magic padlock, strengthened with blood, which he holds in his hand.

'Anyone considering himself “caught” by a spirit, may have to travel up to a hundred miles to that spirit's main shrine. In order to reach it safely, he pours rum on the ground to appease the spirit, and at the shrine he will have to wait for its special week-day. On that day the priest will be a holy person and no one is allowed to shake his hands. (He has to abstain sexually the night before.) The priest will enter the temple and fall into a trance, in order that the spirit may speak through him ( cp. Plate 24). This may be in a sort of pidgin-Twi (the spirits are often connected with Northern Ghana where this is the form of speech) or it may be completely unintelligible and is often accompanied by a quivering of the mouth and jaws. The person “caught” will then come forward, give his name and state what he has done. He is then questioned until the whole story has been told. The “spirit”, therefore, acts as a sort of court dealing with witchcraft cases theft, adultery, broken taboos, and cases of oath (when the fetish had been invoked as a witness in an argument). The invoking of the fetish is considered a great sin. Confessing witches may name people they have killed or made barren and these names are taken down. They often maintain [Page 126] they have “eaten” their own child. In order that their witch-spirits may lose their power, they may then reveal their secret names, and sing their “witch-song”. They must hand over the objects in which the witch-spirit was supposedly kept-beads, towels, pots, stools, cloth, etc., and at this moment the assembled crowd will sometimes mock triumphantly. At one particular shrine the priest sometimes tells the accursed to show the palm of his hand, from which he pretends to be able to read his guilt. Thieves are either made to return the money they have stolen to the defrauded person, or the priest will himself accept the money and return it to its owner. In addition, the culprit has to pay one or two “sheep” to the shrine for its services (fifteen to thirty shillings. A real sheep, of course, costs much more.). Not all cases are settled at once-some are dismissed, others require further evidence, etc., and those which do not fit into the preconceived pattern of witchcraft belief are rejected as idle tales. The atmosphere at shrines is often psychologically impressive and suggestive, since some of the shrines are far away, and well off the main road. One priest even had a private road constructed to the outskirts of his town, eight miles from the main road. Lorries were not allowed to enter the town itself, and, therefore, the last two hundred yards had to be done on foot. He installed electricity in the town, but as the spirit “told him that he did not like it”, the generator was not used.' <sup id="cite_ref-471" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-471">[471]</a></sup>//'What happens if a witch has been “caught” by a shrine and has “confessed”? At one time witches were killed, but this has been stopped by the Government, and now the shrines attempt to heal witches or to drive away their witch-spirit. A priest told me: “I cure the witches by water treatment. First an egg is broken over the head of the witch after her confession, then she is thrice sprinkled with medicated water. The recipe of this medicine is my secret”. This is how Mr. Akesson describes the exorcism of witch spirits before the Kune shrine, in his manuscript “Gold Coast Fetishism Explained”: “After a victim's confessions have been heard and his sacrifice of a fowl has been accepted by the fetish, a day is fixed for the final exorcism. The linguist mixes red clay with water and brings with it an old sweeping broom. The victim sits in front of the male fetish. The linguist dips the broom into the liquid and gently strikes the top of the victim's head three times saying: ‘Yeyi wo bayie’ (we drive out your witchspirit). In the same [Page 127] manner, the face and the joints of the victim are struck thrice daily. After this the victim is asked to stand facing his house or town. The linguist then holds the neck and pushes him to give him a start to run away to his house without looking behind. As he runs away, the spectators hoot at him at the top of their voices until the victim has disappeared. This done, the patches of hair on his head are cut off for him by one of the fetish servants”. A full confession must always precede the healing. The methods of the shrines for the curing of incipient witches and the driving away of witchspirits, are basically the same as those applied by herbalists specializing in the combating of witchcraft, who are frequently invoked by people believing themselves to be forced against their will into becoming witches. This neurotic state of fear is much more difficult to cure than the full blown witch state, and in severe cases can even produce hysteric blindness and lameness. One herbalist said: “you become sick and shrink”. His treatment consisted of giving his patient some medicine to put into a bucket of water.

The fee for this treatment he said to be seven pounds, seven shillings and seven pence. The witches only punishment nowadays consists of fines, and public exposure to mockery and ridicule. Witches caught by some shrines are shamed by being made to dance in public. It is said that witchcraft carries no stigma, and although members of the clan may press the victim to confess, in general a victim nowadays is kindly treated after confession and not maltreated for practising witchcraft. From my research however, I get the impression that while this may be true in some cases, witchcraft on the whole carries with it a social stigma. A witch who has been found out may not be maltreated, but he or she is certainly despised and ostracised, which is a much more severe punishment than the imposition of fines. When witches have been “cured” by a shrine, the protection of the shrine does not provide them with an enhanced social status, although anybody worrying them might “get into trouble with the shrine”.' <sup id="cite_ref-472" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-472">[472]</a></sup>//'In out of the way places, dances are performed which culminate in direct “discovery” of witches. A District Commissioner told me that he was afflicted by sunstroke when visiting a village in the Goaso region. The priest of the local shrine tried to appease the tutelar spirit of the town, which the D.C. was supposed to have offended. The priest worked himself into an ecstatic, almost epileptic trance turning round and round with a foaming mouth, whipping the drummers when they tried to relax.

Moral pressure is brought to bear upon the psychic weaklings of society and so a continual supply of self-confessed “poisoners” and “witches” is always available. After the drinking of the medicine some people even die-the number of these seems to have been considerable in the times of the Aberewa cult. It was even said that “she had been sent down to earth to protect men and to prolong their lives, but finding so many evildoers, she was greatly incensed and destroyed indiscriminately rich and poor, young and old alike. It was even said that Aberewa dispatched to eternity more people than those poisoned and killed by all sorcerers and witches whose power she came to abolish”.

When the request had been explained to the spirit whose attention had been attracted by the knocking and the beating of the dawuta, the attendant sitting near the basket passed one of the very small fowls, which could only have been a few days old, to the other squatting attendant who had stopped beating his tattoo. He then made a slit in the throat of the chicken from the beak to the breast, allowed some of the blood to drop on the alter-like block, and then threw the chicken on to the cemented area, while everybody watched the death struggle of the tiny animal.

Furthermore, the relatives had to give a “thank offering” to the priests, because the spirit had delivered them from grave danger threatening them through their evil relative. No customary funeral was allowed, the corpse having to be disposed of in a shamefaced way.

Frequently the setting up of such a shrine will necessitate several journeys to the north. Permission from chiefs there and from a special office of the Asantehene (Paramount Chief of Ashanti) is required.

But longer and closer observation by many missionaries, has led to the discovery that tribal paganism and superstition, have as many heads as the hydra serpent of classical mythology. The introduction to an old missionary pamphlet on the notorious anti-witchcraft shrine of Aberewa says: “as new heads grew up as soon as one of the old ones was cut off, so paganism produces time and again new forms, even when you think it to be almost conquered”. (1) So thought the missionary. On the other hand, the anthropologist who had a more positive attitude to paganism, was thrilled by the observation of the same fact which seemed to him like “an entirely new and growing system…to meet the new needs”, (2) and on the rise of the new anti-witchcraft shrines he comments: “It is quite certain that a vigorous countertide is surging through the great mass of the population and its chiefs. Spontaneously, inarticulately, and without knowledge of what they are doing, they are re-establishing many features of a long abandoned type of organization”. (3) By this, the author (Miss Field) means the old agricultural society as still evidenced in Northern Ghana [Page 106] where life and organization were centred on the worship of nature-spirits.' <sup id="cite_ref-485" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-485">[485]</a></sup>//'These anti-witchcraft shrines are the most active aspect of paganism in Ghana today, and claim to provide the answer to the new needs which we will now discuss.' <sup id="cite_ref-486" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-486">[486]</a></sup>//'This possibility has been open at all times, and set the pattern for a later increase of the neurosis of witchcraft belief. It seems that in the past-before 1850-the witches were comparatively few, and no major danger to the society, which knew quite well how to cope with them in traditional ways. This still is the case in Northern Ghana if we are to believe Dr. Meyer-Fortes who has made a very thorough study of the Talensi, a tribe from that area. It is more difficult to prove the assumption that witchcraft played a smaller role in the past in Akan society, but it is noticeable that only one author before 1850 mentions the witches, whilst all others are completely silent on the subject. Witches in the past could easily be appeased by putting a small amount of meat on sticks at the entrance of towns. In this way the neurotics had the satisfaction of being socially recognized and feared, and therefore became more manageable for society. In more severe cases, antisocial elements were dealt with by ordinary justice by the elders and chiefs, in consultation with the priests of the tutelar spirits. In still more difficult cases or where the authority of a court was not in itself strong, there were various ordeals to find the guilty person-the thief, adulterer, murderer, poisoner or witch. Each death and disaster could be explained either by referring it to Nyame as a death of destiny, or by attributing it to the neglect of duty towards the tutelar spirits, the ancestors, the ntoro or the life soul, or to the evil activity of murderers, poisoners, criminals, workers of bad magic and witches. We shall describe these ordeals in a later chapter.

Dr. Tooth is right in remarking: “It must be remembered that it is less than fifty years since the Gold Coast was freed from the constant threat of internal warfare. The effect of the removal of the insecurity due to personal danger must alone be considerable, but any individual benefit is probably offset by the breaking up of the communities which owed their existence to the competition of arms, and the need for organised self-defence…the behaviour of the mass of the people is still [Page 66] best explained in terms of a release from the artificial restrictions imposed by the state of the country fifty years ago, coupled with a strong natural curiosity”.' <sup id="cite_ref-488" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-488">[488]</a></sup>//'Society reacts against the new false “ideal” of the “big man” by imputing witchcraft to rich people. It has been observed in the past, that witch hunting was one of the means by which chiefs and communities were able to check the power of wealthy people. “Big men” were tracked down as witches and forced to pay heavy fines. This destroyed the exaggerated respect paid to them, and diminished their wealth, whilst at the same time, the chief obtained much needed money. (155) The recent witch-hunting of a pseudo-prophet was welcomed by chiefs of the region concerned for that very reason, as I personally observed.

<dd>'All these elements contributed to form one of the main causes of the increase in witchcraft belief, and the decline in morality, for example, bribery. As Miss Field says: “Not only did the Cocoa industry bring an increase in witchcraft but also an increase in plain ordinary stealing. Both Cocoa and the money paid out by the cocoa buyers to the small farmer are often stolen. The police and all the tribunals know quite well that the cocoa season is the season of maximum crime. Though a part of this crime can be laid at the door of liquor, on which much of the money is spent, a great part is simple theft. The influx of strangers for cocoa trading, and mining has also increased the tendency of women to be unfaithful to their husbands”. (164) This is true not only of the cocoa growing areas, but also for the non-cocoa growing areas, where the men are often absent for weeks if not months, far away on their cocoa farms, leaving the women at home. This militates against stability. What has been said for cases of Cewa witchcraft (the Cewas are a Bantu tribe in South Africa) is therefore equally true of Akan witchcraft: “We may ultimately trace all witchcraft cases described above to conflict between European and Cewa value premises-especially those regarding the nature of property ownership”.' <sup id="cite_ref-491" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-491">[491]</a></sup>//'This is another helpful line of approach, though very isolated and one which is nowadays almost out of date. Its use is suggested in the notes collected by Rev. Lochmann. In discussing disease, he states that “a fetishman may tell you the reasons for it-either the life-soul went away…or the life-soul is sick…or you may be told that you took leave of God correctly, but that a mischievous enemy hindered you from getting what you should have got, according to your leave taking; go therefore and cut yourself a Nyame dua (God's tree) and put it at the entrance of your yard, kill a fowl and besmear his wings with blood, hang them on the Nyame dua and pray thus to Nyame: that you may get that which you have chosen from God, in your leave-taking”.' <sup id="cite_ref-492" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-492">[492]</a></sup>//'A student wrote: “A little bit of raw meat or other food is frequently put at the entrance of a village for the witches to eat. This offering also frequently takes the form of a bunch of palm nuts pinned to the ground with a stick” ( cp. Plate 15). “Another way of appeasing the witch is to make an ohoni, a kind of effigy, meant to represent a sick person, which is put at the outskirts of the town for the spirit or witch supposed to be troubling the person. Before it you put some meat, e.g. the leg or shoulder of a sheep on a long pole”. This practice, though once very common, is rarely seen nowadays. Here is another story of witch-appeasing, as told by a student: “Some time ago a child saw a witch spouting fire while sitting on a tree behind his parents' house. The child took the fancy to go there and throw a stone at the tree. At once the fire was quenched and a naked woman stood before him. She looked silently at the child and went up the tree again. The next morning the child was full of deadly sores. Medicine after medicine was given to the child, but the sores did not heal, until at last they asked the child what had happened. Being told, the parents of the child fetched various things: a bathing sponge, eggs, soap, and ten shillings for the witch to ask her forgiveness. When the woman had taken these things, the sores at once died away and the child recovered”. It would seem [Page 90] that the matter was solved peacefully and the psychic conflict in the child's soul was settled in an empirical psychiatric way. Two people were helped, the guilt-complex was taken from the child and the frustration complex from the “witch”, who now saw herself in a somewhat respected and feared position. In this instance belief in witchcraft can be said to be an impetus to retrieve the balance of social relations, and fulfil a valuable social function. This is very marked among the Azande, according to Dr. Evans-Pritchard. “Belief in witchcraft”, he writes, “is a valuable corrective to uncharitable impulses, because a show of spleen, meanness or hostility may bring serious consequences in its train. Since Azande do not know who are witches and who are not, they assume all their neighbours to be so, and are therefore careful not to offend any of them without good cause. The notion works in two ways. Firstly, a jealous man may be suspected of witchcraft by those of whom he is jealous, and will seek to avoid suspicion by curbing his jealousy, and secondly, those of whom he is jealous may be witches and may seek to injure him in return for his enmity, therefore he will curb his jealousy from fear of being bewitched”' <sup id="cite_ref-493" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-493">[493]</a></sup>//'In order to protect the fields, the sheep are often fenced in. In order to protect a town magically, there are various methods of spiritual “fencing in”. Some anti-witchcraft shrines, e.g. Kankamea, have a “holy area” marked off by a chain which is thought to keep out any evil thinking person. Similarly, a town may be protected by “spiritually isolating it against witches” with a wire drawn round it, as I have seen in Nzima. Another such magic fence is the pampim, “a low fence or obstruction over the foot-path near a town or village, to prevent the entrance of evil spirits”.' <sup id="cite_ref-494" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-494">[494]</a></sup>//'We now turn to individual protection by “medicines”. Akropong students have written: “Some protective ‘medicines’ may be in the form of black powder injected into the body through vaccination or ‘drunk into the body’ with water. It is believed that these ‘medicines’ make your blood bitter so that no witch cares to taste it. For infants, the powder is put into a cream and the child's body is painted with it about twice a day”. “Some of the powder is mixed with palm wine and drunk”. “The black powder is filled into little bags or bottles carried on the body or round the neck”, “tied into a handkerchief and put under the beds and pillows”. “Medicated or herbal water is used for bathing in order to make the flesh bitter and nasty to the taste”. “Small cuttings, in groups of three or five, are made on all the joints and the ‘medicines’ are rubbed in, thus making one bold to withstand the witches”. “Powder mixed with oil is smeared on the body of a sick person”. Universal powders are generally sold by the anti-witchcraft doctors or medicine men, but one need not necessarily be a specialist in witchcraft in order to do so; they are just “house medicines” like cough syrups. The marks of the cutting for “vaccination” against witchcraft can be seen on many people on the wrist, while little bottles containing the powders can be seen hanging round the necks of many children. They are not only used against witchcraft, but for other “medical” reasons, and there are many different kinds of black powders (boto).' <sup id="cite_ref-495" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-495">[495]</a></sup>//'Powders can be used to protect communities as well as individuals: “A whole community is protected through the bosomfoo (priest of a tutelar spirit) who may place some ‘medicine’ upstream of the water supply of the town. As both witches and non-witches drink from the same stream, they all come under the control of the cult, and a practising witch will be checked from the start”. This type belongs to the anti-witchcraft shrines.' <sup id="cite_ref-496" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-496">[496]</a></sup>//'Among the Akan, witches are at times “fumigated away”; “In a house where there is a babe or a sick person supposed to be under the influence of witches, scented gum (caked latex of a particular tree called ohe) is burned in a small broken earthenware pot which is put at the gate, or, when going to bed, at the door leading to the room. This ohe burns slowly and gives off a scented smoke that permeates the whole house, both within and without. It is believed that this scented smell drives away all witches and so wards off any diabolical visiting” (statement from a student). Such fumigating, with ricinus leaves and sharp pepper is common among the Adangmes. (15) The story of Tobias shows us that the Jews used to believe that demons could be driven away by smoke. (16) As Europeans we may well think that such fumigations disinfect rooms and drive away malaria carrying mosquitoes! The idea of some of these medicines is “to drive out witchcraft by witchcraft”, e.g. a Ewe one, made from the feathers of a bird which was really a transformed witch: “Some people catch ‘witchcraft’, burn it and prepare medicine with it. Anyone who is injected with this medicine gains immunity from witch attack. When the ‘agent of witchcraft’ is caught, in the form of a bird or in any other guise, he is killed and the witch dies”. Rev. Spieth tells of a Ewe medicine made from seven torches, seven shells, a black fowl, a small pot of palm wine and a toad. This is smeared over the patient's body, making it slippery and magically immune to witchcraft. It would seem to be a method of healing the patient from witchcraft possession.' <sup id="cite_ref-497" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-497">[497]</a></sup>//'Charms are often dispensed by the priests of shrines. The Moslem sebe or abansere charms are the most prevalent: they consist of verses from the Koran and Arabic magic formulae sewn into leather. Students describe anti-witchcraft charms thus: “They are rings on the finger, sebe, beads, arm rings”. “These things must always be worn and carried about. The people who invented them are the Northern Territories people and the Togolanders. Some are hung at the gates of houses and doors so that evil doers may not approach. All these things work spiritually” ( cp. Plate 16). [...] The old Ashanti charm Kunkuma and others are still used, but those from the north are thought to be more efficient. There are two reasons for this: Firstly, objects, medicines and charms from far away are always considered to be more efficient. Secondly, the tribes of the Northerners are still more compact and not under the same mental stress as the Southerners and therefore there is more psychic vigour and less fear of the witches in the north. Why? The African answers: “Because their charms are better”.' <sup id="cite_ref-498" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-498">[498]</a></sup>//'The very same belief was affirmed to me by an anti-witchcraft doctor when I asked him whether the famous tutelar spirit Akonnedi of Larteh could offer protection against witches. “How could he?” was the answer, “the witches serve as his lanterns when he goes on trips at night”. This somewhat curious connection of witches and tutelar spirits may represent a relic of very ancient beliefs, where light phenomena were not associated with witchcraft. There are, however, several ancient abosom who engaged in witch-fighting. These are the shrines of the region round Wenchi in Northern Ashanti among the Brongs.' <sup id="cite_ref-499" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-499">[499]</a></sup>//'In the past, the ordinary methods of protection by charms and powders described above seem to have sufficed to deal with the witches. There was even a certain antagonism in some cases between the charms and the more aristocratic shrines of tutelar spirits. (23) Hence the anti-witchdoctors could affirm: “the abosom were never consulted for the discovery of bayi (witchcraft), because it was recognised that they would not tell, ‘being afraid of bayi which was more powerful than they’. When I am under the possession of Sasabonsam, a priest will address me as father”.' <sup id="cite_ref-500" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-500">[500]</a></sup>//'This seems to be another instance of a pre-Akan religion. Local abosom may be conscious of their duty to protect against witchcraft, but, being of the town and related to many townspeople, the priests would find it too risky to make accusations of witchcraft among their relatives. In the terms of witchcraft belief, this is expressed by a student: “So great is the witches' connection with base and evil spirits that they can do very little good but much evil. If there is an obosom in the town which does not allow them to do all they want, they kill his obosom by putting its filthy taboos into the kunkuma (the pot serving as shrine) at the obosom's grove”.' <sup id="cite_ref-501" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-501">[501]</a></sup>//'And here is another version of the same psychological fact from a different angle recorded by another student: “The tutelar spirits have dominion over their people in town. So they can prevent the wizards from attacking or preying on their subjects, except with permission. So if anybody wants to be free of the pangs of witches and wizards, he should pay homage to the abosom who will protect him. The priests act as the interpreters of the abosom and at times they receive bribes from the witches and allow them to carry off some unfortunate people. So most priests have power to catch witches on active service. But when a priest is becoming somewhat too hostile toward the witches, they form a strong company and try to overthrow him spiritually. So early deaths of some priests are ascribed to the work of the witches”.' <sup id="cite_ref-502" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-502">[502]</a></sup>//'People nowadays, seldom, if ever, have recourse to the traditional shrines for protection. Dr. Field has rightly remarked that “interest in the archaic, nature-worshipping religion is now disorganized, fragmentary and not bound up with the social organization. Their mediums are usually very old persons…and where a deity fails to possess a medium at all, it is a clear indication that no one is interested in that deity”. Thus the tutelar spirits were not able to cope with the new rise of witchcraft-they were, as we have seen, “driven away by the guns, the church bells and the telephone wires”. Where the tutelar spirits of the old type still function in witchcraft cases, they do so as sort of “general practitioners” and send those they suspect afflicted by witchcraft to the “specialists”-the new shrines of the anti-witchcraft type to be described later. In the past, they could use for their diagnosis the string-oracle called “ntonto-bo”, the drawing of lots. (26) Rev. Jost brought such an oracle home to Switzerland from Brofoyedru in Asen and presented it to the Historical museum of Berne (27) ( cp. Plate 19).' <sup id="cite_ref-503" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-503">[503]</a></sup>//'In order to find out the guilty person, African justice in the past often resorted to trial by ordeals. In this way thieves, murderers, taboo-breakers and witches were “found out”. Space prevents me from describing these ordeals at length. There were a number of minor ones. The suspects were made to chew dry rice and those who could not swallow it were declared guilty. Medicine men were alleged to possess black powder with which they could make a witch glow or even burn, if they rubbed it on his forehead. After the application of a counter-medicine, the witch would confess. The Gas used some special medicated eyewater which would blind the guilty ones and leave the innocent unharmed. (31) More serious was the ordeal with boiling oil, into which the suspect was to hold his hand. (32) This ordeal was surrounded by an elaborate [Page 102] ritual. Even more fearful was the poison ordeal, where a concoction of the bark of the Odom ( not Odum) tree was drunk by the suspect. Fainting and loss of consciousness were taken as proof of guilt. (33) Such poison ordeals are common all over Africa. (34)The most important Ghana ordeal was the so called “carrying of the corpse”. The dead body of a person who had died a strange death was carried by either two or four men. (Sometimes some objects represented the actual body.) The “corpse” was asked questions and answered “yes” or “no” by the way it “made the carriers sway or knock forward”. In this way the corpse could knock against the guilty person.' <sup id="cite_ref-504" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-504">[504]</a></sup>//'What happened if an ordeal had designated somebody as a real or “spiritual” murderer, poisoner or witch? The proverb says: “the corpse which is going to knock against someone cares nothing for cries of sorrow”. n olden days a person found guilty by the poison ordeal was caught by the feet, dragged through the scrub and over stones till his body was torn to pieces and he died. This was the procedure among the Gas. Among the Ashantis, a witch's blood may not be shed. She was, therefore, strangled to death, or drowned, or clubbed, or smeared all over with palm oil and cast into a fire. Another method of punishment has also been described by Captain Rattray: “A self confessed witch used to have a firebrand placed in her hand before being expelled from the village. A message was sent to the next village, from which she would also be driven and so on. This punishment really amounted to the death penalty”. Among the Brongs at Boundoukou, the person found guilty was clubbed to death in the forest and his body was just thrown into the bush and not buried-a terrible punishment, if one knows how important for the after life correct burial is esteemed among the pagan. (38) Among the Nkonya (a Guang tribe) the punishment was death by burning, or the payment of a ransom to the value of seven slaves. (39) Among the Agni, the punishment for witchcraft was decapitation. Until a century ago, the person convicted of witchcraft was almost always put to death by torture as Bowdich attests. This was really just a ceremonial form of lynching.' <sup id="cite_ref-505" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-505">[505]</a></sup>//'A long heartbreaking account of such an execution witnessed by Rev. Mader, dated 29th October, 1856, is preserved in the Archives of the Mission House in Basel. Space prevents me from quoting the well-written report in full. Rev. Mader describes how the asafo (war companies of young men) danced through Akropong in a drunken frenzy. The corpse of a deceased person had knocked at somebody. The Asafo went and pulled down this “accursed house”, and rushed on the person indicted, wounding him with their cutlasses and clubs, and torturing him terribly for three hours-frantically dancing up and down the town hitting the miserable wretch every time they passed him. At last he was decapitated. The skull was to be buried at the feet of the person he was supposed to have killed, and afterwards to be fixed on a war drum. The right hand and the fingers of the left were also cut off, but Rev. Mader did not find out what became of them. The body was not buried, but just thrown into the bush. After the Colonial Government had stopped this lynching, another form of punishment became more frequent: it was that of telling or expecting the person found guilty to commit suicide. (42) The same Rev. Mader reports another case of “carrying the corpse”, where the “guilty person” was a mother of eight children. Through fear of the government-since two soldiers happened to be in town-she was not lynched but socially ostracized. Everybody avoided her. Her relatives told her to take courage and kill herself. She even went to see the paramount chief to ask for her death, but was refused-again for fear of the Government. She was then taken into custody in the house of an elder. There the constant mockery so distressed her, that she finally asked permission to fetch firewood in the bush and there she hanged herself. Another way of avoiding the wrath of the Government was by killing the “guilty person” secretly. This was done in a town near Anamabou, where the person indicated by the ordeal of “carrying the corpse” was secretly drowned in the sea. It took the authorities fourteen years to discover it! This happened about one hundred years ago and the whole procedure has been described at length by the British officer Brodie Cruickshank.' <sup id="cite_ref-506" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-506">[506]</a></sup>//'In the past, persons thus found guilty of “murder” were either killed, or sold into slavery. (45) The property of the person executed, or forced to suicide on account of an ordeal, or of his being a witch, went to the chief. The relatives, however, could ask the chief for forgiveness and were given part of the goods of the executed [Page 104] person. (46) Since the Government has abolished all this elaborate trial by ordeal and summary punishment, what reaction follows? Similar interference of Governmental authorities in the Sudan made Dr. Evans-Pritchard, write that it brought about “vagueness and confusion”. (47) The same can be said of the Akan. However cruel the old system may look to us today, it maintained some order. Guilty persons were found-it did not matter whether they always really were guilty or not-and the system gave a certain sense of security. This was destroyed by the Government, which, of course, only wanted to prevent cruelty and could not do otherwise than prohibit such customs. The feeling of insecurity which resulted has been reported from the mouth of a Ghana Chief by Mary Kingsley: “A chief complained to me of the way the Government, in the districts under its surveillance, were preserving vermin in the shape of witches. You were no longer allowed to destroy them as of old, and therefore the vermin were destroying the game for, he said, ‘the witches here live almost entirely on the blood they suck from children at night. They used in the old days, to do this furtively…but in districts where the Government says that witchcraft is utter nonsense, and killing its proficients is utter murder which will be dealt with accordingly, the witch flourishes exceedingly, and blackmails the fathers and mothers of families, threatening that if they are not bought off, they will have their child's blood; and if they are not paid, the child dies away gradually…” (48)' <sup id="cite_ref-507" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-507">[507]</a></sup>//'At one particular shrine the priest sometimes tells the accursed to show the palm of his hand, from which he pretends to be able to read his guilt. Thieves are either made to return the money they have stolen to the defrauded person, or the priest will himself accept the money and return it to its owner. In addition, the culprit has to pay one or two “sheep” to the shrine for its services (fifteen to thirty shillings. A real sheep, of course, costs much more.). Not all cases are settled at once-some are dismissed, others require further evidence, etc., and those which do not fit into the preconceived pattern of witchcraft belief are rejected as idle tales. The atmosphere at shrines is often psychologically impressive and suggestive, since some of the shrines are far away, and well off the main road. One priest even had a private road constructed to the outskirts of his town, eight miles from the main road. Lorries were not allowed to enter the town itself, and, therefore, the last two hundred yards had to be done on foot. He installed electricity in the town, but as the spirit “told him that he did not like it”, the generator was not used.' <sup id="cite_ref-508" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-508">[508]</a></sup>//'What happens if a witch has been “caught” by a shrine and has “confessed”? At one time witches were killed, but this has been stopped by the Government, and now the shrines attempt to heal witches or to drive away their witch-spirit. A priest told me: “I cure the witches by water treatment. First an egg is broken over the head of the witch after her confession, then she is thrice sprinkled with medicated water. The recipe of this medicine is my secret”. This is how Mr. Akesson describes the exorcism of witch spirits before the Kune shrine, in his manuscript “Gold Coast Fetishism Explained”: “After a victim's confessions have been heard and his sacrifice of a fowl has been accepted by the fetish, a day is fixed for the final exorcism. The linguist mixes red clay with water and brings with it an old sweeping broom. The victim sits in front of the male fetish. The linguist dips the broom into the liquid and gently strikes the top of the victim's head three times saying: ‘Yeyi wo bayie’ (we drive out your witchspirit). In the same [Page 127] manner, the face and the joints of the victim are struck thrice daily. After this the victim is asked to stand facing his house or town. The linguist then holds the neck and pushes him to give him a start to run away to his house without looking behind. As he runs away, the spectators hoot at him at the top of their voices until the victim has disappeared. This done, the patches of hair on his head are cut off for him by one of the fetish servants”.' <sup id="cite_ref-509" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-509">[509]</a></sup></dd>

</p><p>Note: Writing about the Ashanti period, Arhin describes the power hierarchy from the village upwards: 'Female stools complemented the hierarchy of male stools. In the village the elders, mpanyinfo, heads of the matrilineages, who constituted with the odekro the village council, had their aberewa or obaapanyin, who looked after the women's affairs. The odekro had an obaapanyin who was responsible for the affairs of the women of the village and was a member of the village council; the ohene, head of a division, and the omanhene, head of the autonomous political community, had their female counterparts known as ohemma, female ruler, who sat on their councils. The ohene and the ohemma were all of the same mogya, blood, or clan. The Asantehemma, the occupant of the female stool of the Kumasi state, and therefore of united Asante, since her male counterpart was ex officio the Asantehene, king of Asante, was a member of the Kotoko council, the executive committee or cabinet of the Asanteman Nhyiamu, general assembly of Asante rulers.' <sup id="cite_ref-510" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-510">[510]</a></sup> Major and minor chiefs were also summoned to council: 'Where the paramount King of a state summons the Head-Chiefs of provinces and chiefs of minor communities to attend a State Council, it is the privilege of the Councillors of the several communities composing the State, according to their rank and importance, to accompany their several Heads to the capital and to join in the “palaver,” or discussion, that will take place, the King in person presiding over the deliberations, supported by his own Councillors and principal Linguists. This is the full Parliament of the people, who are thus fully and duly represented in every way from the highest to the lowest. The commands which go forth from this assembly are binding upon every individual family of the entire State, from the most important province to the most insignificant hamlet, and the sanction operates equally upon all.' <sup id="cite_ref-511" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-511">[511]</a></sup> The attribution of concrete entities to a particular executive level is not always clear. On the executive level it therefore seems best to go with the stool system: 'Every Asante village was a microcosm of the Asante economic, social, and political universe. Its population included both rulers and ruled, both “owners” of the land with the right of succession to the local, divisional, and state stools and free men grouped in other lineages with corporate interests in other political offices.' <sup id="cite_ref-512" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-512">[512]</a></sup> In the pre-Ashanti period, this hierarchy probably culminated in the rulers of regional Akan states.
</p><p>However, by making this assumption we might distort historical realities. While some Akan states were politically autonomous, others paid tribute to other polities after having been conquered by Akan competitors. Accordingly, histories of conquest and military expansion predate Ashanti rule over Ghana: 'Akan states, historical complex of gold-producing forest states in western Africa lying between the Comoé and Volta rivers (in an area roughly corresponding to the coastal lands of the modern republics of Togo, Ghana, and, in part, Côte d’Ivoire). Their economic, political, and social systems were transformed from the 16th to the 18th century by trade with Europeans on the coast. Of the northern Akan (or Brong) states the earliest (established c. 1450) was Bono; of the southern the most important were Denkyera, Akwamu, Fante (Fanti), and Asante.' <sup id="cite_ref-513" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-513">[513]</a></sup> 'Denkyera, also spelled Denkyira, major 17th-century kingdom of the southern Akan peoples, situated in the forested hinterland of modern Ghana’s southwestern coast. According to tradition, its kings migrated from the area of the northern Akan or Brong. By the end of the 17th century they had subjugated the Twifo and the Akan subjects of Axim (to the south), had taken over the rich gold-bearing districts of Wassaw and Aowin (to the west), and had established their dominion over Elmina Castle—the wealthiest market on the Gold Coast.' <sup id="cite_ref-514" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-514">[514]</a></sup> 'The desire to control the major extractive areas of the gold-mining industry brought Denkyera into conflict with the Asante, against whom it waged a series of ultimately unsuccessful wars between 1699 and 1701. After Denkyera’s final defeat, many chiefs recognized the authority of the Asante king Osei Tutu—by whom they were incorporated into the Kumasi division of his kingdom—while others, moving south of Denkyera’s ancient capital Abankeseso, retained their national identity but acknowledged the Asante’s overlordship. See also Akan states.' <sup id="cite_ref-515" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-515">[515]</a></sup> Meyerowitz provides the following summary: 'The history of Ghana can be divided into four distinct periods; the first from roughly A.D. 1000 to 1500, the second from about 1500 to 1701, the third from 1701 to 1901, and the fourth from 1901 (when the country became a British colony known as the Gold Coast) to independence in 1957.' <sup id="cite_ref-516" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-516">[516]</a></sup> 'The history of Ghana is the history of the Twi-speaking peoples who now call themselves Akan — a name which originally denoted one group only. Before that time they were known as Gbon; this name has been forgotten, but the fact may be inferred from the names of several states which they founded after their earlier kingdom in the Niger bend, Dyala, had been destroyed about A.D. 1000 by Islamised Saharan Berbers.' <sup id="cite_ref-517" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-517">[517]</a></sup> 'States founded in Ghana and surrounding regions at that time were Gonja (the modern name for Gbon-Dya), north of the Black Volta where the river flows from west to east. Close by on the other side of the White Volta (a confluent of the Black Volta) emigrants from Gonja founded the Dagbon (Dya-Gbon) kingdom. To the north of Gonja, Gbon with a Dya royal clan, founded the first Bono (descendants of Gbon) kingdom in the triangle formed by the White and Red Volta rivers, ‘in Mossi’, a kingdom which existed already in about A. D. 1000.' <sup id="cite_ref-518" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-518">[518]</a></sup> 'Adjacent to Bono ‘in Mossi’ in the west was the Djomo (Dya-Mo) kingdom founded by Adiaka Fante, a branch of the Akan. To the south-west of Dya-Mo on the other side of the Black Volta where the river flows from north to south, Gbon with a Dya royal clan, founded the Bona (descendants of Gbon) kingdom and at a later date another branch of the Gbon founded the Bonda (Gbon-Dva) kingdom to the north of Bona. Further to the west Gbon founded Kpon(g) in the Upper Volta region (Kpon is a variant of Gbon). Kpong, two centuries later, became the capital of the Kumbu kingdom, the original home of the Akan proper. To the north was the kingdom of the Twi-speaking Anyi whose royal clan was related to that of Bono and Bona; and to the far west of Kpong lay the kingdom of a branch of Fante whose name is no longer remembered.' <sup id="cite_ref-519" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-519">[519]</a></sup> 'In the course of centuries refugees and emigrants from all these kingdoms came and settled (up to about 1600) mostly in the second Bono kingdom which had been founded about 1300 south of Gonja by refugees from the first Bono kingdom ‘in Mossi’. Bono's capital Bono-Manso soon developed into a great and [Page 6] important town owing to its trade, especially the gold trade with the Sudan. Bono being underpopulated welcomed ‘brothers’ from other regions at all times. The brothers' were attracted by the country's prosperity, which grew until its end in 1722-3' <sup id="cite_ref-520" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-520">[520]</a></sup> 'In the middle of the fourteenth century, a number of people emigrated from Bono, among them Fante, Eguafo, Afutu and Dyabi who eventually founded a number of small states on the central coast among the Etsi who, like the Bono, were Dya-Gbon people from the Niger bend. Contact between the Bono and the coastal people was maintained by means of the north-south road. This was, in fact, no more than a path through still primaeval forest leading from Bono-Manso to Eguafo and from there to the coastal towns; hunters who had set up their camps along this road gave food and shelter to the travellers passing through. A century later this road became of the greatest importance after two events inaugurated the second period of Ghana's history.' <sup id="cite_ref-521" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-521">[521]</a></sup> 'Shortly before 1500 the Portuguese discovered the coastal people and, attracted by their gold omaments, returned ten years later to build Elmina Castle on Eguafo territory for trading purposes. At the same time in the 1470s, the Bonda kingdom was conquered by Anyi and the Kumbu kingdom ceased to exist after its conquest by the Songhay. Many refugees went in search of new homes, and having heard in Bono-Manso of the trade activities of the Portuguese on the coast, some of the more enterprising Bonda and Kumbu people went south and were able to settle at strategic points. The queenmother Asiriba of Bonda and followers occupied the region along the central part of the north-south road where her successor founded the Akyerekyere kingdom to the south of Bono. Its capital Fomase soon became the clearing house for goods from the coast, mostly of Portuguese origin one may assume, and goods from Bono and various parts of the Sudan.' <sup id="cite_ref-522" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-522">[522]</a></sup> 'On the other hand, a prince of the former Kumbu royal house who had gone to Bono-Manso gathered a number of young men around him there, marched south, and drove out the Wasa (of Fante origin) from their eastern territory ‘behind Eguafo’, and founded there the Akumu-Akoto kingdom. Its capital Kum-Kunso was situated roughly thirty miles to the north of Elmina Castle. Whereas the Bonda dominated the north-south trade road, the ‘Acanes’ as the Portuguese called the Akumu-Akoto, dominated the old trade road from Eguafo to Begho, the capital of Banda, neighbouring Bono in the west. It had been founded by Dyala peoples who had settled first in Mande, mostly Kara and Kamara Dyula. From Begho the [Page 7] trade road led directly to Mande towns and the Niger bend.' <sup id="cite_ref-523" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-523">[523]</a></sup> 'Other ‘Acanes’ founded Akyim ‘Great Akan’ bordering on Akyerekyere in the east, and about A.D. 1550 emigrants from Akumu-Akoto founded Akwamu on Akyim lands in the east.

About fifty years later a civil war broke out which destroyed the town and some of the homeless survivors founded city states to the north-east of Kumasi. The Denkyira invaded at once the Asantemanso-Kumasi region and the new city states and ruled its inhabitants mercilessly until, in 1701, under the able leadership of Osei Tutu, the Asantemanso people rebelled and defeated the Denkyira. After this victory they founded the Asanteman, or Ashanti kingdom with its capital Kumasi, and incorporated most of the vassal states of Denkyira. Thus from its inception Ashanti was a powerful state. In 1723, as a result of its defeat of Bono, the whole savannah region between the forest and the Black Volta river came under the suzerainty of Ashanti. Thus the third period in Ghana's history began with the foundation of Ashanti and ended with its defeat by the British in 1901.' <sup id="cite_ref-526" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-526">[526]</a></sup> Accordingly, the pre-Ashanti history of the Akan states may have been more complex than our usual inference approach allows for.
</p><p>Some examples of pre-Ashanti Akan states: NKYIRAA: 'The Nkyiraa either no longer remember where their ancestors came from or do not wish to have it known. They arrived in Bono in the middle of the seventeenth century (they had three chiefs before 1700) and were people of the Asona clan who spoke ‘Blong’, a Brong dialect of the type where sentences often start with me daa—‘I say’. Their leaders were Atia Yaw and the queenmother, or headwoman, Twumwaa. Legend has it that they ‘came out of the hill Botene’, one mile from the present Tekyiman, together with Anyima-Asine people and Djomo. As they were numerous they soon spread as far as Taakoti, another hill near Tekyiman, and founded Taakotiso there. Others, among them Atia Yaw and his people, went northwards and founded Boso about six miles from the present Nkyiraa.' <sup id="cite_ref-527" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-527">[527]</a></sup> 'After some time Atia Yaw and his group separated from the Anyima-Asine, Asine clan people called Anyima after their chief, and founded a few miles away Wurobo-Buem; the chief of the Djomo carried the fire before them when they came ‘out of the ground’.' <sup id="cite_ref-528" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-528">[528]</a></sup> 'Wurobo-Buem soon attracted people and developed into a big place; Atia Yaw as chief of the Nkyiraa and Djomo took the title Ohene, king, Ntakera. He was succeeded by Kwaku Amforo; in the reign of his successor Boyi Akwatia the ‘Nkoranza-Nafana war broke out, that is the Bono-Nafana war after the destruction of Beeo-Nsoko. Neither Nkoranza nor Banda (the Nafana state) existed at this time. In the Nkiyraa tradition ‘Nkoranza’ took the place of the forgotten Bono-Manso and ‘Banda’, the place of the Nafana who at a later date were to found the Banda state. The Bono must have drafted the Nkyiraa as well as the Anyima-Asine into their shock troops for both suffered enormous casualties.

There they came ‘out of a hole’—it was actually a cave in a great, big boss of sandstone with a narrow slit above an entrance which is now hidden. In [Page 58] a tiny village, Adunyede, not far from ‘the hole’ lives the descendant of the original priest chief to whom the land belonged, and who still performs the custom for the rock, the home of the ancient god Obotin Kwamena. 2 When they emerged the Nkyiraa settled not far away at Hurubera.' <sup id="cite_ref-530" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-530">[530]</a></sup> 'In Boyi Akwatia's reign a Nkyiraa princess was given in marriage to the Bonohene Kyereme Pambuo, the predecessor of the last king of Bono, Ameyaw Kwaakye. Their son was Boyemprisi who was to contribute so much to the downfall of Bono. He was called Boyemprisi because at the time of his birth, Kwaku Nyame, a well-known royal hunter (he once caught an elephant alive) had discovered caves ‘in the stomach of a rock’ (hence ‘Boyem’), the source of the rock being sacred to the god Mprisi.

After the war, believing that the gods of the priest-chiefs had been instrumental in the victory and afraid to leave them at the disposal of the Tekyimanhene, Osei Bonsu annexed the seven towns to serve Ashanti directly and Nkyiraa was one of them. As the Asantehene had been especially impressed by Kwaku Asabere, Nkyiraahene and priest of the god Kukuro, he offered him the post of Sumankwahene in Kumasi, to protect him against evil spirits and witchcraft. Kwaku Asabere accepted and was succeeded at Nkyiraa by his brother Tabiri Kwaku and, in Kumasi, by his son Kwasi Dumde at a later date.

According to Eguafo traditional beliefs, they moved south, accompanied by Dyabi and Evalue, and settled for a time in dense forest in what is now the Twifo-Prasu region.

They also married contrary to custom, so that their son could succeed who, in turn, married the queenmother, a princess of the Asona clan. Succession in the royal lineage can thus be regarded as patrilineal for succession was from father to son; on the other hand the kings [Page 77] came alternately in each generation from the Asona and Anona clans, so the matrilineal clan organization, it is believed, remained undisturbed.

The so-called Xarife's road ran right through her country, apart from its southem part, which was in the hands of her ally the Asebu, or Sabu, as the Portuguese called them. These people had conquered the Etsi towns along this road (which continued the road through Asebu from the coast) and the Aberem people who lived to the north of Etsi. The Portuguese called their kingdom Aberemu and its king also received gifts. At Prasu (the modern name), or near by, the Pra river had to be crossed to get into Asiriba's domain.

[Page 88] Wandering southwards they stopped, before reaching the sea, at Akerakurom, an Etsi town, and seeing that the Etsi spoke a language resembling Bono Twi, ‘but a bit lighter’, the immigrants built their town Mankesim next to the Etsi's town on the northern side.' <sup id="cite_ref-553" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-553">[553]</a></sup> 'After a time a quarrel arose between the Asona, Djomo and Anana people and the Fante, which resulted in the emigration of the Fante chief Kwanza who took the majority of his people and founded Ekumfi south of Mankesim on the sea. Shortly after most of those remaining at Mankesim also left when they discovered that their region was swampy and unhealthy. The Asona and Djomo, going deeper into Etsi country, founded Gomoaman-Djomo-na-man—which means ‘Djomo descendants' state’. 4 The capital Apam was built next to a Ga fishing village and the Etsi town Akeran (Akron on European maps).' <sup id="cite_ref-554" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-554">[554]</a></sup> 'The Anana clan people, led by Enoo, on the other hand, settled further west of Ekumfi about a mile east of the Etsi town Egya.

Enoo married an Etsi princess by name Nkadias Nkyigyase. 6 Intermarriage between the Anana and the Etsi must have been the rule, since a praise name for the Anomabu people at gatherings is to this day ‘Nsuano Etsi’, or ‘Etsi by the water’.

At Eguafo, however, the Fante invasion led by chief Abu Takyi who made himself king is remembered with horror. He was an evil and selfish ruler who killed people mercilessly and, to enrich himself, engaged in slave trading with the Dutch. Finally the Eguafo helped by the Portuguese at Elmina Castle drove out the Fante and captured Abu Takyi who was ‘deported’ by the Portuguese as a ‘slave’. 8 The remnants of his people, it appears, moved on to Anomabu and the two adjacent Fante states—Abuka and Ekumfi—where they established the ‘Fantijn kingdom’ mentioned on the map of 1629.' <sup id="cite_ref-556" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-556">[556]</a></sup> 'As far as I know no tradition exists which says that these conquering Fante [Page 89] came from either the Mossi region, Gonja or Bono, so that taking various factors into account, they may have come from the same kingdom in the Ivory Coast (suggested by the name Takyi) from where the ancestors of Takyi, or Takyi Firi, the founder of Tekyiman came. It is possible that they were the warriors who are said to have brought royal Fante women and children to safety in Bono-Manso from an area threatened by war (probably the upheavals caused by the Moorish invasion of the Niger bend in the 1590s).

The reason for this misunderstanding [Page 128] is, no doubt, that Ewurade Basa succeeded by virtue of being a son of the Akyerekyere king Asare Minten; however, at a time when there was no legitimate heir. A similar situation arose previously at the death of the queenmother Asiriba Gyehenewa, the founder of the state, and the succession passed to a son of her husband, the co-founder.

It came to an end in 1730 when Kyibi rebelled and assisted by allies, defeated and ousted the Akwamu.' <sup id="cite_ref-600" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-600">[600]</a></sup> 'Today there are three Akyim states, apart from the Akyim-Abuakwa, Akyim-Kotoko and Akyim-Bosome. All these states are said by Reindorf (1964:95) and others to have fought in the war against Akwamu which is correct, but as we know from the traditions of the last-named two states they did not exist at that time in Akyim which is never pointed out; Kotoko was still a state in Kwahu and so was the ancestral state of the Akyim-Bosome people called Bokuruwa Nkatia.' <sup id="cite_ref-601" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-601">[601]</a></sup> 'The historical background of these two Kwahu states is as follows: Okyere, co-ruler and heir-apparent of the Denkyirahene (most likely Boadu Akafo Berempon) was rejected as king after the latter's death. Feeling, no doubt, humiliated, he emigrated together with his brother Amponsem and others who had supported his cause. They went to Mmeraem in Adanse where they lived for some years, but when a war between Adanse and Akyim-Fosu broke out, they refused to fight on behalf of Adanse and left. 5 Fighting their way through to Ahuren to join brothers, they met the Asamanhene Gyima, his brothers, sons and followers. They were likewise looking for a place of refuge, after their defeat by Nti Koko, ‘King of Lake Bosomtwi’, in the area between Ahantaase and Waase. ' <sup id="cite_ref-602" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-602">[602]</a></sup> 'Arrived at Ahuren, situated a few miles south east of Kumasi, the two princes were welcomed by their Agona clan brothers and given land on which Okyere, the former co-ruler, founded Amansu (Swedru) about five miles from Ahuren, while Amponsem founded the Oda quarter in Ahuren.' <sup id="cite_ref-603" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-603">[603]</a></sup> 'Some twenty years or so later, during the reign of the Denkyirahene Ntim Gyakari, a civil war broke out in Ahuren following an event during the funeral ceremonies for the Ahurenhene Oti Awere. The successors of the two Denkyira princes, Friempon Mansu and Osei Twum, left and settled at Kwahu. 8 After a few years Friempon Mansu made himself king at Dampong, the capital of the small but not unimportant Kotoko state. Osei Twum with his people went to Anweam in the Agogo region where he died. 9 His successor Kwaw Baadu moved a few miles further east and settled at Bokuruwa Nkatia. In 1710 the Akwamu attacked the various Kwahu peoples who became vassals of Akwamu, 10 but in 1730 they rebelled together with the Kyibi people and their allies, and the Akwamu suffered total defeat.' <sup id="cite_ref-604" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-604">[604]</a></sup> 'Not long after the Kotoku people were defeated by Opoku Ware and fled to Fosu in Asante-Akyim and from there went to Kyibi in the Akyim-Abuakwa state. 11 There they were given land on which they founded the Akyim-Kotoko state. The defeated Borukuwa-Nkwatia people fled at the time to Ankaase (the one on the Kumasi-Denkyira road?) but were driven out of there by the Ashanti in 1818. They also moved into the Akyim-Abuakwa state and were given land near Aduasa, on which they founded the small Akyim-Bosome state. Their descendants to this day pay as tribute to the chief of Aduasa parts of the profits from the land of Akyim-Bosome. 12 But they also have lands of their own, see M.J.

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from military ♣ absent ♥</b> The following refers to the Ashanti period. While the Ashanti infantry mostly consisted of citizen-soldiers who were not specialists in their own right, there was also a nucleus of armed professionals not disbanded during times of peace: 'The local government of Kumasi was in the hands of the Kwaintsirs, a body of men who were the keepers of the golden stool. They formed the Department of War, and the great General Amankwatsia was formerly their Chief. The fact that the Department of War held in its keeping the royal stool illustrates vividly the origin of the kingly office in the Native State, which will be explained later on.' <sup id="cite_ref-606" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-606">[606]</a></sup> During annual military drills, armed commoners gathered in the capital, where they paraded through the streets with specialists: 'Meanwhile the different regiments, under their several Head-Captains, and all commanded by the Captain-General, are preparing to go through their manoeuvres. To avoid disputes, the several regiments parade through the town one after the other, pouring forth thunderous volleys from their long flint Dane guns. After the parade each regiment presents to the King its flags and emblems, new and old, as an act of homage, which the King returns with suitable words. The several Head-Chiefs next renew their allegiance to the King; and, after more dancing and popular rejoicing, thè King retires to his “compound,” where his vassals subsequently take leave of him, each vassal receiving a suitable present.' <sup id="cite_ref-607" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-607">[607]</a></sup> The King was assisted in his military duties by secondary commanders and generals:'The King is the Chief Military Officer of his forces. In time of war, he directs the operations; and if he  is a man of capacity, he has the leading place in the councils of war. There is generally a Tufu Hin, or Captain-General, of the forces; but his authority is subordinate to that of the King, and he is, in every essential, an officer of the King.' <sup id="cite_ref-608" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-608">[608]</a></sup> Accordingly, executive power was not separate from the military. We have assumed the same to be broadly applicable to the pre-Ashanti period as well.</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from legislative ♣ absent ♥</b> Writing in the Ashanti period, Arhin describes the power hierarchy from the village upwards. Stool holders were present in council meetings with elders: 'Female stools complemented the hierarchy of male stools. In the village the elders, mpanyinfo, heads of the matrilineages, who constituted with the odekro the village council, had their aberewa or obaapanyin, who looked after the women's affairs. The odekro had an obaapanyin who was responsible for the affairs of the women of the village and was a member of the village council; the ohene, head of a division, and the omanhene, head of the autonomous political community, had their female counterparts known as ohemma, female ruler, who sat on their councils. The ohene and the ohemma were all of the same mogya, blood, or clan. The Asantehemma, the occupant of the female stool of the Kumasi state, and therefore of united Asante, since her male counterpart was ex officio the Asantehene, king of Asante, was a member of the Kotoko council, the executive committee or cabinet of the Asanteman Nhyiamu, general assembly of Asante rulers.' <sup id="cite_ref-609" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-609">[609]</a></sup> Major and minor chiefs were also summoned to council: 'Where the paramount King of a state summons the Head-Chiefs of provinces and chiefs of minor communities to attend a State Council, it is the privilege of the Councillors of the several communities composing the State, according to their rank and importance, to accompany their several Heads to the capital and to join in the “palaver,” or discussion, that will take place, the King in person presiding over the deliberations, supported by his own Councillors and principal Linguists. This is the full Parliament of the people, who are thus fully and duly represented in every way from the highest to the lowest. The commands which go forth from this assembly are binding upon every individual family of the entire State, from the most important province to the most insignificant hamlet, and the sanction operates equally upon all.' <sup id="cite_ref-610" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-610">[610]</a></sup> The attribution of concrete entities to a particular executive level is not always clear. On the executive level it therefore seems best to go with the stool system: 'Every Asante village was a microcosm of the Asante economic, social, and political universe. Its population included both rulers and ruled, both “owners” of the land with the right of succession to the local, divisional, and state stools and free men grouped in other lineages with corporate interests in other political offices.' <sup id="cite_ref-611" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-611">[611]</a></sup> Given how executive leaders held seats in councils, we have assumed that there was no separate legislative body in either time period.</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from judiciary ♣ absent ♥</b> SCCS variable 89 'Judiciary' is coded as 'Executive'. Executive leaders and elders, not full-time professional judges, presided over judicial proceedings: 'The initial processes applicable to civil, oath, accused or criminal summonses have already been described. In order to meet the clerical service required for these forms, there is attached to the important Tribunals a Registrar's office where summonses and all the other processes are taken. The Registrar has charge of the cause list and the Record Books. In Akim Abuakwa the tribunal sits for five days in the week, Wednesday being excluded by the “Awukudae” custom, and Sunday by the British connexion and other Christian influences. Sittings of Tribunal last for about 6 to 10 working hours each day, and the Omanhene, as responsible judge, is always expected to be present throughout the day's sitting. We have already described the constitution of the Tribunal as consisting of the Omanhene, his Linguists, his four principal Executive Chiefs, the Queen-Mother, the non-Stool owning Elders and Councillors (including in the latter term the Christian Elders and Presbyters). The Tribunal is summoned by the “Kantamanto” or “woni-mini” drum ( q.v.) and on the Omanhene taking his seat at the third beating of the drum, the Registrar proceeds to deal with his cause list.' <sup id="cite_ref-612" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-612">[612]</a></sup> Accordingly, there was no independent judiciary.</dd></dl>

<dd> <b>♠ Impeachment ♣ present ♥</b> Chiefs could be destooled when found incompetent or cruel: 'The Ashanti had a constitutional practice which ensured that the will of the people was given consideration. They had ultimately the constitutional right to destool a chief. As the fundamental principle was that only those who elected a chief could destool him, a destoolment required the consent of the elders. Sometimes they initiated a destoolment themselves when, for example, a chief repeatedly rejected their advice, or when he broke a taboo, or committed a sacrilegious act. The kind of offences for which chiefs were destooled may be gathered from the following instances of destoolments recounted in the traditional histories of the Divisions.' <sup id="cite_ref-613" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-613">[613]</a></sup> 'Chiefs Kwabena Aboagye of Asumegya, Kwabena Bruku, and Kwasi Ten of Nsuta were destooled for drunkenness; Kwame Asonane of Bekwai for being a glutton ( adidifurum); Kwame Asona, also of Bekwai, for dealing in charms and noxious medicines; and Akuamoa Panyin of Juaben for his abusive tongue, and [Page 22] for not following the advice of his elders. In Kokofu, Osei Yaw was destooled for being fond of disclosing the origin of his subjects (i.e. reproaching them with their slave ancestry), and Mensa Bonsu for excessive cruelty.' <sup id="cite_ref-614" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-614">[614]</a></sup> 'A chief was also destooled if he became blind, or impotent, or suffered from leprosy, madness, or fits, or if his body was maimed in a way that disfigured him.' <sup id="cite_ref-615" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-615">[615]</a></sup> According to Danquah, destoolments became more common in the colonial period: 'THE terms “enstoolment” and “destoolment” are used in the Gold Coast to indicate, as to enstoolment (1) the customary procedure of electing and installing a member of the stool family as Chief or King of the tribe or nation over which that stool rules, and, as to destoolment, (2) the converse procedure of deposing a reigning Chief or King from his former position as ruler. Owing to the importance attached to the hereditary position of Chief either as Odikro (Chief of a town), or Ohene (Chief of a sub-divisional state), there has (Paramount Chief of an independent state), there has been much litigation in recent times in connexion with disputes on the legality or otherwise of particular Enstoolments or Destoolments, and instances are not wanting of such disputes passing through the African and British Courts in the Colony to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in England.' <sup id="cite_ref-616" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-616">[616]</a></sup> 'Many are the causes which have given rise to such frequent disputes, but to examine such causes is not the object of this article, our purpose in writing which is more theoretical than practical. Enstoolment used to be a peaceful and dignified procedure. But the frequency of modern disputed elections has changed the peace and dignity which used to attend the ancient mode of making the best men of the tribe King or ruler.' <sup id="cite_ref-617" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-617">[617]</a></sup> 'Many political theorists versed in the craft have traced the cause of this frequent deposition of Chiefs to the effects of the Native Jurisdiction Ordinances. We are not prepared to deny or accept this view, but we are inclined to think that the present discontent among the mass of the people against the ruling houses must have one cause in the general administration of affairs, and another in the irreconciled differences existing between the old system of government and the form of government which seems to be demanded by the present generation. However much we may admire the Akan institutions, we should not be doing our duty for the effective maintenance of the best that should be preserved in our institutions were we to suffer both Ormuzd and Ahriman [Page 110] to grow strong together. Where an existing order leads to creation of disorder nothing but a reform of the former would lead to a cessation of the latter.' <sup id="cite_ref-618" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-618">[618]</a></sup> 'We are not, however, concerned in this treatise with debatable political considerations, and having stated a sufficient preamble for the present subject, we proceed to discuss it so far as present limitations will permit.' <sup id="cite_ref-619" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-619">[619]</a></sup> However, we have assumed that destoolment was possible in the pre-Ashanti period as well, at least in principle.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Customary mechanism ♣ ♥</b></dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Legal mechanism ♣ present ♥</b> The Ohemma played an important role in power transitions: 'As the abrewa, the ohemma was also custodian of ‘custom’. She was officially the foremost authority on the genealogy of the royal matrilineage, and hence the first and final arbiter on who was qualified by blood to be a male ruler; it was said of the ohemma's stool in relation to the male stool that it was the elder stool, akonnua panyin. It was the ohemma who played the leading role in the selection of a successor to a deceased or destooled (removed from office) ohene.' <sup id="cite_ref-620" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-620">[620]</a></sup> But popular consent was also required: 'If a Chief dies, or “goes to his village”, as the untoward incident is euphemistically described, it remains for the family, after the first funeral obsequies to name a successor to the stool. There are usually in every town, about two or three divisions, or “houses” in the ruling Royal family. It does not rest with any one of these “houses” to say whose turn it is to ascend the stool. It is the will of the people which determines what particular member of the Family taken as a whole is most fit to ascend the stool and to rule over them. The question of the choice of a stool candidate by the materfamilias, which will be explained later, is purely a formal ceremony chiefly dependent upon the people's will. For if the initial selection were the absolute privilege of any individual member of the family, no town or tribal stool would be worthy of the name. It is necessary to remember that the people's allegiance to stools are not as subjects of an absolute monarchy, but as citizens of a more or less democratic country, and were it that they had to accept any haphazard choice thrown upon them by the Head of the Royal Family, the popular veto would seem a shadowy thing. We do not say this to disparage the authority of the Heads of families, we say it to demonstrate the principle that the selection by the female head derives its source from the popular will, and this will is always easily known.' <sup id="cite_ref-621" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-621">[621]</a></sup> Male members of royal matrilineages were eligible for succession: 'In the case of succession to Stool, be it family, town, tribal, or divisional, either a brother (we speak solely of the female line) or a nephew, an uncle, or a grand-uncle, a cousin or an adult member of the Royal Family, can be selected to succeed a dead or destooled Chief; for, no matter how far removed in blood he may be from the out-going Chief, so long as he belongs to the same recognized Royal Family, any member of the Stool family stands the good fortune of being elected. The mere fact of one being in the second or third house places [Page 111] no bar on one's right to ascend the stool. The same blue blood runs in the veins of any member of the family who can be proved to be a direct descendant in the female line of the known materfamilias. Every member of the Royal Family is, as it were, an heir-presumptive. Character and influence, then, are the determining factors. That stool heir must be fortunate who is unsullied in character, influential withal, and respected by all.' <sup id="cite_ref-622" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-622">[622]</a></sup> 'However, if the heir-apparent—the eldest sister's eldest son—i.e. the nearest nephew—is of good age, of good repute or character as well as rich, there are but two things that stand between him and the stool. One is foul play. He must guard against being played out. The other danger is general or physical health and bodily accomplishments. He must be strong in body and have no personal and bodily defects. His weakness and bodily defects are enough grounds to destroy his candidature. In Akim Abuakwa, for instance, a circumcised person cannot ascend any stool, be it a cottage or town stool. The stools are considered sacred, and a stool aspirant who is circumcised has, by his own act, rendered himself ineligible to ascend a sacred Akan stool.' <sup id="cite_ref-623" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-623">[623]</a></sup> Danquah describes the process of selecting a successor: 'After the funeral obsequies of a Chief, or the final determination of the deposition of an unwanted Chief, all who must have a voice in the election of the new Chief assemble in the public place at the invitation of the Chief who is Regent ex-officio. Thereupon, the sub-Chiefs, Elders and Councillors of the town, together with the Captains of the Asafo companies, call upon the female head, or in her absence, the male head of the Royal Family, to name a person fit for the stool. The members of the Royal Family would then retire into council with a view to consult on the question of the proper person to be selected for the stool. The Head of the Family is, however, the moving spirit of the whole. On the return of the Head of the Royal Family with her people, she names a suitable candidate for the election. If the nominee is acceptable to the sub-Chiefs, Elders, and Councillors assembled, the name is submitted to the meeting, and the general approval of the Asafo or “Werempi” Company (of young men) obtained. If he is not acceptable, the Asafo or “Werempi” Company would signify their disapproval through their respective captains, and their opinion being in consonance with that of the sub-Chiefs, Elders, and Councillors, [Page 112] the Head of the Royal Family would have to make other suggestions until the proper candidate desired by the people would be nominated and accepted.' <sup id="cite_ref-624" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-624">[624]</a></sup> 'The accepted candidate is then taken hold of and beaten, as in a “rag”, he is powdered with white clay and carried on the shoulders by the Asafo or Werempi Company from one end of the town to the other, three times, amid an animated outburst of civic and war songs. After this impressive ceremony of public acclamation by the Asafo Company an “Aseda” money would be taken from the elected Chief when he had been made to sit on the election stool. The amount or value of “Aseda” taken on this occasion is calculated on the relative position of the Chief, and not on the Chief's wealth. Drinks are generally offered by the Chief to all the sub-Chiefs and people there and then assembled. Drumming goes on the whole time, and if there are any State paraphernalia they are brought out in the service of the new Chief.' <sup id="cite_ref-625" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-625">[625]</a></sup> 'But the elected is as yet little more than an ordinary member of the Royal Family. There remains the ceremony of swearing-in, and then the grander and more solemn ceremony of installation. The swearing-in may be done the same, or on the following day. All the minor Chiefs of the new Chief, the sub-Chiefs so-called, hasten to swear in a renewal of their allegiance to the stool, and then the new Chief would swear to them of his unswerving support and assistance to them in the administration of his dominion. The new Chief has also to swear allegiance to the representative of his superior Chief who must be present before any of the above ceremonies are gone through, and the representative would in turn swear on behalf of his over-lord, never to forsake him but to support and uphold him in the service of the country. This swearing to one's superior Chief's representative does not exonerate one from the obligation of swearing allegiance personally [Page 113] to the superior Chief. It is the very first thing to be observed on any proper occasion that such new Chief comes into the presence of his superior Chief. We may here state that in former times it was not the custom for a newly elected Opakani or Chief to make his appearance at the capital town until three years after his election and installation, when such principal Chief had to swear the Oath of Allegiance to the Paramount Stool. It is difficult to trace the reason for this custom, but its very impracticability in modern chieftaincy has gradually brought it into disuse. Probably it was to permit the newly elected chief to perform his own Odwiratuo, grand triennial festival, at the end of his third year, before coming to see his Paramount Chief.' <sup id="cite_ref-626" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-626">[626]</a></sup> 'In the Stool-house certain ceremonies are done. The new Chief is given his final initiation into the highest part of the great Order in the nation—the most solemn Order of the [Page 114] worship of ancient stools—and the highest honours that any member of the tribe can obtain are there and then poured on him. The impressive and recordable part of the initiation is that of holding the new Chief suspended three times over a black consecrated stool—the oldest and most famous of the collection—and declaring him lord and ruler of his dominions, by the direction and guidance of the spirits of his departed and august ancestors. The ceremony begins and ends with slaughter of sheep. Among other things the Chief who is being installed must observe that it is improper for him to bring his body in contact with the black consecration-stool on which he is thrice suspended, for it is regarded unlucky, and it is said that the unfortunate person who does so, stands the risk of weakening for ever his organs of reproduction. This assumption is based on the belief that the black consecration-stool is a living force, and that its spirit is so strong that actual contact with human beings is sure to produce disastrous results.' <sup id="cite_ref-627" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-627">[627]</a></sup> 'After this solemn ceremony the new Chief is worthy enough to regard himself as the most elevated person amongst his peers, and he is now endowed with the right and correlative duty to rule and govern his dominions with the advice and counsel of the members of the Administration.' <sup id="cite_ref-628" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-628">[628]</a></sup> We have assumed this to be broadly applicable to the pre-Ashanti period as well.</dd>

<p><b>♠ Private property (land) ♣ absent ♥</b> Society was organized in matrilineal clans: 'All Akan groups recognize matrilineal descent. The basic group is the clan, of which there are eight; they are dispersed among the many kingdoms. Members of a subclan tend to occupy a single town or village. The clan is an exogamous group. It is comprised of constituent groups that may be referred to as lineages, but these do not form any kind of segmentary lineage system, lineages being attached to others by propinquity and the power and wealth of the host lineage. Although there has been much confusion in accounts of the Akan peoples between matriliny and matriarchy, authority within clans and lineages is held firmly by men, succession being from a man to his brother or to his closest sister's son.' <sup id="cite_ref-645" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-645">[645]</a></sup> 'A child inherits his or her blood from the mother, and character or temperament from the father. Maternal blood ensures the child's membership in the ABUSUA (clan or lineage); paternity bestows membership in one of nine other groups or categories. Although some accounts claim the Akan descent system is one of double descent, this view appears to be based on a misreading of the actual roles of the two lines of descent. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-646" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-646">[646]</a></sup> 'There are groups in which membership is transmitted patrilineally, but these are neither exogamous nor corporate groups; nor are jural or political rights or duties derived from paternal descent. What is involved is the concept of NTORO; the male transmitted NTORO (spirit) which forms a unique spiritual bond between father and son. Following this principle, every person belongs to one of a limited number of named quasi-ritual categories, the ntoro divisions. Members of the same ntoro division are required to observe certain taboos, perform certain rituals, and are believed to have some common personality characteristics. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-647" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-647">[647]</a></sup> 'Consistent with the emphasis on matrilineal descent is the fact that the system of kinship terminology is of the Crow type. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-648" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-648">[648]</a></sup> Clans held and transmitted land: 'The localized matrilineage tracing descent from a known common female ancestor for a period of 10 to 12 generations is the basic unit for political, legal, and ritual purposes. Succession and inheritance rules stress sex, generation, and age, with men having precedence over women, "brothers" over "sisters' sons," and senior over junior. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-649" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-649">[649]</a></sup> 'Land was the unalienable possession of the clan--actually the clan's ancestral spirits were considered the true owners of the land and the tribal land's living occupants only trustees or tenants. Security of tenure was based on working the land. Abandoned land reverted to the stool. Rights to land were inherited matrilineally. Today Akan have the right to sell land although leasing seems to be the preferred arrangement. [IS]' <sup id="cite_ref-650" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-650">[650]</a></sup>  But inheritance was divided between a man's matrilineage and his own offspring: 'Despite being jurally matrilineal, inheritance is to some extent divided between sister's children and a man's own children. The basic principle is that lineage-inherited property goes to sisters' children, and property acquired with the help of a man's wife and children is distributed among the latter at his death. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-651" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-651">[651]</a></sup> Households cultivated family farms: 'The farm, known in Asante as the afuo, was essentially a smallholding capable of supporting a single family. It consisted of two or sometimes three distinct parts, the afuwa, mfufuwa and mfufuwa-nini. The land currently under cultivation was the afuwa, “the little farm” or field, and the land under fallow was the mfufuwa, literally “the non- afuwa.” A farmer's rights of tenure over his fallow were as secure as those over his land under cultivation. In some cases a farm may have attached to it further land — fallow that has not been brought back into cultivation at the appropriate time because, for example, of unsatisfactory yields or of the inability of the tenants (through illnesses, deaths, or the like) to resume cropping it. Such land is the mfufuwa-nini, literally “barren fallow.” The original tenants and their heirs retain rights to the produce from it — to the fruits of palm and kola trees, for example, and to firewood and poles — but Asante law appears not to have defined with any precision the point in time at which others might acquire rights in it and recommence farming operations. Much litigation results.' <sup id="cite_ref-652" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-652">[652]</a></sup> Land became the property of clans through clearing of forests and cultivation. Wilks describes the process of establishing estates: 'Akan village histories make frequent reference to hunters ranging the forest in search of land suitable for agricultural exploitation—taking account, presumably, of surface relief, water resources, soil, and so forth. The role of the aberemp[unavailable]n in these explorations is often described in considerable detail. By way of illustration I shall cite the cases of two, Tabiri Heman and Akuamoa Panin.' <sup id="cite_ref-653" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-653">[653]</a></sup> 'The aberemp[unavailable]n were essentially developers. They created estates, founding villages and clearing the arable land necessary for subsistence. I refer to such estates as “ beremp[unavailable]n-doms” (by analogy with “kingdoms,” “chiefdoms,” etc.). Of the actual work of felling, clearing, and building, and of how the imported unfree labor was used, we know nothing. Such is not the stuff of tradition. Kea has drawn attention to a possible model, that of Aduafo of Afutu and “other great lords” who had contracted with the Danish African Company to clear a site and construct a trading post for them. They brought 300 of their slaves to the site and divided them [Page 98] into two teams. One carried out the clearing while the other assembled the building materials. This was, however, at a coastal location and is therefore of uncertain relevance.' <sup id="cite_ref-654" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-654">[654]</a></sup> 'If the creation of an estate was predicated on the procurement of unfree labor, its prosperity depended on free settlers being attracted to it. Such was the pressure on land, on arable land, that they came. Sometimes the original estate was subdivided by purchase. For example, Adu Gyamfi, by origin from Adansemanso, founded a settlement named Aboforumu. It lay about 12 miles northwest of what was to become Kumase. He subsequently sold (“as the explorers or the owners of the land”) part of the estate to new settlers, Amma Badu and Antwi, who paid him mperedwan aduosia, 60 peredwans or some 135 oz. of gold. The estate was soon to be divided yet again. We have met Akosua Yitua of Asantemanso and her son Danso Abeam, above. She had five daughters. The third of these settled at Amoaman, but her descendants “became hemmed in at this village.” They moved northward, and their leader, Adu Panin, purchased a block of land from Amma Badu and Antwi. He renamed it Ntonso. The price is not reported. The transaction is said to have occurred at the time of Oti Akenten of Kumase. Other cases did not involve purchase, but contract sometimes sealed by marriage. The case of Kyerewa Akenten and her brother, Kagya, is instructive. They left Asantemanso in search of land and, after rejecting several places as unsuitable, arrived at Oyoko, near Feyiase. They went from there 'to Odum-Anaafuo to ask Berefo Kese, the Chief of the place for some land to settle on. He showed them a site where they built their village which they named “Kagya-kurom” [Kagya's village]. Owing to the large number of the followers of Kagya and his sister, Berefo Kese presented them a large portion of his lands on which they farmed. From Kagya-kurom Berefo Kese married Kyerewa Akenten and after their marriage Berefo Kese added a much larger portion of his lands to that already in their hands and presented it to them.' <sup id="cite_ref-655" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-655">[655]</a></sup> 'Obtaining land involved negotiation with the [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n who had developed it, who had (as it were) staked out first claims to it. Matrifiliation as such conferred no rights of settlement. It will follow that the free settlers within a beremp[unavailable]n-dom belonged to different matriclans. In fact these are dispersed almost randomly throughout forest society. As Fortes has remarked, the matriclan “delimits a diffuse field of amity, wide in extent but of minimal structural specificity.” Within the beremp[unavailable]n-dom, of the rule of exogamy, and in that respect was a socially integrative factor. But claims to land were based upon the heritable rights that the [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n conferred upon the settlers, and the matrilineages that thus arose were tied to specific tracts of land within the estate.' <sup id="cite_ref-656" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-656">[656]</a></sup> 'From the fifteenth century onward numerous estates or beremp[unavailable]n-doms arose as the frontier of farming expanded outward from the Adanse and Amansie regions. Such has been the thrust of the argument. Some were in time to become the capitals of aman, of states; some were to be incorporated into such states; and some were to falter and vanish. The struggles that attended the process are exhaustively chronicled in Akan traditions; the nature of the process itself, whereby a class of entrepreneurs became transformed into a ruling class, is not. The key lies in an understanding of the peculiar features of Akan land proprietorship.' <sup id="cite_ref-657" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-657">[657]</a></sup> 'A cardinal feature of the system is expressed in the maxim, afuo mu yε me deε, asase yε [unavailable]hene deε, “the farm is my property, the land is the king's.” It is necessary to extrapolate from more recent practice, described by Rattray, Busia, and Fortes among others. If the proprietor of the land conferred heritable rights to the arable on those who were permitted to settle, he also reserved or established certain rights to himself and his heirs — to his “stool.” He took an almost token part of the harvest at the time of the annual harvest festival (the odwira), but required a more substantial share of the produce of the land as opposed to the arable: fish, snails, game, kola, minerals, and the like. He could levy a wide range of taxes, such as peato for military expenses, ayieto for funerals, and [unavailable]manto to defray the costs of making regalia and putting up buildings. Most importantly, he could require the provision of labor for military service or, for example, for work on the roads. Such, briefly, were what led Potekhin to refer to “the relatively easy feudal dues of the free members of the community.” Relatively easy” they may or may not have been; there was variation from place to place and time to time. “Feudal” they were not, for the free settlers acquired almost unassailable titles to the land they farmed, while the various taxes and services provided to the landholder were ad hoc and sporadic and did not approximate in character to a rent, whether economic or otherwise.' <sup id="cite_ref-658" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-658">[658]</a></sup> 'The descendants of free settlers became [unavailable]manmufo, citizens. Those of the proprietors became adehyeε, nobility. There remain the unfree laborers. They must surely be those who became the third major element in the composition of an [unavailable]man, namely the gyaasefo. Literally “the people of the hearth,” they were absorbed into Akan society as servants of the adehyeε. They became responsible not only for their own subsistence but for that of the nobles. They farmed for them, assumed responsibility for their debts, and provided them with a wide range of personal services as stool-carriers, drummers, hornblowers, umbrella-carriers, bathroom attendants, messengers, tradesmen, sextons, and so forth. Their masters (or mistresses) were heirs to their property. Their status, unlike that of nobles and citizens, was transmitted through the male line. Rattray commented on the matter: [Page 100] 'There is little doubt that the Gyasefo were in olden times recruited from the slave class. A “Stool” slave became one of the Gyasefo. The descendants of a Gyase woman were of course considered as Gyasefo, down the female line for all time; not only was this so, but the son of a Gyase man would ordinarily also enter the office to which his father belonged, irrespective of the position of his mother.' <sup id="cite_ref-659" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-659">[659]</a></sup> Accordingly, land was formally owned by matrilineages and stools rather than individuals. The latter held usufruct rights in lineage land rather than owning it 'privately'.

<p><b>♠ Other property ownership ♣ present ♥</b> Heirlooms were transmitted within families: 'According to Rattray, kuduo were classed as agyapadie, a term he translates as ‘heirloom’. Kuduo were clearly regarded as items of great importance, and many thousands survive. Earlier in this century it appears the Asante were reluctant to part with these vessels to outsiders and, although many have since been removed from Ghana, some are still to be found in stool rooms or in the private possession of old people. Many of the kuduo which exist today are heavily corroded, indicating that they have, at some time, been buried.' <sup id="cite_ref-662" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-662">[662]</a></sup> Husbands gifted clothing and other objects to their wives, which the latter had to repay in the case of divorce: 'The following is only a brief indication of what seems to me to be peculiar in an Akan marriage as compared to the institution in other countries.' <sup id="cite_ref-663" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-663">[663]</a></sup> 'Such is the state of a married couple that in many instances a wife may well guard against receiving any large presents in the form of clothing, etc., from her husband, or she might one day regret her action. This is so because, should there be a rupture, ending in divorce, all that the husband had since the payment of “Aseda” and during the time of their married life, given to the wife by way of presents, etc., must be returned to the husband. Even in cases where the wife is seeking for divorce without good cause shown or with a view to marrying another man in the immediate future, she has to pay for all the clothing which had become useless by wear and tear. Consequently, while husband and wife are living together, there may be constant dread on the part of the wife to make use of things given to her by her husband, else she may one day be divorced a bankrupt. If she is rich in her own right, the wife will prefer to dress in clothing bought with her own money, and she would not wait for her husband to provide her clothing.' <sup id="cite_ref-664" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-664">[664]</a></sup> Stools were associated with matriclans: 'Before proceeding further, it is necessary to explain the origin of stools, whether family or public. Where the head of a family has more than one stool, he may give one to a member of the family on appointing him the Penin of a junior branch of the large family. The person so appointed thereby acquires possession of all the goods, chattels, and lands appurtenant to that stool. His own property becomes stool property, and is merged in whatever is given him. The children of the last stoolholder call him father, and the widows become his wives; each woman can, however, obtain her freedom on repayment of the Consawment money, that is, dowry. But a new stool is created in this wise: when the family of a man of wealth or influence on his death so will, they create a family stool which is named after the deceased. For this purpose the favourite chair of the deceased, generally a small one, which was in constant use by him, is cleaned, then rubbed all over with the blood of sheep, and finally smeared with a mixture of soot and eggs. The stool is afterwards wrapped in some skin and safely kept. During this consecration, libation is made and prayers are freely offered for the prosperity of the family, and that its members may, in time to come, attain greater influence and prominence. These stools are added to from time to time, but count is made of only the prominent ones. Too often the name of the original founder of the family is dropped for that of one of his successors of greater eminence. When an old stool is so decayed that it ought to be destroyed, it is burnt, and the ashes thereof are made into a paste with oil, blood, eggs, and other substances. The paste is then daubed on a new stool, which is [Page 13] consecrated as a family stool and named after the old one. When an old stool is lost a new one is specially made and consecrated.' <sup id="cite_ref-665" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-665">[665]</a></sup> Chiefs owned ceremonial drums: 'Before we enter upon a detailed description of these drums, an account of how they are made, and the ceremonial inseparable from their manufacture, will be of interest. When an Ashanti chief wants a couple of ntumpane or talking drums he will summon the makers (who are not the drummers), and are variously known as 'kyerema nyano (the drummer's nyano) or atwenesenfo (i. e. carvers of the tweneboa tree). Only chiefs of the rank of omanhene, ohene, or safohene have the right to possess such drums. A Queen Mother or other women may not possess a drum.' <sup id="cite_ref-666" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-666">[666]</a></sup> Kronenfeld provides a general description of the property system: 'Thus, the actual social effects of Fanti inheritance rules depend on the durability of property, 1) The only properties (in Egyaa, at least) durable for a long time are positions: lineage leader ( ebusua panyin) and other chiefships or stools belonging to the ebusua. Informants talked about the inheritance of position in the same way that they talked about the inheritance of property, All stools or chiefships (except possibly for some asafo 2) House sites stay within an ebusua normally, but are common enough in Egyaa not to be worth fighting over. Houses themselves seem usually to last 20-30 years at most before needing rebuilding. (This refers to traditional wattle-and-daub or adobe houses. More recent concrete block houses will probably last longer.) Houses, then, may pass down one generation of inheritance, but not much further. 3) Personal property (clothes, utensils, etc.) also seem to have a short useful life, i.e., 10-20 years. 4) Fishing boats have an expected life span of 10 years, nets around 5 years, and motors around 3 years. 5) Women's fish-smoking ovens only seem to last a couple of years. 6) An active farm will be inherited when its owner dies; in fact, however, particular farms (in [Page 27] Egyaa ) only last for a couple of years, and thus are not too important as inherited property. 7) Finally, there does seem to have been a lot of cash in Egyaa which would represent a worthwhile inheritance. Supposedly, inherited money is kept separately from earned money. But money is constantly loaned out through a kinship-based credit network, and uncollectible debts are common. The net effect, I think, is that money deriving from some particular person only goes through a couple of inheritances at most before disappearing (or going into goods). However, this is only speculation, since money, being less visible and identifiable than goods, was harder for me to follow, and presumably for the same reasons is harder for the people involved to keep track of.' <sup id="cite_ref-667" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-667">[667]</a></sup> Slavery was also practiced: 'The Akan practiced slavery, obtaining slaves from northern slave dealers, usually Muslims. War captives, criminals, persons who opposed local chiefs, and many local ritual leaders were also enslaved. Slaves were used for domestic and field labor, for sale to traders across the Sahara and Atlantic, and as sacrifices to royal and other ancestors. In the middle of the nineteenth century, slaves amounted to half of the population in many towns. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-668" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-668">[668]</a></sup>

<dd><b>♠ matrilineal inheritance ♣ present ♥</b> Society was organized in matrilineal clans: 'All Akan groups recognize matrilineal descent. The basic group is the clan, of which there are eight; they are dispersed among the many kingdoms. Members of a subclan tend to occupy a single town or village. The clan is an exogamous group. It is comprised of constituent groups that may be referred to as lineages, but these do not form any kind of segmentary lineage system, lineages being attached to others by propinquity and the power and wealth of the host lineage. Although there has been much confusion in accounts of the Akan peoples between matriliny and matriarchy, authority within clans and lineages is held firmly by men, succession being from a man to his brother or to his closest sister's son.' <sup id="cite_ref-669" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-669">[669]</a></sup> 'A child inherits his or her blood from the mother, and character or temperament from the father. Maternal blood ensures the child's membership in the ABUSUA (clan or lineage); paternity bestows membership in one of nine other groups or categories. Although some accounts claim the Akan descent system is one of double descent, this view appears to be based on a misreading of the actual roles of the two lines of descent. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-670" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-670">[670]</a></sup> 'There are groups in which membership is transmitted patrilineally, but these are neither exogamous nor corporate groups; nor are jural or political rights or duties derived from paternal descent. What is involved is the concept of NTORO; the male transmitted NTORO (spirit) which forms a unique spiritual bond between father and son. Following this principle, every person belongs to one of a limited number of named quasi-ritual categories, the ntoro divisions. Members of the same ntoro division are required to observe certain taboos, perform certain rituals, and are believed to have some common personality characteristics. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-671" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-671">[671]</a></sup> 'Consistent with the emphasis on matrilineal descent is the fact that the system of kinship terminology is of the Crow type. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-672" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-672">[672]</a></sup> Clans held and transmitted land: 'The localized matrilineage tracing descent from a known common female ancestor for a period of 10 to 12 generations is the basic unit for political, legal, and ritual purposes. Succession and inheritance rules stress sex, generation, and age, with men having precedence over women, "brothers" over "sisters' sons," and senior over junior. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-673" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-673">[673]</a></sup> 'Land was the unalienable possession of the clan--actually the clan's ancestral spirits were considered the true owners of the land and the tribal land's living occupants only trustees or tenants.

Today Akan have the right to sell land although leasing seems to be the preferred arrangement. [IS]' <sup id="cite_ref-674" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-674">[674]</a></sup>  But inheritance could be divided between a man's matrilineage and his own offspring: 'Despite being jurally matrilineal, inheritance is to some extent divided between sister's children and a man's own children. The basic principle is that lineage-inherited property goes to sisters' children, and property acquired with the help of a man's wife and children is distributed among the latter at his death. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-675" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-675">[675]</a></sup> 'An Ashanti father on his death-bed might call his abusua (blood relations) around him, inform them that his son had served him well, and that when he died he wished him to be given some of his (the father's) personal private property. Such a bequest is known as Samansie (that which is left, or set aside, by the ghost). A father might not, however, leave his inherited weapons to his son. They went to his brother or nephew. It will be seen, later, how a claimant, who [Page 16] wishes to be considered for selection to a vacant stool, speaks of ‘taking the gun of the deceased’.' <sup id="cite_ref-676" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-676">[676]</a></sup> Inheritance rights within the matrilineage were based on seniority and siblingship relations: 'Inheritance rights in Fanti are based on lineage membership and seniority, and lineage membership can be framed in terms of types of siblingship. But yet the basic siblingship and seniority information relevant to inheritance are expressed in Fanti outside of the basic kin terminology. In this paper I want first to show how these kinds of information are expressed and how the information specifically shapes inheritance rights and then to examine the effects of inheritance on lineage segmentation. I will conclude with a look at some linguistic consequences (in the kin terminology) of changes in cultural expectations regarding inheritance — changes which stem from effects of Ghanaian law on inheritance and from changes in the obligations involved in raising children.' <sup id="cite_ref-677" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-677">[677]</a></sup> 'Each of these issues — siblingship, seniority, inheritance rights, and change — will be examined separately for its interaction with the wider kinship system, and thus for what it contributes to the feedback relations among the kin terminology, the inheritance and socialization relations that shape the terminology, and the kin groups that have precipitated out around these inheritance relations. This discussion of the interrelationship among kin terminology, kin groups, and succession will necessarily raise the further analytic issue of what other linguistic information (beyond that minimally necessary to a formal analysis of the kinship terms themselves) belongs in a kinship terminological analysis — if that analysis is addressed to these kinds of functional questions.' <sup id="cite_ref-678" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-678">[678]</a></sup> 'Seniority, referring in its core sense to relative age, is important to Fanti kinship and social interaction in several ways. Computed on age and genealogical criteria within a lineage, and relative to the relevant property, seniority defines the ordering of potential heirs to property. The relative seniority of any ego and alter — where seniority can refer to the age and genealogical criteria of inheritance, but where it also can refer to a subtle interaction of power, respect, precedence, and putative authority — is treated as important by Fanti speakers, and importantly affects day-to-day interactions and kin term usage (see Kronenfeld 1973). However, seniority is not coded directly in the kin terminology proper. Instead, seniority is optionally marked via the use of general (i.e., non-kinship-specific) modifiers — usually panyin (senior) and kakraba (junior). These modifiers do not have a primary kinship reference; they can apply to any relationship between non-equals (in age, power, authority, and, even, by extension, size or assertiveness).' <sup id="cite_ref-679" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-679">[679]</a></sup> 'A woman has the potential of being inherited leviratically by her kun kakraba (who is her husband's “brother”), but not by her kun panyin, and reciprocally a man may inherit his yer panyin (“senior wife” = wife of senior “brother” or “uncle”), but not his yer kakraba (“junior wife” = wife of junior “brother”). As far as I know, there is no equivalent sororate on the woman's side.' <sup id="cite_ref-680" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-680">[680]</a></sup> 'A nua panyin is older than a nua kakraba and has authority over the kakraba. As children, the elder brother can discipline his junior, subject to control by the father. As adults, the elder is senior in the lineage to the junior and will inherit before the junior (the junior will inherit subsequently). Among brothers, the panyin kakraba distinction is commonly made and seems to be considered an important one. In certain lineage situations (see below) an extended younger nua can be senior ( panyin) to an elder because he has a senior mother.' <sup id="cite_ref-681" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-681">[681]</a></sup> 'I have explored the concepts of siblingship and seniority not only for the insight they give into the interrelationship among cultural action, terminology, and grammar, but also because of the role they play in the execution of the major corporate function of Fanti lineages: the assignment of inheritance rights. I want now to examine that inheritance role in more detail. Matrilineages (ebusua) are very salient social units to the Fanti. They figure heavily in conversations of various sorts, including discussions of political and economic maneuverings. The lineage represents the primary referent of the English word “family” as it is used by Fanti speakers. The word ebusua is the primary translation equivalent of “family” for Fanti speakers, while in anthropological terms ebusua refers to a matrilineage (the unmarked default sense) or matriclan (a denotatively correct extension).' <sup id="cite_ref-682" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-682">[682]</a></sup> 'Inheritance is traditionally within the ebusua (lineage). The elders of the ebusua determine who will succeed to the property and positions of a deceased person. The elders are free to pick any member of the lineage as successor, or they can select an outsider to act as custodian of the property and/or as temporary filler of the position. They are supposed to pick successors who are mature and who have the skills needed for effectively using the property or filling the position.' <sup id="cite_ref-683" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-683">[683]</a></sup> 'There are ideal norms which are followed, insofar as possible, concerning the genealogical relationship of heir to deceased: 1) Normally women inherit from women and men from men. 2) Qualified people of the deceased's own generation take precedence over those of subsequent generations, and seniors do not normally inherit from juniors (i.e., qualified people junior to the deceased come in order of seniority). 3) Genealogical qualification consists primarily in being descended from the [Page 26] mother of the person who first earned or created the property; other lineage members come afterward.' <sup id="cite_ref-684" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-684">[684]</a></sup> 'There is, therefore, a kind of inheritance seniority (mba mpanyin mu). According to this seniority pattern (see Fig. 2), if a man. A, creates some property, the property ideally should pass to his next younger matrilineally related brother, then to the next younger, etc. In Generation -1 the eldest son of his eldest sister would come first, followed by the eldest son of his next eldest sister and so on. In Generation -2 the eldest son of the eldest daughter of A's eldest sister would come first, etc. B.

A man has been able, by an oral will (or, more recently, a written one), to leave a part of the property that he has earned or created himself to his children and/or wife, subject to the agreement of his ebusua, Furthermore, modern Ghanaian law permits a Fanti man to leave up to a third of his acquired property to his children and up to a third to his wife. However, in spite of the potentiality, I recorded no cases in Egyaa of sons having inherited anything from their fathers: Egyaa men give their children anything they intend for them to receive during their lifetimes, leaving their whole estate to their ebusua heirs. My understanding was that this is a more traditional and common way of transferring property to men's children than oral wills, though I collected no hard evidence on the question.' <sup id="cite_ref-687" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-687">[687]</a></sup> 'To summarize, the only property a man can transfer to his sons is that which he has personally acquired. His ebusua controls the distribution (normally within the ebusua) of other property which he has held. The persons in the ebusua who are his most likely heirs can be different for different properties since the ordering of likely heirs depends on the genealogical “age” of the property in question.' <sup id="cite_ref-688" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-688">[688]</a></sup> Kronenfeld provides a general description of the property system: 'Thus, the actual social effects of Fanti inheritance rules depend on the durability of property, 1) The only properties (in Egyaa, at least) durable for a long time are positions: lineage leader ( ebusua panyin) and other chiefships or stools belonging to the ebusua.

<dd><b>♠ State expropriation ♣ present ♥</b> Stools were owed 'death duties' in gold, slaves and movables: '(a) Death Duties (Ayibuadie): Bowdich mentions that the King of Ashanti was ‘heir to the gold of every subject from the highest to the lowest’,  and thus, according to Ashanti custom, had to contribute to the funeral custom ‘to validate his claim’. This statement, however, requires considerable qualification. While it is correct to state that, theoretically, a Chief (or rather a Stool) would sooner or later become heir—within the strict limitation implied in the Ashanti meaning of the word—to all his subjects, the majority of such death duties were received by a Stool, indirectly. It has been observed that a Chief only has direct dealings with a minority of his subordinate Chiefs, e.g. with his own Mpanyimfo and with his own Birempon, and that these officials have numerous subjects of their own whom the Head-Chief only attempts to control through them. Let us suppose that a wealthy subject died, who happened to be under one of the Mpanyimfo of the Head-Chief's Birempon. The Opanyini would succeed to a specified amount of his subordinate's private personal [Page 108] movable assets, gold-dust, slaves, cloths, and such like. On the Opanyini's death, the Birempon would take a similar proportion of his estate. The Birempon's Head-Chief, i.e. the Head of the whole Territorial Division, would not get anything on these occasions. Later, however, when the Birempon himself died, the Head-Chief would benefit by receiving the death duties from his estate, which would thus include all that he, the Birempon, had collected and accumulated in death duties from his subjects. The potential wealth of Ashanti Chiefs might thus be very great, the amount of their immediately realizable securities very small. The late Mary Kingsley, whose writings on West Africa are remarkable for observation and intuition, wrote: ‘In the capacity (eventually) to command these things his wealth lies. So take the whole together and you will see how you can have a very rich African, who could not possibly pay down £20, but a real millionaire for all that.’ The unfairness of demanding great sums as war indemnities at very short notice, which had been the policy of some of our civil and military commanders in the wars against Ashanti, may thus be realized.' <sup id="cite_ref-693" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-693">[693]</a></sup> 'It is necessary to understand that when, in Ashanti, we speak of a Chief taking part of a man's property on death, only his personal self-acquired movable property is meant. Family property, in the possession of the deceased, which on his death reverted to the family, might not be touched. The proportion of the property of a dead man taken by a Chief varied in specified cases, and this will be noted when the Constitution of individual Stools comes under examination. In this chapter I am concerned with general principles rather than with the more minute details. Ayibuadie means literally ‘something to cover over or help the funeral rite’. There is a word in the vernacular, muhoma (lit. that with which to bind the breasts), which has a significance very similar to ayibuadie. Instead of a Chief coming down upon the estate of a dead subject, i.e. sending his Sana Hene (Treasurer) to lock up his rooms and boxes until the value of the estate had been assessed, he might leave the amount to be paid in death duties to the discretion of the relatives of the deceased. The levy then assumed more the appearance of a voluntary contribution on their part, ‘to bind the breast of the Chief’, ‘whose heart was sore’ owing to the loss of his subject and friend. This method of allowing the death duty to be paid was a more delicate and tactful way of going about the collection of this tax than the other more forcible method, but it practically amounted to [Page 109] the same thing in the end. It must not be overlooked that the claim to receive ayibuadie or muhoma involved some special obligations on the part of the recipient. Both these claims may be traced back to the original cell from which most of these more elaborate customs sprang. The house-father succeeded to the property of his dead kinsman, but he also had to see to it that he gave him a good and proper funeral. By a legal fiction, the Chief stood in a similar relationship to his subject, and by taking some of the latter's property on his death placed himself under the fictitious obligation of having to contribute to his funeral custom. By doing so he did not, however, become liable for the debts of the deceased. A Chief would also take care to see that the balance struck between what came in from ayibuadie or muhoma and what went out in funeral contributions ( nsa or nsawa) was in his favour. There is yet another expression which is sometimes confused with the above, i.e. awunyadie. This term, I think, means the inheritance of property by the legal heir.' <sup id="cite_ref-694" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-694">[694]</a></sup> 'Death duties ( Ayibuadie): The Chief claimed ayibuadie from those subjects who served him directly. He could claim all private property on death of any gyase who was descended down the female line from a gyase female slave. In the case of the descendant of a gyase man who had married a free woman (but a subject of the Chief), a male would enter that company to which his father had belonged, but at his death the Chief would claim only one half of his private belongings, the other half going to his own kindred. The Chief of Kumawu also claimed about two-thirds of the private property of the Heads of the following fekuo (the remaining third went to the Stool of the deceased), the Atum'tufo, Asoamfo, Asokwafo, Barimfo, Obofo, Samanfo, Sodofo. He received from his Mpanyimfo (on their death) a voluntary contribution made by the successor which was known as muhoma, and generally consisted of one of the deceased's wives, a male servant, a cloth, and some gold-dust. The taking of ayibuadie or muhoma implied an obligation to contribute towards the funeral expenses and to present gifts to the dead. In the case of a wealthy man, from whose estate a considerable amount had been received in death duties, this contribution might consist of a velvet pillow ( agopekyi), a silk danta (loin-cloth), in the folds of which was wrapped a suru of gold-dust (£1); 10 s. worth of gold-dust, to mix with the fat which was used to rub down the corpse; the coffin (which it has now become the custom for the children to buy); two or three [Page opp. p 230] [Page 230] cloths, which were buried with the body; a sheep and about 10 s. in gold-dust towards the funeral expenses. In the case of a poor man, the death duties from whose estate would be a small amount, the Chief would give a sheep and a cheap cloth, ‘lest if he did not give anything, the dead should report him to the ' Samanfo (spirits)’. [These obligations are still often observed, possibly from a superstitious dread of reprisals on the part of the dead; the corresponding right to demand ayibuadie, or to expect muhoma, has on the other hand almost entirely lapsed, and this state of affairs is often given as one of the reasons for the impoverished state of Stool finances.] The Chief also informed me of another interesting possible source of revenue in olden times of which I had not previously been aware, though it is possible the custom was not confined to one Division. When the Chief had a son or daughter ( by a wife who was at the same time his own subject), and that child died, the Chief succeeded to all his or her private property and not the child's abusua (kindred group) as would ordinarily be the case. Only a Head-Chief had this right, not the lesser Chiefs—the Mpanyimfo. This rule also applied to the children of the Kyidom Hene, because he was known as the ‘son’ of the Chief.' <sup id="cite_ref-695" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-695">[695]</a></sup> We have assumed that regional rulers practiced this in some form even before the Ashanti period, but this remains in need of confirmation. We have provisionally considered this to be a form of state expropriation.</dd>

<p><b>Marriage</b>
</p>
<dl><dd> <b>♠ Monogamy ♣ present ♥</b> Society was organized in matrilineal kin groups: 'All Akan groups recognize matrilineal descent. The basic group is the clan, of which there are eight; they are dispersed among the many kingdoms. Members of a subclan tend to occupy a single town or village. The clan is an exogamous group. It is comprised of constituent groups that may be referred to as lineages, but these do not form any kind of segmentary lineage system, lineages being attached to others by propinquity and the power and wealth of the host lineage. Although there has been much confusion in accounts of the Akan peoples between matriliny and matriarchy, authority within clans and lineages is held firmly by men, succession being from a man to his brother or to his closest sister's son.' <sup id="cite_ref-696" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-696">[696]</a></sup> 'A child inherits his or her blood from the mother, and character or temperament from the father. Maternal blood ensures the child's membership in the ABUSUA (clan or lineage); paternity bestows membership in one of nine other groups or categories. Although some accounts claim the Akan descent system is one of double descent, this view appears to be based on a misreading of the actual roles of the two lines of descent. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-697" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-697">[697]</a></sup> 'There are groups in which membership is transmitted patrilineally, but these are neither exogamous nor corporate groups; nor are jural or political rights or duties derived from paternal descent. What is involved is the concept of NTORO; the male transmitted NTORO (spirit) which forms a unique spiritual bond between father and son. Following this principle, every person belongs to one of a limited number of named quasi-ritual categories, the ntoro divisions. Members of the same ntoro division are required to observe certain taboos, perform certain rituals, and are believed to have some common personality characteristics. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-698" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-698">[698]</a></sup> 'Consistent with the emphasis on matrilineal descent is the fact that the system of kinship terminology is of the Crow type. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-699" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-699">[699]</a></sup> Exogamy was the norm: 'Marriage is expected to be exogamous, and is extremely simple. There is no bride-wealth, the union being effected by the transfer of rum or other drink and some money from the groom to the bride's immediate family. Divorce is extremely easy and may be initiated by either men or women. The most usual causes are adultery and the barrenness of wives.' <sup id="cite_ref-700" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-700">[700]</a></sup> Society was matrilineal, but legitimacy was still important: 'Legitimacy is important both for inheritance and to define a person as having, or not having, slave ancestry. It demands not only a proper marriage, however short, but also a recognized pater: he gives the child his own spiritual identity and his or her name; he admits his responsibility for the child's education, and he has the expectation that the child will carry out the father's funerary rites. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-701" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-701">[701]</a></sup> Multiple residence patterns were present: 'Domestic organization long remained one of the most ambiguous aspects of Akan social structure. It was Fortes who finally delineated the key structural principles and processes through his research in the 1940s in the communities of Asokore and Agogo. He distinguished three major household types each based on a different residence pattern. First are households grouped around a minimal matrilineage, such as a woman and her sister or daughters, or a man and his sister or sister's son. Such households are based on duolocal residence, with a husband and wife living apart in different domestic units; about 62 percent of the households in Agogo were of this type.' <sup id="cite_ref-702" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-702">[702]</a></sup> 'Second are households consisting of a man, his wife, and their children, sometimes including other kinsfolk; this type of patrilocal or virilocal unit constituted about 22 percent of the households in Agogo. Finally, there are households made up of combinations of the previous types (e.g. a man, his wife, and children) plus his sister's children. Often these reflect an avunculocal residence pattern. The matrilineal domestic group is usually preponderant in the larger communities, while virilocal or patrilocal households are the most common type in small farming villages or hamlets. But all three "types" should be viewed simply as phases in a domestic cycle. In the early years of marriage, residence is predominantly duolocal, but with the passage of time this could shift to avunculocal or patrilocal/virilocal. Thus the composition of a domestic group would evolve over time. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-703" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-703">[703]</a></sup> Fathers played a prominent role in the arrangement of marriages: 'THERE are two forms of marriage recognised in the Fanti districts of the Gold Coast Colony, ( a) Marriage by native custom, and ( b) Marriage under Ordinance No. 14 of 1884 of the Colony.' <sup id="cite_ref-704" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-704">[704]</a></sup> 'I intend to deal only with the native custom, and I may here state that I have always relied rather on illiterate natives and chiefs, for my information, than on educated native men, for the following reasons:—the illiterate native tells one all he knows, or all he dares, and, having no reason to lie when he is not in court, he generally relates facts. A chief is the judge of his people, and, with his councillors, is the repository and exponent of the law, and must necessarily be taken as an expert. The scholar studies anything but his own customs, while an educated native is too inclined to embellish those customs, and present them in a form that would do credit to Justinian.' <sup id="cite_ref-705" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-705">[705]</a></sup> 'According to the Family System of the Tˇw-speaking races of the Gold Coast, although the children belong to the family of the mother, and not of the father, yet the father seems always to have been the person responsible for the marriage of his children.' <sup id="cite_ref-706" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-706">[706]</a></sup> 'He was liable for their maintenance and up-bringing, and was responsible for their actions. Thus if any of his sons, living under his roof, seduced any woman, the father had to pay satisfaction. If any of his daughters were seduced, he claimed and obtained compensation. He supplied his children with means to trade, or to make a living, and in return was entitled to all their earnings. The liability for the sons ceased on their marriage, or when they became self-supporting, so that it was to the father's advantage to find them wives as soon as possible after they reached the age of puberty, and this became recognised as a duty.' <sup id="cite_ref-707" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-707">[707]</a></sup> 'Hence it is clear that primitive negro marriages were interparental contracts, in which the consent of the parties themselves was never considered. The father gave his son a peto and a half of gold dust, and the mother contributed half a peto, to start him in life (a peto being roughly an ounce), and he then worked for himself instead of for his father.' <sup id="cite_ref-708" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-708">[708]</a></sup> 'As time went on fathers came to look on their daughters as sources of income, and demanded sums of money when approached for their hands; this was only natural, as they had nothing to lose by keeping them unmarried, and lost at least their services when they parted with them; whereas unmarried sons were always a possible source of danger.' <sup id="cite_ref-709" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-709">[709]</a></sup> 'Thus it came about, within historical times, that when a man had a marriageable son he approached a man with a marriageable daughter, and having made a suitable present, which varied from one ackie (4 s. 6 d.) to four ackies (18 s.), the two were betrothed, and cohabitation completed the marriage. [Some reckon the ackie as worth 5 s.]' <sup id="cite_ref-710" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-710">[710]</a></sup> 'Sometimes it happened, for personal reasons, that children were betrothed before they were mature; in such cases the boy's parent maintained the girl in her father's house and watched her, and was entitled to satisfaction if she were tampered with. When both had reached puberty the marriage was completed by cohabitation. The betrothal could be broken off meanwhile by the boy's parent, on forfeiting the so-called ‘consawment’ money, or by the girl's parent, by returning the money that had been paid.' <sup id="cite_ref-711" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-711">[711]</a></sup> According to Ffoukes, marriage negotiations became more extensive in the colonial period. There was a lot of regional variation: 'This state continued so long as children quietly submitted to the dictates of their parents, but during the last five centuries the natives have been brought into touch with various European nations, and the much-despised civilisation [Page 33] has tended to modify all their customs and ideas. Sons gradually came to be consulted, and were later allowed to choose their own wives; while the consent of the women was never considered until very recently, and even now it is not usual, except in Coast towns, where girls are far more independent than in the bush.' <sup id="cite_ref-712" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-712">[712]</a></sup> 'The marriage custom, instead of being the simple process of parents pairing off their children, now entails considerable expense. For instance, the present procedure in Cape Coast is as follows:—The relatives of the man (or more often the man himself) approach the relatives of the girl with rum, and if they appear willing a further “dash” is taken, which varies from £1 to 30 s., according to the suitor's circumstances; this is called Abombo or the “knocking” fee, as the suitor knocks at the door to ask for the girl; the father fixes the amount. On the acceptance of the abombo the girl becomes the affianced bride of the man, and although this is only a moral obligation, it is very strictly adhered to, and breach of promise is unknown to native custom. Occasional presents may now be exchanged, and shortly afterwards her parents receive the Etsir-Nsã (Fantee, Etsir a head, Nsã rum), which consists of two flasks of gin and a sum varying from five dollars (£1) to half an ounce of gold (£2) which is distributed amongst her relatives.' <sup id="cite_ref-713" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-713">[713]</a></sup> 'Her parents then may or may not make a further claim for dowry or head money, etsirkyeradzi or etsiradzi (from etsir, “head,” kyere “to show” or “prove,” and adzi, “thing”), of one to two ounces of gold, or £6 to £9; and the man further sends a box to the girl containing cloths, handkerchiefs, a comb, lavender-water and pomade, with perhaps pipes and a supply of tobacco, and a day is fixed to hand the girl over.' <sup id="cite_ref-714" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-714">[714]</a></sup> 'Some time usually elapses between sending the etsir nsã and contributing the etsiradzi, and this, it is alleged, is to give the man and his parents time to watch the character of the girl, as well as to meet the increasing demands of the avaricious parents who fix the dowry; but there is nothing to prevent sending both at once and completing the nuptial ceremony forthwith. However, the negro never does anything in a hurry! No precautions are now taken with the girl other than to warn her not to visit her intended husband's house before she is handed over, and she is never confined before her marriage, but satisfaction must be paid for cohabitation before she is so handed over.' <sup id="cite_ref-715" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-715">[715]</a></sup> 'In Fanti Yankumase [Assin] the custom varies appreciably from Cape Coast, for here the suitor sends to ask the girl's family, without rum or abombo, and if they agree, both families meet to drink rum or palm wine; this ceremony, to show the couple is engaged, is called Wakagyir. Then the man seals his bond by sending three small bottles of gin to the girl's family, and this is termed etsir nsã. He also [Page 35] gives the town crier 1 s. 6 d. to publish his betrothal, and 4 s. to witnesses. He further sends 8 s. to the girl's mother to maintain her until marriage; this payment is called Ntamboba (= Tanbiba, see infra), which implies, “as the mother has looked after the child, now somebody takes her.”' <sup id="cite_ref-716" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-716">[716]</a></sup> 'The matter then waits until the man has sufficient money, and if the girl or her family has a debt he pays it; this they call the etsiradzi. At this stage the Assins make sure that the bride-elect is a virgin, and, if not, lay their claim against the seducer. If there are no debts, the bridegroom merely provides a box, with cloths, handkerchiefs, looking-glass, and perfumes, and takes the bride home.' <sup id="cite_ref-717" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-717">[717]</a></sup> 'In Denkera the matter is much simpler; the man asks the father for his daughter, and notifies the girl's family, if he gets the father's consent, by sending them rum; he then pays her family the abombo, which they fix, and which may vary from £1 to 30 s., and the man takes the girl home; although he may pay a further dowry of £4 or £5, but this is not essential.' <sup id="cite_ref-718" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-718">[718]</a></sup> Marriage and divorce became more regulated in the colonial period: 'The passing of the 1884 Marriage Ordinance Act attempted to set a standard for monogamous marriage and spousal inheritance of self-acquired property. Conflict over inheritance often ended up in court where officials tried to determine whether or not a spouse was a true and therefore legal wife. Women began to organize in the 1950's to change the distinction between ‘wife’ and ‘non-wife’ in order to protect the interests of women and children. The results were the passage of the Maintenance of Children Bill in 1965 and a new divorce law in 1971. [IS]' <sup id="cite_ref-719" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-719">[719]</a></sup> Concubinage was practiced, but the rights of concubines differed from those of wives: 'Concubinage is everywhere practised on the Coast, and is generally respected, although civilisation has made educated natives profess to disparage it; the sole difference amongst the Fantis is, that Mpata or satisfaction can be sued for by a married man if his wife commits adultery, whereas he can obtain no redress in the case of a concubine. Further, a native can hardly be said to buy his wife, as all moneys paid by him are received on trust for the good behaviour of the wife during the marriage, and are returnable to the husband if he divorces his wife for her misconduct, only vesting in her family on her death, or the death of her husband.' <sup id="cite_ref-720" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-720">[720]</a></sup> 'Concubinage is openly permitted, and although it is not encouraged on the Coast, it is widely practised elsewhere. It is really quite as honourable a connection as the native marriage, as couples frequently live through life with no other bond than mutual affection. The essential difference is that for lack of consideration the man cannot claim damages if the woman misconducts herself; and if the man misbehaves, the woman has only to leave him at will. In fact the difference is all in favour of the woman, as will be seen when dealing with divorce. Even a married man may keep a concubine openly if his wife has no objection, but she cooks only at the wife's request; it is when a man keeps concubines clandestinely or against his wife's will that the custom is deprecated, and he has to “pacify” her whenever she finds him out. Wives do not appear to discourage it so long as they themselves get their fair share of attention. Whatever is given to a concubine is given outright, and cannot be reclaimed if she chooses to leave him for someone else. Her children can hardly be called illegitimate, as they still belong to her family, and as in the case of a chieftainess the children succeed to the stool. If she has children, and then marries another man, the natural father usually takes and brings them up, so that they may bury him; but if he does not, the husband is obliged to look after them.' <sup id="cite_ref-721" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-721">[721]</a></sup> 'There is this great difference, however, that, whereas the father of legitimate children is bound to support them, and he is responsible for all their acts, the natural father is not so bound, the obligation and liability falling on the woman's family; he only does so to keep up his good name, and the children do not participate equally in the funeral expenses.' <sup id="cite_ref-722" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-722">[722]</a></sup> Levirate was also practiced: 'There is a peculiar exception to one of these prohibitions, for when a Fanti dies he is succeeded by his eldest surviving brother, and if he has no brothers, by his eldest sister's eldest son. If the brother succeeds, he is said to take his [Page 44] place, and part of his duty is to marry the widow; this is called Okuranba; if the nephew ( Awofasepenyin) inherits he has a wider choice, for if the man leaves a daughter the nephew can take his choice between the widow and her daughter, but he cannot marry both. ' <sup id="cite_ref-723" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-723">[723]</a></sup> Husbands were obliged to pay compensation to the wife in the case of divorce unless a legitimate reason for the dissolution of the marriage could be provided: 'The Fantis assert that a man may repudiate his wife at will, but, if no substantial reason is given, he forfeits the dowry and all payments made on her behalf, pays all her expenses, and in addition pays her heavy compensation, so that it is never done. Elsewhere repudiation at will is unknown.' <sup id="cite_ref-724" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-724">[724]</a></sup> 'The following are held to be good grounds on which a husband may divorce his wife:— (1) Adultery. (2) Repeatedly insulting the husband's parents. (3) Refusal on the part of the woman to cohabit, after the man has preferred his claim against an adulterer. (4) If she becomes a notorious thief or criminal. (5) If she persists in not consenting to his taking another wife. (6) If the wife practises witchcraft. (7) Desertion.' <sup id="cite_ref-725" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-725">[725]</a></sup> 'In all these cases it is usual for both families to meet, and appoint an arbitrator, who may be the chief or any other person to whose decision they agree to submit. The case is gone into in the presence of both families, and if the grounds are held to be sufficient, the man is ordered to “chop” ( i.e., pipe-clay) the neck and breast of the woman, and she has to parade the town to publish the fact, and to show that she is free to marry again. If she was in the wrong, the man could then claim from her family restitution of the dowry, and all the expenses he had incurred throughout the marriage on her behalf, except the actual expense of maintaining her, doctor's bills, and the cloths that she had worn out; all jewels and the cloths that he had given her and which were not worn out are also returned. In Assin she is chalked on the foot. In Denkera she is not chalked at all, and here, although actual current expenses are awarded, they are invariably remitted.' <sup id="cite_ref-726" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-726">[726]</a></sup> 'In the case of adultery, the husband can turn the woman [Page 47] out on the spot and refuse her all further support. Inquiry might show that she had committeed adultery after gross ill-treatment or desertion; in such cases a divorce would be decreed, but the man would forfeit his expenses. For adultery he also has an alternative, in that he could sue the adulterer for damages (Birebu), which might be more than the expenses that he could claim, and are never less; this depends on his position. In Cape Coast he has to elect, and cannot claim a divorce at the same time; he can only proceed to a divorce if the woman now refuses to pay some small satisfaction, and further refuses to live with him. In Assin he may divorce as well as claim. When a wife repeatedly inveighs against her husband's family, the family take the matter up, and the husband has to get a divorce or break with his family, but all endeavours are first made to persuade the woman to desist.' <sup id="cite_ref-727" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-727">[727]</a></sup> 'In the case of theft, unless the wife is notorious, she pacifies the husband with a sheep, and the marriage continues. If the husband refuses, he forfeits his moneys; if the woman refuses, he can claim all.' <sup id="cite_ref-728" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-728">[728]</a></sup> 'Where a woman refuses her consent to a new wife, she is invariably won over by a handsome dash.' <sup id="cite_ref-729" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-729">[729]</a></sup> Women could not divorce their husbands directly, but courts could order men to divorce their wives on their behalf: 'A wife cannot divorce her husband, and the husband may always claim the Ayifur if she marries any other man without being first chalked. She can, however, take him before a native court on the following grounds:—(1) Continuous illtreatment. (2) His repeated insults to her family. (3) Aggravated assault. (4) If he is a notorious thief. (5) Desertion.' <sup id="cite_ref-730" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-730">[730]</a></sup> 'If she gets judgment the court orders the husband to “chop” her to show she is free; he further forfeits all his expenses, and has to give up all her property that he has in his possession. Also, if there have been loans or money transactions between them, accounts are rendered and balances struck. In Fanti Yankumase the husband is entitled to recover his expenses in all cases of divorce.' <sup id="cite_ref-731" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-731">[731]</a></sup> Given how adultery was recognized as constituting legitimate grounds for divorce, we have decided to code 'present'.</dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Gender ♣ present ♥</b> Descent was matrilineal: 'All Akan groups recognize matrilineal descent. The basic group is the clan, of which there are eight; they are dispersed among the many kingdoms. Members of a subclan tend to occupy a single town or village. The clan is an exogamous group. It is comprised of constituent groups that may be referred to as lineages, but these do not form any kind of segmentary lineage system, lineages being attached to others by propinquity and the power and wealth of the host lineage. Although there has been much confusion in accounts of the Akan peoples between matriliny and matriarchy, authority within clans and lineages is held firmly by men, succession being from a man to his brother or to his closest sister's son.' <sup id="cite_ref-732" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-732">[732]</a></sup> 'A child inherits his or her blood from the mother, and character or temperament from the father. Maternal blood ensures the child's membership in the ABUSUA (clan or lineage); paternity bestows membership in one of nine other groups or categories. Although some accounts claim the Akan descent system is one of double descent, this view appears to be based on a misreading of the actual roles of the two lines of descent. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-733" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-733">[733]</a></sup> 'There are groups in which membership is transmitted patrilineally, but these are neither exogamous nor corporate groups; nor are jural or political rights or duties derived from paternal descent. What is involved is the concept of NTORO; the male transmitted NTORO (spirit) which forms a unique spiritual bond between father and son. Following this principle, every person belongs to one of a limited number of named quasi-ritual categories, the ntoro divisions. Members of the same ntoro division are required to observe certain taboos, perform certain rituals, and are believed to have some common personality characteristics. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-734" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-734">[734]</a></sup> 'Consistent with the emphasis on matrilineal descent is the fact that the system of kinship terminology is of the Crow type. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-735" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-735">[735]</a></sup> Female stools and councils complemented male power hierarchies: 'Female stools complemented the hierarchy of male stools. In the village the elders, mpanyinfo, heads of the matrilineages, who constituted with the odekro the village council, had their aberewa or obaapanyin, who looked after the women's affairs. The odekro had an obaapanyin who was responsible for the affairs of the women of the village and was a member of the village council; the ohene, head of a division, and the omanhene, head of the autonomous political community, had their female counterparts known as ohemma, female ruler, who sat on their councils. The ohene and the ohemma were all of the same mogya, blood, or clan. The Asantehemma, the occupant of the female stool of the Kumasi state, and therefore of united Asante, since her male counterpart was ex officio the Asantehene, king of Asante, was a member of the Kotoko council, the executive committee or cabinet of the Asanteman Nhyiamu, general assembly of Asante rulers.' <sup id="cite_ref-736" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-736">[736]</a></sup> 'As members of their respective councils, female stool occupants participated in the legislative and judicial processes, in the making and the unmaking of war, and in the distribution of land, the basic resource of the economy. An ohemma of a state also had her own ntam, oath, a formula for starting the judicial process, and her own court, as well as her own okyeame (spokesman) who in the Akan courts acted as prosecutor and judge.'  <sup id="cite_ref-737" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-737">[737]</a></sup> 'An ohemma was a refuge for a fugitive from the ohene's court who often successfully sought her intervention in cases of the death penalty. Called the ‘mother’ of the ohene, she was the latter's most effective adviser and she had the right to administer to him even a public admonition. The ohemma was the aberewa, wisdom personified: an Akan court panel preceded their retirement to discuss a case before passing judgement by saying that they were going to consult aberewa,the old woman. As the aberewa of the town, the ohemma was the moral guardian of the females of the political community and a kind of moral censor: she examined adolescent girls before the main puberty rites which ushered them into adulthood and licensed their marriage, and was expected to say whether or not pregnancy had occurred before the rites. A girl who was found to have become pregnant before the rites was known as kyiribra, and was punished [Page 94] with ostracism together with her partner. The polity thrived on a sound moral order.' <sup id="cite_ref-738" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-738">[738]</a></sup> 'As the abrewa, the ohemma was also custodian of ‘custom’. She was officially the foremost authority on the genealogy of the royal matrilineage, and hence the first and final arbiter on who was qualified by blood to be a male ruler; it was said of the ohemma's stool in relation to the male stool that it was the elder stool, akonnua panyin. It was the ohemma who played the leading role in the selection of a successor to a deceased or destooled (removed from office) ohene.' <sup id="cite_ref-739" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-739">[739]</a></sup> 'The ohemma's role in the succession to a vacant stool can be understood in terms, first, of the composite nature of most of the Akan matrilineages and, secondly, of the Akan rules of succession. The composite nature of the Akan matrilineage lay not in its segmentation over time and space, but in the incorporation into it of ‘stranger’ segments which in time became concealed; even when it was known it was not permitted for outsiders to point it out. ‘Stranger’ segments could be descended from slave women or freeborn women of another clan who, therefore, were not of pure blood and whose descendants were not eligible for the stool. The ohemma was the one who could pronounce on the fitness of potential successors for the stool from the viewpoint of true descent from the founding ancestors/ancestresses.' <sup id="cite_ref-740" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-740">[740]</a></sup> 'Secondly, while the Akan vested the right of succession in the royal matrilineage, they left open the question of the actual successor among the eligible males, which was resolved by joint consultations between the ohemma, as leader of the royal matrilineage, and the members of the village, divisional, or national council. In the process of consultation the ohemma and the council were governed by the following rules: brothers should succeed each other before sisters' sons in the order of seniority in age; but age could be discounted in favour of superior wisdom and character in a junior person. Seniority in age could also be discounted in favour of a younger successor, if rotational succession among the segments of the royal lineage had been adopted as a ‘convention’ by the lineage and the community as a whole. Where rotation had been adopted as a working rule, both the male and female stools rotated among the segments, so that at any moment the occupants belonged to different competing segments.' <sup id="cite_ref-741" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-741">[741]</a></sup> 'It was the ohemma who operated these rules and ensured orderly succession to the stool. On the decease or de-stoolment of an ohene, the members of the council formally asked the ohemma to nominate a candidate for their approval, and gave her three succeeding options at the end of which the councillors could in turn present a candidate for her approval. It rarely, if ever, came to this. An ohemma consulted members of her matrilineage, her husband, if she had one, and the community at large through discreet inquiries by her nkotimsefo, [Page 95] household servants, who, like the palace functionaries, were so selected as to represent the various sections of the community. The candidate she turned up was thus more often than not the result of communal consensus. It was easy to arrive at this kind of consensus in the small-scale, face-to-face communities of the period before colonial rule.' <sup id="cite_ref-742" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-742">[742]</a></sup> However, female heads of household would delegate authority to eldest sons and other male relatives: 'I have mentioned that the eldest member of the family is recognised as the head, but where this member is a woman, and more particularly where the family is connected with a stool, the head delegates her authority to her eldest son, or the eldest male in the family. Women have, however, been [Page 400] known to occupy the stool as reigning chiefs. Adoption proper is unknown, but if a distressed native commends himself to a family, and they approve, he is received by them as a domestic slave, and, as such, becomes absorbed into it. Again, in Fanti Yankumase, for instance, if a member of another tribe settles with them, and his sept, the Kwonna (say) will not help him, he may choose one of the others, who will, and he henceforth is treated as a member of the latter.' <sup id="cite_ref-743" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-743">[743]</a></sup> According to Rattray, women were not oppressed by husbands and other men due to support from their matrilineage: 'In the chapter on ‘the Ashanti Classificatory System’ it was [Page 79] recorded that wives were inherited in exactly the same way as any other property; even in the case of a chief who is not dead but who has been deposed, or de-stooled as it is called in West Africa, his successor has a perfect right to have his predecessor's wives transferred to him equally with any other stool property. Again, on examination of the marriage laws, it will be found that, under certain circumstances, the native idiom for ‘to marry’ is to 'yere, lit. ‘buy a wife’.' <sup id="cite_ref-744" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-744">[744]</a></sup> 'These two isolated instances, removed from their proper context, might well lead the casual observer to suppose that an Ashanti wife was little better than a man's chattel and to point to the servile condition of women.' <sup id="cite_ref-745" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-745">[745]</a></sup> 'But in Ashanti no woman stands alone, for behind the woman stand a united family, bound by the tie of blood, which has here a power and a meaning we can hardly grasp. ‘If you see one parrot do not throw a stone at it, for there are many others,’ runs one of their sayings.' <sup id="cite_ref-746" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-746">[746]</a></sup> 'The whole conception of ‘mother-right’ affords the woman a protection and a status that is more than an adequate safeguard against the ill-treatment by any male or group of males.' <sup id="cite_ref-747" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-747">[747]</a></sup> 'Her children belong to her and her clan, not to that of her husband.' <sup id="cite_ref-748" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-748">[748]</a></sup> 'All her individually acquired and inherited property is hers and her clan's, and her husband cannot touch it. Not only is this so, but when she dies, no male even of her own clan may be her heir until all her female blood (clan) relations are extinct.' <sup id="cite_ref-749" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-749">[749]</a></sup> 'From these facts it is clear that the position of women in Ashanti is one of great importance.' <sup id="cite_ref-750" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-750">[750]</a></sup> '‘I am the mother of the man,’ she says, and her meaning we cannot understand until a fuller knowledge of Ashanti social and religious organization shows us what is meant.' <sup id="cite_ref-751" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-751">[751]</a></sup> '‘I alone can transmit the blood to a king.’' <sup id="cite_ref-752" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-752">[752]</a></sup> '‘If my sex die in the clan then that very clan becomes extinct, for be there one, or one thousand male members left, not one can transmit the blood, and the life of the clan becomes measured on this earth by the span of a man's life.’' <sup id="cite_ref-753" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-753">[753]</a></sup> Debrunner claims that the status of senior women declined during the colonial period: In the past, old women beyond child bearing age often had honoured social positions—as senior wives of a compound, female elders, recognized mediums (akomfo), priests, even female chiefs. Nowadays however, this has somewhat changed owing to the unequal spreading of education.' <sup id="cite_ref-754" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-754">[754]</a></sup> 'The status of women and especially old women has declined. Young school girls are often rated higher than their mothers and grandmothers by society who call them “awuraa”, madam. Secretly the old women resent it and the younger members feel guilty towards them and therefore try to ward off their guilt feeling by accusing the old women of witchery. A student writes: “Because witchery is mostly attributed to old women, any misfortune that occurs in the family of such a woman is accredited to her. If care is not taken, such women will be cast out from family matters entirely”. Administrator Tauxier finds that the old women are accused by society of witchcraft because they have become useless to it—they cannot have children and cannot give pleasure to men.' <sup id="cite_ref-755" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-755">[755]</a></sup> Farm labour was shared, but participation in crafts was largely restricted to men: 'Men and women share in labor, but both may own farms and houses and both may provide the labor for them. With respect to crafts, only pottery making is a female activity; the others are restricted to male specialists. Even in the case of pottery making, only men are allowed to fashion pots or pipes representing anthropomorphic or zoomorphic figures. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-756" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-756">[756]</a></sup> However, marriage and divorce norms discriminated along gender lines. Husbands could take concubines, but wives could not take (legitimate) lovers (see above). Husbands could divorce their wives: 'The Fantis assert that a man may repudiate his wife at will, but, if no substantial reason is given, he forfeits the dowry and all payments made on her behalf, pays all her expenses, and in addition pays her heavy compensation, so that it is never done. Elsewhere repudiation at will is unknown.' <sup id="cite_ref-757" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-757">[757]</a></sup> 'The following are held to be good grounds on which a husband may divorce his wife:— (1) Adultery. (2) Repeatedly insulting the husband's parents. (3) Refusal on the part of the woman to cohabit, after the man has preferred his claim against an adulterer. (4) If she becomes a notorious thief or criminal. (5) If she persists in not consenting to his taking another wife. (6) If the wife practises witchcraft. (7) Desertion.' <sup id="cite_ref-758" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-758">[758]</a></sup> 'In all these cases it is usual for both families to meet, and appoint an arbitrator, who may be the chief or any other person to whose decision they agree to submit. The case is gone into in the presence of both families, and if the grounds are held to be sufficient, the man is ordered to “chop” ( i.e., pipe-clay) the neck and breast of the woman, and she has to parade the town to publish the fact, and to show that she is free to marry again. If she was in the wrong, the man could then claim from her family restitution of the dowry, and all the expenses he had incurred throughout the marriage on her behalf, except the actual expense of maintaining her, doctor's bills, and the cloths that she had worn out; all jewels and the cloths that he had given her and which were not worn out are also returned. In Assin she is chalked on the foot. In Denkera she is not chalked at all, and here, although actual current expenses are awarded, they are invariably remitted.' <sup id="cite_ref-759" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-759">[759]</a></sup> 'In the case of adultery, the husband can turn the woman [Page 47] out on the spot and refuse her all further support. Inquiry might show that she had committeed adultery after gross ill-treatment or desertion; in such cases a divorce would be decreed, but the man would forfeit his expenses. For adultery he also has an alternative, in that he could sue the adulterer for damages (Birebu), which might be more than the expenses that he could claim, and are never less; this depends on his position. In Cape Coast he has to elect, and cannot claim a divorce at the same time; he can only proceed to a divorce if the woman now refuses to pay some small satisfaction, and further refuses to live with him. In Assin he may divorce as well as claim. When a wife repeatedly inveighs against her husband's family, the family take the matter up, and the husband has to get a divorce or break with his family, but all endeavours are first made to persuade the woman to desist.' <sup id="cite_ref-760" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-760">[760]</a></sup> 'In the case of theft, unless the wife is notorious, she pacifies the husband with a sheep, and the marriage continues. If the husband refuses, he forfeits his moneys; if the woman refuses, he can claim all.' <sup id="cite_ref-761" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-761">[761]</a></sup> 'Where a woman refuses her consent to a new wife, she is invariably won over by a handsome dash.' <sup id="cite_ref-762" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-762">[762]</a></sup> Women could not divorce their husbands directly, but courts could order men to divorce their wives on their behalf: 'A wife cannot divorce her husband, and the husband may always claim the Ayifur if she marries any other man without being first chalked. She can, however, take him before a native court on the following grounds:—(1) Continuous illtreatment. (2) His repeated insults to her family. (3) Aggravated assault. (4) If he is a notorious thief. (5) Desertion.' <sup id="cite_ref-763" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-763">[763]</a></sup> 'If she gets judgment the court orders the husband to “chop” her to show she is free; he further forfeits all his expenses, and has to give up all her property that he has in his possession. Also, if there have been loans or money transactions between them, accounts are rendered and balances struck. In Fanti Yankumase the husband is entitled to recover his expenses in all cases of divorce.' <sup id="cite_ref-764" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-764">[764]</a></sup> We are unsure whether the above comments on divorce also apply to the pre-Ashanti period or whether they only apply to the colonial period. But given how women could not occupy 'male' stools, we have decided to code 'present'. However, it appears that gender complementarity rather than either gender equality or gender stratification was the norm.</dd>

Security of tenure was based on working the land. Abandoned land reverted to the stool. Rights to land were inherited matrilineally. Today Akan have the right to sell land although leasing seems to be the preferred arrangement. [IS]' <sup id="cite_ref-769" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-769">[769]</a></sup> 'The localized matrilineage tracing descent from a known common female ancestor for a period of 10 to 12 generations is the basic unit for political, legal, and ritual purposes.

[ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-770" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-770">[770]</a></sup> Lineage segments were differentiated along the lines of heritable interest in property: 'Segments: While the lineage as a whole has some corporate concern with sponsoring the funeral of any of its members and with assigning that member's property to an heir, heritable interests in various properties can differentiate lineage members. Subsets of the membership of a lineage — equalling lineage segments — are defined by the existence of any property for which members of the subsets (exclusive of others) are potential heirs. Such sets (subsets of the whole) may range from, at the one extreme, only the actual children of some man's actual sisters (in the case of property that he himself created) to, at the other extreme, all the members of the lineage (in the case of property, in effect, created by the lineage founder). In Egyaa, only chiefly positions fall in the long-lived extreme, while (almost) all other created property (in Egyaa) falls in or near the short-lived extreme. No property in Egyaa falls enough in between the two extremes to matter, but property that survived long enough to be inherited through several generations (but not substantially longer) were such to exist, would create sets of members representing intermediate segments of the lineage's membership.' <sup id="cite_ref-771" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-771">[771]</a></sup> Slavery was practiced: 'The Akan practiced slavery, obtaining slaves from northern slave dealers, usually Muslims. War captives, criminals, persons who opposed local chiefs, and many local ritual leaders were also enslaved. Slaves were used for domestic and field labor, for sale to traders across the Sahara and Atlantic, and as sacrifices to royal and other ancestors. In the middle of the nineteenth century, slaves amounted to half of the population in many towns. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-772" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-772">[772]</a></sup> Wealthy urban families relied on unfree labour, but wealth stratification had emerged before the colonial and Ashanti periods: 'The Portuguese “blueprint” of 1572 associates gold mining, forest clearing, and food production, and implicitly postulates the existence [Page 96] of an appropriating class and a producing class. It is, I suggest, mutatis mutandis, a paradigm of sorts for the early Akan state. Those who controlled the production and sale of gold were those able to procure a supply of unfree labor. Those who procured unfree labor were those able to create arable land within the forest. Those who created the arable were those who founded the numerous early Akan polities. We see, in other words, a class of Akan entrepreneurs emerging: a class of those able to use the strength of the world bullion market, and the availability of labor locally (whether through Wangara or Portuguese suppliers), in such a way as to create the new agrarian system. These entrepreneurs were known as the aberemp[unavailable]n (sing. [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n), literally “big men” but correctly glossed in an early European source as “a superior rich man.” ' <sup id="cite_ref-773" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-773">[773]</a></sup> 'Akan village histories make frequent reference to hunters ranging the forest in search of land suitable for agricultural exploitation—taking account, presumably, of surface relief, water resources, soil, and so forth. The role of the aberemp[unavailable]n in these explorations is often described in considerable detail. By way of illustration I shall cite the cases of two, Tabiri Heman and Akuamoa Panin.' <sup id="cite_ref-774" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-774">[774]</a></sup> 'The descendants of free settlers became [unavailable]manmufo, citizens. Those of the proprietors became adehyeε, nobility. There remain the unfree laborers. They must surely be those who became the third major element in the composition of an [unavailable]man, namely the gyaasefo. Literally “the people of the hearth,” they were absorbed into Akan society as servants of the adehyeε. They became responsible not only for their own subsistence but for that of the nobles. They farmed for them, assumed responsibility for their debts, and provided them with a wide range of personal services as stool-carriers, drummers, hornblowers, umbrella-carriers, bathroom attendants, messengers, tradesmen, sextons, and so forth. Their masters (or mistresses) were heirs to their property. Their status, unlike that of nobles and citizens, was transmitted through the male line. Rattray commented on the matter: [Page 100] 'There is little doubt that the Gyasefo were in olden times recruited from the slave class. A “Stool” slave became one of the Gyasefo. The descendants of a Gyase woman were of course considered as Gyasefo, down the female line for all time; not only was this so, but the son of a Gyase man would ordinarily also enter the office to which his father belonged, irrespective of the position of his mother.' <sup id="cite_ref-775" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-775">[775]</a></sup> 'It is virtually impossible to render such terms as adehyeε, [unavailable]manmufo and gyaasefo into English with the appropriate nuances. Adehyeε may preside over the affairs of anything from villages on the one hand to kingdoms on the other. Their power will rest in no small measure upon the sheer numbers of gyaasefo whose services they command; indeed, this is one index of their rank. In 1936 Oheneba Sakyi Djan manfully struggled with the problem, though with reference to the more southerly forest Akan: 'The term “Gyaase”…applies to the most immediate adherents attached to the household of any important personage. In this instance, even an ordinary well-to-do man (rich man) may have his own Gyaase, so much so that the head of a family (Opanyin or Atrankonnua) or a ruler of a town (Odekro), or a head of a division of a state (Ohene) or the supreme head or king of a state (Omanhene) should necessarily have his own Gyaase-men, and the number of the members constituting the Gyaase of each of the above heads depends on the importance of the party concerned. That is to say, the number of the members of the Gyaase attached to the Ohene's household is by far fewer than that attached to the Omanhene household.' It was all to do with achievement. The fortunes of an [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n depended first on his ability to procure the labor that, the estate established, became his gyaasefo, and second on his ability to attract free settlers to the estate. Measured in these terms the relatively unsuccessful [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n emerged as no more than a village head, an [unavailable]dekuro, and was absorbed in time into the aman (qua state) of his more successful peer, the [unavailable]hene of this or that group of towns and villages, and he in turn into the aman (qua kingdom) of those even more successful. We turn to a consideration of the most successful of all.' <sup id="cite_ref-776" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-776">[776]</a></sup> 'ON THE BASIS OF HIS observations of Kumase society in 1817, Bowdich became strongly aware of the degree of social stratification present. Of the many indicators of this—housing, diet, hygiene, toiletry, marriage, and so forth —he commented most fully on matters of the household economy:[Page 140] 'the higher class could not support their numerous followers, or the lower their large families, in the city, and therefore employed them in plantations (in which small crooms [villages] were situated) generally within two or three miles of the capital, where their labours not only feed themselves, but supply the wants of the chief, his family, and more immediate suite. The middling orders station their slaves for the same purpose, and also to collect fruit and vegetables for sale, and when their children become numerous, a part are generally sent to be supported by these slaves in the bush.' <sup id="cite_ref-777" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-777">[777]</a></sup> 'Bowdich's “higher class” would appear to refer to the wealthy citizens, high officeholders for the most part, whose gyaasefo or “retainers” supported them; his “middling orders” to aspirant citizens  in the process of creating, through utilization of slaves, their own gyaasefo; and his “lower class” to those who perforce ensured their survival by the use of family labor. If Bowdich may be understood to be suggesting that the commanding morality of metropolitan society was one of upward mobility based on wealth, then he was undoubtedly correct. Had Bowdich remained in Kumase a few months longer, he would have observed that upward mobility was an institutionalized process.' <sup id="cite_ref-778" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-778">[778]</a></sup> Accordingly, political influence was tied to wealth. While attributing class structures to non-capitalist economies is difficult, Wilks distinguishes between 'nobles', an emerging urban 'bourgeoisie', free farmers, and unfree servants in the Ashanti period: 'It is notoriously difficult to characterize the class structure of precapitalist societies. To this generalization Asante is no exception, though R. A. Kea's studies of a number of seventeenth century Akan polities have provided an invaluable lead.  For present purposes the postulate is that a class reproduces itself as a class and that it does so only insofar as it has a determinate and specific, though not necessarily direct, relationship to the means of production. Consider, for example, the Asante class of the adehyeε, a word commonly but inappropriately translated [Page 294] “royalty” in English. “The old adage” (and I quote the collective wisdom of the late Asantehene and his councillors in a judgment passed down in 1964) “is that a royal is one whose ancestor had established or founded a village." This succinct statement of traditional usage defines a class within Asante society by implicit reference to a set of proprietary rights over land exercised by those who were thereby able to appropriate, in the form of tributes, taxes, and services, part of the labor-value of others settled on the land. I have elsewhere suggested that the origins of the adehyeε class are to be sought in the context of the great economic transformations associated with the development of forest agriculture. I have also suggested that the gyaasefo emerged as a servile class in precisely the same context. In this chapter I argue that the asomfo, or those in administrative service, came to constitute a class within Asante society in precisely the same sense of class. Unlike both adehyeε and gyaasefo, however, the asomfo class emerged in an urban rather than rural context, and at a much later date: its full development was, therefore, specific to Asante rather than common to Akan society in general.' <sup id="cite_ref-779" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-779">[779]</a></sup> While this 'bourgeoisie' or group of 'parvenus' may have been absent prior to the Ashanti period, wealth stratification itself was present. Given how leadership titles were tied to matrilineages, we have decided to code 'present'.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Ethnicity or race ♣ present ♥</b> In Ashanti, the emerging peasant class was largely made up of assimilated non-Asante: 'Arhin's article is a most welcome corrective to ideological arguments which attempt to force complex realities into simple schemes. His argument (re: Fallers) that a culturally distinct peasantry can be identified in precolonial Asante is supported, as he notes, by a large and growing body of historical work. Some of this research amplifies the urban/rural distinction even more than Arhin himself does: e.g., Wilks's (1975) discussion of the importance of the urban mercantile class (the asikafo) and his discussion of the way in which the state, embodied in the city itself, enforced its power. It is impossible to discuss the rise of the Asante state without talking about the rise of Kumasi as an urban center. By definition, the rise of the state therefore presupposes the rise of a hinterland and a peasantry. Unless one were to question whether the state existed at all (which no one is doing), there is not much question about a peasantry's existing, economically, politically, and culturally.' <sup id="cite_ref-780" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-780">[780]</a></sup> 'There are a few points which could be emphasized: the cultural distinctiveness of the peasantry is due, in part, to the enormous numbers of strangers (particularly northerners) assimilated into Asante. As the slave trade decreased in the early 19th century, after abolition, large numbers of northerners had to be absorbed into the Asante populace. As Wilks describes, the government had very specific policies for carrying out this absorption. Thus, the urban/rural distinction is not simply one of “class” (which Arhin himself says is very unclear), but also, on some level, an ethnic one. In Asante the ethnic lines became more and more blurred, and the assimilationist policy made and continues to make discussion of this issue difficult; but it is clear that in everyone's attempt to be a “Kumasi” person there is also an attempt to certify one's unquestionable (free) Asante origins, which Arhin calls the “distinctively indigenous.”' <sup id="cite_ref-781" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-781">[781]</a></sup> The same was true of other Akan states: 'Terray has already applied the concept “peasant” to the neighbouring Abron and, comparatively, to Asante (Terray 1974, 1975), but his usage differs from mine, perhaps because the political structures of the Abron and the Asante differ. For Terray the Abron peasant “classes” consist of the subject Kulango people, whom the Akan-Abron conquered before establishing a “conquest state,” a few Abron subjects, and above all slaves acquired through raids and warfare and by purchase. It is from these that the state, dominated by the Abron aristocracy, extracted its surpluses, and it is they that the state exploited. The slaves, in particular, formed the main labour force in the gold mines owned by the aristocrats and provided the main reason for the existence of the state.' <sup id="cite_ref-782" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-782">[782]</a></sup> 'Strangers' were not part of established kin networks: 'People have travelled from the Northern Territories or the Colony to Ashanti in search of employment. Some of them have settled there more or less permanently. There are many people from these areas who have lived in Ashanti most of their lives, but they are outside the Ashanti political structure. They are ‘strangers’, no matter how long they live there.' <sup id="cite_ref-783" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-783">[783]</a></sup> 'Even Ashantis are ‘strangers’ outside their own Divisions. There are many Ashantis living in Divisions other than those in which they are subjects by kinship. This is particularly so in Kumasi, where the opportunities of employment have attracted people from all parts of Ashanti. With reference to the kinship political organization, these Ashantis are strangers, just as are the settlers from the Northern Territories and the Colony.' <sup id="cite_ref-784" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-784">[784]</a></sup> 'These permanent but ‘stranger’ settlers, who have no political status in the traditional organization based on kinship, present the chiefs with a new problem, which has arisen most acutely in connexion with taxation.' <sup id="cite_ref-785" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-785">[785]</a></sup> The legal rights of 'strangers' were restricted: 'Asante men and women drew power and income from a well-developed internal marketplace system with three distinct types of market, in which chiefly regulations protected their privilege as traders and carriers. Non-Asantes were restricted from trading within Asante during most of the nineteenth century, so goods from outside passed into Asante hands at the officially designated border markets whose location contracted with the limits of effective political control (Wilks 1975). Quantities of imported consumer goods, mainly manufactures and crafts, passed from border markets either to the urban daily markets or directly to the regional periodic markets in leading Asante towns (Akoto 1980). These linked the rural population to the border markets and to other parts of Asante with different food supplies. Urban daily markets in Kumasi and leading provincial capitals served the needs of town dwellers for food and consumption goods of all kinds (Lewin 1974).' <sup id="cite_ref-786" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-786">[786]</a></sup> Mixed marriages were rare and in-marrying individuals were expected to conform to local norms: 'Mahommedan law has not influenced these marriage or family customs in the slightest degree; on the contrary, if a Hausa marries a Fanti he must conform to Fanti custom, unless the girl first embraces Mahommedanism, which is very rare, and even then her children are still held to belong to the Fanti family. Such mixed marriages are, however, rare, and are altogether unknown to the Omanhin of Denkera.' <sup id="cite_ref-787" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-787">[787]</a></sup> We have assumed this was also the case in Akan states prior to the Ashanti period.</dd></dl>

The basic group is the clan, of which there are eight; they are dispersed among the many kingdoms. Members of a subclan tend to occupy a single town or village. The clan is an exogamous group. It is comprised of constituent groups that may be referred to as lineages, but these do not form any kind of segmentary lineage system, lineages being attached to others by propinquity and the power and wealth of the host lineage. Although there has been much confusion in accounts of the Akan peoples between matriliny and matriarchy, authority within clans and lineages is held firmly by men, succession being from a man to his brother or to his closest sister's son.' <sup id="cite_ref-802" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-802">[802]</a></sup> 'A child inherits his or her blood from the mother, and character or temperament from the father. Maternal blood ensures the child's membership in the ABUSUA (clan or lineage); paternity bestows membership in one of nine other groups or categories. Although some accounts claim the Akan descent system is one of double descent, this view appears to be based on a misreading of the actual roles of the two lines of descent. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-803" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-803">[803]</a></sup> 'There are groups in which membership is transmitted patrilineally, but these are neither exogamous nor corporate groups; nor are jural or political rights or duties derived from paternal descent. What is involved is the concept of NTORO; the male transmitted NTORO (spirit) which forms a unique spiritual bond between father and son. Following this principle, every person belongs to one of a limited number of named quasi-ritual categories, the ntoro divisions. Members of the same ntoro division are required to observe certain taboos, perform certain rituals, and are believed to have some common personality characteristics. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-804" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-804">[804]</a></sup> 'Consistent with the emphasis on matrilineal descent is the fact that the system of kinship terminology is of the Crow type. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-805" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-805">[805]</a></sup> Clans held and transmitted land: 'The localized matrilineage tracing descent from a known common female ancestor for a period of 10 to 12 generations is the basic unit for political, legal, and ritual purposes. Succession and inheritance rules stress sex, generation, and age, with men having precedence over women, "brothers" over "sisters' sons," and senior over junior. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-806" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-806">[806]</a></sup> 'Land was the unalienable possession of the clan--actually the clan's ancestral spirits were considered the true owners of the land and the tribal land's living occupants only trustees or tenants. Security of tenure was based on working the land. Abandoned land reverted to the stool. Rights to land were inherited matrilineally. Today Akan have the right to sell land although leasing seems to be the preferred arrangement. [IS]' <sup id="cite_ref-807" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-807">[807]</a></sup>  But inheritance was divided between a man's matrilineage and his own offspring: 'Despite being jurally matrilineal, inheritance is to some extent divided between sister's children and a man's own children. The basic principle is that lineage-inherited property goes to sisters' children, and property acquired with the help of a man's wife and children is distributed among the latter at his death. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-808" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-808">[808]</a></sup> Households cultivated family farms: 'The farm, known in Asante as the afuo, was essentially a smallholding capable of supporting a single family. It consisted of two or sometimes three distinct parts, the afuwa, mfufuwa and mfufuwa-nini. The land currently under cultivation was the afuwa, “the little farm” or field, and the land under fallow was the mfufuwa, literally “the non- afuwa.” A farmer's rights of tenure over his fallow were as secure as those over his land under cultivation. In some cases a farm may have attached to it further land — fallow that has not been brought back into cultivation at the appropriate time because, for example, of unsatisfactory yields or of the inability of the tenants (through illnesses, deaths, or the like) to resume cropping it. Such land is the mfufuwa-nini, literally “barren fallow.” The original tenants and their heirs retain rights to the produce from it — to the fruits of palm and kola trees, for example, and to firewood and poles — but Asante law appears not to have defined with any precision the point in time at which others might acquire rights in it and recommence farming operations. Much litigation results.' <sup id="cite_ref-809" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-809">[809]</a></sup> Land became the property of clans through clearing of forests and cultivation. Wilks describes the process of establishing estates: 'Akan village histories make frequent reference to hunters ranging the forest in search of land suitable for agricultural exploitation—taking account, presumably, of surface relief, water resources, soil, and so forth. The role of the aberemp[unavailable]n in these explorations is often described in considerable detail. By way of illustration I shall cite the cases of two, Tabiri Heman and Akuamoa Panin.' <sup id="cite_ref-810" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-810">[810]</a></sup> 'The aberemp[unavailable]n were essentially developers. They created estates, founding villages and clearing the arable land necessary for subsistence. I refer to such estates as “ beremp[unavailable]n-doms” (by analogy with “kingdoms,” “chiefdoms,” etc.). Of the actual work of felling, clearing, and building, and of how the imported unfree labor was used, we know nothing. Such is not the stuff of tradition. Kea has drawn attention to a possible model, that of Aduafo of Afutu and “other great lords” who had contracted with the Danish African Company to clear a site and construct a trading post for them. They brought 300 of their slaves to the site and divided them [Page 98] into two teams. One carried out the clearing while the other assembled the building materials. This was, however, at a coastal location and is therefore of uncertain relevance.' <sup id="cite_ref-811" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-811">[811]</a></sup> 'If the creation of an estate was predicated on the procurement of unfree labor, its prosperity depended on free settlers being attracted to it. Such was the pressure on land, on arable land, that they came. Sometimes the original estate was subdivided by purchase. For example, Adu Gyamfi, by origin from Adansemanso, founded a settlement named Aboforumu. It lay about 12 miles northwest of what was to become Kumase. He subsequently sold (“as the explorers or the owners of the land”) part of the estate to new settlers, Amma Badu and Antwi, who paid him mperedwan aduosia, 60 peredwans or some 135 oz. of gold. The estate was soon to be divided yet again. We have met Akosua Yitua of Asantemanso and her son Danso Abeam, above. She had five daughters. The third of these settled at Amoaman, but her descendants “became hemmed in at this village.” They moved northward, and their leader, Adu Panin, purchased a block of land from Amma Badu and Antwi. He renamed it Ntonso. The price is not reported. The transaction is said to have occurred at the time of Oti Akenten of Kumase. Other cases did not involve purchase, but contract sometimes sealed by marriage. The case of Kyerewa Akenten and her brother, Kagya, is instructive. They left Asantemanso in search of land and, after rejecting several places as unsuitable, arrived at Oyoko, near Feyiase. They went from there 'to Odum-Anaafuo to ask Berefo Kese, the Chief of the place for some land to settle on. He showed them a site where they built their village which they named “Kagya-kurom” [Kagya's village]. Owing to the large number of the followers of Kagya and his sister, Berefo Kese presented them a large portion of his lands on which they farmed. From Kagya-kurom Berefo Kese married Kyerewa Akenten and after their marriage Berefo Kese added a much larger portion of his lands to that already in their hands and presented it to them.' <sup id="cite_ref-812" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-812">[812]</a></sup> 'Obtaining land involved negotiation with the [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n who had developed it, who had (as it were) staked out first claims to it. Matrifiliation as such conferred no rights of settlement. It will follow that the free settlers within a beremp[unavailable]n-dom belonged to different matriclans. In fact these are dispersed almost randomly throughout forest society. As Fortes has remarked, the matriclan “delimits a diffuse field of amity, wide in extent but of minimal structural specificity.” Within the beremp[unavailable]n-dom, of the rule of exogamy, and in that respect was a socially integrative factor. But claims to land were based upon the heritable rights that the [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n conferred upon the settlers, and the matrilineages that thus arose were tied to specific tracts of land within the estate.' <sup id="cite_ref-813" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-813">[813]</a></sup> 'From the fifteenth century onward numerous estates or beremp[unavailable]n-doms arose as the frontier of farming expanded outward from the Adanse and Amansie regions. Such has been the thrust of the argument. Some were in time to become the capitals of aman, of states; some were to be incorporated into such states; and some were to falter and vanish. The struggles that attended the process are exhaustively chronicled in Akan traditions; the nature of the process itself, whereby a class of entrepreneurs became transformed into a ruling class, is not. The key lies in an understanding of the peculiar features of Akan land proprietorship.' <sup id="cite_ref-814" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-814">[814]</a></sup> 'A cardinal feature of the system is expressed in the maxim, afuo mu yε me deε, asase yε [unavailable]hene deε, “the farm is my property, the land is the king's.” It is necessary to extrapolate from more recent practice, described by Rattray, Busia, and Fortes among others. If the proprietor of the land conferred heritable rights to the arable on those who were permitted to settle, he also reserved or established certain rights to himself and his heirs — to his “stool.” He took an almost token part of the harvest at the time of the annual harvest festival (the odwira), but required a more substantial share of the produce of the land as opposed to the arable: fish, snails, game, kola, minerals, and the like. He could levy a wide range of taxes, such as peato for military expenses, ayieto for funerals, and [unavailable]manto to defray the costs of making regalia and putting up buildings. Most importantly, he could require the provision of labor for military service or, for example, for work on the roads. Such, briefly, were what led Potekhin to refer to “the relatively easy feudal dues of the free members of the community.” Relatively easy” they may or may not have been; there was variation from place to place and time to time. “Feudal” they were not, for the free settlers acquired almost unassailable titles to the land they farmed, while the various taxes and services provided to the landholder were ad hoc and sporadic and did not approximate in character to a rent, whether economic or otherwise.' <sup id="cite_ref-815" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-815">[815]</a></sup> 'The descendants of free settlers became [unavailable]manmufo, citizens. Those of the proprietors became adehyeε, nobility. There remain the unfree laborers. They must surely be those who became the third major element in the composition of an [unavailable]man, namely the gyaasefo. Literally “the people of the hearth,” they were absorbed into Akan society as servants of the adehyeε. They became responsible not only for their own subsistence but for that of the nobles. They farmed for them, assumed responsibility for their debts, and provided them with a wide range of personal services as stool-carriers, drummers, hornblowers, umbrella-carriers, bathroom attendants, messengers, tradesmen, sextons, and so forth. Their masters (or mistresses) were heirs to their property. Their status, unlike that of nobles and citizens, was transmitted through the male line. Rattray commented on the matter: [Page 100] 'There is little doubt that the Gyasefo were in olden times recruited from the slave class. A “Stool” slave became one of the Gyasefo. The descendants of a Gyase woman were of course considered as Gyasefo, down the female line for all time; not only was this so, but the son of a Gyase man would ordinarily also enter the office to which his father belonged, irrespective of the position of his mother.' <sup id="cite_ref-816" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-816">[816]</a></sup> While wealth stratification was present, all free individuals could own property in principle. We have assumed this was true of both the Ashanti and pre-Ashanti periods.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Bureaucratic positions are open to people from all ethnic/racial groups ♣ ♥</b> The Ashanti period was characterized by a trend towards greater bureaucratization and functional specialization: 'State organisation became extremely complex in the Kumasi state because at the close of the 17th century it became the capital of the union of Asante states and, in the course of the following century, the seat of an empire which was roughly coterminous with the boundaries of modern Ghana and southeastern Ivory Coast (Wilks 1975: 374-86). The expansion of the state made necessary administrative reforms within Kumasi itself and for the maintenance of effective relations between the Asantehene, the head of the Asante Union and, by consent, also the head of the Kumasi state, and the heads of the conquered territories. The palace administration ( gyase) was expanded with appointive headships of innumerable functional units or palace associations ( afekuo, sing. fekuo) (Rattray 1929: 81-92; Wilks 1967: 214-28; Hagan 1971). The memberships of the palace associations, each of which had either military or nonmilitary functions, cut across the divisions, so that they formed checks on, and counterpoises to, the traditional power units. The heads of the most important of the palace associations, including the units assigned to the offspring of former and reigning Asantehene (Busia 1951: 95), were included in the state council. Since appointments to the headships of the palace associations were in the gift of the Asantehene, the administrative reform represented an intrusion of patrimonialism (Weber 1947: 347) into the traditional political organisation.' <sup id="cite_ref-817" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-817">[817]</a></sup> 'The vast area brought under Asante control by force or threat of arms could not be governed unless new methods of controlling it were developed. From the 1760s, beginning under Asantehene Osei Kwadwo, various steps were taken to bring the control of outlying areas directly under Kumase [...] Senior officeholders in Kumase were placed in charge of particular areas of the administration, controlling considerable numbers of lesser officials. Some supervised the trade in ivory and kola, while others oversaw the gold-producing regions which now fell within the borders of Asante. A form of treasury partly staffed by literate Muslims was created. Groups within the capital began to build up expertise in particular areas of administration and to concentrate on this as a way to power and wealth. Careers began to open for those with intelligence, negotiating skill and a steady nerve.' <sup id="cite_ref-818" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-818">[818]</a></sup> 'Significant changes in Asante administrative practice, in the direction of increasing specialization of role, were attributed to Asantehene Osei Kwadwo (1764-1777). The class of administrators was a growing one, but I do not think we should yet speak of an administrative class emerging, one reproducing itself as a class.' <sup id="cite_ref-819" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-819">[819]</a></sup> The purpose of this new administrative structure was to 'enforce subordination of the conquered rulers to the Asantehene. For this purpose the Asante kings used an administrative staff recruited from their gyase, household organization, consisting of units of functionaries with appointive headships [...] These palace associations, called afekuo (Reondorf, 1895: 119; Rattray, 1929: 91), were recruited from free attendants, warcaptives, purchased slaves (nnonkofo), and other bondsmen; in other words, persons connected by “ties of personal loyalty” (Weber, 1947: 342) to the various Asante Kings.' <sup id="cite_ref-820" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-820">[820]</a></sup> Appointed officials and other dependents increasingly displaced the hereditary authority of 'traditional' public functionaries: 'From Opoku Ware (1720-50) to Kwaku Duah (1834-67), these personal dependants competed with, and replaced the holders of hereditary authority, occupants of royal stools ( adehye nnwa), in Kumasi and in the component states of the Asante Union in the exercise of authority and the collection of tribute and other payments in the conquered territories. Wilks (1967: 211-214) has called this administrative organization the “Kwadwoan revolution” on the ground that it took firm root in the reign of Osei Kwadwo (1864-77) although it began in that of Opoku Ware, and has identified it as the emergence of Asante “bureaucracy”.' <sup id="cite_ref-821" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-821">[821]</a></sup> Senior public functionaries had a stool system of their own: 'In Kumasi proper there were seventy-seven stools, representing seventy-seven public functionaries, as, for example, the Bantuma Chief, or the Chief of the Royal Burial Grove, the Ateni Chief, or the Chief of the Lamplighters.' <sup id="cite_ref-822" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-822">[822]</a></sup> Some foreigners were employed in highly specialized roles: 'A form of treasury partly staffed by literate Muslims was created.

Careers began to open for those with intelligence, negotiating skill and a steady nerve.' <sup id="cite_ref-823" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-823">[823]</a></sup> However, it appears that this process did not predate the Ashanti period.</dd>

<dd><b>♠ Property can be owned by people from all ethnic/racial groups ♣ present ♥</b> Society was organized in matrilineal clans: 'All Akan groups recognize matrilineal descent. The basic group is the clan, of which there are eight; they are dispersed among the many kingdoms. Members of a subclan tend to occupy a single town or village. The clan is an exogamous group. It is comprised of constituent groups that may be referred to as lineages, but these do not form any kind of segmentary lineage system, lineages being attached to others by propinquity and the power and wealth of the host lineage. Although there has been much confusion in accounts of the Akan peoples between matriliny and matriarchy, authority within clans and lineages is held firmly by men, succession being from a man to his brother or to his closest sister's son.' <sup id="cite_ref-824" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-824">[824]</a></sup> 'A child inherits his or her blood from the mother, and character or temperament from the father. Maternal blood ensures the child's membership in the ABUSUA (clan or lineage); paternity bestows membership in one of nine other groups or categories. Although some accounts claim the Akan descent system is one of double descent, this view appears to be based on a misreading of the actual roles of the two lines of descent. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-825" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-825">[825]</a></sup> 'There are groups in which membership is transmitted patrilineally, but these are neither exogamous nor corporate groups; nor are jural or political rights or duties derived from paternal descent. What is involved is the concept of NTORO; the male transmitted NTORO (spirit) which forms a unique spiritual bond between father and son. Following this principle, every person belongs to one of a limited number of named quasi-ritual categories, the ntoro divisions. Members of the same ntoro division are required to observe certain taboos, perform certain rituals, and are believed to have some common personality characteristics. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-826" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-826">[826]</a></sup> 'Consistent with the emphasis on matrilineal descent is the fact that the system of kinship terminology is of the Crow type. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-827" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-827">[827]</a></sup> Clans held and transmitted land: 'The localized matrilineage tracing descent from a known common female ancestor for a period of 10 to 12 generations is the basic unit for political, legal, and ritual purposes. Succession and inheritance rules stress sex, generation, and age, with men having precedence over women, "brothers" over "sisters' sons," and senior over junior. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-828" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-828">[828]</a></sup> 'Land was the unalienable possession of the clan--actually the clan's ancestral spirits were considered the true owners of the land and the tribal land's living occupants only trustees or tenants. Security of tenure was based on working the land. Abandoned land reverted to the stool. Rights to land were inherited matrilineally. Today Akan have the right to sell land although leasing seems to be the preferred arrangement. [IS]' <sup id="cite_ref-829" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-829">[829]</a></sup>  But inheritance was divided between a man's matrilineage and his own offspring: 'Despite being jurally matrilineal, inheritance is to some extent divided between sister's children and a man's own children. The basic principle is that lineage-inherited property goes to sisters' children, and property acquired with the help of a man's wife and children is distributed among the latter at his death. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-830" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-830">[830]</a></sup> Households cultivated family farms: 'The farm, known in Asante as the afuo, was essentially a smallholding capable of supporting a single family. It consisted of two or sometimes three distinct parts, the afuwa, mfufuwa and mfufuwa-nini. The land currently under cultivation was the afuwa, “the little farm” or field, and the land under fallow was the mfufuwa, literally “the non- afuwa.” A farmer's rights of tenure over his fallow were as secure as those over his land under cultivation. In some cases a farm may have attached to it further land — fallow that has not been brought back into cultivation at the appropriate time because, for example, of unsatisfactory yields or of the inability of the tenants (through illnesses, deaths, or the like) to resume cropping it. Such land is the mfufuwa-nini, literally “barren fallow.” The original tenants and their heirs retain rights to the produce from it — to the fruits of palm and kola trees, for example, and to firewood and poles — but Asante law appears not to have defined with any precision the point in time at which others might acquire rights in it and recommence farming operations. Much litigation results.' <sup id="cite_ref-831" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-831">[831]</a></sup> Land became the property of clans through clearing of forests and cultivation. Wilks describes the process of establishing estates: 'Akan village histories make frequent reference to hunters ranging the forest in search of land suitable for agricultural exploitation—taking account, presumably, of surface relief, water resources, soil, and so forth. The role of the aberemp[unavailable]n in these explorations is often described in considerable detail. By way of illustration I shall cite the cases of two, Tabiri Heman and Akuamoa Panin.' <sup id="cite_ref-832" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-832">[832]</a></sup> 'The aberemp[unavailable]n were essentially developers. They created estates, founding villages and clearing the arable land necessary for subsistence. I refer to such estates as “ beremp[unavailable]n-doms” (by analogy with “kingdoms,” “chiefdoms,” etc.). Of the actual work of felling, clearing, and building, and of how the imported unfree labor was used, we know nothing. Such is not the stuff of tradition. Kea has drawn attention to a possible model, that of Aduafo of Afutu and “other great lords” who had contracted with the Danish African Company to clear a site and construct a trading post for them. They brought 300 of their slaves to the site and divided them [Page 98] into two teams. One carried out the clearing while the other assembled the building materials. This was, however, at a coastal location and is therefore of uncertain relevance.' <sup id="cite_ref-833" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-833">[833]</a></sup> 'If the creation of an estate was predicated on the procurement of unfree labor, its prosperity depended on free settlers being attracted to it. Such was the pressure on land, on arable land, that they came. Sometimes the original estate was subdivided by purchase. For example, Adu Gyamfi, by origin from Adansemanso, founded a settlement named Aboforumu. It lay about 12 miles northwest of what was to become Kumase. He subsequently sold (“as the explorers or the owners of the land”) part of the estate to new settlers, Amma Badu and Antwi, who paid him mperedwan aduosia, 60 peredwans or some 135 oz. of gold. The estate was soon to be divided yet again. We have met Akosua Yitua of Asantemanso and her son Danso Abeam, above. She had five daughters. The third of these settled at Amoaman, but her descendants “became hemmed in at this village.” They moved northward, and their leader, Adu Panin, purchased a block of land from Amma Badu and Antwi. He renamed it Ntonso. The price is not reported. The transaction is said to have occurred at the time of Oti Akenten of Kumase. Other cases did not involve purchase, but contract sometimes sealed by marriage. The case of Kyerewa Akenten and her brother, Kagya, is instructive. They left Asantemanso in search of land and, after rejecting several places as unsuitable, arrived at Oyoko, near Feyiase. They went from there 'to Odum-Anaafuo to ask Berefo Kese, the Chief of the place for some land to settle on. He showed them a site where they built their village which they named “Kagya-kurom” [Kagya's village]. Owing to the large number of the followers of Kagya and his sister, Berefo Kese presented them a large portion of his lands on which they farmed. From Kagya-kurom Berefo Kese married Kyerewa Akenten and after their marriage Berefo Kese added a much larger portion of his lands to that already in their hands and presented it to them.' <sup id="cite_ref-834" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-834">[834]</a></sup> 'Obtaining land involved negotiation with the [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n who had developed it, who had (as it were) staked out first claims to it. Matrifiliation as such conferred no rights of settlement. It will follow that the free settlers within a beremp[unavailable]n-dom belonged to different matriclans. In fact these are dispersed almost randomly throughout forest society. As Fortes has remarked, the matriclan “delimits a diffuse field of amity, wide in extent but of minimal structural specificity.” Within the beremp[unavailable]n-dom, of the rule of exogamy, and in that respect was a socially integrative factor. But claims to land were based upon the heritable rights that the [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n conferred upon the settlers, and the matrilineages that thus arose were tied to specific tracts of land within the estate.' <sup id="cite_ref-835" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-835">[835]</a></sup> 'From the fifteenth century onward numerous estates or beremp[unavailable]n-doms arose as the frontier of farming expanded outward from the Adanse and Amansie regions. Such has been the thrust of the argument. Some were in time to become the capitals of aman, of states; some were to be incorporated into such states; and some were to falter and vanish. The struggles that attended the process are exhaustively chronicled in Akan traditions; the nature of the process itself, whereby a class of entrepreneurs became transformed into a ruling class, is not. The key lies in an understanding of the peculiar features of Akan land proprietorship.' <sup id="cite_ref-836" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-836">[836]</a></sup> 'A cardinal feature of the system is expressed in the maxim, afuo mu yε me deε, asase yε [unavailable]hene deε, “the farm is my property, the land is the king's.” It is necessary to extrapolate from more recent practice, described by Rattray, Busia, and Fortes among others. If the proprietor of the land conferred heritable rights to the arable on those who were permitted to settle, he also reserved or established certain rights to himself and his heirs — to his “stool.” He took an almost token part of the harvest at the time of the annual harvest festival (the odwira), but required a more substantial share of the produce of the land as opposed to the arable: fish, snails, game, kola, minerals, and the like. He could levy a wide range of taxes, such as peato for military expenses, ayieto for funerals, and [unavailable]manto to defray the costs of making regalia and putting up buildings. Most importantly, he could require the provision of labor for military service or, for example, for work on the roads. Such, briefly, were what led Potekhin to refer to “the relatively easy feudal dues of the free members of the community.” Relatively easy” they may or may not have been; there was variation from place to place and time to time. “Feudal” they were not, for the free settlers acquired almost unassailable titles to the land they farmed, while the various taxes and services provided to the landholder were ad hoc and sporadic and did not approximate in character to a rent, whether economic or otherwise.' <sup id="cite_ref-837" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-837">[837]</a></sup> 'The descendants of free settlers became [unavailable]manmufo, citizens. Those of the proprietors became adehyeε, nobility. There remain the unfree laborers. They must surely be those who became the third major element in the composition of an [unavailable]man, namely the gyaasefo. Literally “the people of the hearth,” they were absorbed into Akan society as servants of the adehyeε. They became responsible not only for their own subsistence but for that of the nobles. They farmed for them, assumed responsibility for their debts, and provided them with a wide range of personal services as stool-carriers, drummers, hornblowers, umbrella-carriers, bathroom attendants, messengers, tradesmen, sextons, and so forth. Their masters (or mistresses) were heirs to their property. Their status, unlike that of nobles and citizens, was transmitted through the male line. Rattray commented on the matter: [Page 100] 'There is little doubt that the Gyasefo were in olden times recruited from the slave class. A “Stool” slave became one of the Gyasefo. The descendants of a Gyase woman were of course considered as Gyasefo, down the female line for all time; not only was this so, but the son of a Gyase man would ordinarily also enter the office to which his father belonged, irrespective of the position of his mother.' <sup id="cite_ref-838" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-838">[838]</a></sup> While wealth stratification was present, all free individuals could own property in principle. We have assumed this was true of both the Ashanti and pre-Ashanti periods.</dd></dl>

Subsets of the membership of a lineage — equalling lineage segments — are defined by the existence of any property for which members of the subsets (exclusive of others) are potential heirs. Such sets (subsets of the whole) may range from, at the one extreme, only the actual children of some man's actual sisters (in the case of property that he himself created) to, at the other extreme, all the members of the lineage (in the case of property, in effect, created by the lineage founder). In Egyaa, only chiefly positions fall in the long-lived extreme, while (almost) all other created property (in Egyaa) falls in or near the short-lived extreme. No property in Egyaa falls enough in between the two extremes to matter, but property that survived long enough to be inherited through several generations (but not substantially longer) were such to exist, would create sets of members representing intermediate segments of the lineage's membership.' <sup id="cite_ref-845" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-845">[845]</a></sup> Slavery was practiced: 'The Akan practiced slavery, obtaining slaves from northern slave dealers, usually Muslims. War captives, criminals, persons who opposed local chiefs, and many local ritual leaders were also enslaved. Slaves were used for domestic and field labor, for sale to traders across the Sahara and Atlantic, and as sacrifices to royal and other ancestors. In the middle of the nineteenth century, slaves amounted to half of the population in many towns. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-846" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-846">[846]</a></sup> Wealthy urban families relied on unfree labour, but wealth stratification had emerged before the colonial and Ashanti periods: 'The Portuguese “blueprint” of 1572 associates gold mining, forest clearing, and food production, and implicitly postulates the existence [Page 96] of an appropriating class and a producing class. It is, I suggest, mutatis mutandis, a paradigm of sorts for the early Akan state. Those who controlled the production and sale of gold were those able to procure a supply of unfree labor. Those who procured unfree labor were those able to create arable land within the forest. Those who created the arable were those who founded the numerous early Akan polities. We see, in other words, a class of Akan entrepreneurs emerging: a class of those able to use the strength of the world bullion market, and the availability of labor locally (whether through Wangara or Portuguese suppliers), in such a way as to create the new agrarian system. These entrepreneurs were known as the aberemp[unavailable]n (sing. [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n), literally “big men” but correctly glossed in an early European source as “a superior rich man.” ' <sup id="cite_ref-847" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-847">[847]</a></sup> 'Akan village histories make frequent reference to hunters ranging the forest in search of land suitable for agricultural exploitation—taking account, presumably, of surface relief, water resources, soil, and so forth.

Adehyeε may preside over the affairs of anything from villages on the one hand to kingdoms on the other. Their power will rest in no small measure upon the sheer numbers of gyaasefo whose services they command; indeed, this is one index of their rank. In 1936 Oheneba Sakyi Djan manfully struggled with the problem, though with reference to the more southerly forest Akan: 'The term “Gyaase”…applies to the most immediate adherents attached to the household of any important personage. In this instance, even an ordinary well-to-do man (rich man) may have his own Gyaase, so much so that the head of a family (Opanyin or Atrankonnua) or a ruler of a town (Odekro), or a head of a division of a state (Ohene) or the supreme head or king of a state (Omanhene) should necessarily have his own Gyaase-men, and the number of the members constituting the Gyaase of each of the above heads depends on the importance of the party concerned. That is to say, the number of the members of the Gyaase attached to the Ohene's household is by far fewer than that attached to the Omanhene household.' It was all to do with achievement. The fortunes of an [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n depended first on his ability to procure the labor that, the estate established, became his gyaasefo, and second on his ability to attract free settlers to the estate. Measured in these terms the relatively unsuccessful [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n emerged as no more than a village head, an [unavailable]dekuro, and was absorbed in time into the aman (qua state) of his more successful peer, the [unavailable]hene of this or that group of towns and villages, and he in turn into the aman (qua kingdom) of those even more successful. We turn to a consideration of the most successful of all.' <sup id="cite_ref-850" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-850">[850]</a></sup> 'ON THE BASIS OF HIS observations of Kumase society in 1817, Bowdich became strongly aware of the degree of social stratification present. Of the many indicators of this—housing, diet, hygiene, toiletry, marriage, and so forth —he commented most fully on matters of the household economy:[Page 140] 'the higher class could not support their numerous followers, or the lower their large families, in the city, and therefore employed them in plantations (in which small crooms [villages] were situated) generally within two or three miles of the capital, where their labours not only feed themselves, but supply the wants of the chief, his family, and more immediate suite. The middling orders station their slaves for the same purpose, and also to collect fruit and vegetables for sale, and when their children become numerous, a part are generally sent to be supported by these slaves in the bush.' <sup id="cite_ref-851" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-851">[851]</a></sup> 'Bowdich's “higher class” would appear to refer to the wealthy citizens, high officeholders for the most part, whose gyaasefo or “retainers” supported them; his “middling orders” to aspirant citizens  in the process of creating, through utilization of slaves, their own gyaasefo; and his “lower class” to those who perforce ensured their survival by the use of family labor. If Bowdich may be understood to be suggesting that the commanding morality of metropolitan society was one of upward mobility based on wealth, then he was undoubtedly correct. Had Bowdich remained in Kumase a few months longer, he would have observed that upward mobility was an institutionalized process.' <sup id="cite_ref-852" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-852">[852]</a></sup> Accordingly, political influence was tied to wealth. While attributing class structures to non-capitalist economies is difficult, Wilks distinguishes between 'nobles', an emerging urban 'bourgeoisie', free farmers, and unfree servants: 'It is notoriously difficult to characterize the class structure of precapitalist societies. To this generalization Asante is no exception, though R. A. Kea's studies of a number of seventeenth century Akan polities have provided an invaluable lead.  For present purposes the postulate is that a class reproduces itself as a class and that it does so only insofar as it has a determinate and specific, though not necessarily direct, relationship to the means of production. Consider, for example, the Asante class of the adehyeε, a word commonly but inappropriately translated [Page 294] “royalty” in English. “The old adage” (and I quote the collective wisdom of the late Asantehene and his councillors in a judgment passed down in 1964) “is that a royal is one whose ancestor had established or founded a village." This succinct statement of traditional usage defines a class within Asante society by implicit reference to a set of proprietary rights over land exercised by those who were thereby able to appropriate, in the form of tributes, taxes, and services, part of the labor-value of others settled on the land. I have elsewhere suggested that the origins of the adehyeε class are to be sought in the context of the great economic transformations associated with the development of forest agriculture. I have also suggested that the gyaasefo emerged as a servile class in precisely the same context. In this chapter I argue that the asomfo, or those in administrative service, came to constitute a class within Asante society in precisely the same sense of class. Unlike both adehyeε and gyaasefo, however, the asomfo class emerged in an urban rather than rural context, and at a much later date: its full development was, therefore, specific to Asante rather than common to Akan society in general.' <sup id="cite_ref-853" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-853">[853]</a></sup> While the 'parvenus' (see Ashanti-period data sheet) were probably absent prior to the Ashanti period, wealth stratification itself was present. However, this does not seem to constitute a caste system.</dd></dl>
<p><b>♠ social mobility ♣ absent ♥</b> Society was organized in matrilineal kin groups rather than castes: 'All Akan groups recognize matrilineal descent. The basic group is the clan, of which there are eight; they are dispersed among the many kingdoms. Members of a subclan tend to occupy a single town or village. The clan is an exogamous group. It is comprised of constituent groups that may be referred to as lineages, but these do not form any kind of segmentary lineage system, lineages being attached to others by propinquity and the power and wealth of the host lineage. Although there has been much confusion in accounts of the Akan peoples between matriliny and matriarchy, authority within clans and lineages is held firmly by men, succession being from a man to his brother or to his closest sister's son.' <sup id="cite_ref-854" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-854">[854]</a></sup> 'A child inherits his or her blood from the mother, and character or temperament from the father. Maternal blood ensures the child's membership in the ABUSUA (clan or lineage); paternity bestows membership in one of nine other groups or categories. Although some accounts claim the Akan descent system is one of double descent, this view appears to be based on a misreading of the actual roles of the two lines of descent. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-855" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-855">[855]</a></sup> 'There are groups in which membership is transmitted patrilineally, but these are neither exogamous nor corporate groups; nor are jural or political rights or duties derived from paternal descent. What is involved is the concept of NTORO; the male transmitted NTORO (spirit) which forms a unique spiritual bond between father and son. Following this principle, every person belongs to one of a limited number of named quasi-ritual categories, the ntoro divisions. Members of the same ntoro division are required to observe certain taboos, perform certain rituals, and are believed to have some common personality characteristics. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-856" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-856">[856]</a></sup> 'Consistent with the emphasis on matrilineal descent is the fact that the system of kinship terminology is of the Crow type. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-857" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-857">[857]</a></sup> Matrilineages held and transmitted land and political positions: 'Land was the unalienable possession of the clan--actually the clan's ancestral spirits were considered the true owners of the land and the tribal land's living occupants only trustees or tenants. Security of tenure was based on working the land. Abandoned land reverted to the stool. Rights to land were inherited matrilineally. Today Akan have the right to sell land although leasing seems to be the preferred arrangement. [IS]' <sup id="cite_ref-858" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-858">[858]</a></sup> 'The localized matrilineage tracing descent from a known common female ancestor for a period of 10 to 12 generations is the basic unit for political, legal, and ritual purposes. Succession and inheritance rules stress sex, generation, and age, with men having precedence over women, "brothers" over "sisters' sons," and senior over junior. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-859" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-859">[859]</a></sup> Lineage segments were differentiated along the lines of heritable interest in property: 'Segments: While the lineage as a whole has some corporate concern with sponsoring the funeral of any of its members and with assigning that member's property to an heir, heritable interests in various properties can differentiate lineage members. Subsets of the membership of a lineage — equalling lineage segments — are defined by the existence of any property for which members of the subsets (exclusive of others) are potential heirs. Such sets (subsets of the whole) may range from, at the one extreme, only the actual children of some man's actual sisters (in the case of property that he himself created) to, at the other extreme, all the members of the lineage (in the case of property, in effect, created by the lineage founder). In Egyaa, only chiefly positions fall in the long-lived extreme, while (almost) all other created property (in Egyaa) falls in or near the short-lived extreme. No property in Egyaa falls enough in between the two extremes to matter, but property that survived long enough to be inherited through several generations (but not substantially longer) were such to exist, would create sets of members representing intermediate segments of the lineage's membership.' <sup id="cite_ref-860" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-860">[860]</a></sup> Slavery was practiced: 'The Akan practiced slavery, obtaining slaves from northern slave dealers, usually Muslims. War captives, criminals, persons who opposed local chiefs, and many local ritual leaders were also enslaved. Slaves were used for domestic and field labor, for sale to traders across the Sahara and Atlantic, and as sacrifices to royal and other ancestors. In the middle of the nineteenth century, slaves amounted to half of the population in many towns. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-861" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-861">[861]</a></sup> Wealthy urban families relied on unfree labour, but wealth stratification had emerged before the colonial and Ashanti periods: 'The Portuguese “blueprint” of 1572 associates gold mining, forest clearing, and food production, and implicitly postulates the existence [Page 96] of an appropriating class and a producing class. It is, I suggest, mutatis mutandis, a paradigm of sorts for the early Akan state. Those who controlled the production and sale of gold were those able to procure a supply of unfree labor. Those who procured unfree labor were those able to create arable land within the forest. Those who created the arable were those who founded the numerous early Akan polities. We see, in other words, a class of Akan entrepreneurs emerging: a class of those able to use the strength of the world bullion market, and the availability of labor locally (whether through Wangara or Portuguese suppliers), in such a way as to create the new agrarian system. These entrepreneurs were known as the aberemp[unavailable]n (sing. [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n), literally “big men” but correctly glossed in an early European source as “a superior rich man.” ' <sup id="cite_ref-862" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-862">[862]</a></sup> 'Akan village histories make frequent reference to hunters ranging the forest in search of land suitable for agricultural exploitation—taking account, presumably, of surface relief, water resources, soil, and so forth. The role of the aberemp[unavailable]n in these explorations is often described in considerable detail. By way of illustration I shall cite the cases of two, Tabiri Heman and Akuamoa Panin.' <sup id="cite_ref-863" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-863">[863]</a></sup> 'The descendants of free settlers became [unavailable]manmufo, citizens. Those of the proprietors became adehyeε, nobility. There remain the unfree laborers. They must surely be those who became the third major element in the composition of an [unavailable]man, namely the gyaasefo. Literally “the people of the hearth,” they were absorbed into Akan society as servants of the adehyeε. They became responsible not only for their own subsistence but for that of the nobles. They farmed for them, assumed responsibility for their debts, and provided them with a wide range of personal services as stool-carriers, drummers, hornblowers, umbrella-carriers, bathroom attendants, messengers, tradesmen, sextons, and so forth. Their masters (or mistresses) were heirs to their property. Their status, unlike that of nobles and citizens, was transmitted through the male line. Rattray commented on the matter: [Page 100] 'There is little doubt that the Gyasefo were in olden times recruited from the slave class. A “Stool” slave became one of the Gyasefo. The descendants of a Gyase woman were of course considered as Gyasefo, down the female line for all time; not only was this so, but the son of a Gyase man would ordinarily also enter the office to which his father belonged, irrespective of the position of his mother.' <sup id="cite_ref-864" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-864">[864]</a></sup> 'It is virtually impossible to render such terms as adehyeε, [unavailable]manmufo and gyaasefo into English with the appropriate nuances. Adehyeε may preside over the affairs of anything from villages on the one hand to kingdoms on the other. Their power will rest in no small measure upon the sheer numbers of gyaasefo whose services they command; indeed, this is one index of their rank. In 1936 Oheneba Sakyi Djan manfully struggled with the problem, though with reference to the more southerly forest Akan: 'The term “Gyaase”…applies to the most immediate adherents attached to the household of any important personage. In this instance, even an ordinary well-to-do man (rich man) may have his own Gyaase, so much so that the head of a family (Opanyin or Atrankonnua) or a ruler of a town (Odekro), or a head of a division of a state (Ohene) or the supreme head or king of a state (Omanhene) should necessarily have his own Gyaase-men, and the number of the members constituting the Gyaase of each of the above heads depends on the importance of the party concerned. That is to say, the number of the members of the Gyaase attached to the Ohene's household is by far fewer than that attached to the Omanhene household.' It was all to do with achievement. The fortunes of an [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n depended first on his ability to procure the labor that, the estate established, became his gyaasefo, and second on his ability to attract free settlers to the estate. Measured in these terms the relatively unsuccessful [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n emerged as no more than a village head, an [unavailable]dekuro, and was absorbed in time into the aman (qua state) of his more successful peer, the [unavailable]hene of this or that group of towns and villages, and he in turn into the aman (qua kingdom) of those even more successful. We turn to a consideration of the most successful of all.' <sup id="cite_ref-865" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-865">[865]</a></sup> 'ON THE BASIS OF HIS observations of Kumase society in 1817, Bowdich became strongly aware of the degree of social stratification present. Of the many indicators of this—housing, diet, hygiene, toiletry, marriage, and so forth —he commented most fully on matters of the household economy:[Page 140] 'the higher class could not support their numerous followers, or the lower their large families, in the city, and therefore employed them in plantations (in which small crooms [villages] were situated) generally within two or three miles of the capital, where their labours not only feed themselves, but supply the wants of the chief, his family, and more immediate suite. The middling orders station their slaves for the same purpose, and also to collect fruit and vegetables for sale, and when their children become numerous, a part are generally sent to be supported by these slaves in the bush.' <sup id="cite_ref-866" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-866">[866]</a></sup> 'Bowdich's “higher class” would appear to refer to the wealthy citizens, high officeholders for the most part, whose gyaasefo or “retainers” supported them; his “middling orders” to aspirant citizens  in the process of creating, through utilization of slaves, their own gyaasefo; and his “lower class” to those who perforce ensured their survival by the use of family labor. If Bowdich may be understood to be suggesting that the commanding morality of metropolitan society was one of upward mobility based on wealth, then he was undoubtedly correct. Had Bowdich remained in Kumase a few months longer, he would have observed that upward mobility was an institutionalized process.' <sup id="cite_ref-867" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-867">[867]</a></sup> Accordingly, political influence was tied to wealth. While attributing class structures to non-capitalist economies is difficult, Wilks distinguishes between 'nobles', an emerging urban 'bourgeoisie', free farmers, and unfree servants: 'It is notoriously difficult to characterize the class structure of precapitalist societies. To this generalization Asante is no exception, though R. A. Kea's studies of a number of seventeenth century Akan polities have provided an invaluable lead.  For present purposes the postulate is that a class reproduces itself as a class and that it does so only insofar as it has a determinate and specific, though not necessarily direct, relationship to the means of production. Consider, for example, the Asante class of the adehyeε, a word commonly but inappropriately translated [Page 294] “royalty” in English. “The old adage” (and I quote the collective wisdom of the late Asantehene and his councillors in a judgment passed down in 1964) “is that a royal is one whose ancestor had established or founded a village." This succinct statement of traditional usage defines a class within Asante society by implicit reference to a set of proprietary rights over land exercised by those who were thereby able to appropriate, in the form of tributes, taxes, and services, part of the labor-value of others settled on the land. I have elsewhere suggested that the origins of the adehyeε class are to be sought in the context of the great economic transformations associated with the development of forest agriculture. I have also suggested that the gyaasefo emerged as a servile class in precisely the same context. In this chapter I argue that the asomfo, or those in administrative service, came to constitute a class within Asante society in precisely the same sense of class. Unlike both adehyeε and gyaasefo, however, the asomfo class emerged in an urban rather than rural context, and at a much later date: its full development was, therefore, specific to Asante rather than common to Akan society in general.' <sup id="cite_ref-868" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-868">[868]</a></sup> Given how the 'parvenus' (see Ashanti-period data sheet) were absent prior to the Ashanti period, social mobility was probably absent.

<dl><dd> <b>♠ recruitment of chief executive ♣ equal ♥</b> Writing about the Ashanti period, Arhin describes the power hierarchy from the village upwards: 'Female stools complemented the hierarchy of male stools. In the village the elders, mpanyinfo, heads of the matrilineages, who constituted with the odekro the village council, had their aberewa or obaapanyin, who looked after the women's affairs. The odekro had an obaapanyin who was responsible for the affairs of the women of the village and was a member of the village council; the ohene, head of a division, and the omanhene, head of the autonomous political community, had their female counterparts known as ohemma, female ruler, who sat on their councils. The ohene and the ohemma were all of the same mogya, blood, or clan. The Asantehemma, the occupant of the female stool of the Kumasi state, and therefore of united Asante, since her male counterpart was ex officio the Asantehene, king of Asante, was a member of the Kotoko council, the executive committee or cabinet of the Asanteman Nhyiamu, general assembly of Asante rulers.' <sup id="cite_ref-869" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-869">[869]</a></sup> Major and minor chiefs were also summoned to council: 'Where the paramount King of a state summons the Head-Chiefs of provinces and chiefs of minor communities to attend a State Council, it is the privilege of the Councillors of the several communities composing the State, according to their rank and importance, to accompany their several Heads to the capital and to join in the “palaver,” or discussion, that will take place, the King in person presiding over the deliberations, supported by his own Councillors and principal Linguists. This is the full Parliament of the people, who are thus fully and duly represented in every way from the highest to the lowest. The commands which go forth from this assembly are binding upon every individual family of the entire State, from the most important province to the most insignificant hamlet, and the sanction operates equally upon all.' <sup id="cite_ref-870" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-870">[870]</a></sup> On the executive level it seems best to go with the stool system: 'Every Asante village was a microcosm of the Asante economic, social, and political universe. Its population included both rulers and ruled, both “owners” of the land with the right of succession to the local, divisional, and state stools and free men grouped in other lineages with corporate interests in other political offices.' <sup id="cite_ref-871" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-871">[871]</a></sup> In the Ashanti period, the paramount executive authority was the Asantehene: 'The King is the Chief Executive Officer of the State, but not the Executive Council of the State. Such a council exists, and any acts done by the King without its concurrence are liable to be set aside.' <sup id="cite_ref-872" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-872">[872]</a></sup> This level was absent prior to the Ashanti period. At that time, the executive hierarchy probably culminated in the more regionally based Omanhene (see also social complexity variables above). We have treated the chiefly matrilineages of the individual Akan states as 'top nobility'. Accordingly, we have coded the status of the Omanhenes as 'equal' to the 'top nobility'.</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ extreme status elevation ♣ absent ♥</b> We have found no evidence of lower-status individuals occupying the office of Omanhene.</dd>

<p><b>♠ occupational mobility ♣ absent ♥</b> Cultivation systems varied with local ecology: 'The different ecological zones have given rise to contrasting types of agriculture. In the north the main subsistence and cash crop is yams, followed by guinea corn; by 1950 there still had not been any large-scale development of export crops. In the south, a much larger variety of subsistence crops are grown, especially yams, cocoyams, manioc, and maize. Also, there has been widespread development of major commercial crops such as the kola-nut and cocoa, which has become the main economic activity in the southern zone. In former times, until the end of the nineteenth century, farm work was done by servile labor: slaves, pawns, and various kinds of servants. Today sharecropping and hired labor are the most prevalent, although domestic peonage is still common. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-873" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-873">[873]</a></sup> While the rural population consisted primarily of farmers and craftsmen, the towns offered a more diverse labor market, at least from the Ashanti period onwards: 'The Kumasi Central Market is among the largest in West Africa and lies at the center of a vast market region. Traders, wholesalers, distributors, transporters, and retailers make up a complex network of exchanges, which are bolstered by a variety of kin, ethnic, and local ties. Commodity chiefs control the wholesale end of the business regulating prices. In the early nineteenth century men moved into commercial farming, leaving women to run the markets. [IS]' <sup id="cite_ref-874" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-874">[874]</a></sup> 'But by the late eighteenth century the capital, Kumase, and several other major centers of local administration - Bekwae, Dwaben, Kokofu, and Mampon, for example - had come to offer a wide range of employment opportunities other than farming: in court, in the civil and military administrations, in business, in crafts, and so forth. In the early nineteenth century Kumase was already a town of about 20,000 people, few of whom were directly engaged in food production.' <sup id="cite_ref-875" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-875">[875]</a></sup> Craft specializaton was also present:  'The Ashanti are noted for their expertise in a variety of specialized crafts. These include weaving, woodcarving, ceramics, and metallurgy. Weaving is a highly developed craft, with dozens of standardized and named textile designs. Weaving in cotton and silk is of a technically and aesthetically high order, and much commerce is built around it. Woodcarvings have also become a valuable commodity, especially with the rise of the tourist trade in the late twentieth century. Woodcarving is divided into many branches, each with its own specialists. Among the major products are wooden sculptures of outstanding artistic quality, talking-drums (NTUPANE), and the famous wooden "stools," which are symbolic and ritual objects rather than items of furniture.' <sup id="cite_ref-876" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-876">[876]</a></sup> 'One of the most specialized crafts is metallurgy. Traditionally, Ashanti metal smiths worked in iron, brass, bronze, silver, and gold. Agricultural implements and other metal utensils were made of iron. Using a lost-wax process, smiths cast brass and bronze gold weights (MRAMMUE) of geometric, human, or animal forms. Although these objects are now mainly of interest to art collectors, their original function was practical; they were standard weights used to measure gold dust. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-877" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-877">[877]</a></sup> 'Craft production was an individual undertaking, and apprentice craftsmen were more often sons than sisters' sons. There were concentrations of certain crafts in certain villages, which were founded with war captives or refugees. Among these were settlements in the Kumase district such as Bonwire (cloth weaving), Ntonso (cloth dyeing), Pankrono (pottery), Ahwia (woodworking), and Breman and Adum (metalworking). Blacksmithery and joinery which catered to the needs of cultivators were scattered throughout the kingdom (Bowdich 1819, Dupuis 1824, Freeman 1967 [1898]). The crafts concerned with the elaboration of regalia were located in the immediate neighbourhood of the state capitals and the imperial capital of Kumasi (Rattray 1927: 216-308; Arhin 1982). Craft practitioners owned their own tools, and the factors that conditioned production were agricultural demand and state requirements.' <sup id="cite_ref-878" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-878">[878]</a></sup> Trade was also important: 'There were early cultural and commercial links with the empires of the southern Sahara. The major commodities exchanged were gold from the Akan region and salt from the Sahara. The main Akan trading town was Bighu (Bitu) with links to Jenne on the Niger bend. Trade in gold and slaves formed the commercial basis of the traditional Ashanti state. Kola-nuts were also exported to the north. Today cocoa is Ghana's main export commodity. [IS]' <sup id="cite_ref-879" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-879">[879]</a></sup> This seems to suggest that occupational mobility was present to an extent, at least in coastal cities of the Ashanti period. We are unsure whether this was the case prior to the Ashanti period as well. We have provisionally coded 'absent', but this remains in need of confirmation.

[MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-880" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-880">[880]</a></sup> Uncles could 'pawn' their nephew and nieces: 'An uncle had the power to pawn his nephew or niece. The whole legal position of pawns ( nwowa) will be examined later in detail under that heading. An uncle was expected to give the father of the person he wished to pawn ‘the first refusal’, that is, to ask him if he would not himself like to take his own child as his pawn. In any case, whether the father desired to do so or not, he might not protest or interfere. My Ashanti informants state that the person to be pawned would not wish him to do either, and remarked, Oba ose ose dome abusua (‘A child may resemble his father, but affection (duty) is for the blood relations’); and again, Gyadua si abontene ne hi wo fie (‘The gyadua (tree) may stand in the street, but its roots are in the house). ‘His uncle may not beat or punish your child while he is under your care, but, on the other hand, you may spend much money on your children, consulting the gods, yet when their uncle's house becomes poor he will sell them.’' <sup id="cite_ref-881" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-881">[881]</a></sup> 'An uncle had the power to compel his niece to divorce her husband so that he might pawn her to raise money to ‘buy the head’ of one of his abusua.

The Fanti and Ashanti have exogamous patrilineages also, making a double descent system. There is polygamy. In traditional Ghana when custom had determining influence on social life, a preference was given to cross-cousin marriage which among other things ensured that, in spite of matrilineal system of inheritance, the daughters of a man benefited from his property which they and their mother helped him to acquire. Local endogamy and traditional slavery and debt slavery also prevailed. There are no endogamous castes and no initiation schools.' <sup id="cite_ref-884" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-884">[884]</a></sup> 'Slaves were not allowed to mix freely with free-men or allowed to go to the chief's palace; they were required to work harder and to do the dirty work. Moreover they were not accorded a funeral custom. There were four sub-classes of slaves. (1) The akoa (plural nkoa) originally referred only to voluntary servitude of a person to, for example, his MoBr (w[unavailable]fa). The best translation originally would have been “subject”; in reality it came to include persons whom another person had power over, merging with [unavailable]d[unavailable]nk[unavailable], the slave proper. (2) [unavailable]d[unavailable]nk[unavailable] (plural nn[unavailable]nk[unavailable], nn[unavailable]nk[unavailable]fo is a non-Akan purchased expressly as a slave. The second generation would always be termed akoa. They were usually bought at Salaga, a male costing the equivalent in cowries of 9,000 kola nuts, a female costing the equivalent of 14,000 kola nuts. Outside of Ashanti the master had life and death prerogative over his slaves; within Ashanti any execution had to be performed by the Asantehene's executioners. (3) The dommum was a foreign prisoner of war or tribute. All these [Page 40] classes of slaves could marry, own property (including his own slaves), swear an oath, and become heir to his master. A slave could swear an oath to be taken by another master if badly treated. Slaves could be sacrificed, and a reserve of them were kept at a special village (Akyere kurom). (4) An akyere was a slave condemned to death for an offense but saved until a sacrifice was required.'  <sup id="cite_ref-885" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-885">[885]</a></sup> Slaves could not hold stools and only inherited their master's wealth if no matrikin were present: 'Inheritance is arranged by the ohurew or executor responsible for all the funeral arrangements. Ideally the ohurew is the deceased's father's younger brother's son, in the same generation but preferably junior to the deceased. For a female deceased the ideal is FaBrDa. A dying declaration (samansew) is binding if there are witnesses. Although the ohurew is required to settle and distribute the estate, there is a constant problem of distinguishing family from self-acquired property. “The uncle seems in theory the heir to the personal property of his nephews, but almost invariably he waives his right in favour of the deceased's next eldest brother” (Rattray 1929:4). Next in line after eldest brother is the next brother in age until all the deceased's brothers are exhausted. Next is SiSo, then MoSiSo, and finally after all the male possibilities are exhausted the females are eligible for male property, beginning with the deceased's eldest sister. If all relatives are dead, the property (but never a stool) is inherited by a slave, even before the man's actual children — who are completely excluded. This same line of inheritance is followed in the succession for a stool, except that the line stops at slaves and women.' <sup id="cite_ref-886" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-886">[886]</a></sup> But slaves could be adopted into matrilineages: 'Douglas has argued that “matrilineal descent groups are organised to recruit members by other means additional to direct lineal descent”; that “matrilineal descent goes with a quality of openness in the texture of effective descent groups”; and that [Page 80] 'because of the open texture of its descent groups and its bias towards a wide-ranging recruitment of manpower, matriliny is well adapted to any situation in which competing demands for men are higher than demands for material resources.' We suggest, then, that this “open texture” may have been at least one of the factors dictating the new form of social organization that appeared [Page 81] at the time of the clearances: the matriclan functioned to facilitate the assimilation of strangers and, to the point, of the unfree labor being drawn into the forest country. From more recent times we know that those of unfree origins were assimilated as rapidly as possible into the class of free Asante commoners and their acquired status afforded full protection of the law. An Ashanti slave,” wrote Rattray, in nine cases out of ten, possibly became an adopted member of the family, and in time his descendants so merged and intermarried with the owner's kinsmen that only a few would know their origin.' But Rattray still failed to allow fully for the “open texture” of the matrilineal group. The view has been expressed to the writer on many occasions that “in the old days” women married at a young age and men at a relatively advanced one; hat a male slave might often become the third, fourth, or even fifth husband of a (by then elderly) free woman, so that any children she bore by him would be free; and that female slaves were often married by free men and their children immediately adopted into the father's lineage.' <sup id="cite_ref-887" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-887">[887]</a></sup> But slaves had no recourse to corporate descent groups of their own and could be ritually sacrificed: 'Such briefly were the rights of an Ashantislave. They seemed in many instances practically the ordinary privileges of any Ashanti free man, with whom, in these respects, his position did not seem to compare so unfavourably. The chief danger in which his peculiar status placed him appears to me to lie in the fact that the slave was generally a solitary creature more or less at the mercy of a single individual. Every one around him was in a sense ‘the slave’ of some one, but such persons had always behind them a whole group of relatives, whose numbers and wealth and power were ever at their disposal. The slave was not ordinarily possessed jointly (a position which would have ensured certain safeguards); at least, not when a member of a family had purchased him with the proceeds of his own individual labour. It seems probable that circumstances generally would have tended towards his kind treatment. An Ashanti slave, in nine cases out of ten, possibly became an adopted member of the family, and in time his descendants so merged and intermarried with the owner's kinsmen that only a few would know their origin. One outstanding fact, however, remained, i.e. that the status of a slave, i.e. an odonko, could never be lost, and, when necessity arose, or the terrible practice of human sacrifice became the vogue, an otherwise kind and considerate master would turn instinctively to the man who had no friend in the world, in order to satisfy the need for money or for a victim. The liability to be sacrificed at funeral customs may have been an ever-present fear in the mind of a West African slave. Many persons indeed were inevitably condemned to such an end. This idea was, as time went on, developed in an extraordinary degree. Whole villages existed where all the inhabitants were looked upon as a human reservoir from which, when occasion arose, sacrificial victims might be drawn. Such villages were called Akyere kurom (village of Akyere). Akyere means a slave who, instead of suffering immediate capital punishment for some offence of which he had been found guilty, was [Page 43] held over till his unhappy services were required. Meanwhile the person thus condemned went about his or her ordinary vocations, possibly was kept waiting for death for many years, married, brought children into the world, who again married and bore grandchildren to the original culprit. All these descendants (through the female line) inherited the liability of their ancestor to suffer capital punishment at any moment, and helped to swell a reserve of potential funeral victims.' <sup id="cite_ref-888" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-888">[888]</a></sup> Slaves featured prominently in the trade with European powers: 'The fact of the matter is, then, that when the Portuguese entered the Akan gold trade in 1471, those they sought to do business with already had strong consumer preferences, formed in the context of their prior involvement with the Wangara. There was, however, one commodity that was not available from the northern traders: firearms. Initially, so it seems, a brisk exchange of guns for gold took place at Elmina, though such transactions were banned by papal decree. Pope Sixtus IV was petitioned to lift the restriction. On 28 January 1481, he forgave those who had transgressed but reaffirmed the ban. The Christian fear that arms sold at Elmina might find their way into Muslim hands was, in the circumstances, not entirely without foundation. The decision to build the fort of São Jorge at Elmina was taken in the belief that other Portuguese-manufactured produce—“silk, woollen and linen cloths, and other domestic goods” —would find a ready market there. Certainly objects of copper and brass did, whether shaving bowls, urinals, chamber pots, water jugs, bells, boxes, or bracelets (manilhas). Portuguese cloth, however, was apparently not so well received, and the Casa de Guiné in Lisbon was obliged to procure North African “lambens,” “aljaravias,” and the like, to service the Elmina trade. Vogt has suggested that in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries cloth accounted for about 40 percent of the business done at São Jorge, and metals for about 37 percent. Next to these was the sale of slaves, accounting for about 10 percent of trade. Duarte Pacheco Pereira's informants on the Gambia spoke, as we have seen, of the merchants of Bitu, “Banbarranaa,” and “Bahaa” going to “Toom,” that is, the Akan country, “to buy gold in exchange for the merchandise and slaves which they take there.” In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries a strong demand for labor arose in forest Akan society as local entrepreneurs, the aberemp[unavailable]n, sought to increase the extent of the cleared land available for tillage (see chapters 2 and 3). Slaves, in other words, could readily be traded against gold. By virtue of their command of the maritime routes, the Portuguese were able to insinuate themselves into this lucrative business. By 1479 Portuguese vessels were already [Page 24] moving slaves to Elmina from as far east as the Benin coast, and after 1515 the islands of São Tomé and Principe were developed as depots for the expanding enterprise. “Both during the life of Don João (1481-95) and of Dom Manuel (1495-1521),” wrote De Barros, 'this sale of slaves continued from Beny [Benin] to Mina, for ordinarily the ships that left this Kingdom went to Beny to buy the slaves, and then carried them to the Mina, until this trade was altered on account of the great inconvenience which arose. A large caravel was wont to sail from the island of S. Thome, where the slaves of the coast of Beny joined those from the kingdom of Congo, because all the vessels that sailed to those parts called there, and this caravel carried them from the island to Mina.' <sup id="cite_ref-889" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-889">[889]</a></sup> 'For the period 1500-35 it has been estimated that the Portuguese imported ten to twelve thousand slaves to Elmina, though the figure takes no account of those landed by smugglers and interlopers. Although their sale accounted for only some 10 percent of the Portuguese trade at Elmina, it was critical in luring the inland merchants to the coast. “An adequate and continuous supply of slaves was indispensable for the success of Portuguese trade at São Jorge da Mina,” Vogt remarks. “Without such slaves, much of the remainder of the trade-goods would not have been sold.” The total cost, including purchase price, transportation, and food, of a slave procured in the Slave Rivers and sold at Elmina was reckoned at about one-third of an ounce of gold. The sale price ranged from about three to six ounces, according to physique.' <sup id="cite_ref-890" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-890">[890]</a></sup> We have adopted the estimate provided by eHRAF, but this may overestimate the number of slaves.

Human sacrifices were offered at private as well as at royal funerals, and also to gods to ensure the success of Asante military operations and on occasions of national disaster. In addition, human victims were killed at regular Asante festivals, such as the annual Yam festival (Odwira), which involved over 100 deaths a year, and the monthly Adae Festival, at which over 70 people were killed on one occasion in 1820.95 Richard Burton, seeking to defend Dahomey against charges of excess in these matters in the 1860s, could reasonably claim that Asante was worse." <sup id="cite_ref-891" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-891">[891]</a></sup> We have assumed this to be true of the pre-Ashanti period above.

<p><b>♠ Rulers are legitimated by gods ♣ present ♥</b> Writing about the Ashanti period, Arhin describes the power hierarchy from the village upwards: 'Female stools complemented the hierarchy of male stools. In the village the elders, mpanyinfo, heads of the matrilineages, who constituted with the odekro the village council, had their aberewa or obaapanyin, who looked after the women's affairs. The odekro had an obaapanyin who was responsible for the affairs of the women of the village and was a member of the village council; the ohene, head of a division, and the omanhene, head of the autonomous political community, had their female counterparts known as ohemma, female ruler, who sat on their councils. The ohene and the ohemma were all of the same mogya, blood, or clan. The Asantehemma, the occupant of the female stool of the Kumasi state, and therefore of united Asante, since her male counterpart was ex officio the Asantehene, king of Asante, was a member of the Kotoko council, the executive committee or cabinet of the Asanteman Nhyiamu, general assembly of Asante rulers.' <sup id="cite_ref-896" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-896">[896]</a></sup> Major and minor chiefs were also summoned to council: 'Where the paramount King of a state summons the Head-Chiefs of provinces and chiefs of minor communities to attend a State Council, it is the privilege of the Councillors of the several communities composing the State, according to their rank and importance, to accompany their several Heads to the capital and to join in the “palaver,” or discussion, that will take place, the King in person presiding over the deliberations, supported by his own Councillors and principal Linguists. This is the full Parliament of the people, who are thus fully and duly represented in every way from the highest to the lowest. The commands which go forth from this assembly are binding upon every individual family of the entire State, from the most important province to the most insignificant hamlet, and the sanction operates equally upon all.' <sup id="cite_ref-897" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-897">[897]</a></sup> The paramount executive authority was the Asantehene: 'The King is the Chief Executive Officer of the State, but not the Executive Council of the State. Such a council exists, and any acts done by the King without its concurrence are liable to be set aside.' <sup id="cite_ref-898" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-898">[898]</a></sup> The attribution of concrete entities to a particular executive level is not always clear, though, especially in the early period: 'The state of the union that emerged after the War of Independence was obviously a very fluid one. The Asanteman is referred to as the  Asante Aman Nnum, the Five Asante States, but there is no clear consensus about which states comprised the original union. [...] The fact of the matter seems to have been that the coalition against the Denkyira included what were no more than “estates” on the one hand, like Bekwae, and what were established states on the other, like Mampon, Dwaben, and Kumase itself. Some were to decline and some were to prosper; some were to become powerful components of the Asanteman and some were to become little more than their clients.' <sup id="cite_ref-899" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-899">[899]</a></sup> Government was organized in a system of stools: 'Every Asante village was a microcosm of the Asante economic, social, and political universe. Its population included both rulers and ruled, both “owners” of the land with the right of succession to the local, divisional, and state stools and free men grouped in other lineages with corporate interests in other political offices.' <sup id="cite_ref-900" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-900">[900]</a></sup> Chiefship had a sacred character as rulers were thought to have a special connection to the ancestors: 'Chiefship in Ashanti is a sacred office. This has been shown by the rites of the chief's enstoolment and by his part in ceremonies such as have been described. As long as he sits upon the stool of [Page 37] the ancestors his person is sacred. As the successor of the ancestors he performed various rites for the welfare of his people. With that office were joined other functions which may be described as administrative, executive, judicial, and military. If he abused his power, he was divested of it by having his special connexion with his ancestors, established on his enstoolment, severed. This happened when he committed or was made to commit one of the tabooed acts. His sanctity was violated and he was no longer able to sit on the stool of the ancestors. Thus, the Ashanti destool a chief by bumping his buttocks on the ground, or taking his sandals off his feet, or by mutilating his body. After such an act the chief was no longer in special contact with the ancestors, and having lost his sanctity he became automatically divested of all the other functions pertaining to the office of chiefship.' <sup id="cite_ref-901" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-901">[901]</a></sup> Accordingly, we have assumed that 'sacredness' characterized both the head of the later Ashanti empire as well as regional leaders of older Akan states.

<dd> <b>♠ Ideological thought distinguishes elites and commoners ♣ present ♥</b> Society was organized in matrilineal kin groups rather than castes: 'All Akan groups recognize matrilineal descent. The basic group is the clan, of which there are eight; they are dispersed among the many kingdoms. Members of a subclan tend to occupy a single town or village. The clan is an exogamous group. It is comprised of constituent groups that may be referred to as lineages, but these do not form any kind of segmentary lineage system, lineages being attached to others by propinquity and the power and wealth of the host lineage. Although there has been much confusion in accounts of the Akan peoples between matriliny and matriarchy, authority within clans and lineages is held firmly by men, succession being from a man to his brother or to his closest sister's son.' <sup id="cite_ref-907" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-907">[907]</a></sup> 'A child inherits his or her blood from the mother, and character or temperament from the father. Maternal blood ensures the child's membership in the ABUSUA (clan or lineage); paternity bestows membership in one of nine other groups or categories.

What is involved is the concept of NTORO; the male transmitted NTORO (spirit) which forms a unique spiritual bond between father and son. Following this principle, every person belongs to one of a limited number of named quasi-ritual categories, the ntoro divisions. Members of the same ntoro division are required to observe certain taboos, perform certain rituals, and are believed to have some common personality characteristics.

Subsets of the membership of a lineage — equalling lineage segments — are defined by the existence of any property for which members of the subsets (exclusive of others) are potential heirs. Such sets (subsets of the whole) may range from, at the one extreme, only the actual children of some man's actual sisters (in the case of property that he himself created) to, at the other extreme, all the members of the lineage (in the case of property, in effect, created by the lineage founder). In Egyaa, only chiefly positions fall in the long-lived extreme, while (almost) all other created property (in Egyaa) falls in or near the short-lived extreme. No property in Egyaa falls enough in between the two extremes to matter, but property that survived long enough to be inherited through several generations (but not substantially longer) were such to exist, would create sets of members representing intermediate segments of the lineage's membership.' <sup id="cite_ref-913" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-913">[913]</a></sup> Slavery was practiced: 'The Akan practiced slavery, obtaining slaves from northern slave dealers, usually Muslims.

It is, I suggest, mutatis mutandis, a paradigm of sorts for the early Akan state. Those who controlled the production and sale of gold were those able to procure a supply of unfree labor. Those who procured unfree labor were those able to create arable land within the forest. Those who created the arable were those who founded the numerous early Akan polities. We see, in other words, a class of Akan entrepreneurs emerging: a class of those able to use the strength of the world bullion market, and the availability of labor locally (whether through Wangara or Portuguese suppliers), in such a way as to create the new agrarian system. These entrepreneurs were known as the aberemp[unavailable]n (sing.

They farmed for them, assumed responsibility for their debts, and provided them with a wide range of personal services as stool-carriers, drummers, hornblowers, umbrella-carriers, bathroom attendants, messengers, tradesmen, sextons, and so forth. Their masters (or mistresses) were heirs to their property. Their status, unlike that of nobles and citizens, was transmitted through the male line. Rattray commented on the matter: [Page 100] 'There is little doubt that the Gyasefo were in olden times recruited from the slave class. A “Stool” slave became one of the Gyasefo. The descendants of a Gyase woman were of course considered as Gyasefo, down the female line for all time; not only was this so, but the son of a Gyase man would ordinarily also enter the office to which his father belonged, irrespective of the position of his mother.' <sup id="cite_ref-917" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-917">[917]</a></sup> 'It is virtually impossible to render such terms as adehyeε, [unavailable]manmufo and gyaasefo into English with the appropriate nuances. Adehyeε may preside over the affairs of anything from villages on the one hand to kingdoms on the other. Their power will rest in no small measure upon the sheer numbers of gyaasefo whose services they command; indeed, this is one index of their rank. In 1936 Oheneba Sakyi Djan manfully struggled with the problem, though with reference to the more southerly forest Akan: 'The term “Gyaase”…applies to the most immediate adherents attached to the household of any important personage. In this instance, even an ordinary well-to-do man (rich man) may have his own Gyaase, so much so that the head of a family (Opanyin or Atrankonnua) or a ruler of a town (Odekro), or a head of a division of a state (Ohene) or the supreme head or king of a state (Omanhene) should necessarily have his own Gyaase-men, and the number of the members constituting the Gyaase of each of the above heads depends on the importance of the party concerned. That is to say, the number of the members of the Gyaase attached to the Ohene's household is by far fewer than that attached to the Omanhene household.' It was all to do with achievement. The fortunes of an [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n depended first on his ability to procure the labor that, the estate established, became his gyaasefo, and second on his ability to attract free settlers to the estate. Measured in these terms the relatively unsuccessful [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n emerged as no more than a village head, an [unavailable]dekuro, and was absorbed in time into the aman (qua state) of his more successful peer, the [unavailable]hene of this or that group of towns and villages, and he in turn into the aman (qua kingdom) of those even more successful. We turn to a consideration of the most successful of all.' <sup id="cite_ref-918" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-918">[918]</a></sup> 'ON THE BASIS OF HIS observations of Kumase society in 1817, Bowdich became strongly aware of the degree of social stratification present. Of the many indicators of this—housing, diet, hygiene, toiletry, marriage, and so forth —he commented most fully on matters of the household economy:[Page 140] 'the higher class could not support their numerous followers, or the lower their large families, in the city, and therefore employed them in plantations (in which small crooms [villages] were situated) generally within two or three miles of the capital, where their labours not only feed themselves, but supply the wants of the chief, his family, and more immediate suite. The middling orders station their slaves for the same purpose, and also to collect fruit and vegetables for sale, and when their children become numerous, a part are generally sent to be supported by these slaves in the bush.' <sup id="cite_ref-919" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-919">[919]</a></sup> 'Bowdich's “higher class” would appear to refer to the wealthy citizens, high officeholders for the most part, whose gyaasefo or “retainers” supported them; his “middling orders” to aspirant citizens  in the process of creating, through utilization of slaves, their own gyaasefo; and his “lower class” to those who perforce ensured their survival by the use of family labor. If Bowdich may be understood to be suggesting that the commanding morality of metropolitan society was one of upward mobility based on wealth, then he was undoubtedly correct. Had Bowdich remained in Kumase a few months longer, he would have observed that upward mobility was an institutionalized process.' <sup id="cite_ref-920" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-920">[920]</a></sup> Accordingly, political influence was tied to wealth. While attributing class structures to non-capitalist economies is difficult, Wilks distinguishes between 'nobles', an emerging urban 'bourgeoisie', free farmers, and unfree servants: 'It is notoriously difficult to characterize the class structure of precapitalist societies. To this generalization Asante is no exception, though R. A. Kea's studies of a number of seventeenth century Akan polities have provided an invaluable lead.  For present purposes the postulate is that a class reproduces itself as a class and that it does so only insofar as it has a determinate and specific, though not necessarily direct, relationship to the means of production. Consider, for example, the Asante class of the adehyeε, a word commonly but inappropriately translated [Page 294] “royalty” in English. “The old adage” (and I quote the collective wisdom of the late Asantehene and his councillors in a judgment passed down in 1964) “is that a royal is one whose ancestor had established or founded a village." This succinct statement of traditional usage defines a class within Asante society by implicit reference to a set of proprietary rights over land exercised by those who were thereby able to appropriate, in the form of tributes, taxes, and services, part of the labor-value of others settled on the land. I have elsewhere suggested that the origins of the adehyeε class are to be sought in the context of the great economic transformations associated with the development of forest agriculture. I have also suggested that the gyaasefo emerged as a servile class in precisely the same context. In this chapter I argue that the asomfo, or those in administrative service, came to constitute a class within Asante society in precisely the same sense of class. Unlike both adehyeε and gyaasefo, however, the asomfo class emerged in an urban rather than rural context, and at a much later date: its full development was, therefore, specific to Asante rather than common to Akan society in general.' <sup id="cite_ref-921" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-921">[921]</a></sup> While the 'bourgeoisie' (see Ashanti-period data sheet) was not present prior to Ashanti rule, the other strata were.</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Ideological thought distinguishes all ethnicities ♣ present ♥</b> In the Ashanti period, the emerging peasant class was largely made up of assimilated non-Asante: 'Arhin's article is a most welcome corrective to ideological arguments which attempt to force complex realities into simple schemes. His argument (re: Fallers) that a culturally distinct peasantry can be identified in precolonial Asante is supported, as he notes, by a large and growing body of historical work. Some of this research amplifies the urban/rural distinction even more than Arhin himself does: e.g., Wilks's (1975) discussion of the importance of the urban mercantile class (the asikafo) and his discussion of the way in which the state, embodied in the city itself, enforced its power. It is impossible to discuss the rise of the Asante state without talking about the rise of Kumasi as an urban center. By definition, the rise of the state therefore presupposes the rise of a hinterland and a peasantry. Unless one were to question whether the state existed at all (which no one is doing), there is not much question about a peasantry's existing, economically, politically, and culturally.' <sup id="cite_ref-922" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-922">[922]</a></sup> 'There are a few points which could be emphasized: the cultural distinctiveness of the peasantry is due, in part, to the enormous numbers of strangers (particularly northerners) assimilated into Asante. As the slave trade decreased in the early 19th century, after abolition, large numbers of northerners had to be absorbed into the Asante populace. As Wilks describes, the government had very specific policies for carrying out this absorption. Thus, the urban/rural distinction is not simply one of “class” (which Arhin himself says is very unclear), but also, on some level, an ethnic one. In Asante the ethnic lines became more and more blurred, and the assimilationist policy made and continues to make discussion of this issue difficult; but it is clear that in everyone's attempt to be a “Kumasi” person there is also an attempt to certify one's unquestionable (free) Asante origins, which Arhin calls the “distinctively indigenous.”' <sup id="cite_ref-923" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-923">[923]</a></sup> The same was true of other Akan states: 'Terray has already applied the concept “peasant” to the neighbouring Abron and, comparatively, to Asante (Terray 1974, 1975), but his usage differs from mine, perhaps because the political structures of the Abron and the Asante differ. For Terray the Abron peasant “classes” consist of the subject Kulango people, whom the Akan-Abron conquered before establishing a “conquest state,” a few Abron subjects, and above all slaves acquired through raids and warfare and by purchase. It is from these that the state, dominated by the Abron aristocracy, extracted its surpluses, and it is they that the state exploited. The slaves, in particular, formed the main labour force in the gold mines owned by the aristocrats and provided the main reason for the existence of the state.' <sup id="cite_ref-924" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-924">[924]</a></sup> 'Strangers' were not part of established kin networks: 'People have travelled from the Northern Territories or the Colony to Ashanti in search of employment. Some of them have settled there more or less permanently. There are many people from these areas who have lived in Ashanti most of their lives, but they are outside the Ashanti political structure. They are ‘strangers’, no matter how long they live there.' <sup id="cite_ref-925" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-925">[925]</a></sup> 'Even Ashantis are ‘strangers’ outside their own Divisions. There are many Ashantis living in Divisions other than those in which they are subjects by kinship. This is particularly so in Kumasi, where the opportunities of employment have attracted people from all parts of Ashanti. With reference to the kinship political organization, these Ashantis are strangers, just as are the settlers from the Northern Territories and the Colony.' <sup id="cite_ref-926" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-926">[926]</a></sup> 'These permanent but ‘stranger’ settlers, who have no political status in the traditional organization based on kinship, present the chiefs with a new problem, which has arisen most acutely in connexion with taxation.' <sup id="cite_ref-927" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-927">[927]</a></sup> The legal rights of 'strangers' were restricted: 'Asante men and women drew power and income from a well-developed internal marketplace system with three distinct types of market, in which chiefly regulations protected their privilege as traders and carriers. Non-Asantes were restricted from trading within Asante during most of the nineteenth century, so goods from outside passed into Asante hands at the officially designated border markets whose location contracted with the limits of effective political control (Wilks 1975). Quantities of imported consumer goods, mainly manufactures and crafts, passed from border markets either to the urban daily markets or directly to the regional periodic markets in leading Asante towns (Akoto 1980). These linked the rural population to the border markets and to other parts of Asante with different food supplies. Urban daily markets in Kumasi and leading provincial capitals served the needs of town dwellers for food and consumption goods of all kinds (Lewin 1974).' <sup id="cite_ref-928" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-928">[928]</a></sup> Mixed marriages were rare and in-marrying individuals were expected to conform to local norms: 'Mahommedan law has not influenced these marriage or family customs in the slightest degree; on the contrary, if a Hausa marries a Fanti he must conform to Fanti custom, unless the girl first embraces Mahommedanism, which is very rare, and even then her children are still held to belong to the Fanti family. Such mixed marriages are, however, rare, and are altogether unknown to the Omanhin of Denkera.' <sup id="cite_ref-929" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-929">[929]</a></sup> We have assumed this to be broadly true of both time periods.</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Ideological thought distinguishes men and women ♣ present ♥</b> Descent was matrilineal: 'All Akan groups recognize matrilineal descent. The basic group is the clan, of which there are eight; they are dispersed among the many kingdoms. Members of a subclan tend to occupy a single town or village. The clan is an exogamous group. It is comprised of constituent groups that may be referred to as lineages, but these do not form any kind of segmentary lineage system, lineages being attached to others by propinquity and the power and wealth of the host lineage. Although there has been much confusion in accounts of the Akan peoples between matriliny and matriarchy, authority within clans and lineages is held firmly by men, succession being from a man to his brother or to his closest sister's son.' <sup id="cite_ref-930" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-930">[930]</a></sup> 'A child inherits his or her blood from the mother, and character or temperament from the father. Maternal blood ensures the child's membership in the ABUSUA (clan or lineage); paternity bestows membership in one of nine other groups or categories. Although some accounts claim the Akan descent system is one of double descent, this view appears to be based on a misreading of the actual roles of the two lines of descent. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-931" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-931">[931]</a></sup> 'There are groups in which membership is transmitted patrilineally, but these are neither exogamous nor corporate groups; nor are jural or political rights or duties derived from paternal descent. What is involved is the concept of NTORO; the male transmitted NTORO (spirit) which forms a unique spiritual bond between father and son. Following this principle, every person belongs to one of a limited number of named quasi-ritual categories, the ntoro divisions. Members of the same ntoro division are required to observe certain taboos, perform certain rituals, and are believed to have some common personality characteristics. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-932" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-932">[932]</a></sup> 'Consistent with the emphasis on matrilineal descent is the fact that the system of kinship terminology is of the Crow type. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-933" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-933">[933]</a></sup> Female stools and councils complemented male power hierarchies: 'Female stools complemented the hierarchy of male stools. In the village the elders, mpanyinfo, heads of the matrilineages, who constituted with the odekro the village council, had their aberewa or obaapanyin, who looked after the women's affairs. The odekro had an obaapanyin who was responsible for the affairs of the women of the village and was a member of the village council; the ohene, head of a division, and the omanhene, head of the autonomous political community, had their female counterparts known as ohemma, female ruler, who sat on their councils. The ohene and the ohemma were all of the same mogya, blood, or clan. The Asantehemma, the occupant of the female stool of the Kumasi state, and therefore of united Asante, since her male counterpart was ex officio the Asantehene, king of Asante, was a member of the Kotoko council, the executive committee or cabinet of the Asanteman Nhyiamu, general assembly of Asante rulers.' <sup id="cite_ref-934" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-934">[934]</a></sup> 'As members of their respective councils, female stool occupants participated in the legislative and judicial processes, in the making and the unmaking of war, and in the distribution of land, the basic resource of the economy. An ohemma of a state also had her own ntam, oath, a formula for starting the judicial process, and her own court, as well as her own okyeame (spokesman) who in the Akan courts acted as prosecutor and judge.'  <sup id="cite_ref-935" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-935">[935]</a></sup> 'An ohemma was a refuge for a fugitive from the ohene's court who often successfully sought her intervention in cases of the death penalty. Called the ‘mother’ of the ohene, she was the latter's most effective adviser and she had the right to administer to him even a public admonition. The ohemma was the aberewa, wisdom personified: an Akan court panel preceded their retirement to discuss a case before passing judgement by saying that they were going to consult aberewa,the old woman. As the aberewa of the town, the ohemma was the moral guardian of the females of the political community and a kind of moral censor: she examined adolescent girls before the main puberty rites which ushered them into adulthood and licensed their marriage, and was expected to say whether or not pregnancy had occurred before the rites. A girl who was found to have become pregnant before the rites was known as kyiribra, and was punished [Page 94] with ostracism together with her partner. The polity thrived on a sound moral order.' <sup id="cite_ref-936" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-936">[936]</a></sup> 'As the abrewa, the ohemma was also custodian of ‘custom’. She was officially the foremost authority on the genealogy of the royal matrilineage, and hence the first and final arbiter on who was qualified by blood to be a male ruler; it was said of the ohemma's stool in relation to the male stool that it was the elder stool, akonnua panyin. It was the ohemma who played the leading role in the selection of a successor to a deceased or destooled (removed from office) ohene.' <sup id="cite_ref-937" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-937">[937]</a></sup> 'The ohemma's role in the succession to a vacant stool can be understood in terms, first, of the composite nature of most of the Akan matrilineages and, secondly, of the Akan rules of succession. The composite nature of the Akan matrilineage lay not in its segmentation over time and space, but in the incorporation into it of ‘stranger’ segments which in time became concealed; even when it was known it was not permitted for outsiders to point it out. ‘Stranger’ segments could be descended from slave women or freeborn women of another clan who, therefore, were not of pure blood and whose descendants were not eligible for the stool. The ohemma was the one who could pronounce on the fitness of potential successors for the stool from the viewpoint of true descent from the founding ancestors/ancestresses.' <sup id="cite_ref-938" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-938">[938]</a></sup> 'Secondly, while the Akan vested the right of succession in the royal matrilineage, they left open the question of the actual successor among the eligible males, which was resolved by joint consultations between the ohemma, as leader of the royal matrilineage, and the members of the village, divisional, or national council. In the process of consultation the ohemma and the council were governed by the following rules: brothers should succeed each other before sisters' sons in the order of seniority in age; but age could be discounted in favour of superior wisdom and character in a junior person. Seniority in age could also be discounted in favour of a younger successor, if rotational succession among the segments of the royal lineage had been adopted as a ‘convention’ by the lineage and the community as a whole. Where rotation had been adopted as a working rule, both the male and female stools rotated among the segments, so that at any moment the occupants belonged to different competing segments.' <sup id="cite_ref-939" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-939">[939]</a></sup> 'It was the ohemma who operated these rules and ensured orderly succession to the stool. On the decease or de-stoolment of an ohene, the members of the council formally asked the ohemma to nominate a candidate for their approval, and gave her three succeeding options at the end of which the councillors could in turn present a candidate for her approval. It rarely, if ever, came to this. An ohemma consulted members of her matrilineage, her husband, if she had one, and the community at large through discreet inquiries by her nkotimsefo, [Page 95] household servants, who, like the palace functionaries, were so selected as to represent the various sections of the community. The candidate she turned up was thus more often than not the result of communal consensus. It was easy to arrive at this kind of consensus in the small-scale, face-to-face communities of the period before colonial rule.' <sup id="cite_ref-940" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-940">[940]</a></sup> However, female heads of household would delegate authority to eldest sons and other male relatives: 'I have mentioned that the eldest member of the family is recognised as the head, but where this member is a woman, and more particularly where the family is connected with a stool, the head delegates her authority to her eldest son, or the eldest male in the family. Women have, however, been [Page 400] known to occupy the stool as reigning chiefs. Adoption proper is unknown, but if a distressed native commends himself to a family, and they approve, he is received by them as a domestic slave, and, as such, becomes absorbed into it. Again, in Fanti Yankumase, for instance, if a member of another tribe settles with them, and his sept, the Kwonna (say) will not help him, he may choose one of the others, who will, and he henceforth is treated as a member of the latter.' <sup id="cite_ref-941" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-941">[941]</a></sup> According to Rattray, women were not oppressed by husbands and other men due to support from their matrilineage: 'In the chapter on ‘the Ashanti Classificatory System’ it was [Page 79] recorded that wives were inherited in exactly the same way as any other property; even in the case of a chief who is not dead but who has been deposed, or de-stooled as it is called in West Africa, his successor has a perfect right to have his predecessor's wives transferred to him equally with any other stool property. Again, on examination of the marriage laws, it will be found that, under certain circumstances, the native idiom for ‘to marry’ is to 'yere, lit. ‘buy a wife’.' <sup id="cite_ref-942" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-942">[942]</a></sup> 'These two isolated instances, removed from their proper context, might well lead the casual observer to suppose that an Ashanti wife was little better than a man's chattel and to point to the servile condition of women.' <sup id="cite_ref-943" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-943">[943]</a></sup> 'But in Ashanti no woman stands alone, for behind the woman stand a united family, bound by the tie of blood, which has here a power and a meaning we can hardly grasp. ‘If you see one parrot do not throw a stone at it, for there are many others,’ runs one of their sayings.' <sup id="cite_ref-944" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-944">[944]</a></sup> 'The whole conception of ‘mother-right’ affords the woman a protection and a status that is more than an adequate safeguard against the ill-treatment by any male or group of males.' <sup id="cite_ref-945" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-945">[945]</a></sup> 'Her children belong to her and her clan, not to that of her husband.' <sup id="cite_ref-946" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-946">[946]</a></sup> 'All her individually acquired and inherited property is hers and her clan's, and her husband cannot touch it.

A student writes: “Because witchery is mostly attributed to old women, any misfortune that occurs in the family of such a woman is accredited to her. If care is not taken, such women will be cast out from family matters entirely”.

Husbands could take concubines, but wives could not take (legitimate) lovers (see above). Husbands could divorce their wives: 'The Fantis assert that a man may repudiate his wife at will, but, if no substantial reason is given, he forfeits the dowry and all payments made on her behalf, pays all her expenses, and in addition pays her heavy compensation, so that it is never done.

If she was in the wrong, the man could then claim from her family restitution of the dowry, and all the expenses he had incurred throughout the marriage on her behalf, except the actual expense of maintaining her, doctor's bills, and the cloths that she had worn out; all jewels and the cloths that he had given her and which were not worn out are also returned.

For adultery he also has an alternative, in that he could sue the adulterer for damages (Birebu), which might be more than the expenses that he could claim, and are never less; this depends on his position. In Cape Coast he has to elect, and cannot claim a divorce at the same time; he can only proceed to a divorce if the woman now refuses to pay some small satisfaction, and further refuses to live with him. In Assin he may divorce as well as claim.

It is comprised of constituent groups that may be referred to as lineages, but these do not form any kind of segmentary lineage system, lineages being attached to others by propinquity and the power and wealth of the host lineage. Although there has been much confusion in accounts of the Akan peoples between matriliny and matriarchy, authority within clans and lineages is held firmly by men, succession being from a man to his brother or to his closest sister's son.' <sup id="cite_ref-963" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-963">[963]</a></sup> 'A child inherits his or her blood from the mother, and character or temperament from the father. Maternal blood ensures the child's membership in the ABUSUA (clan or lineage); paternity bestows membership in one of nine other groups or categories. Although some accounts claim the Akan descent system is one of double descent, this view appears to be based on a misreading of the actual roles of the two lines of descent. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-964" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-964">[964]</a></sup> 'There are groups in which membership is transmitted patrilineally, but these are neither exogamous nor corporate groups; nor are jural or political rights or duties derived from paternal descent. What is involved is the concept of NTORO; the male transmitted NTORO (spirit) which forms a unique spiritual bond between father and son. Following this principle, every person belongs to one of a limited number of named quasi-ritual categories, the ntoro divisions. Members of the same ntoro division are required to observe certain taboos, perform certain rituals, and are believed to have some common personality characteristics. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-965" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-965">[965]</a></sup> 'Consistent with the emphasis on matrilineal descent is the fact that the system of kinship terminology is of the Crow type. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-966" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-966">[966]</a></sup> Exogamy was the norm: 'Marriage is expected to be exogamous, and is extremely simple. There is no bride-wealth, the union being effected by the transfer of rum or other drink and some money from the groom to the bride's immediate family. Divorce is extremely easy and may be initiated by either men or women. The most usual causes are adultery and the barrenness of wives.' <sup id="cite_ref-967" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-967">[967]</a></sup> Society was matrilineal, but legitimacy was still important: 'Legitimacy is important both for inheritance and to define a person as having, or not having, slave ancestry. It demands not only a proper marriage, however short, but also a recognized pater: he gives the child his own spiritual identity and his or her name; he admits his responsibility for the child's education, and he has the expectation that the child will carry out the father's funerary rites. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-968" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-968">[968]</a></sup> Multiple residence patterns were present: 'Domestic organization long remained one of the most ambiguous aspects of Akan social structure. It was Fortes who finally delineated the key structural principles and processes through his research in the 1940s in the communities of Asokore and Agogo. He distinguished three major household types each based on a different residence pattern. First are households grouped around a minimal matrilineage, such as a woman and her sister or daughters, or a man and his sister or sister's son. Such households are based on duolocal residence, with a husband and wife living apart in different domestic units; about 62 percent of the households in Agogo were of this type.' <sup id="cite_ref-969" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-969">[969]</a></sup> 'Second are households consisting of a man, his wife, and their children, sometimes including other kinsfolk; this type of patrilocal or virilocal unit constituted about 22 percent of the households in Agogo. Finally, there are households made up of combinations of the previous types (e.g. a man, his wife, and children) plus his sister's children. Often these reflect an avunculocal residence pattern. The matrilineal domestic group is usually preponderant in the larger communities, while virilocal or patrilocal households are the most common type in small farming villages or hamlets. But all three "types" should be viewed simply as phases in a domestic cycle. In the early years of marriage, residence is predominantly duolocal, but with the passage of time this could shift to avunculocal or patrilocal/virilocal. Thus the composition of a domestic group would evolve over time. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-970" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-970">[970]</a></sup> Fathers played a prominent role in the arrangement of marriages: 'THERE are two forms of marriage recognised in the Fanti districts of the Gold Coast Colony, ( a) Marriage by native custom, and ( b) Marriage under Ordinance No. 14 of 1884 of the Colony.' <sup id="cite_ref-971" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-971">[971]</a></sup> 'I intend to deal only with the native custom, and I may here state that I have always relied rather on illiterate natives and chiefs, for my information, than on educated native men, for the following reasons:—the illiterate native tells one all he knows, or all he dares, and, having no reason to lie when he is not in court, he generally relates facts. A chief is the judge of his people, and, with his councillors, is the repository and exponent of the law, and must necessarily be taken as an expert. The scholar studies anything but his own customs, while an educated native is too inclined to embellish those customs, and present them in a form that would do credit to Justinian.' <sup id="cite_ref-972" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-972">[972]</a></sup> 'According to the Family System of the Tˇw-speaking races of the Gold Coast, although the children belong to the family of the mother, and not of the father, yet the father seems always to have been the person responsible for the marriage of his children.' <sup id="cite_ref-973" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-973">[973]</a></sup> 'He was liable for their maintenance and up-bringing, and was responsible for their actions. Thus if any of his sons, living under his roof, seduced any woman, the father had to pay satisfaction. If any of his daughters were seduced, he claimed and obtained compensation. He supplied his children with means to trade, or to make a living, and in return was entitled to all their earnings. The liability for the sons ceased on their marriage, or when they became self-supporting, so that it was to the father's advantage to find them wives as soon as possible after they reached the age of puberty, and this became recognised as a duty.' <sup id="cite_ref-974" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-974">[974]</a></sup> 'Hence it is clear that primitive negro marriages were interparental contracts, in which the consent of the parties themselves was never considered. The father gave his son a peto and a half of gold dust, and the mother contributed half a peto, to start him in life (a peto being roughly an ounce), and he then worked for himself instead of for his father.' <sup id="cite_ref-975" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-975">[975]</a></sup> 'As time went on fathers came to look on their daughters as sources of income, and demanded sums of money when approached for their hands; this was only natural, as they had nothing to lose by keeping them unmarried, and lost at least their services when they parted with them; whereas unmarried sons were always a possible source of danger.' <sup id="cite_ref-976" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-976">[976]</a></sup> 'Thus it came about, within historical times, that when a man had a marriageable son he approached a man with a marriageable daughter, and having made a suitable present, which varied from one ackie (4 s. 6 d.) to four ackies (18 s.), the two were betrothed, and cohabitation completed the marriage. [Some reckon the ackie as worth 5 s.]' <sup id="cite_ref-977" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-977">[977]</a></sup> 'Sometimes it happened, for personal reasons, that children were betrothed before they were mature; in such cases the boy's parent maintained the girl in her father's house and watched her, and was entitled to satisfaction if she were tampered with. When both had reached puberty the marriage was completed by cohabitation. The betrothal could be broken off meanwhile by the boy's parent, on forfeiting the so-called ‘consawment’ money, or by the girl's parent, by returning the money that had been paid.' <sup id="cite_ref-978" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-978">[978]</a></sup> According to Ffoukes, marriage negotiations became more extensive in the colonial period. There was a lot of regional variation: 'This state continued so long as children quietly submitted to the dictates of their parents, but during the last five centuries the natives have been brought into touch with various European nations, and the much-despised civilisation [Page 33] has tended to modify all their customs and ideas. Sons gradually came to be consulted, and were later allowed to choose their own wives; while the consent of the women was never considered until very recently, and even now it is not usual, except in Coast towns, where girls are far more independent than in the bush.' <sup id="cite_ref-979" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-979">[979]</a></sup> 'The marriage custom, instead of being the simple process of parents pairing off their children, now entails considerable expense. For instance, the present procedure in Cape Coast is as follows:—The relatives of the man (or more often the man himself) approach the relatives of the girl with rum, and if they appear willing a further “dash” is taken, which varies from £1 to 30 s., according to the suitor's circumstances; this is called Abombo or the “knocking” fee, as the suitor knocks at the door to ask for the girl; the father fixes the amount. On the acceptance of the abombo the girl becomes the affianced bride of the man, and although this is only a moral obligation, it is very strictly adhered to, and breach of promise is unknown to native custom. Occasional presents may now be exchanged, and shortly afterwards her parents receive the Etsir-Nsã (Fantee, Etsir a head, Nsã rum), which consists of two flasks of gin and a sum varying from five dollars (£1) to half an ounce of gold (£2) which is distributed amongst her relatives.' <sup id="cite_ref-980" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-980">[980]</a></sup> 'Her parents then may or may not make a further claim for dowry or head money, etsirkyeradzi or etsiradzi (from etsir, “head,” kyere “to show” or “prove,” and adzi, “thing”), of one to two ounces of gold, or £6 to £9; and the man further sends a box to the girl containing cloths, handkerchiefs, a comb, lavender-water and pomade, with perhaps pipes and a supply of tobacco, and a day is fixed to hand the girl over.' <sup id="cite_ref-981" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-981">[981]</a></sup> 'Some time usually elapses between sending the etsir nsã and contributing the etsiradzi, and this, it is alleged, is to give the man and his parents time to watch the character of the girl, as well as to meet the increasing demands of the avaricious parents who fix the dowry; but there is nothing to prevent sending both at once and completing the nuptial ceremony forthwith. However, the negro never does anything in a hurry! No precautions are now taken with the girl other than to warn her not to visit her intended husband's house before she is handed over, and she is never confined before her marriage, but satisfaction must be paid for cohabitation before she is so handed over.' <sup id="cite_ref-982" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-982">[982]</a></sup> 'In Fanti Yankumase [Assin] the custom varies appreciably from Cape Coast, for here the suitor sends to ask the girl's family, without rum or abombo, and if they agree, both families meet to drink rum or palm wine; this ceremony, to show the couple is engaged, is called Wakagyir. Then the man seals his bond by sending three small bottles of gin to the girl's family, and this is termed etsir nsã. He also [Page 35] gives the town crier 1 s. 6 d. to publish his betrothal, and 4 s. to witnesses. He further sends 8 s. to the girl's mother to maintain her until marriage; this payment is called Ntamboba (= Tanbiba, see infra), which implies, “as the mother has looked after the child, now somebody takes her.”' <sup id="cite_ref-983" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-983">[983]</a></sup> 'The matter then waits until the man has sufficient money, and if the girl or her family has a debt he pays it; this they call the etsiradzi. At this stage the Assins make sure that the bride-elect is a virgin, and, if not, lay their claim against the seducer. If there are no debts, the bridegroom merely provides a box, with cloths, handkerchiefs, looking-glass, and perfumes, and takes the bride home.' <sup id="cite_ref-984" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-984">[984]</a></sup> 'In Denkera the matter is much simpler; the man asks the father for his daughter, and notifies the girl's family, if he gets the father's consent, by sending them rum; he then pays her family the abombo, which they fix, and which may vary from £1 to 30 s., and the man takes the girl home; although he may pay a further dowry of £4 or £5, but this is not essential.' <sup id="cite_ref-985" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-985">[985]</a></sup> Marriage and divorce became more regulated in the colonial period: 'The passing of the 1884 Marriage Ordinance Act attempted to set a standard for monogamous marriage and spousal inheritance of self-acquired property. Conflict over inheritance often ended up in court where officials tried to determine whether or not a spouse was a true and therefore legal wife. Women began to organize in the 1950's to change the distinction between ‘wife’ and ‘non-wife’ in order to protect the interests of women and children. The results were the passage of the Maintenance of Children Bill in 1965 and a new divorce law in 1971. [IS]' <sup id="cite_ref-986" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-986">[986]</a></sup> Concubinage was practiced, but the rights of concubines differed from those of wives: 'Concubinage is everywhere practised on the Coast, and is generally respected, although civilisation has made educated natives profess to disparage it; the sole difference amongst the Fantis is, that Mpata or satisfaction can be sued for by a married man if his wife commits adultery, whereas he can obtain no redress in the case of a concubine. Further, a native can hardly be said to buy his wife, as all moneys paid by him are received on trust for the good behaviour of the wife during the marriage, and are returnable to the husband if he divorces his wife for her misconduct, only vesting in her family on her death, or the death of her husband.' <sup id="cite_ref-987" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-987">[987]</a></sup> 'Concubinage is openly permitted, and although it is not encouraged on the Coast, it is widely practised elsewhere. It is really quite as honourable a connection as the native marriage, as couples frequently live through life with no other bond than mutual affection. The essential difference is that for lack of consideration the man cannot claim damages if the woman misconducts herself; and if the man misbehaves, the woman has only to leave him at will. In fact the difference is all in favour of the woman, as will be seen when dealing with divorce. Even a married man may keep a concubine openly if his wife has no objection, but she cooks only at the wife's request; it is when a man keeps concubines clandestinely or against his wife's will that the custom is deprecated, and he has to “pacify” her whenever she finds him out. Wives do not appear to discourage it so long as they themselves get their fair share of attention. Whatever is given to a concubine is given outright, and cannot be reclaimed if she chooses to leave him for someone else. Her children can hardly be called illegitimate, as they still belong to her family, and as in the case of a chieftainess the children succeed to the stool. If she has children, and then marries another man, the natural father usually takes and brings them up, so that they may bury him; but if he does not, the husband is obliged to look after them.' <sup id="cite_ref-988" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-988">[988]</a></sup> 'There is this great difference, however, that, whereas the father of legitimate children is bound to support them, and he is responsible for all their acts, the natural father is not so bound, the obligation and liability falling on the woman's family; he only does so to keep up his good name, and the children do not participate equally in the funeral expenses.' <sup id="cite_ref-989" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-989">[989]</a></sup> Levirate was also practiced: 'There is a peculiar exception to one of these prohibitions, for when a Fanti dies he is succeeded by his eldest surviving brother, and if he has no brothers, by his eldest sister's eldest son. If the brother succeeds, he is said to take his [Page 44] place, and part of his duty is to marry the widow; this is called Okuranba; if the nephew ( Awofasepenyin) inherits he has a wider choice, for if the man leaves a daughter the nephew can take his choice between the widow and her daughter, but he cannot marry both. ' <sup id="cite_ref-990" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-990">[990]</a></sup> Husbands were obliged to pay compensation to the wife in the case of divorce unless a legitimate reason for the dissolution of the marriage could be provided: 'The Fantis assert that a man may repudiate his wife at will, but, if no substantial reason is given, he forfeits the dowry and all payments made on her behalf, pays all her expenses, and in addition pays her heavy compensation, so that it is never done. Elsewhere repudiation at will is unknown.' <sup id="cite_ref-991" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-991">[991]</a></sup> 'The following are held to be good grounds on which a husband may divorce his wife:— (1) Adultery. (2) Repeatedly insulting the husband's parents. (3) Refusal on the part of the woman to cohabit, after the man has preferred his claim against an adulterer. (4) If she becomes a notorious thief or criminal. (5) If she persists in not consenting to his taking another wife. (6) If the wife practises witchcraft. (7) Desertion.' <sup id="cite_ref-992" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-992">[992]</a></sup> 'In all these cases it is usual for both families to meet, and appoint an arbitrator, who may be the chief or any other person to whose decision they agree to submit. The case is gone into in the presence of both families, and if the grounds are held to be sufficient, the man is ordered to “chop” ( i.e., pipe-clay) the neck and breast of the woman, and she has to parade the town to publish the fact, and to show that she is free to marry again. If she was in the wrong, the man could then claim from her family restitution of the dowry, and all the expenses he had incurred throughout the marriage on her behalf, except the actual expense of maintaining her, doctor's bills, and the cloths that she had worn out; all jewels and the cloths that he had given her and which were not worn out are also returned. In Assin she is chalked on the foot. In Denkera she is not chalked at all, and here, although actual current expenses are awarded, they are invariably remitted.' <sup id="cite_ref-993" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-993">[993]</a></sup> 'In the case of adultery, the husband can turn the woman [Page 47] out on the spot and refuse her all further support. Inquiry might show that she had committeed adultery after gross ill-treatment or desertion; in such cases a divorce would be decreed, but the man would forfeit his expenses. For adultery he also has an alternative, in that he could sue the adulterer for damages (Birebu), which might be more than the expenses that he could claim, and are never less; this depends on his position. In Cape Coast he has to elect, and cannot claim a divorce at the same time; he can only proceed to a divorce if the woman now refuses to pay some small satisfaction, and further refuses to live with him. In Assin he may divorce as well as claim. When a wife repeatedly inveighs against her husband's family, the family take the matter up, and the husband has to get a divorce or break with his family, but all endeavours are first made to persuade the woman to desist.' <sup id="cite_ref-994" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-994">[994]</a></sup> 'In the case of theft, unless the wife is notorious, she pacifies the husband with a sheep, and the marriage continues. If the husband refuses, he forfeits his moneys; if the woman refuses, he can claim all.' <sup id="cite_ref-995" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-995">[995]</a></sup> 'Where a woman refuses her consent to a new wife, she is invariably won over by a handsome dash.' <sup id="cite_ref-996" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-996">[996]</a></sup> Women could not divorce their husbands directly, but courts could order men to divorce their wives on their behalf: 'A wife cannot divorce her husband, and the husband may always claim the Ayifur if she marries any other man without being first chalked. She can, however, take him before a native court on the following grounds:—(1) Continuous illtreatment. (2) His repeated insults to her family. (3) Aggravated assault. (4) If he is a notorious thief. (5) Desertion.' <sup id="cite_ref-997" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-997">[997]</a></sup> 'If she gets judgment the court orders the husband to “chop” her to show she is free; he further forfeits all his expenses, and has to give up all her property that he has in his possession. Also, if there have been loans or money transactions between them, accounts are rendered and balances struck. In Fanti Yankumase the husband is entitled to recover his expenses in all cases of divorce.' <sup id="cite_ref-998" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-998">[998]</a></sup> Given how adultery was recognized as constituting legitimate grounds for divorce, we have decided to code 'present'. However, we are unsure to which extent these regulations apply to the pre-Ashanti period. Confirmation is needed.

<dl><dd><b>♠ charity ♣ absent ♥</b> Cooperation among matrikin was common and expected: 'Two categories of matrikin who have invested in farms must be clearly distinguished: those who from the information might expect a return and those who do not. In addition, when considering rights and obligations of matrikin, we are looking both at individuals and at the matrilineage as a whole. Among the individuals are nephews working for their mothers' brothers while having no independent income of their own. Of the Dominase farmers, several were working with their sisters' sons on a permanent basis. Matrikin were also supervising work on bearing farms elsewhere, but these were more senior kinsmen who themselves had farms, and for them there was no question of expecting a direct return for assistance given. Among this second group of matrikin are mother's brothers and a large number of temporary assistants, who included mothers, sisters, a brother and sisters' sons. Most of the twelve male owners studied at Dominase had received assistance from this category, who were in a position to give rather than to receive. In a number of instances this was in the form of contacts, money, or land to make the venture possible in the first place. In some cases part of their financial backing came from the proceeds of farms which they had inherited and which were therefore lineage property. The position of this group can only be understood if account is taken of the corporate nature of descent groups and the sense of obligation existing between members, doing things for one another because they must, particularly men for their sisters' sons. A good mother's brother is expected to help his sisters' sons, thereby obliging the latter to reciprocate in the next generation either through their own sisters' sons or through other matrilineal dependants (Fortes, 1950). Returns are not always therefore related directly to inputs on farms. Three farmers had each made gifts of farms or land to matrikin which could not be related directly to inputs. One had purchased four pieces of land for the children of four sisters, and one [Page 177] for his oldest sister which was to have been for his own mother, who died before he was able to complete the project. A second had offered land to the adult offspring of his mother's sister. In the first case the only assistance he claimed to have received from matrikin was labour from a grand-nephew when he first arrived at Dominase; whereas the second man did rely financially on matrikin and used the proceeds of a family farm which he had inherited, although he had until then received little help from his grand-nephews. The third farmer said that he had purchased land for a brother who had not worked for him.' <sup id="cite_ref-999" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-999">[999]</a></sup> However, this does not constitute charity. Families in need had recourse to wealthier relatives, but could not force the latter to support them: 'Mutual assistance within the lineage should be substantial, but it too stops far short of pooling. Even inherited lineage property clearly belongs to one individual heir, who should use it for the benefit of kin but has virtually unchallenged power to decide what uses will serve their long-term benefit. Relatives can ask for help without offense, and pressures from the abusua to agree can be intense, but this help cannot be compelled or assumed. Pleas to wealthier kin are based on needs, not rights, and one certainly cannot use their property as one's own.' <sup id="cite_ref-1000" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1000">[1,000]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ production of public goods ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> Danquah and Rattray describe 'companies' of young men: 'Asafo. A union or company of men banded together under a leader, chosen from among their number by popular vote, to compel the recognition of a real or imaginary grievance or to further some plan, good or perhaps bad, upon which all are of one mind; or perhaps again, merely for the purpose of joining together to work in turns for each other, say at cultivating or clearing a plantation.' <sup id="cite_ref-1001" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1001">[1,001]</a></sup> 'These companies or confederations adopt a leader, as already [Page 46] stated, and assume an emblem or flag, and the confederation is given a name, generally one explaining the raison d'être for the amalgamation. The following are a few examples of ‘company’ names.' <sup id="cite_ref-1002" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1002">[1,002]</a></sup> 'IF one had to make a choice between a purely social as distinguished from a political institution in the Akan state system it would be difficult to point to a characteristic mark by which to differentiate between the two. “Society” at the stage in which we are studying it among the Akan peoples is not far removed from the idea of association of families, clans, or tribes. Invariably the head of the family is not only the patriarch but also the social leader of that family or clan. Matches between marriageable youths are contracted under his personal advice; free consent of girl or boy to a marriage is only conditional on the sanction of the head of family. Dances are usually held within the family compound and when the youth of two or more families meet for some social purpose they do so under the aegis of the central head of those families. Society is more or less clannish in structure, and in proportion as the family tie is close, the youth of the family or tribe are constrained to model their social intercourse on the structure of the political or tribal units. Thus then starting from the highest structure in the State with the Omanhene as its head, we meet a descending scale of social institutions having some head or other who partakes of the hierarchy inherent in the supreme head. The town with a Chief or Odikro as political head has also a corresponding head for the social activities of the town. This head is directly under the Odikro or Chief, but in so far as members of his association are concerned, he is supreme as supremacy goes in the Akan institutional regime. There are several such institutions in every Akan state, and almost every town in an Akan state has a social association of young men with their own leaders called captains (Asafohene or Asafoatse) and lieutenants (Sripi). These Asafo companies as they are called have very definite functions in the political and social community wherein they are found, and as the host (Asafo) of all the young men in a town or state, they were in historical times the only disciplined association [Page 225] of able-bodied men who fought their country's battles in time of war and did yeoman service in time of peace.' <sup id="cite_ref-1003" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1003">[1,003]</a></sup> 'Thus, then, these Asafo Companies of young men are established with very different and diverse purposes, and their activities in recent years have given cause to much controversy as to whether they should be regarded as indispensable parts of the Akan constitution, or whether they are mere associations of young men working for their own immediate benefit and enjoyment. At one time, the rivalry between the different companies, the so-called “company fights”, became so serious that Government had to institute inquiries into the origin, constitution, and status of the Company System. The result of these inquiries did not make the contemplated abolition of the system necessary or practicable, and, for sociological purposes, the value of such associations admits of no cursory treatment.' <sup id="cite_ref-1004" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1004">[1,004]</a></sup> 'Mr. Casely Hayford deals with the Company System in his Native Institutions, but apparently he has in mind the relation between an Asafo Company and the Chief of a town or division, or between the Government and the Company System. He does not, however, lose sight of the fact that the Asafo Companies are the backbone of the country. Such a company in a town consists really of the whole male inhabitants of a town or village, exclusive only of boys under sixteen or seventeen, and of the Councillors in a Chief's Tribunal. They form a strong body of commons who, besides other duties, have also a distinct voice in the enstoolment or destoolment of local Chiefs. Without them, the governments of the Akan nations would not have that glamour of liberal sanction which makes the government of any free people at once orderly and democratic.' <sup id="cite_ref-1005" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1005">[1,005]</a></sup> 'The Asafo Companies have assumed different forms in successive ages. First there is the company which for services rendered to the town or country in time of war or of peace, has been raised to a status which entitles it to participate in the direct government of the town or country. This is effected by making the Company's captain or leader a Captain-on-Stool ( Okonnuasoni). It should be observed that captains of Asafo companies have, as a fact, no stools, and until a Company captain is created as a stool-holding captain, the succession to the captaincy is always made by vote of the members. In the old days companies were usually formed not by the admixture of different members of various families, as is the case at present, but by a collection of the members of a single family, primarily for [Page 226] defensive and offensive purposes. This class of Asafo Companies is now extinct.

<dd><b>♠ communal dining ♣ present ♥</b> Feasting was practiced during festivals. Akan communities celebrated the annual yam harvest with a public festival: 'An annual custom is always held in connection with the first fruits of each staple crop such as yam. The general name for a festival is Afahyε (afa, “festival”; hyε, “fix a day”). The chief's and head priest's house and things are refurbished [Page 35] by singing old women, the blackened stools are taken to the stream and sprinkled with water; pieces of sacrificed and new food crops are put on each stool. The spirits are invoked to start the new year and make it a good one, the new year beginning at different times in different localities.' <sup id="cite_ref-1008" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1008">[1,008]</a></sup>//'The Akan annual yam festival, a purificatory ceremony lasting one-two weeks usually in September or October, is called Odwira, meaning “to purify/cleanse”. (It is sometimes also called apafram). It is similar to the Apo in that all disputes are settled, bringing harmony back to the town. The central part of the festival is the re-purification of the stools and the abosom shrines. It is a festival involving remembrance of the dead, harvest, and thanksgiving.' <sup id="cite_ref-1009" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1009">[1,009]</a></sup>//'The Odwira Festival is the most important yearly celebration among the Ashanti people. It is held in autumn, the time when new yams are ready. They cannot be eaten until the second day of the festival, when they are paraded through the streets. The whole festival lasts for five days is celebrated slightly differently in each community. Throughout the festival, music and drumming abound. On the first day the path leading towards the chief's burial is cleaned. On the second day priests make offerings at the burial chambers and a great yam parade takes place. On the third day people mourn and fast. On the fourth a splendid feast for everyone in the community is held at the local chief's house. That night, everyone stay indoors, to avoid catching sight of the chief's thrones, symbols of the dead men's spirits, which are carried to the river to be ceremonially washed. On the fifth and final day, chiefs and other important clan members dressed in their best, parade through the town in a  grand procession to pay homage to the senior local chief. Some are carried shoulder high on litters and shaded with brilliantly coloured umbrellas. Then people play music and dance late into the night.'<sup id="cite_ref-1010" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1010">[1,010]</a></sup>//Warren provides a description of the relevant narratives and proceedings among the Techiman-Bono:'The other major annual Bono Festival is the Yam Festival ( henerεk dibayerefoforo: literally, the chief is going to eat new yams). The myth explaining the origin of the festival states that when the Techiman-Bono people came from the cavern at Amowi, Onyame pointed out forest yams (aha bayere). Seeing that bush pigs and elephants had eaten some of the yams, they cooked a few and saw that the yam was good food. They gave some to their chief, who also enjoyed it. After that, they began to celebrate on an annual basis the day on which they first found yams. After their chief died, they fed his soul (saman) yams on the same day. Later the Bono began to plant yams, and the yam became the most important staple in the Bono diet. Every farmer celebrates the festival to thank Onyame after the harvest. The living and the deceased are all invited to share in the abundance. Every Bono chief and priest celebrates a yam festival, but before the celebrations begin, a man from the village of Kenten whose title is Akokohwedeε (woodhen) first tastes the yam. When he sees that the yam is ripe, early in the morning on the traditional day called Fodwo he informs the god Taa Mεnsah that the yam is ready to be prepared for εto (mashed yams mixed with palmoil).' <sup id="cite_ref-1011" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1011">[1,011]</a></sup>//'The Taa Mεnsah deity celebrates his yam festival on Fodwo, a Monday. The new yam is hung from rafters in the shrine room for some weeks before the Akokohwedeε comes to taste it. After the yam is hung, children may begin to eat new yam and the elders can [Page 57] [Page 58] begin to eat aso bayere (one species of yam). In the evening on Fodwo, the god Taa Mεnsah is prepared to eat yam after being carried on the main street from one end of the town to the other end three times and consulted. After this, the god informs the manhene that he is about to eat yam and the manhene gives the god permission to eat the yam. The manhene sends a yam to the god and it is always this yam which is cooked as εto and placed on the shrine. The next day, Tuesday, the manhene sends a sheep and wine to the god.' <sup id="cite_ref-1012" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1012">[1,012]</a></sup>//'Two weeks after the Taa Mεnsah Yam Festival, the yam festivals for the Queenmother, the Adontenhene, and the Nifahene are celebrated on a Monofie, a Friday. Nwonakusie, a Thursday, is the yam festival day for the Twafohene, the Adaatihene, the Akyeamehene, the Konkontiwahene, and the Krontihene. Fofie, another Friday, is the yam festival day for the manhene, the Gyaasehene, the Ankbeahene, and the Barimhene. The manhene provides about six sheep and a cow for his own yam festival. These are sacrificed, the blood being spilled on the ancestral stools; the meat is cooked and distributed.' <sup id="cite_ref-1013" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1013">[1,013]</a></sup>// The Apo Festival was celebrated annually and included carnivalesque elements: 'Many festivals exist among the Akan; their foundations and functions are found in the traditional religion. The Apo festival is celebrated yearly among the Brong; it is a feast of eight days duration in which complete lampooning liberty (in the form of song) of both superiors and inferiors (without punishment) is given. The people explain that if one's sunsum is hurt, the body becomes ill; often ill health is caused by evil and the hatred another person may have for you. In like manner, if you have a hatred for someone, it affects your own sunsum, so this time is set aside to allow any man to tell any other man what has offended him. This frees the spirit, and both sunsum become relaxed. During this festival there is theoretical sexual license; this isn't really taken [Page 33] [Page 34] advantage of since traditional court action can be initiated after the eight day festival. Punishment is therefore deferred until the rites are over. Should an aggrieved party take action he forfeits the right to investigation, to satisfaction, and he is also heavily fined. During this period all the priests and priestesses of the area are present with their shrines; they touch each shrine with every other one to re-establish communications which might have been lost. The major gods are taken to the river and cleansed of all evil. On the eighth day everyone makes a concerted effort to drive all evil from the area. Around twenty-five distinct Apo songs are sung, and there is a specific Apo dance for the festival.' <sup id="cite_ref-1014" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1014">[1,014]</a></sup>//Purification is a major element in the rituals performed: 'The festival period is, in fact, a period of coming together in which the people from all over the Techiman traditional area, including well-wishers and invitees from other states, meet in the capital to display the traditional Bono culture through singing, dancing, and drumming. The manhene and his elders, through the Barimhene, purify the soul of King Ameyaw (the chief defeated by the Asante in 1723), adorn his grave with the royal regalia of the incumbent manhene, recall the deeds that Ameyaw performed for the State (man), and present drinks, sheep, and food to his soul and those of the other ancestral chiefs of the Techiman-Bono State. Finally, the Apo is a period during which the shrines of various gods and goddesses are purified. The shrine of the main deity in Techiman Township, Taa Kεse (Taa Mεnsah), is, at this time, purified at the River Agyentoamu during the last hour of the celebration; this serves as a sign of the completion of the Apo Festival.' <sup id="cite_ref-1015" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1015">[1,015]</a></sup>//The festival also served as a check on authority and as a forum for the resolution of mutual resentment: 'The functions of the Apo festival seem to be four: (1) psychological release, (2) a forum for public opinion, (3) a means to periodically check those in authority, (4) a method of enforcing sanctions of behaviour.' <sup id="cite_ref-1016" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1016">[1,016]</a></sup> According to Warren, the restoration of amicable relations is one of the major purposes of the festival: 'This festival allows every person resident in Techiman Traditional State, without regard to class, creed, ethnic group, or race, eleven days of liberty to lampoon, in the form of songs and proverbs, the faults and malpractices of any other person, including those in authority-especially the manhene and his divisional chiefs. In addition, the people may sing the praises of those in authority in appreciation of worthy achievements so as to encourage them to even greater deeds. During this period it is strictly forbidden to fight in any way. The emphasis of the festival is upon the removal of bitterness and misfortune in the State. After all personal grudges, faults, and hatreds are sung and spoken out amicably, the end result is renewed peace and harmony among the Techiman inhabitants; the spirit (sunsum) of the [Page 56] state is cleansed after all the unspoken interpersonal bitternesses are voiced.' <sup id="cite_ref-1017" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1017">[1,017]</a></sup> While the descriptions refer to the Ashanti period, we have assumed that they are broadly applicable to the pre-Ashanti period as well.</dd>

<dd><b>♠ Ideology forbids slavery universally ♣ absent ♥</b> Slavery was widely practiced: 'The Akan practiced slavery, obtaining slaves from northern slave dealers, usually Muslims. War captives, criminals, persons who opposed local chiefs, and many local ritual leaders were also enslaved. Slaves were used for domestic and field labor, for sale to traders across the Sahara and Atlantic, and as sacrifices to royal and other ancestors. In the middle of the nineteenth century, slaves amounted to half of the population in many towns. [MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-1018" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1018">[1,018]</a></sup> Uncles could 'pawn' their nephew and nieces: 'An uncle had the power to pawn his nephew or niece. The whole legal position of pawns ( nwowa) will be examined later in detail under that heading. An uncle was expected to give the father of the person he wished to pawn ‘the first refusal’, that is, to ask him if he would not himself like to take his own child as his pawn. In any case, whether the father desired to do so or not, he might not protest or interfere. My Ashanti informants state that the person to be pawned would not wish him to do either, and remarked, Oba ose ose dome abusua (‘A child may resemble his father, but affection (duty) is for the blood relations’); and again, Gyadua si abontene ne hi wo fie (‘The gyadua (tree) may stand in the street, but its roots are in the house). ‘His uncle may not beat or punish your child while he is under your care, but, on the other hand, you may spend much money on your children, consulting the gods, yet when their uncle's house becomes poor he will sell them.’' <sup id="cite_ref-1019" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1019">[1,019]</a></sup> 'An uncle had the power to compel his niece to divorce her husband so that he might pawn her to raise money to ‘buy the head’ of one of his abusua. He would give her husband the option to advance the money, taking his wife as a pawn, but if he could not or would not do so, two courses were open to him: ( a) To put white clay upon his wife's back, i. e. divorce her, to enable her uncle to pawn her elsewhere, or, ( b) Pawn himself or his nephew to pay the debt of his wife's uncle.' <sup id="cite_ref-1020" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1020">[1,020]</a></sup> 'My informant added, ‘If you refused to do either of these things, the uncle would “swear an oath” upon you to buy your wife for some large amount ( tramma), for your wife is the property of her uncle, she is his agyapadie (inherited ancestral property).' <sup id="cite_ref-1021" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1021">[1,021]</a></sup> There were multiple classes of slaves: 'The Akan groups are characterized by matrilineal descent, inheritance, and succession. The Fanti and Ashanti have exogamous patrilineages also, making a double descent system. There is polygamy. In traditional Ghana when custom had determining influence on social life, a preference was given to cross-cousin marriage which among other things ensured that, in spite of matrilineal system of inheritance, the daughters of a man benefited from his property which they and their mother helped him to acquire. Local endogamy and traditional slavery and debt slavery also prevailed. There are no endogamous castes and no initiation schools.' <sup id="cite_ref-1022" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1022">[1,022]</a></sup> 'Slaves were not allowed to mix freely with free-men or allowed to go to the chief's palace; they were required to work harder and to do the dirty work. Moreover they were not accorded a funeral custom. There were four sub-classes of slaves. (1) The akoa (plural nkoa) originally referred only to voluntary servitude of a person to, for example, his MoBr (w[unavailable]fa). The best translation originally would have been “subject”; in reality it came to include persons whom another person had power over, merging with [unavailable]d[unavailable]nk[unavailable], the slave proper. (2) [unavailable]d[unavailable]nk[unavailable] (plural nn[unavailable]nk[unavailable], nn[unavailable]nk[unavailable]fo is a non-Akan purchased expressly as a slave. The second generation would always be termed akoa. They were usually bought at Salaga, a male costing the equivalent in cowries of 9,000 kola nuts, a female costing the equivalent of 14,000 kola nuts. Outside of Ashanti the master had life and death prerogative over his slaves; within Ashanti any execution had to be performed by the Asantehene's executioners. (3) The dommum was a foreign prisoner of war or tribute. All these [Page 40] classes of slaves could marry, own property (including his own slaves), swear an oath, and become heir to his master. A slave could swear an oath to be taken by another master if badly treated. Slaves could be sacrificed, and a reserve of them were kept at a special village (Akyere kurom). (4) An akyere was a slave condemned to death for an offense but saved until a sacrifice was required.'  <sup id="cite_ref-1023" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1023">[1,023]</a></sup> Slaves could not hold stools and only inherited their master's wealth if no matrikin were present: 'Inheritance is arranged by the ohurew or executor responsible for all the funeral arrangements. Ideally the ohurew is the deceased's father's younger brother's son, in the same generation but preferably junior to the deceased. For a female deceased the ideal is FaBrDa. A dying declaration (samansew) is binding if there are witnesses. Although the ohurew is required to settle and distribute the estate, there is a constant problem of distinguishing family from self-acquired property. “The uncle seems in theory the heir to the personal property of his nephews, but almost invariably he waives his right in favour of the deceased's next eldest brother” (Rattray 1929:4). Next in line after eldest brother is the next brother in age until all the deceased's brothers are exhausted. Next is SiSo, then MoSiSo, and finally after all the male possibilities are exhausted the females are eligible for male property, beginning with the deceased's eldest sister. If all relatives are dead, the property (but never a stool) is inherited by a slave, even before the man's actual children — who are completely excluded. This same line of inheritance is followed in the succession for a stool, except that the line stops at slaves and women.' <sup id="cite_ref-1024" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1024">[1,024]</a></sup> But slaves could be adopted into matrilineages: 'Douglas has argued that “matrilineal descent groups are organised to recruit members by other means additional to direct lineal descent”; that “matrilineal descent goes with a quality of openness in the texture of effective descent groups”; and that [Page 80] 'because of the open texture of its descent groups and its bias towards a wide-ranging recruitment of manpower, matriliny is well adapted to any situation in which competing demands for men are higher than demands for material resources.' We suggest, then, that this “open texture” may have been at least one of the factors dictating the new form of social organization that appeared [Page 81] at the time of the clearances: the matriclan functioned to facilitate the assimilation of strangers and, to the point, of the unfree labor being drawn into the forest country. From more recent times we know that those of unfree origins were assimilated as rapidly as possible into the class of free Asante commoners and their acquired status afforded full protection of the law. An Ashanti slave,” wrote Rattray, in nine cases out of ten, possibly became an adopted member of the family, and in time his descendants so merged and intermarried with the owner's kinsmen that only a few would know their origin.' But Rattray still failed to allow fully for the “open texture” of the matrilineal group. The view has been expressed to the writer on many occasions that “in the old days” women married at a young age and men at a relatively advanced one; hat a male slave might often become the third, fourth, or even fifth husband of a (by then elderly) free woman, so that any children she bore by him would be free; and that female slaves were often married by free men and their children immediately adopted into the father's lineage.' <sup id="cite_ref-1025" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1025">[1,025]</a></sup> But slaves had no recourse to corporate descent groups of their own and could be ritually sacrificed: 'Such briefly were the rights of an Ashantislave. They seemed in many instances practically the ordinary privileges of any Ashanti free man, with whom, in these respects, his position did not seem to compare so unfavourably. The chief danger in which his peculiar status placed him appears to me to lie in the fact that the slave was generally a solitary creature more or less at the mercy of a single individual. Every one around him was in a sense ‘the slave’ of some one, but such persons had always behind them a whole group of relatives, whose numbers and wealth and power were ever at their disposal. The slave was not ordinarily possessed jointly (a position which would have ensured certain safeguards); at least, not when a member of a family had purchased him with the proceeds of his own individual labour. It seems probable that circumstances generally would have tended towards his kind treatment. An Ashanti slave, in nine cases out of ten, possibly became an adopted member of the family, and in time his descendants so merged and intermarried with the owner's kinsmen that only a few would know their origin. One outstanding fact, however, remained, i.e. that the status of a slave, i.e. an odonko, could never be lost, and, when necessity arose, or the terrible practice of human sacrifice became the vogue, an otherwise kind and considerate master would turn instinctively to the man who had no friend in the world, in order to satisfy the need for money or for a victim. The liability to be sacrificed at funeral customs may have been an ever-present fear in the mind of a West African slave. Many persons indeed were inevitably condemned to such an end. This idea was, as time went on, developed in an extraordinary degree. Whole villages existed where all the inhabitants were looked upon as a human reservoir from which, when occasion arose, sacrificial victims might be drawn. Such villages were called Akyere kurom (village of Akyere). Akyere means a slave who, instead of suffering immediate capital punishment for some offence of which he had been found guilty, was [Page 43] held over till his unhappy services were required. Meanwhile the person thus condemned went about his or her ordinary vocations, possibly was kept waiting for death for many years, married, brought children into the world, who again married and bore grandchildren to the original culprit. All these descendants (through the female line) inherited the liability of their ancestor to suffer capital punishment at any moment, and helped to swell a reserve of potential funeral victims.' <sup id="cite_ref-1026" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1026">[1,026]</a></sup> Slaves featured prominently in the trade with European powers: 'The fact of the matter is, then, that when the Portuguese entered the Akan gold trade in 1471, those they sought to do business with already had strong consumer preferences, formed in the context of their prior involvement with the Wangara. There was, however, one commodity that was not available from the northern traders: firearms. Initially, so it seems, a brisk exchange of guns for gold took place at Elmina, though such transactions were banned by papal decree. Pope Sixtus IV was petitioned to lift the restriction. On 28 January 1481, he forgave those who had transgressed but reaffirmed the ban. The Christian fear that arms sold at Elmina might find their way into Muslim hands was, in the circumstances, not entirely without foundation. The decision to build the fort of São Jorge at Elmina was taken in the belief that other Portuguese-manufactured produce—“silk, woollen and linen cloths, and other domestic goods” —would find a ready market there. Certainly objects of copper and brass did, whether shaving bowls, urinals, chamber pots, water jugs, bells, boxes, or bracelets (manilhas). Portuguese cloth, however, was apparently not so well received, and the Casa de Guiné in Lisbon was obliged to procure North African “lambens,” “aljaravias,” and the like, to service the Elmina trade. Vogt has suggested that in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries cloth accounted for about 40 percent of the business done at São Jorge, and metals for about 37 percent. Next to these was the sale of slaves, accounting for about 10 percent of trade. Duarte Pacheco Pereira's informants on the Gambia spoke, as we have seen, of the merchants of Bitu, “Banbarranaa,” and “Bahaa” going to “Toom,” that is, the Akan country, “to buy gold in exchange for the merchandise and slaves which they take there.” In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries a strong demand for labor arose in forest Akan society as local entrepreneurs, the aberemp[unavailable]n, sought to increase the extent of the cleared land available for tillage (see chapters 2 and 3). Slaves, in other words, could readily be traded against gold. By virtue of their command of the maritime routes, the Portuguese were able to insinuate themselves into this lucrative business. By 1479 Portuguese vessels were already [Page 24] moving slaves to Elmina from as far east as the Benin coast, and after 1515 the islands of São Tomé and Principe were developed as depots for the expanding enterprise. “Both during the life of Don João (1481-95) and of Dom Manuel (1495-1521),” wrote De Barros, 'this sale of slaves continued from Beny [Benin] to Mina, for ordinarily the ships that left this Kingdom went to Beny to buy the slaves, and then carried them to the Mina, until this trade was altered on account of the great inconvenience which arose. A large caravel was wont to sail from the island of S. Thome, where the slaves of the coast of Beny joined those from the kingdom of Congo, because all the vessels that sailed to those parts called there, and this caravel carried them from the island to Mina.' <sup id="cite_ref-1027" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1027">[1,027]</a></sup> 'For the period 1500-35 it has been estimated that the Portuguese imported ten to twelve thousand slaves to Elmina, though the figure takes no account of those landed by smugglers and interlopers. Although their sale accounted for only some 10 percent of the Portuguese trade at Elmina, it was critical in luring the inland merchants to the coast. “An adequate and continuous supply of slaves was indispensable for the success of Portuguese trade at São Jorge da Mina,” Vogt remarks. “Without such slaves, much of the remainder of the trade-goods would not have been sold.” The total cost, including purchase price, transportation, and food, of a slave procured in the Slave Rivers and sold at Elmina was reckoned at about one-third of an ounce of gold. The sale price ranged from about three to six ounces, according to physique.' <sup id="cite_ref-1028" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1028">[1,028]</a></sup> We have assumed the above material is broadly applicable to the pre-Ashanti period as well.</dd></dl>

<p><b>Supernatural beings (e.g., gods, spirits, ancestors)</b>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>♠ Number of officially sanctioned supernatural beings ♣ polytheistic ♥</b> The pantheon was made up of an omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient high/creator god as well as various other deities, spirits and ancestors. eHRAF provides the following summary: 'Indigenous Akan religion is based upon the worship of a High God, various spirits or deities, and ancestors. The High God-known as Onyame, Onyankopon, and by other names-is the Creator, now otiose; Asase Yaa, the goddess of the earth, accompanies him. The ancestors live in the land of the dead and may demand offerings, in the past including those of slaves.'<sup id="cite_ref-1048" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1048">[1,048]</a></sup> It is unclear how many spirits and gods there were, which is partly due to the fact that different towns and other localities had their own gods. We have focused on the ‘native’ religion, not converts to Christianity.</dd>

He is Totarobonsu, that is to say, “he pours and pours, and the waters are made.” He is never dried up. Another strong name of Onyankopon Kwame is Abommubuwafre, that is to say, “he is the one who when lamentation or weeping comes upon you, you call upon.” When thus called upon, he answers you. Another strong name of Onyankopon is Nya-amane-kose, that is to say, “he is the one to whom if you report (or tell) any need or trouble, he is able to help you.” Onyankopon Kwame's further strong name is Brckyirihuade, that is to say, “he is the one who knows what is happening in his presence as well as behind his back.” He is the knower of the universe of things.'<sup id="cite_ref-1049" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1049">[1,049]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b>♠ High Gods (creator gods) ♣ moralizing ♥</b> Onyankopon created and governs the cosmos: this is clearly expressed in the first two of the following four quotes. The third and fourth clearly show that only those who follow obra (good conduct; e.g. reciprocity, mutual aid) join the Nana (ancestors) in the afterlife, and the third one implies (but, it should be noted, does not state clearly) that Onyankopon decides who has followed obra when it says that the Nana 'show the right way in which mortal man should live so as to come to the Supreme Being.'

<p><b>Supernatural Enforcement of Morality</b>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement against harm ♣ inferred present ♥</b> Belief that morality flows from the gods in Akan religion, and widespread taboo against murder in African religions. "According to Opoku (1978), this [Akan] proverb [i.e. "God is against sin or evil"] is a clear indication that morality flows from God, and that the nature of God demands an appropriate response from His creatures. Adding to Opoku (1978), Harris and Sawyerr (1968) also refer to the Mende myth that explains the origin of sacrifice of fowls, performed when someone has offended another to illustrate God’s attitude towards morality. For Mbiti (1969), morality flows from religion. By this assertion, he argues that one should view morality as an authoritative code of conduct directly sanctioned by superhuman being (god, deities and even ancestors). The moral code that Mbiti (1969) refers to is therefore not autonomous, but its autonomy is derived from the creator god. Any breach of the moral code would accordingly be an offence against god and his instruction. Mbiti (1969) points out that there is in existence and operation numerous taboos and prohibitions in African societies which Ghana is of no exemption. These taboos and prohibitions, which have their source from religion according to Mbiti, are instituted to shape the moral lives of the people belonging to that society. Taboos and prohibitions such as, stealing, pre-marital sex, murder, incest, having sexual intercourse in the bush, adultery and suicide were viewed with serious concerns and offenders were seriously punished not by man as such, but predominantly by the gods and the ancestral spirits. By this, the divine (gods and ancestors) inflict drought, infertility and sicknesses on the life of the offender and the entire society."<sup id="cite_ref-1060" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1060">[1,060]</a></sup> The following is also worth noting, especially as it related specifically to this NGA: 'Each man's way of life (abrabo) serves as his conduct before the ancestors.

"According to Opoku (1978), this [Akan] proverb [i.e. "God is against sin or evil"] is a clear indication that morality flows from God, and that the nature of God demands an appropriate response from His creatures. Adding to Opoku (1978), Harris and Sawyerr (1968) also refer to the Mende myth that explains the origin of sacrifice of fowls, performed when someone has offended another to illustrate God’s attitude towards morality. For Mbiti (1969), morality flows from religion. By this assertion, he argues that one should view morality as an authoritative code of conduct directly sanctioned by superhuman being (god, deities and even ancestors). The moral code that Mbiti (1969) refers to is therefore not autonomous, but its autonomy is derived from the creator god. Any breach of the moral code would accordingly be an offence against god and his instruction. Mbiti (1969) points out that there is in existence and operation numerous taboos and prohibitions in African societies which Ghana is of no exemption. These taboos and prohibitions, which have their source from religion according to Mbiti, are instituted to shape the moral lives of the people belonging to that society. Taboos and prohibitions such as, stealing, pre-marital sex, murder, incest, having sexual intercourse in the bush, adultery and suicide were viewed with serious concerns and offenders were seriously punished not by man as such, but predominantly by the gods and the ancestral spirits.

It is, I suggest, mutatis mutandis, a paradigm of sorts for the early Akan state. Those who controlled the production and sale of gold were those able to procure a supply of unfree labor. Those who procured unfree labor were those able to create arable land within the forest. Those who created the arable were those who founded the numerous early Akan polities. We see, in other words, a class of Akan entrepreneurs emerging: a class of those able to use the strength of the world bullion market, and the availability of labor locally (whether through Wangara or Portuguese suppliers), in such a way as to create the new agrarian system. These entrepreneurs were known as the aberemp[unavailable]n (sing. [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n), literally “big men” but correctly glossed in an early European source as “a superior rich man.” ' <sup id="cite_ref-1097" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1097">[1,097]</a></sup> 'Akan village histories make frequent reference to hunters ranging the forest in search of land suitable for agricultural exploitation—taking account, presumably, of surface relief, water resources, soil, and so forth.

By way of illustration I shall cite the cases of two, Tabiri Heman and Akuamoa Panin.' <sup id="cite_ref-1098" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1098">[1,098]</a></sup> 'The descendants of free settlers became [unavailable]manmufo, citizens. Those of the proprietors became adehyeε, nobility. There remain the unfree laborers. They must surely be those who became the third major element in the composition of an [unavailable]man, namely the gyaasefo. Literally “the people of the hearth,” they were absorbed into Akan society as servants of the adehyeε. They became responsible not only for their own subsistence but for that of the nobles. They farmed for them, assumed responsibility for their debts, and provided them with a wide range of personal services as stool-carriers, drummers, hornblowers, umbrella-carriers, bathroom attendants, messengers, tradesmen, sextons, and so forth. Their masters (or mistresses) were heirs to their property. Their status, unlike that of nobles and citizens, was transmitted through the male line. Rattray commented on the matter: [Page 100] 'There is little doubt that the Gyasefo were in olden times recruited from the slave class. A “Stool” slave became one of the Gyasefo. The descendants of a Gyase woman were of course considered as Gyasefo, down the female line for all time; not only was this so, but the son of a Gyase man would ordinarily also enter the office to which his father belonged, irrespective of the position of his mother.' <sup id="cite_ref-1099" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1099">[1,099]</a></sup> 'It is virtually impossible to render such terms as adehyeε, [unavailable]manmufo and gyaasefo into English with the appropriate nuances. Adehyeε may preside over the affairs of anything from villages on the one hand to kingdoms on the other. Their power will rest in no small measure upon the sheer numbers of gyaasefo whose services they command; indeed, this is one index of their rank. In 1936 Oheneba Sakyi Djan manfully struggled with the problem, though with reference to the more southerly forest Akan: 'The term “Gyaase”…applies to the most immediate adherents attached to the household of any important personage. In this instance, even an ordinary well-to-do man (rich man) may have his own Gyaase, so much so that the head of a family (Opanyin or Atrankonnua) or a ruler of a town (Odekro), or a head of a division of a state (Ohene) or the supreme head or king of a state (Omanhene) should necessarily have his own Gyaase-men, and the number of the members constituting the Gyaase of each of the above heads depends on the importance of the party concerned. That is to say, the number of the members of the Gyaase attached to the Ohene's household is by far fewer than that attached to the Omanhene household.' It was all to do with achievement. The fortunes of an [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n depended first on his ability to procure the labor that, the estate established, became his gyaasefo, and second on his ability to attract free settlers to the estate. Measured in these terms the relatively unsuccessful [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n emerged as no more than a village head, an [unavailable]dekuro, and was absorbed in time into the aman (qua state) of his more successful peer, the [unavailable]hene of this or that group of towns and villages, and he in turn into the aman (qua kingdom) of those even more successful. We turn to a consideration of the most successful of all.' <sup id="cite_ref-1100" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1100">[1,100]</a></sup> Wilks provides a general description of the class structure as it was present during the Ashanti period: 'It is notoriously difficult to characterize the class structure of precapitalist societies. To this generalization Asante is no exception, though R. A. Kea's studies of a number of seventeenth century Akan polities have provided an invaluable lead.  For present purposes the postulate is that a class reproduces itself as a class and that it does so only insofar as it has a determinate and specific, though not necessarily direct, relationship to the means of production. Consider, for example, the Asante class of the adehyeε, a word commonly but inappropriately translated [Page 294] “royalty” in English. “The old adage” (and I quote the collective wisdom of the late Asantehene and his councillors in a judgment passed down in 1964) “is that a royal is one whose ancestor had established or founded a village." This succinct statement of traditional usage defines a class within Asante society by implicit reference to a set of proprietary rights over land exercised by those who were thereby able to appropriate, in the form of tributes, taxes, and services, part of the labor-value of others settled on the land. I have elsewhere suggested that the origins of the adehyeε class are to be sought in the context of the great economic transformations associated with the development of forest agriculture. I have also suggested that the gyaasefo emerged as a servile class in precisely the same context. In this chapter I argue that the asomfo, or those in administrative service, came to constitute a class within Asante society in precisely the same sense of class. Unlike both adehyeε and gyaasefo, however, the asomfo class emerged in an urban rather than rural context, and at a much later date: its full development was, therefore, specific to Asante rather than common to Akan society in general.' <sup id="cite_ref-1101" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1101">[1,101]</a></sup> Obedience to authority was valued: 'It is the duty of the Head of a family to bring up the members thereof in the way they should go; and by “family” you must understand the entire lineal descendants of a head materfamilias, if I may coin a convenient phrase. It is expected of him by the State to bring up his charge in the knowledge of matters political and traditional. It is his work to train up his wards in the ways of loyalty and obedience to the powers that be. He is held responsible for the freaks of recalcitrant members of his family, and he is looked to to keep them within bounds, and to insist upon conformity on their part with the customs, laws, and traditional observances of the community.

It is also a ‘feast of the dead’ which is associated with new crops and first fruits (Bowdich, 1819: 274-278; Rattray, 1923; 151-171; 1927: 122-143; Busia, 1951; 1954).' <sup id="cite_ref-1105" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1105">[1,105]</a></sup> 'The Akan annual yam festival, a purificatory ceremony lasting one-two weeks usually in September or October, is called Odwira, meaning “to purify/cleanse”.

In addition, the people may sing the praises of those in authority in appreciation of worthy achievements so as to encourage them to even greater deeds. During this period it is strictly forbidden to fight in any way. The emphasis of the festival is upon the removal of bitterness and misfortune in the State.

An elderly female has handmade beads placed in a brass pan before her body; these are buried with her. It is said that a spirit-woman called Amokye will not allow women without beads to pass into the ancestral realm. A sheep is slaughtered to purify the town and the lineage stool; this ritual is called the removal of misfortune or evil. Guns, frequently old Danish guns, are fired at intervals; Christians, however, seldom follow this particular custom. The corpse is usually buried the same or the day after death; the actual funeral (ayie) usually takes place a week or so later, after the entire extended family can be informed. The date may be extended further into the future if the family lacks sufficient financial resources. Ideally there are remembrance funeral ceremonies at one week, at two weeks, at 42 days, at 80 days, and at a year (afrenhyia) after a death, although ceremonies subsequent to the first-week funeral may be quite perfunctory.

The shedding of blood was therefore seen as fundamentally antithetical to the natural order and was regulated by the Seventy-Seven Laws of Okomfo Anokye. Putting criminals to death and the slaying of persons to accompany the dead in the next world were sanctioned, but had to be carried out by the highly trained and ritually prepared adumfo or public executioners. The same Laws addressed the matter of menstrual blood. Menstruating women were forbidden from entering any regular dwelling house and were provided with special buildings for the duration. They were not allowed to swear an oath, to address any servant of the king (ahenkwaa) or any priest ([unavailable]komfo), or to have sexual intercourse.

It consisted of two or sometimes three distinct parts, the afuwa, mfufuwa and mfufuwa-nini. The land currently under cultivation was the afuwa, “the little farm” or field, and the land under fallow was the mfufuwa, literally “the non- afuwa.” A farmer's rights of tenure over his fallow were as secure as those over his land under cultivation. In some cases a farm may have attached to it further land — fallow that has not been brought back into cultivation at the appropriate time because, for example, of unsatisfactory yields or of the inability of the tenants (through illnesses, deaths, or the like) to resume cropping it. Such land is the mfufuwa-nini, literally “barren fallow.” The original tenants and their heirs retain rights to the produce from it — to the fruits of palm and kola trees, for example, and to firewood and poles — but Asante law appears not to have defined with any precision the point in time at which others might acquire rights in it and recommence farming operations. Much litigation results.' <sup id="cite_ref-1131" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1131">[1,131]</a></sup> 'Akan village histories make frequent reference to hunters ranging the forest in search of land suitable for agricultural exploitation—taking account, presumably, of surface relief, water resources, soil, and so forth. The role of the aberemp[unavailable]n in these explorations is often described in considerable detail. By way of illustration I shall cite the cases of two, Tabiri Heman and Akuamoa Panin.' <sup id="cite_ref-1132" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1132">[1,132]</a></sup> 'The aberemp[unavailable]n were essentially developers. They created estates, founding villages and clearing the arable land necessary for subsistence. I refer to such estates as “ beremp[unavailable]n-doms” (by analogy with “kingdoms,” “chiefdoms,” etc.). Of the actual work of felling, clearing, and building, and of how the imported unfree labor was used, we know nothing. Such is not the stuff of tradition. Kea has drawn attention to a possible model, that of Aduafo of Afutu and “other great lords” who had contracted with the Danish African Company to clear a site and construct a trading post for them. They brought 300 of their slaves to the site and divided them [Page 98] into two teams. One carried out the clearing while the other assembled the building materials. This was, however, at a coastal location and is therefore of uncertain relevance.' <sup id="cite_ref-1133" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1133">[1,133]</a></sup> 'If the creation of an estate was predicated on the procurement of unfree labor, its prosperity depended on free settlers being attracted to it. Such was the pressure on land, on arable land, that they came. Sometimes the original estate was subdivided by purchase. For example, Adu Gyamfi, by origin from Adansemanso, founded a settlement named Aboforumu. It lay about 12 miles northwest of what was to become Kumase. He subsequently sold (“as the explorers or the owners of the land”) part of the estate to new settlers, Amma Badu and Antwi, who paid him mperedwan aduosia, 60 peredwans or some 135 oz. of gold. The estate was soon to be divided yet again. We have met Akosua Yitua of Asantemanso and her son Danso Abeam, above. She had five daughters. The third of these settled at Amoaman, but her descendants “became hemmed in at this village.” They moved northward, and their leader, Adu Panin, purchased a block of land from Amma Badu and Antwi. He renamed it Ntonso. The price is not reported. The transaction is said to have occurred at the time of Oti Akenten of Kumase. Other cases did not involve purchase, but contract sometimes sealed by marriage. The case of Kyerewa Akenten and her brother, Kagya, is instructive. They left Asantemanso in search of land and, after rejecting several places as unsuitable, arrived at Oyoko, near Feyiase. They went from there 'to Odum-Anaafuo to ask Berefo Kese, the Chief of the place for some land to settle on. He showed them a site where they built their village which they named “Kagya-kurom” [Kagya's village]. Owing to the large number of the followers of Kagya and his sister, Berefo Kese presented them a large portion of his lands on which they farmed. From Kagya-kurom Berefo Kese married Kyerewa Akenten and after their marriage Berefo Kese added a much larger portion of his lands to that already in their hands and presented it to them.' <sup id="cite_ref-1134" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1134">[1,134]</a></sup> 'Obtaining land involved negotiation with the [unavailable]beremp[unavailable]n who had developed it, who had (as it were) staked out first claims to it.

In fact these are dispersed almost randomly throughout forest society. As Fortes has remarked, the matriclan “delimits a diffuse field of amity, wide in extent but of minimal structural specificity.” Within the beremp[unavailable]n-dom, of the rule of exogamy, and in that respect was a socially integrative factor.

The struggles that attended the process are exhaustively chronicled in Akan traditions; the nature of the process itself, whereby a class of entrepreneurs became transformed into a ruling class, is not. The key lies in an understanding of the peculiar features of Akan land proprietorship.' <sup id="cite_ref-1136" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1136">[1,136]</a></sup> 'A cardinal feature of the system is expressed in the maxim, afuo mu yε me deε, asase yε [unavailable]hene deε, “the farm is my property, the land is the king's.” It is necessary to extrapolate from more recent practice, described by Rattray, Busia, and Fortes among others. If the proprietor of the land conferred heritable rights to the arable on those who were permitted to settle, he also reserved or established certain rights to himself and his heirs — to his “stool.” He took an almost token part of the harvest at the time of the annual harvest festival (the odwira), but required a more substantial share of the produce of the land as opposed to the arable: fish, snails, game, kola, minerals, and the like. He could levy a wide range of taxes, such as peato for military expenses, ayieto for funerals, and [unavailable]manto to defray the costs of making regalia and putting up buildings. Most importantly, he could require the provision of labor for military service or, for example, for work on the roads. Such, briefly, were what led Potekhin to refer to “the relatively easy feudal dues of the free members of the community.” Relatively easy” they may or may not have been; there was variation from place to place and time to time. “Feudal” they were not, for the free settlers acquired almost unassailable titles to the land they farmed, while the various taxes and services provided to the landholder were ad hoc and sporadic and did not approximate in character to a rent, whether economic or otherwise.' <sup id="cite_ref-1137" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1137">[1,137]</a></sup> 'The descendants of free settlers became [unavailable]manmufo, citizens. Those of the proprietors became adehyeε, nobility. There remain the unfree laborers. They must surely be those who became the third major element in the composition of an [unavailable]man, namely the gyaasefo. Literally “the people of the hearth,” they were absorbed into Akan society as servants of the adehyeε. They became responsible not only for their own subsistence but for that of the nobles. They farmed for them, assumed responsibility for their debts, and provided them with a wide range of personal services as stool-carriers, drummers, hornblowers, umbrella-carriers, bathroom attendants, messengers, tradesmen, sextons, and so forth. Their masters (or mistresses) were heirs to their property. Their status, unlike that of nobles and citizens, was transmitted through the male line. Rattray commented on the matter: [Page 100] 'There is little doubt that the Gyasefo were in olden times recruited from the slave class. A “Stool” slave became one of the Gyasefo. The descendants of a Gyase woman were of course considered as Gyasefo, down the female line for all time; not only was this so, but the son of a Gyase man would ordinarily also enter the office to which his father belonged, irrespective of the position of his mother.' <sup id="cite_ref-1138" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1138">[1,138]</a></sup> Theft was punished: 'By virtue of his position, all penalties for breach of the [Page 30] tribal or public oath are collected for and paid to the Ohene, in addition to certain court fees, such as Asida, or Atingé. In former times the Ohene of every large town was entitled to fine strangers entering his town bearing arms without his permission so to do. Fines are paid for accidental homicide; such as carelessly wounding a person taking part in the chase. A person found guilty of criminal intercourse with a married woman is liable to pay to the injured husband a fine of two ounces of gold (benda), that is, £7 4 s. In cases of theft the guilty offender is made to restore to the owner the stolen article or its value, and to his ruler he pays a fine. Where a thief is unable to restore a priceless article, he is killed, and his nearest blood relatives are fined, and, if unable to pay, are sold for the amount. The amount of a fine for theft does not depend so much on the value of the article as upon the nature thereof; e.g. it is not considered theft for a starving man to steal any foodstuff to appease his hunger. Among a people who have been accustomed to have all things in common, the sensibility of many persons to the criminality of theft is not so great as in Europe.

They are "fed" at shrines in the form of blackened stools of wood and kept in the "stool rooms" in palaces and houses. Traditionally, the stools were anointed with human blood, gunpowder, and spider webs, and given alcoholic drink; human sacrifices are no longer made. Each kingdom and town has, or had in past years, an annual purification ritual, known as ODWIRA, in which the king, the office of kingship, the kingdom, and the town are purified of the pollution of the preceding year; this is often known in the literature as a "yam festival." [MG]'<sup id="cite_ref-1145" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1145">[1,145]</a></sup> The Akan pantheon featured an omnipotent and omniscient supreme being (see also above). Gods and ancestors were thought to watch over the moral conduct of humans. Good deeds were rewarded in the afterlife, while bad deeds were punished: 'All ancestors are children of Nyame. Ancestors pass on to their children those things required of them by the Supreme Being as his children. They stand (mediate) between their children and the Supreme Being. They show the right way in which mortal man should live so as to come to the Supreme Being. That good or right way is called conduct (obra) or good conduct (obra pa). The Ga people call it dzenba (world-coming) [Page 24] that is, way of being, or living, in this world; the way in which one makes good or behaves himself in the world.' <sup id="cite_ref-1146" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1146">[1,146]</a></sup> 'Each man's way of life (abrabo) serves as his conduct before the ancestors. He who lives in the right way is said to have a good soul, and when he dies, he too becomes a Nana (ancestor) and joins the ancestors. He who does not live in the right way is an accursed soul, and when he dies, he is not called Nana; he has not a good soul, and he does not join the Nananom. The sunsum of a wicked or accursed man does not agree with Odomankoma, who is spoken of in succeeding chapters and who created the Thing. He becomes a hovering spirit and is unable to proceed to any desirable habitat.'<sup id="cite_ref-1147" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1147">[1,147]</a></sup> 'Every good spirit belongs to the Supreme Being.

In their simplest form the temples were small rectangular buildings, entered by steps, the outer surfaces decorated with low reliefs and covered with red and white clay. More usually they consisted of a number of units around a court. Here male priests would periodically carry the god's shrine on their heads, becoming possessed and showing their powers to see, say and do things beyond the abilities of ordinary mortals.' <sup id="cite_ref-1149" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1149">[1,149]</a></sup> 'Beneath 'Nyame are the atano and abosom, ‘gods’ or ‘powers’ who possess men and women to serve as mediumistic priests (ak[unknown]mfo) and can provide guidance and aid. Each god has its own character, revealed by the movements and speech of the possessed priest, although the latter cannot recall what occurs when he is seized by the god.' <sup id="cite_ref-1150" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1150">[1,150]</a></sup> 'Gods still reveal themselves, perhaps most commonly by ‘seizing’ persons, making them behave as if they were becoming mad (abondamfo). The person becomes disoriented (sometimes running wildly into the bush and becoming lost), speaks incoherently and hears voices. He or she may cease to eat and become withdrawn. Herbalists (dunsinfo) and priests will be consulted until the cause has been identified. Sometimes the priests will decide, while possessed by their own gods, that a new or an established god wishes the afflicted person to become its priest. The situation of the first seizing may suggest this: for example, if a person is possessed at a priest's funeral, it will be assumed that the dead priest's god is seeking a successor.' <sup id="cite_ref-1151" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1151">[1,151]</a></sup> 'These shrines (yowa) are of crucial importance in Asante religion. Each was usually kept in a special room inside a compound, a white cloth draped over the door to warn menstruating women away. Some of the most successful gods were kept in a separate temple (bosom'dan or bosom'fie). The shrine was placed upon the head of a male priest on ‘bad’ days (nnabone) in the forty-two-day cycle (see p.53), and the priest became possessed, usually inside the shrine room, where supplicants consulted him. Later in the day he would sometimes dance with the god on his head to the music of the god's drums and the songs of women devotees. Numbers of gold-weights depict this dance. Occasionally a priest would display his prowess by dancing with the heavy pan resting on his shoulders and the nape of his neck, his head pushed forward.' <sup id="cite_ref-1152" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1152">[1,152]</a></sup> 'It was the role of gods and priests to advise on obscure areas of existence, to trace the causes of sickness and misfortune, and help alleviate or remove these. The gods helped to make sense of the ways in which the lives of individuals and the community departed from the expected. Answers to supplicants' inquiries were often phrased in allusive and ambiguous terms.' <sup id="cite_ref-1153" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1153">[1,153]</a></sup> 'Powerful priests are believed to be aided by creatures from the wild — mmoatia (literally, ‘short’ or ‘little beasts’), a term usually translated as ‘dwarfs’. These are described as being about 30-60 cm in height, more or less of human form except that their feet point backwards. There are three sorts: red, black and white, the three basic colour groups of the Asante spectrum. Dwarfs are unpredictable: they may either attack or befriend those lost in the bush. A person befriended is miraculously sustained with eggs touched to the mouth. Dwarfs also teach the powers of herbs to lost people who help others when they return from the bush. They communicate by whistling, the pattern of tones reproducing those of ordinary speech.' <sup id="cite_ref-1154" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1154">[1,154]</a></sup> 'Formerly priests and priestesses lived somewhat outside normal society and were feared by ordinary people. Their primary function was to control the [Page 63] intrusion of supernatural beings into human life and they conversed with powers unknown and invisible to most humans. It is said priests and priestesses did not marry, and Bowdich claimed priestesses were highly promiscuous, that is they disregarded normal sexual rules. Appearance emphasised ak[unknown]mfo'sdifference. Their costume was a raffia skirt (d[unknown]s[unknown]) and when possessed they went barefoot — the antithesis of chiefs whose feet were supposed never to touch the earth. Priests' hair was allowed to grow into long, matted locks in the style known as mpesempese (a term sometimes translated as ‘I don't like it’). Uncut hair is usually associated with dangerous behaviour: madmen let their locks grow, and the same hair-style was worn by royal executioners.' <sup id="cite_ref-1155" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1155">[1,155]</a></sup> The relationship between priests and political power was complicated: 'The relationship of priests to the system of chiefly rule is obscure, and it is unclear how far ak[unknown]mfo acted together, apart from training new members. Missionaries suspected that priests passed information to impress and trick ordinary people, but such charges are impossible to substantiate, and in any case it is hard to accept that the whole religious system was founded on trickery and self-delusion.' <sup id="cite_ref-1156" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1156">[1,156]</a></sup> 'Many priests seem to have achieved an unusual degree of independence. This and their self-confidence struck several nineteenth-century observers favourably. Ramseyer and Kuhne, for example, testified to the kindness of one priest who sent them food and drink and to the way in which other priests visited them, apparently feeling that they and the Christians were engaged on the same type of work' <sup id="cite_ref-1157" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1157">[1,157]</a></sup> 'There is evidence that chiefs tried to exercise a degree of control over priests. In several states (oman) it is claimed that new gods could not be introduced without the approval of the Omanhene and his council, although it is impossible to say how far this operated in practice. There also exist numerous traditions telling how rulers laid traps to see which priests could prophesy or divine accurately. The Asantehene had a god called Diakomfo (‘eat priests’), and it is said priests adjudged false were killed over his shrine. Certain gods were classed as state gods and were thought to have a particularly close relationship to the state's success and prosperity. Many of these seem to have been brought by the first settlers in the area or to have been ‘found’ by them in the new land. Other gods seem to have been captured in war and, with their priests, to have been brought back to help the victorious group. Bonnat noted a tradition that the priests with a defeated army were not slain. ' <sup id="cite_ref-1158" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1158">[1,158]</a></sup> 'The priesthood's political power is difficult to estimate, and in any case the situation was never static. Early in the nineteenth century some senior Asante appear to have considered that Islam could provide a firmer support for the state, but little came of this. Later, the disruptive potential of Christianity was recognised, and its missionaries were given little chance of preaching either within or outside the capital until the British seized control. At the time of Bowdich's visit the cult of the royal ancestors, incorporated in the great annual Odwira new yam festival, may have been emphasised to counterbalance the priesthood. Towards the end of Asante independence the priesthood, or at least the idiom of priesthood, was used to counter royal power. In the troubles of the 1880s some of those opposed to Asantehene Mensa Bonsu claimed to be reincarnations of the famous priest Anokye and other long-dead priests. They tried to assassinate the King, and many were taken and executed. The incident is obscure, but it appears that those involved were declaring their complete separation from the usual political process and appealing to a different view of the Asante state. The use of the names of famous priests for this purpose seems, therefore, to indicate a pre-existing tension between state and priesthood.' <sup id="cite_ref-1159" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1159">[1,159]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>Type of punishment this typically entailed (can be more than one):</b>
</p>
<dl><dd> <b>♠ physical punishment ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> eHRAF provides a general description of offenses and sanctions, which included corporeal punishment: 'The two major kinds of offenses were the violation of tribal taboos and household cases. The family head (ABUSUA PANIN) adjudicated the later and chiefs the former. A public declaration of a forbidden oath by the plaintiff had the immediate effect of bringing a chief in to adjudicate the dispute. Murder and assault were capital crimes, and suicide a capital sin. Incest and adultery were also abhorred and at one time were capital crimes. Capital punishment included death by beheading, strangulation, or clubbing. Mutilation and public ridicule were other sanctions employed. Extra-clan offenses were avoided at all costs. Expulsion from the clan avoided blood feuds and in most cases resulted in the offender's enslavement. [IS]'<sup id="cite_ref-1160" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1160">[1,160]</a></sup> The offender's kin were sometimes considered to be liable to punishment as well: 'Crime we have seen, no less than every other individual act, was a corporate deed; it therefore involved the innocent as well as the guilty. Here we have further extension of this theory as exemplified in the fact that should the guilty person be permitted to continue to live and reproduce the species, such offspring were liable to share in the sentence once passed on their parent. This custom raises an interesting question: Was the child liable to punishment because of the act of his parent, whose guilt he or she was now considered to have inherited, or was he punished because he was considered to inherit an inevitable propensity to re-enact the crime for which the parent had been condemned to death? The latter is, I believe, the notion in the West African's mind. An Ashanti once remarked to me, ‘An otofo (criminal who has been executed), if he or she “come back”, will “come back” as an otofo’.' <sup id="cite_ref-1161" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1161">[1,161]</a></sup> According to Rattray, punishments became more severe in the Ashanti period: 'With the rise of Ashanti to power, we find a marked increase in the severity of punishments meted out to offenders, which was probably the very antithesis of early justice, when tradition points to mildness of régime as having been the predominating feature. It seems indeed not improbable that the functions of the early judge were largely confined to the pronouncement of a statement as to innocence or guilt, and that punishment was left in the hands of supernatural powers. Where guilt was difficult of assignment, the judge might even leave the verdict to these hidden powers, and only intervene to pronounce sentence after they had manifested their decision. I shall deal with these subjects later, under the heading of Ordeals.' <sup id="cite_ref-1162" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1162">[1,162]</a></sup> 'The important place occupied by ridicule as a primitive sanction [Page opp. p. 293] [Page 293] among the Ashanti is of especial interest, and will be examined presently in some detail.' <sup id="cite_ref-1163" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1163">[1,163]</a></sup> Capital punishment was practiced for some offenses, but offenders could avoid this by paying 'blood money' to leaders: 'The law of evidence presents many curious and unusual features, shedding considerable light on the real meaning of ‘lying’ in the Ashanti mind. The method of using witnesses will, in one respect, be seen to be very reminiscent of the part played by ‘compurgators’ in our own early courts of justice. I have devoted considerable space to land tenure and alienation, a subject about which I had written in a previous book, 1 to which the new evidence that has come to light since that chapter was written may be taken as supplementary. I now propose to deal with those two main divisions of offences which the Ashanti alone seemed formerly to recognize, i. e. Oman Akyiwadie (Tribal taboos or sins), and Efiesem (literally, cases [that might be settled] in the house).' <sup id="cite_ref-1164" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1164">[1,164]</a></sup> 'THE offences set out in paragraph four of this chapter (among several others which may have escaped my notice) were known in Ashanti as Oman Akyiwadie, which, translated literally, means, ‘Things hateful to the Tribe’. These acts were looked upon as sins of which the central authority was bound to take immediate official notice, lest certain supernatural powers, to whom the deeds were regarded as peculiarly offensive, should wreak their vengeance upon those whose paramount duty it was to protect their interests and to punish breaches of immemorial law or custom.' <sup id="cite_ref-1165" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1165">[1,165]</a></sup> 'Up to the time of European intervention, an Ashanti who committed any of these sins was liable to summary arrest and trial, without any further legal formality, such as has been noted in the case of other offences. If found guilty, the culprit suffered capital punishment. At a later date he might have been permitted—in the case of some, but not all these sins—‘to buy his head’.' <sup id="cite_ref-1166" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1166">[1,166]</a></sup> 'I have tabulated these Tribal taboos under certain headings. It will be seen later, however, in a more detailed examination of each, that the Ashanti definition of many of the terms I have employed varied considerably from the meanings given to them in our own law. These Oman Akyiwadie then were: 1. Murder. 2. Suicide. 3. A class of ‘sins’ which we might describe as ‘sexual offences’, and others of a somewhat similar nature, which we should consider possibly as ‘immoral’ but not as ‘criminal’. 2 4. Certain forms of abuse. 5. Certain kinds of assault. 6. Certain kinds of stealing. 7. The invocation of a curse upon a Chief. 8. Treason and cowardice. 9. Witchcraft. [Page 295] 10. The violation, by word or deed, of any other recognized Tribal taboo. 11. The breaking of any law or command, the violation of which would not, in the ordinary way, involve the breaking of any Tribal taboo, but the observance of which had been enjoined on the clear understanding that disobedience would be taken, in this particular case, as entailing the violation of a specific taboo. In other words, refusal to obey any law or command issued and qualified by a ‘conditional curse’, i.e. by an Ntam (‘Oath’).' <sup id="cite_ref-1167" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1167">[1,167]</a></sup> Trials were held in order to prevent supernatural revenge: '‘The reason that a man might not be killed without first being told what he had done to deserve death was because, if he were executed without a trial, his sasa (ghost) would trouble the Chief in his sleep and also the people in the town.’ We have seen 2 how this fear of a [Page 296] dead man's sasa was present in a minor degree, even in the case of a prisoner duly executed by a strictly legal process. It seems therefore natural to suppose that the revengeful spirit should be feared still more when the person had been illegally done to death. That this spirit should be considered as likely to take vengeance on a Chief who allowed his death to pass unavenged, no less than on the actual murderer, is strictly in accordance with the belief in the corporate responsibility of certain persons for the acts of the individual, which is such an inseparable feature in the Ashanti law of crime. I think, therefore, it is right to assume that it was the dread of supernatural reprisal, rather than the outrage upon the central authority, which placed this act in the category of a tribal or national sin. Murder for long remained one of the offences for which it was impossible ‘to buy one's head’. It was also one of the few sins for which the punishment was death by dancing Atopere.' <sup id="cite_ref-1168" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1168">[1,168]</a></sup> Decapitation was the most common form of execution, but oher methods were also practiced: 'The kindred and—with the rise of territorial Chiefs and territorial Jurisdiction—the community as a body were thought possibly to suffer for the ritualistic offence of its individual members. It was—I hazard the opinion—to such a belief that we can trace the creation of that important category of offences which have been dealt with in this volume under the heading of ‘Tribal Taboos’ (Oman Akyiwadie), the punishment for the violation of which was death, inflicted not by the supernatural agency that had been outraged, but by man. At first, I believe, the death penalty was the only corporal sanction which the higher central authority inflicted. This form of punishment later became modified by the march of economic events. Instead of being executed a man might ‘buy his head’, or he might be enslaved or banished, or suffer some minor mutilation. The sanctions at the disposal of the highest authority also included some that are beyond the [Page 375] bounds of our civilized secular community to enforce. They included not only reprisals upon the living, but the punishment of the dead. The defunct criminal in Ashanti was never quite beyond the arm of the law. He might, as we have seen, be decapitated, or he might be denied the essential funeral obsequies, including burial.' <sup id="cite_ref-1169" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1169">[1,169]</a></sup> 'I shall close this brief chapter—brief because the subject with which it deals has already been set forth in the pages which comprise this and its kindred volumes—with a list of the common corporal sanctions which were once in the power of the central authority to inflict.' <sup id="cite_ref-1170" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1170">[1,170]</a></sup> 'Perhaps the commonest form of capital punishment was for the victim to have his or her head cut off with a small knife. Many of the old executioners' knives which I have seen appear to have been bread or carving knives imported from Europe. The executioner or executioners, for he generally had his young assistants, having seized his man, either proceeded to decapitate him by cutting from the front of the neck, and working back, or ‘if he did not wish to look upon his victim's face, he would hold the head down and slice or saw through the neck, commencing at the back’.' <sup id="cite_ref-1171" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1171">[1,171]</a></sup> 'A sepow knife would almost invariably have first been thrust through the cheeks in order to prevent the criminal from ‘blessing the Chief’. This form of decapitation might follow the preliminaries described in a previous volume and known as Atopere. Only the Asante Hene (King of Ashanti) and the great paramount Chiefs had power to inflict capital punishment. A Birempon of a Head-Chief or a Safohene (Elder or war captain) who did so, even in the case of a slave, without the permission of his Head-Chief, would have been guilty of murder and liable, at least, to destoolment or a very heavy fine. The King and Paramount Chiefs of Divisions alone ‘held the knife’ (Ono owo sekan). A Birempon of a Divisional Head-Chief might, it is true, have had his own abrafo (executioners), but they could not ply their trade without the permission of the Head-Chief. This right of a Paramount Divisional Chief to inflict capital punishment extended also only to his own subjects, and not even to all of these, for, without the permission of the Asante Hene, a Divisional Head-Chief might not execute his own Safohene, Birempon, princes, or Adehye (blood members of the royal family). [Page 376] Certain other persons were, as we have seen, also entirely exempt from capital punishment. Decapitation was not the only way in which a person might be killed. The death sentence might also have been carried out by the following methods: (a) Strangling (Abomporo). Ahenkwa (young ‘palace’ attendants), heralds; Safohene (war captains); Adehye (kindred of the ruling house); wives of a Chief, killed or volunteering to die on the death of their master, were generally executed in this fashion. The idea was to avoid distasteful mutilation or the shedding of blood. The strangling was sometimes performed with a leather thong or done by the hands of the executioners (bu no kon). (b) Clubbing (Abaporowa). This method of dispatch was also used for young ‘palace’ attendants; a pestle was sometimes the form of club employed, or the tusk of an elephant (where the victim was of royal blood).' <sup id="cite_ref-1172" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1172">[1,172]</a></sup> 'Witches were also sometimes clubbed instead of being burned, strangled, or drowned. The last-named form of punishment was known euphemistically as ‘crossing the river’ (asu twa).' <sup id="cite_ref-1173" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1173">[1,173]</a></sup> Mutilation, flogging and castration were also practiced: 'Mutilation.

The word adabra is stated to be of Dagomba origin. See also Religion and Art in Ashanti, p. 119 n. Apparently certain offences were punished with castration. This was probably resorted to to obtain recruits for the posts of eunuchs in the various royal harems. A concrete case was given, which is as follows: ‘Two young boys were playing together when one “abused” the other by saying, Owonta! (begetter of twins). The boy who was called this retaliated by “swearing the great oath” that he had never yet even had sexual intercourse with any woman.

The first point to notice in connexion with the sums formerly imposed by Native Tribunals (which we wrongly translate by ‘fines’) was that the sum demanded and paid was always some odd amount. 12 s., 23 s. 6 d., £4 13 s., £9 6 s., and so on, i.e. in the gold-dust currency, was made up of two weights—10 s. and 2 s., £1 and 3 s. 6 d., £4 and 13 s., £8 and £1 6 s. The odd amounts were known in Ashanti as mataho or kyekyerekon (i.e. something stuck or tied ‘on the neck’ of the larger packet of gold-dust). Sika kuntunsin nko ahen fie (A headless packet of gold-dust does not go to the Chief's palace). These little extra bundles were invariably the perquisites of the Okyeame (or Akyeame), upon whom fell by far the most onerous [Page 115] duties in a Native Tribunal. The following was the method of division of Aseda amounting to £4 13 s., paid by the successful litigant into the Chief's Treasury:  13 s. went to the Okyeame. 3 s. 6 d. went to the Queen Mother. 2 s. went to the females of the blood royal. 3 s. divided between the Stool-carriers and the keepers of the mausoleum. 2 s. to the sword-bearers. 4 s. to the treasurers. 2 s. to the children and the grandchildren of the Chief. 2 s. to the gun-carriers. 3 s. divided among any strangers or the general public who were present in court during the trial.' <sup id="cite_ref-1186" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1186">[1,186]</a></sup> Offenders could sometimes avoid capital punishment by paying 'blood money' (see above).

Owing to the importance attached to the hereditary position of Chief either as Odikro (Chief of a town), or Ohene (Chief of a sub-divisional state), there has (Paramount Chief of an independent state), there has been much litigation in recent times in connexion with disputes on the legality or otherwise of particular Enstoolments or Destoolments, and instances are not wanting of such disputes passing through the African and British Courts in the Colony to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in England.' <sup id="cite_ref-1187" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1187">[1,187]</a></sup> 'The Ashanti had a constitutional practice which ensured that the will of the people was given consideration. They had ultimately the constitutional right to destool a chief. As the fundamental principle was that only those who elected a chief could destool him, a destoolment required the consent of the elders. Sometimes they initiated a destoolment themselves when, for example, a chief repeatedly rejected their advice, or when he broke a taboo, or committed a sacrilegious act.

</p>
<dl><dd> <b>♠ The state regulates banking ♣ absent ♥</b> Note: Cultivation systems varied with local ecology: 'The different ecological zones have given rise to contrasting types of agriculture. In the north the main subsistence and cash crop is yams, followed by guinea corn; by 1950 there still had not been any large-scale development of export crops. In the south, a much larger variety of subsistence crops are grown, especially yams, cocoyams, manioc, and maize. Also, there has been widespread development of major commercial crops such as the kola-nut and cocoa, which has become the main economic activity in the southern zone. In former times, until the end of the nineteenth century, farm work was done by servile labor: slaves, pawns, and various kinds of servants. Today sharecropping and hired labor are the most prevalent, although domestic peonage is still common. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-1192" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1192">[1,192]</a></sup> While the rural population consisted primarily of farmers and craftsmen, the towns offered a more diverse labor market, at least from the Ashanti period onwards: 'The Kumasi Central Market is among the largest in West Africa and lies at the center of a vast market region. Traders, wholesalers, distributors, transporters, and retailers make up a complex network of exchanges, which are bolstered by a variety of kin, ethnic, and local ties. Commodity chiefs control the wholesale end of the business regulating prices. In the early nineteenth century men moved into commercial farming, leaving women to run the markets. [IS]' <sup id="cite_ref-1193" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1193">[1,193]</a></sup> 'But by the late eighteenth century the capital, Kumase, and several other major centers of local administration - Bekwae, Dwaben, Kokofu, and Mampon, for example - had come to offer a wide range of employment opportunities other than farming: in court, in the civil and military administrations, in business, in crafts, and so forth. In the early nineteenth century Kumase was already a town of about 20,000 people, few of whom were directly engaged in food production.' <sup id="cite_ref-1194" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1194">[1,194]</a></sup> Craft specializaton was also present:  'The Ashanti are noted for their expertise in a variety of specialized crafts. These include weaving, woodcarving, ceramics, and metallurgy. Weaving is a highly developed craft, with dozens of standardized and named textile designs. Weaving in cotton and silk is of a technically and aesthetically high order, and much commerce is built around it. Woodcarvings have also become a valuable commodity, especially with the rise of the tourist trade in the late twentieth century. Woodcarving is divided into many branches, each with its own specialists. Among the major products are wooden sculptures of outstanding artistic quality, talking-drums (NTUPANE), and the famous wooden "stools," which are symbolic and ritual objects rather than items of furniture.' <sup id="cite_ref-1195" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1195">[1,195]</a></sup> 'One of the most specialized crafts is metallurgy. Traditionally, Ashanti metal smiths worked in iron, brass, bronze, silver, and gold. Agricultural implements and other metal utensils were made of iron. Using a lost-wax process, smiths cast brass and bronze gold weights (MRAMMUE) of geometric, human, or animal forms. Although these objects are now mainly of interest to art collectors, their original function was practical; they were standard weights used to measure gold dust. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-1196" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1196">[1,196]</a></sup> 'Craft production was an individual undertaking, and apprentice craftsmen were more often sons than sisters' sons. There were concentrations of certain crafts in certain villages, which were founded with war captives or refugees. Among these were settlements in the Kumase district such as Bonwire (cloth weaving), Ntonso (cloth dyeing), Pankrono (pottery), Ahwia (woodworking), and Breman and Adum (metalworking). Blacksmithery and joinery which catered to the needs of cultivators were scattered throughout the kingdom (Bowdich 1819, Dupuis 1824, Freeman 1967 [1898]). The crafts concerned with the elaboration of regalia were located in the immediate neighbourhood of the state capitals and the imperial capital of Kumasi (Rattray 1927: 216-308; Arhin 1982). Craft practitioners owned their own tools, and the factors that conditioned production were agricultural demand and state requirements.' <sup id="cite_ref-1197" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1197">[1,197]</a></sup> Trade was also important: 'There were early cultural and commercial links with the empires of the southern Sahara. The major commodities exchanged were gold from the Akan region and salt from the Sahara. The main Akan trading town was Bighu (Bitu) with links to Jenne on the Niger bend. Trade in gold and slaves formed the commercial basis of the traditional Ashanti state. Kola-nuts were also exported to the north. Today cocoa is Ghana's main export commodity. [IS]' <sup id="cite_ref-1198" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1198">[1,198]</a></sup> This seems to suggest that occupational mobility was present to an extent, at least in coastal cities of the Ashanti period. We are unsure whether this was the case prior to the Ashanti period as well. Accordingly, some of the below variables may not be applicable.**********According to SCCS variable 17 'Money (Media of Exchange) and Credit' 'Tokens of conventional value as media of exchange' were used, not 'No media of exchange or money' or 'Domestically used articles as media of exchange' or 'Foreign coinage or paper coinage', or 'Indigenous coinage or paper currency'. According to SCCS variable 18 'Credit Source' while 'Internal money lending specialists' are present, 'External money lending specialists; and 'Banks or comparable institutions' are not present. Barter probably continued into the colonial period, at least on the local level. Units of gold dust wwere adopted as currency: 'At least from the beginning of the 18th century on, the Asante economy was growing, as is shown in the adoption of units of gold dust as currency in the territories of the Asante Union in the reign of Osei Tutu, 1712 (Reindorf 1895:17). In the absence of the kinds of descriptions of the Asante area that were made by European and other travellers to Kumasi in the 19th century, it is impossible to detail this growth. One can only suggest that what visitors reported in the first half of the 19th century represented its culmination.' <sup id="cite_ref-1199" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1199">[1,199]</a></sup> Cowries were also used: ‘Tramma means literally cowries, the small shells from the Indian Ocean which, by the route from the north, found their way all over West Africa, and to this day may be seen used for small change in the native markets.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1200" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1200">[1,200]</a></sup> In the Ashanti period, there was a state treasury at the court in Kumasi: 'The Kumase treasury was strictly organised. The main reserves were kept in the Great Chest [...], about 210 × 90 × 60 cm. It has been estimated that this contained 11,340 kg of gold when full, worth about £1,500,000 at nineteenth-century rates. The gold was stored in cloth bundles of given values, and the chest was under the direct care of the Gyaasewahene who, according to an early source, held the only key to the room where it was kept. [...] Smaller containers held lesser quantities of gold for use in everyday court business. Sums of gold were also apparently kept with the royal skeletons at the Bantama mausoleum. Gold was handled on a day-to-day basis by a group of officials under the Fotosanfohene who was responsible for weighing sums in or out as required. Withdrawals were recorded simply: a cowrie shell was put aside for every peredwan (approximately 70 g) of gold-dust removed. The state's wealth was great: there is some reason to believe that the war chest taken on the 1820s' campaign before the battle of Kantamanso contained about £500,000 in gold-dust.' <sup id="cite_ref-1201" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1201">[1,201]</a></sup> Rulers of early Akan states probably had a treasury as well, given the importance of gold dust.

It was a system well suited for measuring, say, cloth, or for laying out the foundations of a house. It was of no use for determining how far a town or village was from Kumase. Distance had to be described in terms of time, and speed was a critical variable' <sup id="cite_ref-1202" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1202">[1,202]</a></sup> Wilks suggests that space was mentally represented in the terminology of travel time rather than spatial area: 'Asante armies sometimes campaigned beyond the frontier. They did so, for example, in 1840-1844. But the reach of government, its ano, was recognized as less than that of the military. The former was fixed - [unavailable]hyε - at a notional twenty days from Kumase. The mental map of Greater Asante as a month reflected, it may be supposed, a rational recognition of reality: that without any major change in the speed of communications, no lands more distant than a month from Kumase, in and out, could effectively be administered even though they might be subdued for the duration of a campaign.' <sup id="cite_ref-1203" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1203">[1,203]</a></sup> Gold dust was measured with brass weights: 'Gold was handled on a day-to-day basis by a group of officials under the Fotosanfohene who was responsible for weighing sums in or out as required.

Geometric weights outnumber representational ones by perhaps ten or fifteen to one. A few weights were made by adapting an existing object of roughly the right mass: beads, bits of European brass, or brass castings from groups near Asante, or seeds, especially those of the Abrus pecatorius bush ( damma). [...] The basic equipment was simple. The dust was weighed in a simple set of beam scales ( nsania). A weight ( abramo[unknown]) was placed in one pan and the gold-dust in the other, usually with a sheet-brass spoon ( saawa). Impurities in the gold could be removed by placing it in a sort of scoop ( famfa) and blowing across it. Gold-dust was usually kept in tied twists of cloth placed in small brass boxes ( adaka ketewa, abampuruwa), occasionally in quills plugged at the open end.' <sup id="cite_ref-1205" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1205">[1,205]</a></sup> We have assumed that this constitutes a form of state-led standardization of weights and measures.

Writing about the pre-Ashanti period, Sarbah mentions urban storage facilities: 'On the 21st of February he sent one of his men with attendants to King Abaan, whose town was about four leagues up-country, where was stored a large quantity of corn and millet. This town is described to be as large as the London of that period. It was guarded every night, and to warn the watchmen, cords were stretched across the roads and paths leading to it. Attached to the cords were bells, which give the alarm. In addition to these cords, nets were hung over the few entrances, and were so contrived as to fall on any person endeavouring to steal into the town. Four hours after their arrival in the morning, these men were sent for by the king at nine o'clock, “for there may no man come to him before he be sent for,” nor was it customary in that country to offer their presents to the ruler until they had visited him thrice. On the last visit, after the king had accepted their presents, he drank palm-wine with them. The king, we are informed, used a cup of gold, and when he drank, the people cried all with one voice, “Abaan, Abaan,” with certain other words. “The king drinks; and when he had drunk, then they gave drink to every one, and that done, the king licensed them to depart; and every one that departeth from him boweth three times towards him, and waveth with both hands together, as they bow and do depart. The king hath commonly sitting by him eight or ten ancient men with grey beards.”' <sup id="cite_ref-1208" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1208">[1,208]</a></sup> Sarbah also speaks of quasi-feudal arragements in some Akan polities prior to Ashanti rule: 'In the Fanti system allegiance is personal, but in the Asanti it is personal and territorial combined. ‡ The head ruler is not necessarily the owner of any land in his jurisdiction; e.g., Ohene Tchibu, of Asin Yankumasi, owns no land, and is a tenant of Abesibro, his captain; so also is Ohene Aka Ayima, of Beyin in Appolonia, by the [Page 25] judgment of Mr. Justice Nicoll, declared to own no land in his district-at least he did not lead evidence to show the land in question was his. In the case of Ohene Tchibu, the explanation is, that his ancestors fled to Fantiland for protection from the north side of the Pra in the kingdom of Asanti. The greater part of the Asinfu settled on lands within the jurisdiction of the head ruler of Abura, who became their feudal superior. * Many of the Asinfu continued to work on their lands across the river Pra, and held them. Among such is Akessi of Fumsu, until, by an order of the Executive Council of Gold Coast, an arbitrary boundary was fixed, and the possessions of the Asinfu, Denkerafu, and others, trans-Pra and trans-Ofin, were declared Asanti territory in the district of Adansi, and this in spite of the fact that Yamsu village, the stool of which was the subject of the case, Ghambra v.

Warren (1973, no. 29) makes an interesting point that social stress can weaken a person's natural resistance to any one of a number of internal malarial and intestinal parasites, resulting in illness.

Singing, long preaching and praying, and at some centres speaking in tongues precedes it. The congregation is made to participate in the proceedings. They may pray aloud each to his own words, the sound being like the roaring of surf. They are “welded” together into a sort of power-field by laying-on of hands by an officiating prophet who is in a trance under the influence of the Holy Spirit. Palm-branches may be given to the congregation. At another prophet's centre people queue up, sing and are sprinkled with holy water. This they carefully rub in, the women opening up their blouses so as to present their breasts to the precious liquid. Then they are given some of the holy water to drink. During this lengthy process the prophet moves around and inspires the singing and drumming of the band, until the whole congregation, gently swaying, has coalesced into one mystical body. This conveys to the devotee a feeling of security and importance. Only after these preparations does the actual direct treatment begin. This may consist of a symbolic rubbing in of holy oil on the front, the ears, the toes and the hands of the patient, thus symbolizing the healing power of Christ over the five senses and the whole of life. The prophet massages liniment and holy water on his patients<sup id="cite_ref-1213" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1213">[1,213]</a></sup> 'Exorcism. After a long service (preaching, announcement, testimony of an old woman said to have been raised from the dead, ordination of ministers for his church) the prophet announced that the evil spirits would now be driven out. A group of church officers and priests busied themselves gathering particulars from about forty men, women and children all eager to confess and to have their supposed witch spirits evicted. They were all lined up in rows, facing “towards Sierra Leone”. Anyone who happened to be looking in the Sierra Leone direction was warned to keep out of the way for a while lest the fleeing spirits might possess one of them. The congregation struck a hand-clapping hymn, accompanied by a band, and in this way obviously built up the psychological pressure on the “witches”, who had already been instructed to kneel down. The prophet and one or two priests moved among them, here and there putting one hand on the head of a witch, and pointing with the other in the direction of “Sierra Leone”, commanding the witch spirit to go there. Some of the witches began to tremble under the psychic stress, and this was taken as a sign that the unclean spirits were beginning to feel uneasy in their bodies. Those spirits who persisted in resisting the prophet's influence shook their owners so severely that they fell writhing on the ground, and remained there quivering for some time. In such severe cases, the prophet or one of his assistants would sprinkle holy sand on them, particularly on their shaking limbs. By close observation, the prophet established the exact spot on limbs or head through which the witch spirit had departed. This danger point was anointed with holy oil and sacred sand to provide special protection against the counter attack. When the treatment was over, the patients lay supine like so many corpses. They were soaked by a rainstorm which had set in during the process of exorcism, and more sand was laid on to symbolize their “burial”, because they were considered as ritually “dead and buried with Christ”, so the prophet told me. Not all the witches, however, reacted so violently as this, more than half of them remained kneeling and shook only moderately or not at all. “Their witch spirits are not so bad and leave earlier” I was told. The ceremony eventually came to an end. Those “dead and buried” were “raised up to new life” by the prophet or one of the priests who pulled them to their feet. Some, however, were so far gone in their stupor that they could not be reawakened to consciousness so easily, and were carried off to the adjoining rooms.'<sup id="cite_ref-1214" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1214">[1,214]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ State pensions for elites ♣ absent ♥</b> The Ashanti period was characterized by a trend towards greater bureaucratization and functional specialization: 'State organisation became extremely complex in the Kumasi state because at the close of the 17th century it became the capital of the union of Asante states and, in the course of the following century, the seat of an empire which was roughly coterminous with the boundaries of modern Ghana and southeastern Ivory Coast (Wilks 1975: 374-86). The expansion of the state made necessary administrative reforms within Kumasi itself and for the maintenance of effective relations between the Asantehene, the head of the Asante Union and, by consent, also the head of the Kumasi state, and the heads of the conquered territories. The palace administration ( gyase) was expanded with appointive headships of innumerable functional units or palace associations ( afekuo, sing. fekuo) (Rattray 1929: 81-92; Wilks 1967: 214-28; Hagan 1971). The memberships of the palace associations, each of which had either military or nonmilitary functions, cut across the divisions, so that they formed checks on, and counterpoises to, the traditional power units. The heads of the most important of the palace associations, including the units assigned to the offspring of former and reigning Asantehene (Busia 1951: 95), were included in the state council. Since appointments to the headships of the palace associations were in the gift of the Asantehene, the administrative reform represented an intrusion of patrimonialism (Weber 1947: 347) into the traditional political organisation.' <sup id="cite_ref-1215" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1215">[1,215]</a></sup> The purpose of this new administrative structure was to 'enforce subordination of the conquered rulers to the Asantehene. For this purpose the Asante kings used an administrative staff recruited from their gyase, household organization, consisting of units of functionaries with appointive headships [...] These palace associations, called afekuo (Reondorf, 1895: 119; Rattray, 1929: 91), were recruited from free attendants, warcaptives, purchased slaves (nnonkofo), and other bondsmen; in other words, persons connected by “ties of personal loyalty” (Weber, 1947: 342) to the various Asante Kings.' <sup id="cite_ref-1216" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1216">[1,216]</a></sup> Senior public functionaries had a stool system of their own: 'In Kumasi proper there were seventy-seven stools, representing seventy-seven public functionaries, as, for example, the Bantuma Chief, or the Chief of the Royal Burial Grove, the Ateni Chief, or the Chief of the Lamplighters.' <sup id="cite_ref-1217" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1217">[1,217]</a></sup> Some foreigners were employed in highly specialized roles: 'A form of treasury partly staffed by literate Muslims was created. Groups within the capital began to build up expertise in particular areas of administration and to concentrate on this as a way to power and wealth. Careers began to open for those with intelligence, negotiating skill and a steady nerve.' <sup id="cite_ref-1218" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1218">[1,218]</a></sup> However, it appears that bureaucratization did not predate the Ashanti period. Accordingly, we have assumed that no system of state pensions was present.

The general name for a festival is Afahyε (afa, “festival”; hyε, “fix a day”). The chief's and head priest's house and things are refurbished [Page 35] by singing old women, the blackened stools are taken to the stream and sprinkled with water; pieces of sacrificed and new food crops are put on each stool.

The central part of the festival is the re-purification of the stools and the abosom shrines.

On the first day the path leading towards the chief's burial is cleaned. On the second day priests make offerings at the burial chambers and a great yam parade takes place. On the third day people mourn and fast. On the fourth a splendid feast for everyone in the community is held at the local chief's house. That night, everyone stay indoors, to avoid catching sight of the chief's thrones, symbols of the dead men's spirits, which are carried to the river to be ceremonially washed. On the fifth and final day, chiefs and other important clan members dressed in their best, parade through the town in a  grand procession to pay homage to the senior local chief.

Then people play music and dance late into the night.'<sup id="cite_ref-1221" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1221">[1,221]</a></sup>//Warren provides a description of the relevant narratives and proceedings among the Techiman-Bono:'The other major annual Bono Festival is the Yam Festival ( henerεk dibayerefoforo: literally, the chief is going to eat new yams). The myth explaining the origin of the festival states that when the Techiman-Bono people came from the cavern at Amowi, Onyame pointed out forest yams (aha bayere). Seeing that bush pigs and elephants had eaten some of the yams, they cooked a few and saw that the yam was good food. They gave some to their chief, who also enjoyed it. After that, they began to celebrate on an annual basis the day on which they first found yams. After their chief died, they fed his soul (saman) yams on the same day. Later the Bono began to plant yams, and the yam became the most important staple in the Bono diet. Every farmer celebrates the festival to thank Onyame after the harvest. The living and the deceased are all invited to share in the abundance. Every Bono chief and priest celebrates a yam festival, but before the celebrations begin, a man from the village of Kenten whose title is Akokohwedeε (woodhen) first tastes the yam. When he sees that the yam is ripe, early in the morning on the traditional day called Fodwo he informs the god Taa Mεnsah that the yam is ready to be prepared for εto (mashed yams mixed with palmoil).' <sup id="cite_ref-1222" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1222">[1,222]</a></sup>//'The Taa Mεnsah deity celebrates his yam festival on Fodwo, a Monday. The new yam is hung from rafters in the shrine room for some weeks before the Akokohwedeε comes to taste it. After the yam is hung, children may begin to eat new yam and the elders can [Page 57] [Page 58] begin to eat aso bayere (one species of yam). In the evening on Fodwo, the god Taa Mεnsah is prepared to eat yam after being carried on the main street from one end of the town to the other end three times and consulted. After this, the god informs the manhene that he is about to eat yam and the manhene gives the god permission to eat the yam. The manhene sends a yam to the god and it is always this yam which is cooked as εto and placed on the shrine. The next day, Tuesday, the manhene sends a sheep and wine to the god.' <sup id="cite_ref-1223" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1223">[1,223]</a></sup>//'Two weeks after the Taa Mεnsah Yam Festival, the yam festivals for the Queenmother, the Adontenhene, and the Nifahene are celebrated on a Monofie, a Friday. Nwonakusie, a Thursday, is the yam festival day for the Twafohene, the Adaatihene, the Akyeamehene, the Konkontiwahene, and the Krontihene. Fofie, another Friday, is the yam festival day for the manhene, the Gyaasehene, the Ankbeahene, and the Barimhene. The manhene provides about six sheep and a cow for his own yam festival. These are sacrificed, the blood being spilled on the ancestral stools; the meat is cooked and distributed.' <sup id="cite_ref-1224" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1224">[1,224]</a></sup>// The Apo Festival was celebrated annually and included carnivalesque elements: 'Many festivals exist among the Akan; their foundations and functions are found in the traditional religion. The Apo festival is celebrated yearly among the Brong; it is a feast of eight days duration in which complete lampooning liberty (in the form of song) of both superiors and inferiors (without punishment) is given. The people explain that if one's sunsum is hurt, the body becomes ill; often ill health is caused by evil and the hatred another person may have for you. In like manner, if you have a hatred for someone, it affects your own sunsum, so this time is set aside to allow any man to tell any other man what has offended him. This frees the spirit, and both sunsum become relaxed. During this festival there is theoretical sexual license; this isn't really taken [Page 33] [Page 34] advantage of since traditional court action can be initiated after the eight day festival. Punishment is therefore deferred until the rites are over. Should an aggrieved party take action he forfeits the right to investigation, to satisfaction, and he is also heavily fined. During this period all the priests and priestesses of the area are present with their shrines; they touch each shrine with every other one to re-establish communications which might have been lost. The major gods are taken to the river and cleansed of all evil. On the eighth day everyone makes a concerted effort to drive all evil from the area. Around twenty-five distinct Apo songs are sung, and there is a specific Apo dance for the festival.' <sup id="cite_ref-1225" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1225">[1,225]</a></sup>//Purification is a major element in the rituals performed: 'The festival period is, in fact, a period of coming together in which the people from all over the Techiman traditional area, including well-wishers and invitees from other states, meet in the capital to display the traditional Bono culture through singing, dancing, and drumming. The manhene and his elders, through the Barimhene, purify the soul of King Ameyaw (the chief defeated by the Asante in 1723), adorn his grave with the royal regalia of the incumbent manhene, recall the deeds that Ameyaw performed for the State (man), and present drinks, sheep, and food to his soul and those of the other ancestral chiefs of the Techiman-Bono State. Finally, the Apo is a period during which the shrines of various gods and goddesses are purified. The shrine of the main deity in Techiman Township, Taa Kεse (Taa Mεnsah), is, at this time, purified at the River Agyentoamu during the last hour of the celebration; this serves as a sign of the completion of the Apo Festival.' <sup id="cite_ref-1226" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1226">[1,226]</a></sup>//The festival also served as a check on authority and as a forum for the resolution of mutual resentment: 'The functions of the Apo festival seem to be four: (1) psychological release, (2) a forum for public opinion, (3) a means to periodically check those in authority, (4) a method of enforcing sanctions of behaviour.' <sup id="cite_ref-1227" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1227">[1,227]</a></sup> According to Warren, the restoration of amicable relations is one of the major purposes of the festival: 'This festival allows every person resident in Techiman Traditional State, without regard to class, creed, ethnic group, or race, eleven days of liberty to lampoon, in the form of songs and proverbs, the faults and malpractices of any other person, including those in authority-especially the manhene and his divisional chiefs. In addition, the people may sing the praises of those in authority in appreciation of worthy achievements so as to encourage them to even greater deeds. During this period it is strictly forbidden to fight in any way. The emphasis of the festival is upon the removal of bitterness and misfortune in the State. After all personal grudges, faults, and hatreds are sung and spoken out amicably, the end result is renewed peace and harmony among the Techiman inhabitants; the spirit (sunsum) of the [Page 56] state is cleansed after all the unspoken interpersonal bitternesses are voiced.' <sup id="cite_ref-1228" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1228">[1,228]</a></sup> While chiefs and priests played a prominent role during festivals, we have found no evidence of 'public funding'. While the descriptions refer to the Ashanti and colonial periods, similar festivals were probably celebrated in the pre-Ashanti period.

The songs are sung in such a way — they have been likened to the humming of bees (Rattray, 1923: 103) — that they are extremely difficult to understand, even for court habitués. It has always seemed to me that the purpose of the minstrels' songs is to remind the king of his incomparable pedigree relative to those of his audience and also to encourage him in ‘manly and heroic’ deeds, — as the praise poems put it — so that he can carry out the necessary acts of state. Such acts include passing death sentences, stripping erstwhile court favourites of their authority and wealth, and declaring wars.

The patterns were printed using carved calabash stamps and a vegetable-based dye. The cloth features fifteen stamped symbols, including nsroma (stars), dono ntoasuo (double Dono drums), and diamonds. It is now in the British Museum.' <sup id="cite_ref-1250" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1250">[1,250]</a></sup> Other kinds of mnemonic devices were also in use: 'Oral creators also attached their texts to material objects. A particular tree or rock could serve as the starting point for a narrative that was associated with this landmark. In the Asante kingdom in Ghana, an elaborate material culture was developed which filled the social space with verbal texts: the finials on chiefs' ceremonia lumbrellas embodied proverbs; gold-weights -small brass figurines used to weigh gold dust in the extensive trading networks centered on the Asanta kingdom- were often designed to represent sayings or epithets relating to the owner; adinkra symbols, also evoking proverbs and other verbal formulations, were carved into wooden prestige objects and metal jewellery, and stamped on cloth. Across West Africa, cloth carried woven, dyed or appliquéd symbols that alluded to oral texts. [...] Thus the Asante gold-weight showing two leopards might call to mind different proverbs [...] And most proverbs can be interpreted in more than one way.' <sup id="cite_ref-1251" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1251">[1,251]</a></sup> The Akan had 'officialized' oral traditions about lineage ancestors and past royal exploits: 'Every Akan state has official custodians of its history. These include the heralds, the drummers and the executioners, said to have been created by  Odomankoma, the creator, before the ruler himself (Rattray, 1923: 263), and the minstrels. The herald is present at all state occasions and has thereby become a storehouse of knowledge about public affairs; the drummer ‘drums’ the history of the state on public occasions; and the executioner is a policeman, a protocol officer and a bard (Wilks, 1967: 231).' <sup id="cite_ref-1252" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1252">[1,252]</a></sup> Akan languages were written down by early missionaries and native elites from the 17th-18th century onwards: 'Twi is a tonal language and, since missionary work during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, has been written in Roman script' <sup id="cite_ref-1253" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1253">[1,253]</a></sup> 'Akan languages started to be written down, mainly in religious publication, by Danish, German and British missionaries during the 17th and 18th centuries.'<sup id="cite_ref-1254" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1254">[1,254]</a></sup> Accordingly, we have assumed that literacy was absent prior to the Ashanti period.</dd></dl>

I have already mentioned that the natives have no artificial foods, consequently, when the mother is very young, or in weak health, the child must suffer, as milk is practically unknown on the Gold Coast, except in tins from Europe, and this, when the natives can afford it, can only be had where there are stores. A weakly child, if it does not die of mal-nutrition, then becomes the more liable to fever and smallpox, which are the two commonest diseases on the Coast.' <sup id="cite_ref-1255" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1255">[1,255]</a></sup> 'In many areas, until recently, 50% infant mortality occured; many types of charms, rituals and other aspects of religion dealt with the explanation of such a high mortality. In the olden days if a new-born baby died before eight days the mother angrily whipped and mutilated the body, wrapped it in sword grass, put it in a pot and buried it near the women's latrine; this was to discourage its return again.' <sup id="cite_ref-1256" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1256">[1,256]</a></sup> We have assumed this to be true of the pre-Ashanti period as well.</dd></dl>

In this case the victim would not be killed but would undergo bodily ailments and pains, thus suffering torture and unpopularity”. A witches' confession may therefore be minuted: “I inflicted sleeping disease”. A student wrote: “They can inflict diseases on a person only at night, when the victim is asleep. They can also do that by giving food to their prey”. This last case links up with anti-social magic.

<dd> <b>♠ Endemic malnutrition ♣ present ♥</b> Accordingy to Wilks, a typical family farm was sufficient to support a household: 'The view of Asante agriculturalists that a typical farm of between two and three acres will support a family of five has been cited above. This observation may now be tested, and the model of the rural economy be developed further. Recent investigations of the food consumption of Asante farmers indicate an average daily intake of 3.86 pounds per person, with an energy value of 1,773 calories. Of these totals, about 80 percent of the daily intake by weight is from the five staples, and about 77 percent by calorific value. In table 3 the average daily intake of each of the five staples is shown, and the total requirement for five persons over three years is computed. The assumption may reasonably be made that patterns of food consumption at least in rural areas have not changed significantly in recent times: it has already been noted, for example, that the same staples have been grown certainly since the early nineteenth century. Tables 2 and 3, derived from different sets of data, are then comparable, both being relevant to the traditional economy. Several observations may be offered. First, it would seem that the produce of a one-hectare field is more than adequate to support a family of five. Second, however, allowances must be made for ordinary loss of crops through disease, storms, or damage from animals (whether wild or domestic). Third, allowance must also be made for a fall in yields as a result of an extraordinary failure of the rains, for example, or of a drop in soil fertility through inadequacy of the fallow or of an insufficiency of labor through death, illness, or the like. It might seem, then, that the one-hectare field is indeed appropriate to the support of a family of five, adequate even in the bad year and yielding a small surplus of food (which might either rot on the farm or be bartered locally) in the good year. The model of the Asante rural economy developed here would thus exemplify a general feature of successful ecosystems, that communities adapt not to usual but to unusual conditions.' <sup id="cite_ref-1271" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1271">[1,271]</a></sup> Women typically extended inter-birth intervals in order to avoid malnutrition in their children: 'According to Bono values, it is considered unwise for a birth to follow a preceding birth too soon. After a woman gives birth, the minimal period before she should get pregnant again is a year; usually a two-year interval between the birth and a succeeding pregnancy is considered desirable. After a first-born child, the mother is to abstain from sexual intercourse for at least six months; after succeeding births a 40-day period is deemed sufficient. There are no legal sanctions which can be brought against a couple who do not respect the one to two year period during which a succeeding pregnancy should not take place, although a woman who bears children in rapid succession is called ntetewa and it will be said of her, “ [unavailable]wo ntetewaa,” “she bears children in close succession.” Since children are breast fed for several years, a newly born child following a preceding birth too closely will put a strain on the mother and result in nutritional deficiency in both children. Often the older child becomes neglected, resulting in various degrees of kwashiorkor. The traditional explanation for this condition is that the older child becomes jealous of the younger one.' <sup id="cite_ref-1272" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1272">[1,272]</a></sup> However, Field's material seems to indicate that malnutrition was common even in the 20th century: 'In general the concept of good nourishment is virtually absent: it is known, of course, that life cannot be preserved without food, but the dependence of health on the quality of food is not appreciated. That food is transformed by physiological processes into body substance is too materialistic an idea to be entertained. A woman came from a village to my clinic bringing four children and asking for medicine because “their bodies were weak”. And indeed they were: their limbs were but little sticks and they could hardly walk for fatigue. I asked what food she gave them: she replied, cocoa-yam. I inquired what else, but there was nothing else. She was wholly unable to accept, or even consider the suggestion, that cocoa-yam was insufficient: she said they were “only children”. I always found it necessary when prescribing good food for convalescent children to diagnose a sulky kra which needed propitiation with pleasing food.' <sup id="cite_ref-1273" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1273">[1,273]</a></sup> Ffoulkes attributes infant mortality to malnutrition: 'With regard to children, infant mortality is great, owing principally to bad nourishment, fever, and smallpox.

<p><b>♠ Volunteering ♣ absent ♥</b>
</p><p><b>♠ Charity ♣ absent ♥</b> Cooperation among matrikin was common and expected: 'Two categories of matrikin who have invested in farms must be clearly distinguished: those who from the information might expect a return and those who do not. In addition, when considering rights and obligations of matrikin, we are looking both at individuals and at the matrilineage as a whole. Among the individuals are nephews working for their mothers' brothers while having no independent income of their own. Of the Dominase farmers, several were working with their sisters' sons on a permanent basis. Matrikin were also supervising work on bearing farms elsewhere, but these were more senior kinsmen who themselves had farms, and for them there was no question of expecting a direct return for assistance given. Among this second group of matrikin are mother's brothers and a large number of temporary assistants, who included mothers, sisters, a brother and sisters' sons. Most of the twelve male owners studied at Dominase had received assistance from this category, who were in a position to give rather than to receive. In a number of instances this was in the form of contacts, money, or land to make the venture possible in the first place. In some cases part of their financial backing came from the proceeds of farms which they had inherited and which were therefore lineage property. The position of this group can only be understood if account is taken of the corporate nature of descent groups and the sense of obligation existing between members, doing things for one another because they must, particularly men for their sisters' sons. A good mother's brother is expected to help his sisters' sons, thereby obliging the latter to reciprocate in the next generation either through their own sisters' sons or through other matrilineal dependants (Fortes, 1950). Returns are not always therefore related directly to inputs on farms. Three farmers had each made gifts of farms or land to matrikin which could not be related directly to inputs. One had purchased four pieces of land for the children of four sisters, and one [Page 177] for his oldest sister which was to have been for his own mother, who died before he was able to complete the project. A second had offered land to the adult offspring of his mother's sister. In the first case the only assistance he claimed to have received from matrikin was labour from a grand-nephew when he first arrived at Dominase; whereas the second man did rely financially on matrikin and used the proceeds of a family farm which he had inherited, although he had until then received little help from his grand-nephews. The third farmer said that he had purchased land for a brother who had not worked for him.' <sup id="cite_ref-1275" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1275">[1,275]</a></sup> However, this does not constitute charity. Families in need had recourse to wealthier relatives, but could not force the latter to support them: 'Mutual assistance within the lineage should be substantial, but it too stops far short of pooling. Even inherited lineage property clearly belongs to one individual heir, who should use it for the benefit of kin but has virtually unchallenged power to decide what uses will serve their long-term benefit. Relatives can ask for help without offense, and pressures from the abusua to agree can be intense, but this help cannot be compelled or assumed. Pleas to wealthier kin are based on needs, not rights, and one certainly cannot use their property as one's own.' <sup id="cite_ref-1276" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1276">[1,276]</a></sup>

A union or company of men banded together under a leader, chosen from among their number by popular vote, to compel the recognition of a real or imaginary grievance or to further some plan, good or perhaps bad, upon which all are of one mind; or perhaps again, merely for the purpose of joining together to work in turns for each other, say at cultivating or clearing a plantation.' <sup id="cite_ref-1277" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1277">[1,277]</a></sup> 'These companies or confederations adopt a leader, as already [Page 46] stated, and assume an emblem or flag, and the confederation is given a name, generally one explaining the raison d'être for the amalgamation. The following are a few examples of ‘company’ names.' <sup id="cite_ref-1278" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1278">[1,278]</a></sup> 'IF one had to make a choice between a purely social as distinguished from a political institution in the Akan state system it would be difficult to point to a characteristic mark by which to differentiate between the two. “Society” at the stage in which we are studying it among the Akan peoples is not far removed from the idea of association of families, clans, or tribes. Invariably the head of the family is not only the patriarch but also the social leader of that family or clan. Matches between marriageable youths are contracted under his personal advice; free consent of girl or boy to a marriage is only conditional on the sanction of the head of family. Dances are usually held within the family compound and when the youth of two or more families meet for some social purpose they do so under the aegis of the central head of those families. Society is more or less clannish in structure, and in proportion as the family tie is close, the youth of the family or tribe are constrained to model their social intercourse on the structure of the political or tribal units. Thus then starting from the highest structure in the State with the Omanhene as its head, we meet a descending scale of social institutions having some head or other who partakes of the hierarchy inherent in the supreme head. The town with a Chief or Odikro as political head has also a corresponding head for the social activities of the town. This head is directly under the Odikro or Chief, but in so far as members of his association are concerned, he is supreme as supremacy goes in the Akan institutional regime. There are several such institutions in every Akan state, and almost every town in an Akan state has a social association of young men with their own leaders called captains (Asafohene or Asafoatse) and lieutenants (Sripi). These Asafo companies as they are called have very definite functions in the political and social community wherein they are found, and as the host (Asafo) of all the young men in a town or state, they were in historical times the only disciplined association [Page 225] of able-bodied men who fought their country's battles in time of war and did yeoman service in time of peace.' <sup id="cite_ref-1279" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1279">[1,279]</a></sup> 'Thus, then, these Asafo Companies of young men are established with very different and diverse purposes, and their activities in recent years have given cause to much controversy as to whether they should be regarded as indispensable parts of the Akan constitution, or whether they are mere associations of young men working for their own immediate benefit and enjoyment. At one time, the rivalry between the different companies, the so-called “company fights”, became so serious that Government had to institute inquiries into the origin, constitution, and status of the Company System. The result of these inquiries did not make the contemplated abolition of the system necessary or practicable, and, for sociological purposes, the value of such associations admits of no cursory treatment.' <sup id="cite_ref-1280" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1280">[1,280]</a></sup> 'Mr. Casely Hayford deals with the Company System in his Native Institutions, but apparently he has in mind the relation between an Asafo Company and the Chief of a town or division, or between the Government and the Company System. He does not, however, lose sight of the fact that the Asafo Companies are the backbone of the country. Such a company in a town consists really of the whole male inhabitants of a town or village, exclusive only of boys under sixteen or seventeen, and of the Councillors in a Chief's Tribunal. They form a strong body of commons who, besides other duties, have also a distinct voice in the enstoolment or destoolment of local Chiefs. Without them, the governments of the Akan nations would not have that glamour of liberal sanction which makes the government of any free people at once orderly and democratic.' <sup id="cite_ref-1281" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1281">[1,281]</a></sup> 'The Asafo Companies have assumed different forms in successive ages. First there is the company which for services rendered to the town or country in time of war or of peace, has been raised to a status which entitles it to participate in the direct government of the town or country. This is effected by making the Company's captain or leader a Captain-on-Stool ( Okonnuasoni). It should be observed that captains of Asafo companies have, as a fact, no stools, and until a Company captain is created as a stool-holding captain, the succession to the captaincy is always made by vote of the members. In the old days companies were usually formed not by the admixture of different members of various families, as is the case at present, but by a collection of the members of a single family, primarily for [Page 226] defensive and offensive purposes. This class of Asafo Companies is now extinct. They have all of them obtained statutory right to partake in the direct government of the town or country to which they belong.' <sup id="cite_ref-1282" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1282">[1,282]</a></sup> 'The form of the institution now in vogue consists of the young men of a town who have brought themselves together for social intercourse, and for the purpose of devoloping a unified national spirit.' <sup id="cite_ref-1283" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1283">[1,283]</a></sup> We have assumed that these companies were present before the Ashanti period already, probably for purposes of communal defense.

[MG]' <sup id="cite_ref-1284" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1284">[1,284]</a></sup> Priests occasionally left their homes and travelled to visit patients in other places, and formed a guild: 'When a priest is called in from a distance to attend a case, he will generally tell the friends of the patient much about the family history, and indicate that a deceased relative is troubling the patient for some act of disobedience. The deceased relative must accordingly be propitiated. How does he come to know the history of the family to which he is a stranger? There is a Guild of Priests in the country to which all Priests belong, whose members are absolutely faithful to one another.' <sup id="cite_ref-1285" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1285">[1,285]</a></sup> They received specialist training: 'A Priest's training begins early in his life. He is generally sent away to another district to a seminary, where he serves out his apprenticeship, which may cover a period of three years.

<p><b>♠ Tribute ♣ present ♥</b> eHRAF provides a general description of the rise and fall of the Ashanti empire: 'In 1701, the Asantemanso under the leadership of Osei Tutu (d. 1717) rebelled and defeated the Denkyira. The Ashanti formed a confederacy of Akan groups, who acknowledged the authority of the Kumasi Stool. Under Osei Tutu's successor, Opoku Ware (1717-1764), the Confederacy conducted wars of expansion defeating the Wankyi (1711-12), Takyiman (Bono)(1722-3) and Akyem (1742). By the end of Opoku Ware's reign the Greater Asante covered an area nearly the size of present-day Ghana and included the states of Mampon, Beckwa, Insuta, Juabin, Kokofu, Adansi, Akropong Manasu, Asanti Akim, Awiku, and Mamponsu. Subsequent rulers, Osei Kwadwo (1764-1777) and Osei Tutu Kwame (1804-1823) strengthened their control of the region by bureaucratic and ideological means. Senior office holders were put in charge of various functions such as gold production, roads, porters, and the kola and ivory trades. Osei Tutu's head priest Anokye had devised a new system of authority symbolized by the Golden Stool, which was superimposed on the authority of the clans. Later another royal symbol, the Golden Elephant Tail, was added representing wealth. Now Big Men (ABEREMPON) could acquire wealth and power outside of the clan system. However, all acquired wealth was subject to a heavy death duty (AWUNNYADE) and ultimately returned to the King's treasury. The Dutch, Danes, and British followed the Portuguese to the Gold Coast. By the nineteenth century, the British were the dominant European power in the region and in 1827, British-led forces defeated an Ashanti army at Katammanso. In 1831, the British and the Ashanti signed a peace treaty that opened up all ports to trade. The Bond of 1844 gave British authorities jurisdiction over criminal matters in the districts surrounding the forts, however, an attempt to exact a poll tax in the surrounding districts failed. In 1868 Fanti clan leaders and educated elite convened to write the Mankessim Constitution and form the Fanti Confederacy. The leaders were quickly arrested and imprisoned for sedition. By 1872 the British had complete control of the coast after taking over the Dutch and Danish forts. When they did not recognize Ashanti sovereignty in the area, the Ashanti invaded. In 1874, British forces launched a counteroffensive and sacked Kumasi. In 1883 a general uprising led to the overthrow of the Ashanti chi ef Mensu Bonsu and four years of civil war (1884-1888). A faction representing mercantile interests prevailed, although an Imperial faction regained power in the following decade. This led to another war with the British, who again attacked Kumasi in 1895 and captured the Ashanti king and chiefs. The king and chiefs were exiled and in 1901 the whole region was declared a British possession.' <sup id="cite_ref-1288" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1288">[1,288]</a></sup> The character of the Ashanti-Denkyira conflict as a 'rebellion' might suggest that some Akan states paid tribute to Denkyira. This remains in need of confirmation.

<p><b>♠ Degree of taxation ♣ present ♥</b> The following material describes the Ashanti period. Gold dust was taxed by the state. Chiefs also collected taxes in the form of tolls and 'death duties': '(a) Death Duties (Ayibuadie): Bowdich mentions that the King of Ashanti was ‘heir to the gold of every subject from the highest to the lowest’,  and thus, according to Ashanti custom, had to contribute to the funeral custom ‘to validate his claim’. This statement, however, requires considerable qualification. While it is correct to state that, theoretically, a Chief (or rather a Stool) would sooner or later become heir—within the strict limitation implied in the Ashanti meaning of the word—to all his subjects, the majority of such death duties were received by a Stool, indirectly. It has been observed that a Chief only has direct dealings with a minority of his subordinate Chiefs, e.g. with his own Mpanyimfo and with his own Birempon, and that these officials have numerous subjects of their own whom the Head-Chief only attempts to control through them. Let us suppose that a wealthy subject died, who happened to be under one of the Mpanyimfo of the Head-Chief's Birempon. The Opanyini would succeed to a specified amount of his subordinate's private personal [Page 108] movable assets, gold-dust, slaves, cloths, and such like. On the Opanyini's death, the Birempon would take a similar proportion of his estate. The Birempon's Head-Chief, i.e. the Head of the whole Territorial Division, would not get anything on these occasions. Later, however, when the Birempon himself died, the Head-Chief would benefit by receiving the death duties from his estate, which would thus include all that he, the Birempon, had collected and accumulated in death duties from his subjects. The potential wealth of Ashanti Chiefs might thus be very great, the amount of their immediately realizable securities very small. The late Mary Kingsley, whose writings on West Africa are remarkable for observation and intuition, wrote: ‘In the capacity (eventually) to command these things his wealth lies. So take the whole together and you will see how you can have a very rich African, who could not possibly pay down £20, but a real millionaire for all that.’ The unfairness of demanding great sums as war indemnities at very short notice, which had been the policy of some of our civil and military commanders in the wars against Ashanti, may thus be realized.' <sup id="cite_ref-1289" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1289">[1,289]</a></sup> 'It is necessary to understand that when, in Ashanti, we speak of a Chief taking part of a man's property on death, only his personal self-acquired movable property is meant. Family property, in the possession of the deceased, which on his death reverted to the family, might not be touched. The proportion of the property of a dead man taken by a Chief varied in specified cases, and this will be noted when the Constitution of individual Stools comes under examination. In this chapter I am concerned with general principles rather than with the more minute details. Ayibuadie means literally ‘something to cover over or help the funeral rite’. There is a word in the vernacular, muhoma (lit. that with which to bind the breasts), which has a significance very similar to ayibuadie. Instead of a Chief coming down upon the estate of a dead subject, i.e. sending his Sana Hene (Treasurer) to lock up his rooms and boxes until the value of the estate had been assessed, he might leave the amount to be paid in death duties to the discretion of the relatives of the deceased. The levy then assumed more the appearance of a voluntary contribution on their part, ‘to bind the breast of the Chief’, ‘whose heart was sore’ owing to the loss of his subject and friend. This method of allowing the death duty to be paid was a more delicate and tactful way of going about the collection of this tax than the other more forcible method, but it practically amounted to [Page 109] the same thing in the end. It must not be overlooked that the claim to receive ayibuadie or muhoma involved some special obligations on the part of the recipient. Both these claims may be traced back to the original cell from which most of these more elaborate customs sprang. The house-father succeeded to the property of his dead kinsman, but he also had to see to it that he gave him a good and proper funeral. By a legal fiction, the Chief stood in a similar relationship to his subject, and by taking some of the latter's property on his death placed himself under the fictitious obligation of having to contribute to his funeral custom. By doing so he did not, however, become liable for the debts of the deceased. A Chief would also take care to see that the balance struck between what came in from ayibuadie or muhoma and what went out in funeral contributions ( nsa or nsawa) was in his favour. There is yet another expression which is sometimes confused with the above, i.e. awunyadie. This term, I think, means the inheritance of property by the legal heir.' <sup id="cite_ref-1290" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1290">[1,290]</a></sup> 'Death duties ( Ayibuadie): The Chief claimed ayibuadie from those subjects who served him directly. He could claim all private property on death of any gyase who was descended down the female line from a gyase female slave. In the case of the descendant of a gyase man who had married a free woman (but a subject of the Chief), a male would enter that company to which his father had belonged, but at his death the Chief would claim only one half of his private belongings, the other half going to his own kindred. The Chief of Kumawu also claimed about two-thirds of the private property of the Heads of the following fekuo (the remaining third went to the Stool of the deceased), the Atum'tufo, Asoamfo, Asokwafo, Barimfo, Obofo, Samanfo, Sodofo. He received from his Mpanyimfo (on their death) a voluntary contribution made by the successor which was known as muhoma, and generally consisted of one of the deceased's wives, a male servant, a cloth, and some gold-dust. The taking of ayibuadie or muhoma implied an obligation to contribute towards the funeral expenses and to present gifts to the dead. In the case of a wealthy man, from whose estate a considerable amount had been received in death duties, this contribution might consist of a velvet pillow ( agopekyi), a silk danta (loin-cloth), in the folds of which was wrapped a suru of gold-dust (£1); 10 s. worth of gold-dust, to mix with the fat which was used to rub down the corpse; the coffin (which it has now become the custom for the children to buy); two or three [Page opp. p 230] [Page 230] cloths, which were buried with the body; a sheep and about 10 s. in gold-dust towards the funeral expenses. In the case of a poor man, the death duties from whose estate would be a small amount, the Chief would give a sheep and a cheap cloth, ‘lest if he did not give anything, the dead should report him to the ' Samanfo (spirits)’. [These obligations are still often observed, possibly from a superstitious dread of reprisals on the part of the dead; the corresponding right to demand ayibuadie, or to expect muhoma, has on the other hand almost entirely lapsed, and this state of affairs is often given as one of the reasons for the impoverished state of Stool finances.] The Chief also informed me of another interesting possible source of revenue in olden times of which I had not previously been aware, though it is possible the custom was not confined to one Division. When the Chief had a son or daughter ( by a wife who was at the same time his own subject), and that child died, the Chief succeeded to all his or her private property and not the child's abusua (kindred group) as would ordinarily be the case. Only a Head-Chief had this right, not the lesser Chiefs—the Mpanyimfo. This rule also applied to the children of the Kyidom Hene, because he was known as the ‘son’ of the Chief.' <sup id="cite_ref-1291" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1291">[1,291]</a></sup> 'In Wilks' analysis the ultimate guarantee that wealth made by commoners would not be retained by commoners was the system of inheritance taxes or death duties. Fines could be disastrous to the payer, but we need to know more about their frequency before accepting them as something approaching a general obstacle to private accumulation of wealth. Meanwhile the various levies on economic activity during the lifetime of the actor, which included tolls on trade routes and market places, reduced the rate of private self-enrichment but did not prevent it. No commodity was more heavily taxed than gold, and all nuggets beyond a certain size had to be surrendered to the Asantehene's treasury. Yet, even so, the treasury would return part of the [Page 21] value, in gold dust, to be divided between the local chief and the finder. Again, in most areas non-subjects of the local stool, and in some chieftaincies subjects themselves, were charged a rent of one- or two-thirds of their production of gold dust. So let us examine the impact of death duties. There were two categories, awunyadie and ayibuadie, but there is some disagreement amongst scholars over whether they related to the estates of subordinate chiefs and commoners respectively, or to movable and immovable property, respectively. The point at issue, however, is best presented through Wilks's quotation of Bowdich as follows: 'The King is heir to the gold of every subject, from the highest to the lowest … The King contributes to the funeral custom to validate his claim, and usually bestows ten periguins  of the gold dust on the successor (if of a rich man,) who is in all cases liable for the debts of the deceased, though the amount is generally made good to him sooner or later, if he has influence with those about the King, or recommends himself to his notice personally.' Thus the reality was less dramatic than the opening words suggest. Part of the estate went to the successor, on behalf of the matrilineage of the deceased. Indeed, the missing words in the first line of Wilks' quotation are: ‘the fetish gold and the cloths are generally presented by him to the successor to the stool, from which the slaves and other property of the deceased are inseparable’. The general point is that the treasury taxed the estates of commoners rather than seizing them. The usual rate seems to have varied between a third and a half of the value of the property concerned. Moreover, Wilks himself noted that ‘In practice it would seem that a small estate, of the ordinary farmer for example, was left intact, to be apportioned by the family of the deceased’, whereas the estates of government functionaries ‘were wholly at the disposal of the government’. If it were not the case that most inheritance proceeded within the matrilineage, it seems unlikely that Asante would have acquired a reputation in ethnography as a classic example of matrilineal inheritance. Moreover, a father could transmit some of his wealth to his son before the issue of death duties arose, by paying his son's marriage expenses, as did Kofi Pusuo's father, and/or by giving him a sum of money, for example as working capital for a long-distance trading expedition, with or without the agreement of the father's matrikin.' <sup id="cite_ref-1292" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1292">[1,292]</a></sup> We are unsure to which degree chiefs taxes their constituents prior to the Ashanti period. We have provisionally assumed that death duties and such were collected prior to the Ashanti period as well, but this remains in need of confirmation.

<p><b>♠ Wages ♣ ♥</b> Note: Cultivation systems varied with local ecology: 'The different ecological zones have given rise to contrasting types of agriculture. In the north the main subsistence and cash crop is yams, followed by guinea corn; by 1950 there still had not been any large-scale development of export crops. In the south, a much larger variety of subsistence crops are grown, especially yams, cocoyams, manioc, and maize. Also, there has been widespread development of major commercial crops such as the kola-nut and cocoa, which has become the main economic activity in the southern zone. In former times, until the end of the nineteenth century, farm work was done by servile labor: slaves, pawns, and various kinds of servants. Today sharecropping and hired labor are the most prevalent, although domestic peonage is still common. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-1299" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1299">[1,299]</a></sup> While the rural population consisted primarily of farmers and craftsmen, the towns offered a more diverse labor market, at least from the Ashanti period onwards: 'The Kumasi Central Market is among the largest in West Africa and lies at the center of a vast market region. Traders, wholesalers, distributors, transporters, and retailers make up a complex network of exchanges, which are bolstered by a variety of kin, ethnic, and local ties. Commodity chiefs control the wholesale end of the business regulating prices. In the early nineteenth century men moved into commercial farming, leaving women to run the markets. [IS]' <sup id="cite_ref-1300" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1300">[1,300]</a></sup> 'But by the late eighteenth century the capital, Kumase, and several other major centers of local administration - Bekwae, Dwaben, Kokofu, and Mampon, for example - had come to offer a wide range of employment opportunities other than farming: in court, in the civil and military administrations, in business, in crafts, and so forth. In the early nineteenth century Kumase was already a town of about 20,000 people, few of whom were directly engaged in food production.' <sup id="cite_ref-1301" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1301">[1,301]</a></sup> Craft specializaton was also present:  'The Ashanti are noted for their expertise in a variety of specialized crafts. These include weaving, woodcarving, ceramics, and metallurgy. Weaving is a highly developed craft, with dozens of standardized and named textile designs. Weaving in cotton and silk is of a technically and aesthetically high order, and much commerce is built around it. Woodcarvings have also become a valuable commodity, especially with the rise of the tourist trade in the late twentieth century. Woodcarving is divided into many branches, each with its own specialists. Among the major products are wooden sculptures of outstanding artistic quality, talking-drums (NTUPANE), and the famous wooden "stools," which are symbolic and ritual objects rather than items of furniture.' <sup id="cite_ref-1302" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1302">[1,302]</a></sup> 'One of the most specialized crafts is metallurgy. Traditionally, Ashanti metal smiths worked in iron, brass, bronze, silver, and gold. Agricultural implements and other metal utensils were made of iron. Using a lost-wax process, smiths cast brass and bronze gold weights (MRAMMUE) of geometric, human, or animal forms. Although these objects are now mainly of interest to art collectors, their original function was practical; they were standard weights used to measure gold dust. [ROL]' <sup id="cite_ref-1303" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1303">[1,303]</a></sup> 'Craft production was an individual undertaking, and apprentice craftsmen were more often sons than sisters' sons. There were concentrations of certain crafts in certain villages, which were founded with war captives or refugees. Among these were settlements in the Kumase district such as Bonwire (cloth weaving), Ntonso (cloth dyeing), Pankrono (pottery), Ahwia (woodworking), and Breman and Adum (metalworking). Blacksmithery and joinery which catered to the needs of cultivators were scattered throughout the kingdom (Bowdich 1819, Dupuis 1824, Freeman 1967 [1898]). The crafts concerned with the elaboration of regalia were located in the immediate neighbourhood of the state capitals and the imperial capital of Kumasi (Rattray 1927: 216-308; Arhin 1982). Craft practitioners owned their own tools, and the factors that conditioned production were agricultural demand and state requirements.' <sup id="cite_ref-1304" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1304">[1,304]</a></sup> Trade was also important: 'There were early cultural and commercial links with the empires of the southern Sahara. The major commodities exchanged were gold from the Akan region and salt from the Sahara. The main Akan trading town was Bighu (Bitu) with links to Jenne on the Niger bend. Trade in gold and slaves formed the commercial basis of the traditional Ashanti state. Kola-nuts were also exported to the north. Today cocoa is Ghana's main export commodity. [IS]' <sup id="cite_ref-1305" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1305">[1,305]</a></sup> This seems to suggest that occupational mobility was present to an extent, at least in coastal cities of the Ashanti period.
