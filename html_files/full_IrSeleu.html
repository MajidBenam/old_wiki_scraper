<p>The Seleucid Empire arose in the years following the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE and the subsequent division of his empire. Alexander’s generals each ruled part of the empire, including Seleucus I who became leader of the Babylonian territory in 319 BCE as a reward for having helped Alexander eliminate the regent Perdiccas <sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup>. This date does not however mark the start of the Seleucid Empire as Seleucus was ousted by the rival Antigonus in 315 BCE and did not return to power until 312 BCE, after which the Seleucid Empire truly began as Seleucus began to extent his domain to create an empire large enough to include territories in the Central Asian steppe to European Thrace <sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup>. Seleucus’ territorial achievements were matched by only one of his successors, Antiochus III, whose rule began 60 years later. The last rulers of the empire could not match the charisma and drive of these earlier rulers, especially in the face of growing powers to the west and east of the empire (Rome and Parthia respectively). The empire declined in size and influence until it was taken over by Rome in 63 BCE.
</p><p>The Seleucid Empire continued to exert the Hellenistic influences of Alexander the Great’s empire, but like Alexander, the rulers of the Seleucid Empire generally allowed other religions and languages to continue and flourish (a notable exception being the persecution of the Jews by Antiochus IV) <sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>. Most written documents are in Greek and contain valuable information about the empire, the battles fought and the kings who ruled. The documents are however far from complete and many aspects of the empire are either inferred from other sources or remain unknown. Overall it can be surmised that the Seleucid Empire was ruled by one king at a time who held central authority, but who exerted that authority through his commanders, or satraps, in the various territories of the empire <sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup>. This both gave the king a great amount of power but also made him vulnerable to the ambitions of his satraps, the most notable example being the betrayal of the general Achaios who in 220 BCE took the territories of Asia Minor for himself after conducting campaigns there on behalf of Antiochus III <sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup>.

This threefold administrative division in each of the two empires must, one supposes, have had a common origin, but what it was is unknown. As the smallest administrative unit in Egypt was the village and in Seleucid east the hyparchy - a district would comprise a number of villages - the organisation of the Seleucid east was of necessity much looser than that of Egypt; the hyparchy, however, for purposes of land registration, was again subdivided into fortified posts called stathmoi - originally post stations on the main roads, the Seleucids having taken over the Persian postal system - each stathmos being the centre of a subdivision comprising so many villages."<sup id="cite_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup></dd>

One such norm involved the overlords allocating them at their discretion among their martial elite or to individual men in their subdivision units as performance rewards and incentives (e.g., Hom.

<p>A collective ritual is a ritual in which two or more people participate. With the official cult we refer to the set of collective ritual practices that are most closely associated with legitimation of the power structure (including elites, if any).

</p><p><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b>
</p><p><b>Description of the Ritual System</b>
</p><p>The ritual system of the Seleucid Period is a complicated mix of long standing Mesopotamian tradition and Hellenistic influence from the Seleucid rule, with a significant presence of Zoroastrianism that remained from the time of the Achaemenids. Macedonian Seleucid rulers encouraged the integration of Hellenistic and Mesopotamian gods, while the same families and administrative structures remained in power.<sup id="cite_ref-208" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-208">[208]</a></sup> Rituals took place in temples and probably in private dwellings. Temples were homes to gods and their servants and families. They were not open to the whole public but were the home of the larger rituals and festivals. Everyday private ritual probably took place in homes, thus there is much less written information about them. <sup id="cite_ref-209" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-209">[209]</a></sup>
</p><p>There was a pantheon of gods across Mesopotamia. The most important god, who might be considered the official cult, varied over time and between cities. At Babylon the Esaglia temple complex of the Bel-Marduk cult remained the most important in the Seleucid period, at Uruk Anu became the foremost deity, taking over from Ishtar. <sup id="cite_ref-210" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-210">[210]</a></sup>
</p><p>Rituals were carried out by a number of priests with specialised roles. There was the exorcist (asipu) who was in charge of averting evil and purifying rituals. Further priests include the singer (naru) and the lamentation priest (kalu). <sup id="cite_ref-211" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-211">[211]</a></sup>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Akitu ♥</b> A few literary references to a festival provide enough evidence for scholars to have concluded that Akitu, the traditional Mesopotamian new year festival, continued during the Seleucid kingdom. There is not enough information to suggest whether the ritual changed in any major or minor way in the Seleucid period compared to previous times, but due to the limited availability of information the ritual is coded using sources from earlier times. The ceremony included celebratory feasting, elaborate parades of the gods through the city and singing. It probably focused around the sacred wedding of the king, possibly to one of the gods, and was a ritualised legitimisation of kingship. There is no evidence to confirm this occurred in the Seleucid period, but it would have been a useful tool of cementing Seleucid rule. <sup id="cite_ref-212" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-212">[212]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Yasna ♥</b> After the region was conquered by Alexander the Great, "The <i>magi</i> continued to preserve the [Zoroastrian] religion. There was no higher collective authority, as under the Achaemenid government. We have therefore to imagine regional differences in the practice of the religion. the <i>magi</i> were accordingly responsible for the way in which the religion developed: they had a monopoly on religious tradition. This had far-reaching consequences, for the joyful and affirmative faith which we recognize in Zarathustra's own hymns was altered and made more prescriptive and rigorous. It now became a question of exacting observation of very strict rules, and there were extreme penalties for any violation. [...] It is reasonable for us to conclude that in the course of Seleucid times the <i>magi</i> established an extensive web of temples of fire, even if they have not been found, thereby creating firm centers for the practice of religion; and this must have been important at a time when the prevailing powers were quite unconcerned with the preservation of Iranian religion. The observance of temples of fire had become as far spread as Asia Minor, as we learn, for example, in Strabo (4.1.3a): 'In Cappadocia (for there the seat of the magi, who are also called firekindlers, is large) ... they ... have fire temples, noteworthy enclosures; and in the midst of these there is an altar, on which there is a large quantity of ashes, and where the magi keep the fire ever burning. And there, entering daily, they make incantations for about an hour, holding before the fire their bundles of rods and wearing round their heads high turbans of felt (that is, the tiara) which reach down over their cheeks far enough to cover their lips.'" <sup id="cite_ref-252" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-252">[252]</a></sup> The ritual described by Strabo is almost certainly the Yasna, which is the central ritual of Zoroastrianism <sup id="cite_ref-253" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-253">[253]</a></sup>. Schwartz writes that it was "the act of worship par excellence, in which, in addition to the other elements of religious service, the beverage haoma, in Achaemenian times probably still a hallucinogen, was prepared in a mortar, strained and offered. A long liturgy, including recitation of the Gathas, was structured around this act" <sup id="cite_ref-254" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-254">[254]</a></sup>. Though Schwarz does not mention animal sacrifice specifically in connection with the Yasna ritual, he does list it in a preceding paragraph among "[t]he ancient canon of elements of cultic worship", and may therefore be considered to be implied "the other elements of religious service" in the above quote, also because the general consensus is that animal sacrifice was en everyday part of Zoroastrian ritual, since the days of Zarathustra himself <sup id="cite_ref-255" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-255">[255]</a></sup>.</dd>

Each meal had two courses, the 'main' and 'second', with the difference being one in quantity not content. The meals were served in a style and manner befitting a king.

Specific cuts of meat were served for the main dish followed by fruit, describes as a beautiful arrangement. The meal was accompanied by musicians and the cella was fumigated before the table was cleared and removed and water was brought to cleanse the deity's fingers. The meal was clearly fit for a king, because after having been presented to the deity's image the dishes from the god's meal were sent to the king. "Not only did the meal need to be carefully prepared and served, but also the items to be used in the meal involved appropriate acts. Special blessings were pronounced at numerous times in the processing of any of the items served. For the bread alone there were prayers for when barley was ground for the sacrificial bread, when the baker was kneading the dough, and when the loaves were taken from the oven. "Despite the extreme attention to the preparation and presentation of the offerings to the deity, humans were not allowed to watch the deity consume the presentation.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Akitu ♥</b> A few literary references to a festival provide enough evidence for scholars to have concluded that Akitu, the traditional Mesopotamian new year festival, continued during the Seleucid kingdom. There is not enough information to suggest whether the ritual changed in any major or minor way in the Seleucid period compared to previous times, but due to the limited availability of information the ritual is coded using sources from earlier times. The ceremony included celebratory feasting, elaborate parades of the gods through the city and singing. It probably focused around the sacred wedding of the king, possibly to one of the gods, and was a ritualised legitimisation of kingship. There is no evidence to confirm this occurred in the Seleucid period, but it would have been a useful tool of cementing Seleucid rule. <sup id="cite_ref-356" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-356">[356]</a></sup></dd>

Only the barest outlines can be detected from the sources: unlike the Achaemenid and Ptolemaic kings, the Seleucids never listed their territorial possessions in royal inscriptions or encomiastic poetry, and historiographical sources privilege the untypical crisis moments of war or revolt. Even so, it is clear that the Seleucid kingdom arranged its political landscape according to an imperial geography largely inherited from Alexander and the Achaemenids. Satrapies (large territorial blocks with some degree of ethnic or cultural identity organized around a capital city), governed by satraps or generals (strategoi), formed the basic administrative reference points. In the third century, the core satrapies east of the Tigris were Susiana, Media, Persis, Parthia-Hyrcania, Carmania, Gedrosia, and Bactria (Bengtson 1944:18). Recall that the easternmost satrapies of Alexander's empire - Gandhara, Paropamisadaa, Areia, and parts of Arachosia - had been handed over to Chandragupta Maurya in the Treaty of the Indus (Mookerji 1995:12 and Foucher 1942: 208 contra Tarn 1951: 100 and Schmitt 1964: 66, n. 4). We now have evidence that the coastline and islands of the Persian Gulf were grouped into an administrative archipelago called either the satrapy of the Erythrean Sea or of Tylos (Bahrain) and the Islands (Kosmin forthcoming). Moreover, at various moments Armenia, Media Atropatene, and Parthia were reduced to a state of vassalage. In the second century, following the independence of Greco-Bactria and the rise of Arsacid Parthia, the Seleucids lost control of all territories east of Media." <sup id="cite_ref-482" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-482">[482]</a></sup>

Indeed it was customary for a new monarch to review and, in some cases, reinstate the land grants of his predecessor.40  Much the same practice continued in the Hellenistic kingdoms, the Seleukid empire being no exception.41 It was in many ways simpler for the king to make the land grant rather than pay a salary or stipend to an official or member of the royal family. In this way he saved the expense and trouble of managing royal land and, at the same time, passed on any risk of a poor harvest or other potential problem to the grantee.

<p><b>♠ Rulers are legitimated by gods ♣ present ♥</b> DH: Seleucid rulers, as Macedonian elites, came from tradition of more secularized rule. But clearly adapted traditional Persia /Zoroastrian traditions for their Persian subjects and based rule (at least in part) on adherence to and legitimation from divine authority. Similar phenomenon as ocurred at same time in Ptolemaic Egypt. "The Achaemenians proclaimed that they were Persians, and received the realm from the supreme god Ahuramazda. Later the Sasanian clergy taught that the kingdom and the(true) religion were twins.2 The Seleucids were of Macedonian stock, but they neither ruled over Macedonia nor had any authority over Macedonians abroad,3 and they commanded peoples not "by the grace of God", but by the right of the spear. They were neither native rulers, nor the instruments of a "colonial" power, but just lucky condottieri. Their power was not institutional but personal." <sup id="cite_ref-556" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-556">[556]</a></sup> "In return, the Greeks honored the kings as divine ‘saviors’ (sōtēres), awarding them divine honors accordingly. From the reign of Antiochos III onward, a centralized state cult of the deified king and queen was institutionalized. The Seleucid family claimed descent from the savior god Apollo. For the sake of the non-Greek subjects, Apollo and his twin sister Artemis were equated with the various local Sun and Moon gods worshipped in the multi-polytheistic empire. Starting with the reign of Antiochus IV, the Seleucids associated their rule with the cosmic kingship of Zeus, who could likewise be identified with non-Greek sky gods." <sup id="cite_ref-557" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-557">[557]</a></sup>

In turn, the ruler had to "win over" his subjects by his own eunoia.

</p><p><b>♠ Rulers become gods after death ♣ inferred absent ♥</b>  "The faith of Seleucus I was of a somewhat conservative nature, and Antiochus I likened his father to Zeus by bestowing on him the title Nicator, thereby establishing a precedent for the official deification of kings after their death. It is possible that the example of Ptolemy II Philadelphus had some influence in the case of Antiochus II whose title Theos cannot have been just an empty word; and although this kind of deification was at first only a local phenomenon (in Miletus), his coins none the less depict Hercules on the rock, Apollo on the omphalos and the horned horse's head - now heraldically stylized. By contrast, Seleucus II Callinicus made virtually no attempt to spread his own cult but was active in encouraging the cult of Apollo and Athene; moreover he combined the cult of the dead queen Stratonice Thea with that ofher protectress Aphrodite. He did not have his own title put on his coins. Neither did Seleucus III Soter and Antiochus III the Great, who stamped the image of Apollo or an elephant on the reverse of their coins - the elephant here having nothing to do with Indian theories of monarchy.2 Even more striking is the absence of any charismatic or mythical references in the consolidation of the dynastic cult under Antiochus III. Only one decree is compiled on the assumption that the kings but not the queens had cults in their lifetime, that from Antioch in Persis3 which lists with their usual titles all the kings from Seleucus I to Antiochus III (together with his eldest son)." <sup id="cite_ref-561" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-561">[561]</a></sup> "On the basis of these facts we must give a decidedly negative answer to the question of whether the Seleucid kings adopted charismatic conceptions of monarchy from their subjects for reasons that relate to religion as a political force or even whether they believed themselves to be personally legitimized by the xvarnah through which Achaemenian kings had exercised world dominion on behalf of Ahura Mazda. Of the statements which can be made about the ancient Iranian or Aryan kings, not a single one applies to the Seleucids. On the other hand interpret- ations were known in Greece which approached very nearly to the Persian concept. In pre-Hellenistic drama Darius is described as "one like the gods in counsel, a god for the Persians and godlike",2 and there was a description, inaccurate and abbreviated, it is true, of the New Year's festivities in Persepolis in which the king occupied the central position.3 The lack of influence of this on the Seleucids appears to show that even with regard to the ideology of kingship, Iranian religion was consciously neglected." <sup id="cite_ref-562" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-562">[562]</a></sup>

<p>(CC:  The equity and prosociality variables below were previously coded to suggest a lack of ideological equality.  However, the code book defines 'ideological reinforcement of equality' as 'Religious doctrine, philosophical statements, or practice makes claims about equality. For instance, explicit statements by religious groups or  influential philosophers that all humans are equal.'  The justifications below state that philosophers encouraged people to look on people as equals.  Therefore I have changed the codes to reflect that ideologies of equality existed, even if this did not translate into equality in practice)

</p><p><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of monogamy ♣ present ♥</b> “Greek culture as a whole was monogamous in the sense that a man was expected to have only one wife at a time (the wife being the bearer of his legitimate heirs). However, exceptions were permitted among powerful men for dynastic reasons, especially during the Hellenistic period (Alexander is a good example, and also the Ptolemies). And throughout Greek history, even ordinary men could have a concubine (pallakis), visit prostitutes, conduct affairs with boys, etc. There was no presumption of male sexual fidelity as a part of the marital state. That was strictly for wives. It was considered in bad taste to keep a concubine in the same house as one’s wife, but that was just about the only restriction. In general, the philosophers said that sexual desire was something men must suppress in order to achieve the good life; they thought that friendship was the most important value and it should always take precedence over sex. [...] The bottom line is that monogamy was the cultural expectation (supported by religion in the sense that even Zeus and Poseidon and Hades only had one wife each). The philosophers did not make much headway in changing this, and where they did, it was more in favor of abstinence (either with or without marriage) than of polygamy.” <sup id="cite_ref-577" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-577">[577]</a></sup>

The only philosopher I can think of who specifically advocates “helping people” over “living luxuriously” is the Stoic Musonius Rufus from the first century CE, but he may have been an innovator in that respect. In general the Greeks had no religious or philosophical teachings to compare with Jewish and Christian teachings about almsgiving, gleaning, or caring for “widows and orphans.” Greek cities sometimes gave stipends to orphans if their fathers had died in battle defending the city.  The most important traditional religious teaching on this subject was that the gods required people to treat “strangers and suppliants” well. That is, you should assist strangers who come to your door in need (and definitely not harm them). You can see this when Odysseus disguised as a beggar receives hospitality (Homer was a basic school text in the Hellenistic period) or in the Hellenistic myth of Baucis and Philemon, a very poor elderly couple who received two strangers and gave them hospitality. The strangers turned out to be Zeus and Hermes, who rewarded the couple. The belief that the gods “tested” humans by coming down to earth was common Hellenistic Asia Minor, where Paul and Barnabas were mistaken for Zeus and Hermes in disguise (Acts 14). Hellenistic philanthropy was closely tied to piety because the benefactions were usually things like sponsoring a festival or enhancing a sanctuary. Sponsoring a festival meant entertainment and free food distribution, but the main goal was not necessarily to help the poor - it was more to enhance the public good.

<dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of property rights ♣ present ♥</b> "It is now evident that, for Hesiod, κακότης‎ represents moral badness and the opposite to virtue, arete. A bad man (κακὸς ἀνήρ‎) does not follow justice (δίκη‎) with his mind, and acts immorally; he represents a source of religious pollution and danger for his community. Just as Hesiod connects the bad man with injustice and religious danger, so he presents moral righteousness and adherence to justice (δίκη‎) as coexisting with ritual correctness. Gregory Nagy points out that in Op. 336-41, a passage which follows the lines quoted above, the moral correctness of δίκη‎ is ‘programmatically re-enforced by the ritual correctness of the just man’:26 Perses is again reminded that gods punish unjust deeds (ἄδικα ἔργα‎; vv. 325-34), and that he should often sacrifice purely and cleanly to the deathless gods and propitiate them often with libations and incense (vv. 336-41). Religious correctness is thus laid out as avoiding unjust deeds and as honouring the gods with sacrifices and libations.//"In vv. 325-34 the following deeds are listed as unjust (ἄδικα ἔργα‎): gaining wealth by force, stealing, or deception; wronging a suppliant or a guest; engaging in illicit sexual intercourse; offending orphans or aged parents. These offences span both the social and religious spheres. This is stressed at the end of the passage, where Hesiod states that such deeds provoke the anger of Zeus himself, who inflicts grave punishments (vv. 333-4). Effectively, Zeus holds the transgressor in <i>agos</i>. To sum up, in Hesiod’s poem, justice is represented as a goddess and as a law given to humans by Zeus. It governs all social and religious relationships; it encompasses religious correctness. Moral goodness equals adherence to justice, whereas ‘badness’ (κακία‎ or κακότης‎) is equal to injustice and religious transgression."<sup id="cite_ref-613" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-613">[613]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of purity ♣ present ♥</b> "Hesiod is generally quick to remark that the gods are pleased when the rites are performed correctly, and are displeased when proper ritual purity is not obtained. [...] We can also observe different grades of divine anger: libating with unwashed hands renders the ritual null and void, and the gods refuse to communicate with the worshipper. The failure to achieve the required state of purity results in the failure of the ritual. A graver and more serious offence is committed when someone crosses the river without prayer and the ritual washing—then the gods are not only irate, but also keen to punish. This makes sense: the rivers are divinities, and by entering them humans establish a particularly close contact with the divine. It is one of the basic premises of Greek religion that gods abhor pollution, which is why ritual cleansing is a necessary prerequisite for every ritual action. This would imply that entering a river requires a particularly stringent adherence to ritual purity, while avoiding this purification inspires a particularly harsh punishment—a punishment for jeopardizing the god’s own purity. The intensity of the contact with the divinity corresponds directly to the intensity of the purity required for the worshipper and to the severity of the divine punishment if this requirement is violated."<sup id="cite_ref-616" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-616">[616]</a></sup></dd>

The only philosopher I can think of who specifically advocates “helping people” over “living luxuriously” is the Stoic Musonius Rufus from the first century CE, but he may have been an innovator in that respect. In general the Greeks had no religious or philosophical teachings to compare with Jewish and Christian teachings about almsgiving, gleaning, or caring for “widows and orphans.” Greek cities sometimes gave stipends to orphans if their fathers had died in battle defending the city.  The most important traditional religious teaching on this subject was that the gods required people to treat “strangers and suppliants” well. That is, you should assist strangers who come to your door in need (and definitely not harm them). You can see this when Odysseus disguised as a beggar receives hospitality (Homer was a basic school text in the Hellenistic period) or in the Hellenistic myth of Baucis and Philemon, a very poor elderly couple who received two strangers and gave them hospitality. The strangers turned out to be Zeus and Hermes, who rewarded the couple. The belief that the gods “tested” humans by coming down to earth was common Hellenistic Asia Minor, where Paul and Barnabas were mistaken for Zeus and Hermes in disguise (Acts 14). Hellenistic philanthropy was closely tied to piety because the benefactions were usually things like sponsoring a festival or enhancing a sanctuary. Sponsoring a festival meant entertainment and free food distribution, but the main goal was not necessarily to help the poor - it was more to enhance the public good. I think it is very likely that the teachings of philosophers encouraged these sorts of activities, but of course the donors also benefited from increased prestige.” <sup id="cite_ref-620" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-620">[620]</a></sup> Overall, though, this does not properly constitute enforcement.</dd>

The rule of law was the most widely respected principle, starting from the time of the early Greek law codes in the Archaic period, when the culture moved from “self-help” family vigilantism and rival strongmen to a system in which men were expected to rely on the state to punish crime and decide civil disputes. Then it was a case of how widely power would be distributed among the citizens—in a kingship, an oligarchy or a democracy. The tyrannos or tyrant early on got a bad reputation precisely because he put himself above the law. During the Hellenistic period, the big problem was how to distinguish between legitimate rulers and tyrants, who were to be despised. Generals were constantly freeing states from the “tyrannies” imposed by their previous rulers and being hailed as saviors. There is much discussion in the literature of how Hellenistic cities reconciled the contradiction between the “freedom” they so highly valued and their obedience to a king. The kings permitted favored cities to self-govern (within certain limits), and this is what they considered “freedom,” quite different from the true autonomy of a Classical polis.” <sup id="cite_ref-622" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-622">[622]</a></sup> Overall, though, this does not properly constitute enforcement.</dd>

We have already seen that Euripides, one of the most sensitive and innovative intellectuals of the Classical period, criticized both the undifferentiated application of the ritual of supplication and the lack of a distinction between a pure body and pure thoughts. This suggests that the development of the idea of the purity of the mind and its priority over the purity of the body was part of a more general process of fundamental changes in the perception of rituals in Classical and Hellenistic Greece. This process leads from the traditional view that ritual actions are effective when correctly performed to the idea that a ritual’s efficacy depends (also) on the moral and other justifications of the individual who performs it. We may observe this process from the late fifth to the third centuries BCE in measures for the exclusion of criminals from asylum, in the development of a new type of curses, in moral requirements for initiation into mystery cults, and more generally in a tendency towards a priority of the word and the thought over the ritual action.” <sup id="cite_ref-623" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-623">[623]</a></sup> Overall, though, this does not properly constitute enforcement.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ kinship ♣ inferred present ♥</b> “Piety required respect for one’s parents, especially in regard to making the annual offerings once they were dead. To mistreat a parent or neglect a parental tomb was a sign of moral depravity. Greek city-states legislated that children owed their parents food, lodging and burial (this goes back to Solon, the first lawgiver at Athens); those who failed in this duty could have their citizenship rights revoked. The worst crimes imaginable were incest with a parent and killing one’s own parent. Killing one’s own child did not carry the same weight of horror, although any kin-murder was considered more serious than murder of non-kin. The expectations for ritual purification after killing made these types of distinctions, and they could be regarded as a form of “regulation.” The Greeks recognized both written and unwritten laws. In general, the need to obey and respect parents was much, much stronger than any parental obligation to a child. Greek fathers throughout antiquity had the right to “expose” offspring they rejected at birth, which meant abandoning the infant either in the wild or in a place known to be used for that purpose, where it might or might not be picked up by slave traders. This did not count as murder, although once the infant was acknowledged by the father and accepted into the household, that would be a different matter. The Kyrene religious law code of the 4th century BCE says that “a man is bound as far as his brother’s children,” meaning that religious obligation (such as paying a fine levied for religious offense on a nephew) extended that far, and only on the paternal side.” <sup id="cite_ref-624" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-624">[624]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ bravery ♣ inferred present ♥</b> “Yes, this was definitely a “promoted value.” The Greeks called it either andreia (lit. “manliness”) or arete(“excellence”). A boy’s first school text was the Iliad, and he had to memorize long passages and write them out (or suffer beatings). As you know, this text is much concerned with the display of manly prowess in combat, which was the ultimate test of andreia. Evidence of cowardice (such as wounds taken in the back, or throwing away a shield in order to run) could ruin a man’s reputation in life or death. Plutarch wrote a book “On the Arete of Women,” in which he describes women who behaved in unexpectedly brave ways (usually by showing physical courage, fighting invaders, or counseling their men against cowardice). Some citations from the Hellenistic author Polybius: 5.111: King Attalus brought Gauls over from Europe as mercenaries because of their reputation for andreia. 6.46: [Citing unnamed sources] ‘For [they say that there are] two things on which the safety of a commonwealth depends,—andreia in the face of the enemy and concord at home.’ 27.8 [Deliberations by the Macedonian general Perseus after a victory]: ‘after this taste of Macedonian andreia, the Romans will be much more careful in the future not to impose an unjust or harsh burden upon the Macedonians.’” <sup id="cite_ref-625" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-625">[625]</a></sup></dd>

[...] Immediately after this, Antigonos adds that his policy was not motivated by self-interest, for he had no personal gain from this matter, but by a sincere concern that Lebedos and other cities may become free of debt. [...] His anxiety about the indebtedness of the cities refers to a situation which is independently attested by abundant epigraphic evidence and therefore seems real and justified: public indebtedness was a chronic feature of city finances (see n. 91 below). That was also the case here. For what Lebedos intended to do—and what other ‘indebted’ cities apparently were in the habit of doing—was, according to our document (lines 72-80), the following: 1. With the king’s permission, a city established a fund from which to purchase and stock grain for a year (eis sitou parathesin). The grain fund of the Lebedians amounted to 1,400 gold staters.84 2. Still with the king’s permission, the amount of money making up the fund was excluded from the total revenue of the city (exaireisthai apo tōn prosodōn); i.e. the amount was deducted when the city was required to pay tribute (phoros) or irregular monetary contributions (syntaxeis) to the king.85 In the present case, the Lebedians were allowed to deduct 1,400 gold staters each year. 3. To build up stocks of grain, the city auctioned the purchase and import of public grain to ‘anyone who so wished’ (ho boulomenos)—the singular ought to be taken to mean that a single purchaser is envisaged.86 That individual was then given the entire sum of the grain-fund as an interest-bearing loan payable at the end of the year.87 The successful candidate, that is, the winner at the public auction, was thus ‘the one who so wished’ and who outbid competitors by offering to pay the highest rate of interest on the loan. Having imported the grain into the city, he was permitted to sell it ‘at whatever time of the year he wishes’.88 In effect, the city auctioned a ‘package’ consisting of (a) the sole right to purchase and import grain (i.e. a statutory monopoly) and (b) a loan with which to finance the operation (a banking service).

To prevent this happening a long (the surviving text is only part of what was originally inscribed) and complicated series of provisions was enacted.

[...] Immediately after this, Antigonos adds that his policy was not motivated by self-interest, for he had no personal gain from this matter, but by a sincere concern that Lebedos and other cities may become free of debt. [...] His anxiety about the indebtedness of the cities refers to a situation which is independently attested by abundant epigraphic evidence and therefore seems real and justified: public indebtedness was a chronic feature of city finances (see n. 91 below). That was also the case here. For what Lebedos intended to do—and what other ‘indebted’ cities apparently were in the habit of doing—was, according to our document (lines 72-80), the following: 1. With the king’s permission, a city established a fund from which to purchase and stock grain for a year (eis sitou parathesin). The grain fund of the Lebedians amounted to 1,400 gold staters.84 2. Still with the king’s permission, the amount of money making up the fund was excluded from the total revenue of the city (exaireisthai apo tōn prosodōn); i.e. the amount was deducted when the city was required to pay tribute (phoros) or irregular monetary contributions (syntaxeis) to the king.85 In the present case, the Lebedians were allowed to deduct 1,400 gold staters each year. 3. To build up stocks of grain, the city auctioned the purchase and import of public grain to ‘anyone who so wished’ (ho boulomenos)—the singular ought to be taken to mean that a single purchaser is envisaged.86 That individual was then given the entire sum of the grain-fund as an interest-bearing loan payable at the end of the year.87 The successful candidate, that is, the winner at the public auction, was thus ‘the one who so wished’ and who outbid competitors by offering to pay the highest rate of interest on the loan. Having imported the grain into the city, he was permitted to sell it ‘at whatever time of the year he wishes’.88 In effect, the city auctioned a ‘package’ consisting of (a) the sole right to purchase and import grain (i.e. a statutory monopoly) and (b) a loan with which to finance the operation (a banking service). In short, ho boulomenos was set up in business by the city, which equipped him with a monopoly and with credit.89" <sup id="cite_ref-646" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-646">[646]</a></sup> From this, it seems that the king was making an exceptionfor Lebedos, but that it was not expected for cities to import store grain for a year.

Much of Iran relied on qanats, underground tunnels to save on evapora- tion, leading from aquifers to the land to be irrigated.34 The Persian king had controlled many of these, if not all, and charged a price for their use (Hdt. 3.117; Polyb. 10.28). From elsewhere, there is no specific information, but it is likely that large irrigation networks, expanded and maintained by the royal administration in Baktria or Margiane or any other arid region that possessed a vital source of water, would be treated as a royal monopoly." <sup id="cite_ref-649" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-649">[649]</a></sup> "The Central Asian economy, however, flourished under the Seleucid dynasty, as the dynasty encouraged migration to Bactria and actively expanded irrigation networks (Frye, 1996, p. 113)." <sup id="cite_ref-650" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-650">[650]</a></sup> "The scale of activity required to dam the outlet of the Euphrates into the Pallakottas canal every year, recorded as requiring the labour of 10,000 men for two months in the Persian period (Arr.

The Thessalian military settlers in Larissa (Syria) received their land from the Seleukid kings “because of their bravery” (ep andreia; Diod. 33.4a). The commander of the Ptolemaic garrison at Philai proudly mentions in a dedication he made that he was given a distinc- tion during the visit of Ptolemy IX (SEG XXVIII 1429). Aristodikides of Assos was one of the “friends” of Antiochos I, to whom the king gave land in the Hellespontine satrapy (ca. 275 BC; Savalli-Lestrade 1998: 11-12; Bagnall and Derow 2004: no. 18). The king explains his motivation in his letters to the governor: “because being our friend he has rendered his services with all goodwill and zeal” (RC 11); “seeing that he is benevolent and zealous in our interest we are anxious to favor the man highly” (RC 12). Such phrases not only honor the recipient of the gift, but also encourage other officers to demonstrate analogous zeal and goodwill. A letter sent by Seleukos IV to Seleukeia in Pieria concerning honors for one of his father’s veterans (RC 45, 186 BC) reinforces this point: “Aristolochos, one of the ‘honored friends,’ has rendered his services with all good-will to our father and our brother and ourself, and has at the most critical times given splendid demonstrations of his attitude towards our affairs”; the “critical times” (anankaiotatoi kairoi) are the uninterrupted wars of Antiochos III, who had recently died before he had a chance to reward Aristolochos.

The main issue of this clause is to determine the person who had the right of guardianship - and thus the right to administer the inheritance of the soldier until his orphans came of age, or who would receive the inheritance if the orphans died prematurely (SEG XXVII 806). The mercenaries wanted to make sure that this person would be the next relative or a person designated by the soldier in his will, and not, for example, an officer.

It has been suggested (ch. 6.3h and above) that land grants may have been one way of cutting down on silver payments to officials and, whenever there was attachment to cities, this may actually have resulted in more silver revenue for the kings through increased economic activity and taxation.
With regard to tax exemptions, it is hardly ever that a Seleukid king made a subject city totally tax-free, although perhaps Jerusalem (and Judaea) approached this condition when faced with weak kings (Demetrios I and II) vying for support. In most cities of Asia Minor about which there is infor- mation, only one or a few of a wide range of taxes were usually exempted and typically the tribute on land first. This may not, however, have been such a heavy burden after all, compared to some of the other taxes (ch. 8.1)." <sup id="cite_ref-677" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-677">[677]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Wages ♣ ♥</b> <i>This data relates to officials.</i> "The Ptolemaic general in charge of the forces that faced Antiochos III in Phoenicia and Palestine, Skopas, received 10 minas a day and each officer of his staff 1 mina (Polyb. 13.2.3). Generals could and did change sides and become governors of provinces (e.g. Ptolemaios, Document 4) and, perhaps, this is an indication of pay scales of senior officials in the Seleukid empire as well.
[...] Milns calculates a cost of 2,200-4,800 talents per year for the mixed phalanx and 6,000 talents per year for 100,000 mercenaries, paid at the rate of 1 drachm per day. He also adds 30-50 per cent for food and overheads. This would give a total of more than 10,000-15,000 talents a year (1987: 254). Cavaignac estimates that a 100,000-man army would cost 6,000 talents a year (1951: 142). Cavaignac also puts the cost of a fleet of the period, consisting of eighty or ninety ships, at about 2,000 talents per year (1923: 118). However, for many officials a large part of their earnings, and perhaps even all, may have been indirect, from the land granted to them by the king, while they remained in office or even afterwards. One does not know what services Mnesimachos had rendered, but following the argument in chapter 8.1a and e, his own revenue from the land grant may have amounted to about 30 drachms per day. Aristodikides’ land grant (Document 2) ulti- mately contained 5,500 plethra of mostly cultivable land, or about 500 hectares, roughly equal in fact to the estimated cultivable area of one of Mnesimachos’ two main villages and so perhaps yielding half his revenue. By way of comparison, a governor of the minor Achaemenid province of Judaea earned 40 (Persian) shekels daily from ‘the satrap’s table’ (Nehemiah 5.15-17), equivalent to about 50 drachms.
These are isolated rates of pay, which really give only an indication of what some administrative personnel of a satrapy may have cost. So, to arrive at a total cost of the provincial administration, one is reduced to ‘educated speculation’.
The financial and, indirectly, civil administration of a satrapy is discussed in chapter 13. Let us assume that the chief officers of a satrapy, the strate ̄gos and the dioike ̄te ̄s, received half of Skopas’ daily pay, namely 500 drachms.50 Each of the twenty or so satrapies of the empire at its peak may have been divided into three or four hyparchies or oikonomiai, on average.51 Let us assume that the hyparch and the oikonomos were each paid 50 drachms per day, half the salary of Skopas’ officers. Garrison commanders are not taken into account, as their pay has been considered part of military expenditure, but there were other senior officials in a satrapy, such as one or more eklogistai (‘tax assessors’), probably an epi to ̄n hiero ̄n (‘supervisor of the sanctuaries’) and certainly epistatai (‘supervisors’) for some cities (ch. 13.4-7). Again, let us assume that each of these middle-level officials earned 50 drachms per day.
So, two chief officers and about ten at the next level made up the ‘senior management’ of a satrapy and may have cost up to 1,500 drachms per day or roughly 90 talents per year. At least one large satrapy (Koile Syria) pos- sessed intermediate administrative subdivisions, the meridarchies, with a meridarch and a dioike ̄te ̄s in command of each, which would have increased their cost (ch. 13.5a). So, for twenty satrapies in the empire at its peak, the total annual cost of senior personnel works out at about 2,000 talents, although a substantial part of this may have effectively been covered by land grants (from which the king could even expect taxation revenue in silver). At more junior levels of the administration, individual personnel costs would have been appreciably lower, probably nearer the 0.5-1 drachm daily pay of the average soldier. Taking into account other expenses of the satrapies that could not be met by requisitions or corve ́e labour, the total cost of the provincial administration in silver may have been of the order of 2,000-3,000 talents annually at the empire’s peaks c. 281 or 190 bc, purely based on ‘educated speculation’." <sup id="cite_ref-690" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-690">[690]</a></sup>

There is no knowing what the prices may have been in the intervening years, but they are also likely to have been high, in the climate of war and uncertainty. If one ignores the affected years, however, one is left with an underlying price trend for barley which is surprisingly flat for 200 years, at about 120 litres for a shekel of silver, equivalent to 60 litres for an Attic drachm, which means that the price of an Attic medimnos of 51.8 litres would have been nearly 0.9 Attic drachms.65" <sup id="cite_ref-691" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-691">[691]</a></sup> "Cereals were the staple of the ancient Near Eastern and Mediterranean diets, and in the Seleukid empire the main crop, as in mainland Greece at this time, seems to have been barley rather than wheat." <sup id="cite_ref-692" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-692">[692]</a></sup> Graph showing the average price between 350 and 150 BCE: 120 Liters for a shekel <sup id="cite_ref-693" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-693">[693]</a></sup>. <span style="color:blue">AD: what is the convention that we will use across polities to indicate the staple cost? </span>

"The Persian king, we are told (Athenaios 4.145a), spent 20 or 30 talents or more a day for his maintenance, for which there is some confirmation in the huge quantities of commodities listed by Polyainos (4.3.32) for the ‘King’s dinner’.52 In both of these cases, it was clearly not only the king and his courtiers who wined and dined, but also that part of the army which was permanently attached to the court and travelled with it. On the assumption that half of the cost was borne by the army, the expenditure of the Persian king and his court would have amounted to about 5,000 talents annually. One cannot apply this directly to the court of the Seleukid king,53 of course, even if the figures were accurate. Nevertheless, to consider that the king spent 2,000-3,000 talents a year on himself and his entourage does not appear unreasonable, since, as part of the ideology of kingship, he was expected to give the impression of great wealth.54 For example, even at a time of financial strain after Magnesia (ch. 12.4), Antiochos IV could be regarded as surpassing all previous kings in his public displays (Livy 41.20)." <sup id="cite_ref-694" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-694">[694]</a></sup>
