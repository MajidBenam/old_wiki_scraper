<dl><dd>The last of the Roman kings, the tyrannical Lucius Tarquinius Superbus ('the Arrogant'), was expelled by a revolt of some of the leading Roman aristocrats in 509 BCE. Vowing never again to allow a single person to amass so much authority, the revolutionaries established in place of the monarchy a republican system of governance, featuring a senate composed of aristocratic men and a series of elected political and military officials. The Roman Republic was a remarkably stable and successful polity, lasting from 509 BCE until it was transformed into an imperial state under Augustus in 31 BCE (though the exact date is debated, as this was not a formal transformation). We divide the Republic into an early (509-264 BCE), a middle (264-133 BCE), and a late (133-31 BCE) period.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The Late Republican period began once Rome was firmly established as the major power throughout the Mediterranean basin. By the end of the period, Romans had taken control of the entire Mediterranean region, with further territorial expansion into North Africa, Anatolia, the Levant and Egypt. Success abroad, however, was not matched by stability at home. The Roman state entered a prolonged period of crisis during the 1st century BCE. Civil wars were frequent, pitting different military leaders such as Sulla, Pompey the Great, and Julius Caesar and their supporters against each other. An underlying tension persisted between the wealthy and elite and the rest of the population. These tensions intensified in 133 BCE, when a Plebeian Tribune (an elected official charged with looking after the interests of the poorer members of society) named Tiberius Gracchus proposed legislation to redistribute land that had been taken over (legally and extra-legally) by wealthy aristocrats to landless Romans, particularly those who had served in the army. This move upset the ruling elite, leading to a riot in the streets of Rome and, ultimately, to Gracchus' death. The city's different political factions were polarized by these events, leading to a series of violent contests for power by military leaders supported either by the elites (notably Sulla and Pompey the Great) or styled as champions of the people (Marius, Caesar, and Octavian/Augustus).</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The period of civil war, and with it republican government at Rome, effectively ended in 31 BCE when Octavian (soon to take the title of Augustus as the first ruler of the imperial Roman state, known as the Principate) defeated Mark Antony and the Egyptian army led by the Ptolemaic Queen Cleopatra at the battle of Actium.</dd></dl>
<p><i>Population and political organization</i>
</p>
<dl><dd>Rome during the Republican period possessed no written constitution, but was governed largely through the power and prestige of the Senate, with a clear respect for precedent and for maintaining Rome's traditions.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> A primary goal of the early Republic was to establish clear checks on the power of any single ruler - the military office of chief commander was in fact split between two generals (consuls), while the chief priestly and legislative posts were split among different people (individuals were restricted from holding multiple offices at once) - and popular assemblies voted on new laws.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Romans of this period did not distinguish between what is today termed 'secular' and 'sacred' authority; although individual magistracies had distinct functions, the same person often held both religious and political offices over the course of their lifetime, as they were thought to be part of essentially the same sphere of governance. The Republic featured a substantial array of religious offices and institutions intended to determine the will of the gods or to please them through the proper performance of rituals and the maintenance of large public temples.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> These public auspices were the basis of magisterial power in the Republic.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> Auspices were sometimes taken by consuls and other officials, for example before important military engagements,<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> but were mainly managed by specialist elected priests and full-time priestesses (such as the Vestal Virgins) and other priestly offices supported by the state.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Despite the internal strife, Rome remained essentially unchallenged by external forces and continued to make military advances. The significant reforms of the consul Marius helped modernize the ever-expanding Roman army around 105 BCE by removing property qualifications for military service, paving the way towards a fully professional fighting force. The period also saw some extensive engineering projects that increased urbanization and economic development: roads, aqueducts, bridges, amphitheatres, theatres, public baths, as well as Roman administrative and legal institutions spread alongside the military throughout the Mediterranean. Though this time was a period of political instability, it also was the start of a 'golden age' in the cultural history of Rome, with literary figures like Cicero, Horace, Sallust, Caesar and Catullus, among others, leaving important and influential writings.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The population at the dawn of empire was around 30 million people, with Italy itself supporting between 5 and 10 million, thus apparently experiencing population growth despite the repeated bouts of civil war.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup></dd></dl>

</p><p><b> ♠ Professional military officers ♣ {present; absent} ♥ </b>  The highest officers in the Roman military system were usually senators not professionals. There were, however, professional junior officers at least from the Roman Principate.
</p><p>"Typically the men who commanded armies and legions were senators. There were no military specialists in Roman government and no imperial high command. All senators alternated brief periods of military command with administrative posts, participation in domestic politics and careers as legal advocates. As military commanders they were, to a great extent, amateurs, even though most did a brief spell as a junior officer (tribune) in a legion. They would have depended on the professional junior officers (tribunes and centurions) as well as the training and discipline of the legionaries themselves to win battles.""<sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup>
</p><p>"Tribunes, like the legionary legate (commander), were drawn from Rome's social and political elite, the senatorial and equestrian orders, and were not professional soldiers. They alternated military service with political, judicial and administrative duties."<sup id="cite_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Professional soldiers ♣ {present; absent}: 100 BCE ♥ </b> Army pay introduced at the start of a campaign against Veii 406 CE: "According to Livy (4.9.11), the Senate introduced army pay (stipendium) to compensate the men serving in this struggle for the labor they lost on their family farms." For the same reason it is widely agreed that pay was introduced due to prolonged campaigns "from the later fourth century onwards, during the wars against the Samnites, the Etruscans, and Gauls." The tributum tax, which is mentioned "from roughly 400 BC onwards" is thought to have been introduced for citizens to pay for soldiers. <sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup>
</p><p>Professional soldiers were certainly present from the beginning of the Roman Principate. "Augustus' main military reforms had the effect of turning the army into a standing force of long-service professionals, instead of the part-time citizen force of the Republic."<sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup> It is also argued that a professional corps developed from the reforms of Marius in 105 BCE.

<b> ♠ Professional priesthood ♣ present ♥ </b> Early Roman cults were funded by regular public offerings, large individual donations, and payment for services. The hierarchy could also profit from land ownership. Professionalism of the priesthood likely pre-dates the Roman era as similar patterns are evident in Greek and Egyptian civilization. When the state provided gifts, it was often in the form of a lavish construction, such as a new temple. Examples: priests of Isis were "full-time religious professionals" <sup id="cite_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup>; Vestals were "supported by the state and were full-time professional clergy, along with the Priestess of Ceres and Proserpina." <sup id="cite_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup>

</p><p>During the Roman Principate there were salaried officials who worked in the Imperial Bureaux (scrinia) <sup id="cite_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-57">[57]</a></sup> but before this time any bureaucrats are thought to have been unpaid aristocrats.

</p><p><b> ♠ Examination system ♣ absent ♥ </b> There was no examination system.
</p><p><b> ♠ Merit promotion ♣ inferred absent ♥ </b> Roman administration was typically formed out of a class of hereditary aristocrats. Distinctions between classes of legionary and distinctions between age and experience within the army had been eliminated by Marius in 105 BCE<sup id="cite_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup> and the Illyrian emperors did demonstrate that "low born" individuals could make it to the top of the administrative hierarchy. Since there was no general policy of merit promotion in the Roman bureaucracy - and the promotion of low-born individuals to position of power might be considered a matter of "politics" among aristocrats - the code is inferred absent.
</p><p><b> ♠ Specialized government buildings ♣ present ♥ </b> The first senate building, the Curia Hostilia, existed from about 600 BCE. <sup id="cite_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup> The first paving of the Roman Forum occurred around 575-625 BCE. <sup id="cite_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-60">[60]</a></sup> The first coin minted in Rome occurred about 269 BCE (one in Neapolis produced coins slightly earlier, around 281 BCE) and the first state archives was created in 78 BCE.

<dd><b> ♠ drinking water supply systems ♣ present ♥ </b> Maintenance of existing aqueduct network. At Rome nearly all aqueducts began in the Sabine Hills, in the valley of the river Anio. Waters, such as from the (previously built) Aqua Marcia, would take 15-20 hours to reach the city. At the city the water would enter a distribution tank, before traveling through the terracotta or lead-pipe network. The best evidence for piped urban water networking has been found at Pompeii. The water had three main destinations: street fountains, baths and domestic. The majority of Romans gained their fresh water from street fountains. For domestic use, water supply was controlled by the size of a bronze nozzle (adjutage) that connected the masonry channel to the leadpipe that entered the house.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ tribal assembly ♥</b> As already mentioned, the surviving information about electoral procedures is mostly haphazard and fragmented. Modern scholars who have discussed the issue attempted to construct as complete a picture as possible from the extant data, and the following account is based largely on their reconstructions and conclusions whose outlines are generally accepted. We shall first review the features common to all electoral assemblies, and then examine the distinctive procedures of each one in turn. "[...] "As in all public activities, it was important to assure that the gods looked upon the elections favorably. Therefore, between midnight and dawn of the elections day, the presiding magistrate (a consul or a dictator who had the right to ask for signs (auspicia), which was part of their imperium) arrived at the voting venue. He established a holy compound (templum) at the site, ascended a raised podium and scanned the skies for signs that the gods looked favorably upon the assembly. These he interpreted with the help of one of the augures. If the signs were inauspicious, the elections were postponed to an alternative assembly day that probably had been reserved ahead for this purpose. [...]. "Since all public activity in Rome ceased at sundown, the magistrate called on citizens to start voting immediately at dawn. The summons, like other instructions to voters, was delivered in a prescribed manner. A herald stood on a podium and declared the start of the elections, while another blew a trumpet around the city walls and called on the citizens to vote. While the voting for the centuriate assembly was in session, a red flag was hoisted on the Ianiculum, the hill across the Tiber, facing the election zone at the campus Martius, to indicate that the city was not in danger of an enemy attack (p.96). "Once all ceremonies had been completed, the magistrate, who was seated on an elevated tribunal outside the saepta, delivered a public prayer in time-honored fashion, beseeching the immortal gods for their blessing and expressing the hope that their good-will would enable the elections to proceed and bring success and prosperity to the elected and to the Roman people in general. He then formally appealed to the assembled citizens to declare which among the candidates they wished to elect to the respective positions. Up to this point, the sequence of events was in fact an unofficial assembly (contio). However, once the presiding magistrate ordered the citizens to split up, report to their respective units (discedite Quirites) and vote (ite ad suffragium)- irrespective of the number of citizens who showed up to vote - the gathering changed from an unofficial assembly to an official one (comitia). "At this point, each voter reported to the place assigned to his tribe in the saepta. It is unclear precisely how and where citizens assembled before the vote, how they identified themselves to the tribal officials (tribules), or how the latter verified the voters’ identities to prevent fraud - perhaps it was based on personal acquaintance, or by consulting a list of tribe members. Nicolet speculated that each Roman citizen was issued with a small bronze “dog tag” stating his name and tribe, but there is no evidence whatsoever to confirm his conjecture. "Before 139, voting was oral. Each voter presented himself before a rogator (p. 129) and stated his choice aloud. The rogator noted this with a point (puncta) on a wax tablet assigned to each of the official candidates, and when the voting was over, each candidate’s points were added up. However, from 139 onwards, Romans elected their magistrates by inscribing the initials of the name(s) of the candidate(s) of their choice on small wax tablets. Precisely when and where each voter received his tablet, or inscribed his choices, remains unknown. Apparently, there was no supervision over the voters during the inscription on the tablets, judging by an incident when Cato the Younger annulled the elections results after proving that 'all the votes bore the same handwriting.' [...] "Having inscribed the names of the chosen candidates on the tablet, each voter joined his tribe’s designated lineup and ascended a raised podium (usually of a temple between six and ten feet high or a specially constructed platform) by the means of a flight of stairs and a wooden bridge (pons). We do not know if there were thirty-five bridges for this purpose - one for each tribe - or a smaller number shared among the tribes. In 119, Marius, as tribune of the plebs, enacted a law that ordered these bridges to be narrowed. Some modern scholars believe that this was designed to make it more difficult for hawkers to sway voters in favor of one candidate or another at the very last minute, but this interpretation is problematic for a number of reasons. First, Plutarch explicitly states that Marius asked to narrow the bridges in connection with voting in the law courts (p.131), not during elections; second, this notion is based on the assumption that voters inscribed the names of the candidates on their tablets only immediately before casting their vote. However, this is inconsistent with other testimonies - such as the aforementioned fraud exposed by Cato the Younger - and with current estimates of the comparative brevity of the elections process, as will presently become clear. Therefore, it cannot be unequivocally established that Marius’ law was applied to elections as well. "On the podium itself stood a large urn (cista) by way of a ballot box (one for each tribe), into which each voter cast his marked wax tablet. It was surrounded by guardians (custodes) appointed by the presiding magistrate from among the tribal dignitaries, as well as by representatives of the vari- ous candidates, whose job was to supervise the voting and to ensure that no voter cast more than a single tablet into the cista. Once voting was over, the tablets were removed from each of the tribal urns, inspected by the “ballot committee,” and the votes noted on other wax tablets with points, just as in the days when voting was conducted orally. Many people were involved in the counting (diribitio), and upon completion, the guardians formally handed over the results to the magistrate who presided over the assembly. "This procedure applied to both the centuriate and tribal assemblies; however, each of the popular assemblies had its own unique features. We will start with the tribal assemblies. "In the days when the tribal assemblies (the concilium plebis and the comitia tributa) voted at different venues in the narrow confines of the Forum, the tribes were called to vote in sequence (p.97), with the first tribe chosen by casting lots among the thirty-one rural tribes (the urban tribes were most probably excluded from this process). Thereafter the remaining tribes voted. Once the elections were moved to the much larger campus Martius, there was no longer any need for casting lots, as all tribes now voted simultaneously. "At the signal given by the presiding magistrate (a plebeian tribune or a consul), the citizens split into designated lines according to their respective tribes, apparently in a space outside the saepta. Once a voter’s identity had been verified by the tribal officials (tribules), he received a wax tablet and inscribed upon it the name or names of his preferred candidates (precisely how and where we do not know). To help the voters, the names of the candidates were noted in big characters on large tables. Although we know nothing about the order of voting within each tribe, it is reasonable to assume that the tribal notables such as senators and equites voted first. As the single file made its way up the pons to the elevated podium each voter cast his tablet into the tribal cista, and left the podium, apparently by means of one or more flights of stairs (either temporary ones or those of a temple) at the rear. "Once all tribes had cast their votes, the vote counting (diribitio) began in the presence of the guardians and the candidates’ representatives. Although the tribes voted simultaneously, the results from each tribe were announced separately, in an order determined by casting lots. This went on until a candidate had achieved the required majority (eighteen tribes i.e., eighteen electoral units out of thirty-five)." <sup id="cite_ref-207" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-207">[207]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b>♠ Typical size of participating group ♣ {6,000; 16,800; 30,000; 55,000; 70,000} ♥</b> NOTE: The following quote refers specifically to the Late Republic. "Lily Ross Taylor, who contributed greatly to our knowledge on Roman popular assemblies, estimated that the permanent structure was capable of holding up to 70,000 voters. Her critics, who also took into account the areas required for the inner spaces, the voting podiums and their approaches, and the vote counting area, have postulated lower figures. MacMullen put the saepta’s capacity at around 55,000 people, while Mouritsen calculated that the structure could hold no more than 30,000 people at a pinch. However, as we have said, mere capacity is not necessarily an indicator of actual attendance. Nicolet has reached an even lower figure, based on a single Ciceronian passage (Fam. 7.30), which attests that in 45, the consular elections (in which only one consul was elected) lasted five hours in all. Taking the entire process into account - including the time needed for each participant to vote, the vote count- ing, and the announcement of winners - he estimated that the number of voters of the eighteen centuriae of equites and the first and second classes - whose votes sufficed to determine the outcome - was 16,800.36 Mouritsen claims, however, that even this figure is overestimated, as Nicolet did not take into account the various organizational problems that took time away from the voting itself, and overlooked the fact that five Roman hours are the equivalent of three hours and forty-five minutes. Mouritsen therefore estimated that in the specific case of these rather extraordinary elections (the assembly had originally convened to elect quaestors), which took place under Caesar’s dictatorship, the number of participants of the first classis, the eighteen centuries of equites and the second classis numbered around six thousand men. All these conclusions are, of course, conjectural, but practically everything points to the fact that a very small percentage of the people participated in the elections." <sup id="cite_ref-212" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-212">[212]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Triumph ♥</b> Triumphs were, traditionally, grand processions celebrating a general's military victories. However, starting from the rule of Augustus onwards, they became dynastic events, "used either to showcase [the Emperor's] chosen heirs [...] or to celebrate the beginning of reigns, almost as a coronation ritual" <sup id="cite_ref-322" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-322">[322]</a></sup>. During the Principate and the Dominate eras, moreover, triumphs were much rarer, sometimes with decades passing between successive ones. But, besides this, the way they were celebrated during the Empire seems to have been broadly similar to how they were celebrated during the Republic. The procession started from outside the city, then proceeded through Rome's streets, passed through the triumphal gate, and ended at the temple of Jupiter on the Capitol, where the Emperor, or a relative of his, dedicated a sacrifice to the god. Triumphs were grand affairs, involving feasts, and, in case of triumphs that were more military than dynastic, the display of prisoners of war, as well as precious items and natural wonders looted from the conquered territories. Usually they lasted one day, but there were exceptions. Prisoners of war were sometimes executed at some point during the festivities<sup id="cite_ref-323" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-323">[323]</a></sup></dd>

<i>Need to edit this</i> The Roman Republic was ruled by a military and religious aristocracy which maintained an extremely complex set of religious and political institutions that with no written constitution<sup id="cite_ref-497" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-497">[497]</a></sup> significantly evolved over the 509-264 BCE period in the aftermath of the monarchy (509-367 BCE) and then as the city-state of Rome conquered and began to rule foreign peoples and territories. The aristocracy used voting assemblies to elect two ruling officials called magesteries who appointed an aristocratic assembly known as the Senate which instructed or advised (in the form of decrees) the executive. Magistrates had "executive, judicial, legislative, diplomatic, military and even religious functions."<sup id="cite_ref-498" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-498">[498]</a></sup> Consuls, elected by the comitia centuriata (assembly of military), were "commanders of military forces ... [who] presided over meetings of the Senate and implemented its decisions." They "were always patrician until 367 BC, when plebeians could stand for office"<sup id="cite_ref-499" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-499">[499]</a></sup> and could appoint a single dictator for a six-month period for times of crisis.<sup id="cite_ref-500" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-500">[500]</a></sup> Consuls always acted in collaboration with the senate.<sup id="cite_ref-501" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-501">[501]</a></sup> For Roman law-making the voting assembly comitia centuriata was the "main legislative body [which] passed laws (leges) named after the magistrates who proposed them. After 287 BC the people controlled legislation with their resolutions (plebiscita). The comitia centuriata rarely legislated after 218 BC."<sup id="cite_ref-502" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-502">[502]</a></sup>; additionally, "edicts of magistrates with imperium and interpretations of jurists ... had the force of law", whilst "Senatorial decrees (senatus consulta ...)... were strictly only advice to magistrates but were generally binding"<sup id="cite_ref-503" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-503">[503]</a></sup>. "As Rome expanded, more magistrates were needed, and the consuls lost some of their original functions to other magistrates."<sup id="cite_ref-504" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-504">[504]</a></sup> From the 318 BCE plebiscitum Ovinium, censors, two magesteries elected by the comitia centuriata who had "especially important sacral and civic duties",<sup id="cite_ref-505" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-505">[505]</a></sup> replaced the two consuls as the individuals with the authority to appoint and remove senators, and they also appointed new consuls as senators. The Roman magesteries reflect both the aristocratic nature of Roman political organization which could permit powerful individuals but did not enable a single individual to dominate Roman society: "The term of office for magistrates was one year, and a senator would expect to be elected to at least two or three magistracies during his lifetime. A magistrate could hold other offices simultaneously, such as a priesthood."<sup id="cite_ref-506" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-506">[506]</a></sup> It is speculated that the three ruling tribes or families (patricians) that ruled the Roman commoners (plebeians) during the regal period, before the tyranny, may have again had political significance during the historically murkier 509-367 BCE period; in that the aristocratic rulers may have wished to create a political system whereby one family could never dominate.<sup id="cite_ref-507" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-507">[507]</a></sup> In the consulship "no two individuals of the same gens ever held office contemporaneously" but in the brief consular tribunate "there [were] instances of the same gens holding more than one office."<sup id="cite_ref-508" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-508">[508]</a></sup> "There is, in other words, no instance where one gens was able to dominate in any year, and we know that laws were passed later in the republic to insist on distribution of office in the priesthood on exactly these grounds."<sup id="cite_ref-509" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-509">[509]</a></sup> In this respect, perhaps, it may be interesting that the Roman Republic had no independent central bureaucracy; it was not until the empire period that revenues were diverted into an imperial treasury<sup id="cite_ref-510" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-510">[510]</a></sup>. The state treasury - cash and Senate archives - was in fact under the custody of a powerful priesthood inside the temple of Saturn controlled by elected officials called quaestors<sup id="cite_ref-511" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-511">[511]</a></sup>. The Pontifex Maximus, chief priest of the college of pontifices, was also an elected position - elected by the comitia tributa (assembly of all citizens). The pontifice lead the state cult and had to "maintain the pax deorum, the 'peace with the gods'"<sup id="cite_ref-512" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-512">[512]</a></sup>. The location of the Roman treasury was thus a symbolic keystone for the Roman Republic because the all-important public auspices rituals "formed the basis of regal and then, in the Republic, magisterial power"<sup id="cite_ref-513" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-513">[513]</a></sup>; in theory held by the executive and first consuls from 509 CE,<sup id="cite_ref-514" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-514">[514]</a></sup> in practice managed by specialist elected priests and full-time priestesses (Vestals, supported by the state and "full-time professional clergy, along with the priestess of Ceres and Proserpina"<sup id="cite_ref-515" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-515">[515]</a></sup>) and an array of religious institutions that determined what the Roman gods wanted (e.g. college of augurs) and attempted to pleased them through ritual sacrifices and maintainence of their temples (e.g. vestals and flamines). Religious offices (duum viri) also were dedicated to interpreting sacred texts known as the Libri Sibyllini that the Romans considered prophetic (retained from the regal period). Romans considered infrastructure dedicated to reading omens and interpreting divine will necessary because every major action of the Roman state had to be legitimated by a reading of the public auspices (the signs of Jupiter).<sup id="cite_ref-516" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-516">[516]</a></sup>. This gave the Roman priesthood an important influence over Roman society. Until Lex Ogulnia (300 BCE) all pontifices were patricians.<sup id="cite_ref-517" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-517">[517]</a></sup> However, the direct role of the priesthood in the affairs of Roman society gradually declined through the 509-264 BCE period: the priests "originally interpreted civil law, ... this role was taken over by jurists (mainly of senatorial rank), and praetors [who] administered the law and issued edicts."<sup id="cite_ref-518" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-518">[518]</a></sup> The famous Twelve Tables of 451-450 BCE was "drawn up by a board of ten men (decemviri legibusscribundis ...)".<sup id="cite_ref-519" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-519">[519]</a></sup> An important trend in the nature of Roman government in the Early Republic was the rise of the plebeian class to positions of power and status. This particularly accellerated from about 444 BCE when began a period historians have called the "Conflict of the Orders". The tribuni militum consulari potestate (consular tribunate) emerged briefly during this time of disruption (to be abolished 367 BCE). "Between 444 and 392, consuls were often replaced by three, four, or six military tribunes with consular power (consular tribunes) and in all years between 391 and 367 by six consular tribunes."<sup id="cite_ref-520" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-520">[520]</a></sup> This was an elected office that could be held both by members of the powerful families and the Roman citizens.<sup id="cite_ref-521" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-521">[521]</a></sup> "Here the Romans devised a college of up to six magistrates who had the consular 'power' to lead an army yet who did not have imperium and whose auspices were deficient in some way. The idea perhaps was to keep members of the plebeian class - who were eligible for the office - away from the highest public auspices."<sup id="cite_ref-522" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-522">[522]</a></sup> Nevertheless, after the consular tribunate was abolished by the lex Licinia Sextia "and the consular constitution was reestablished for 366; henceforth plebeians were eligible for election to one of the consulships, and in more than half the years between 366 and 342 a plebeian was elected."<sup id="cite_ref-523" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-523">[523]</a></sup> Due to the murky nature of the sources, however, we can only be certain of much of what we know about the structure of Roman rule such as "a double magistry and a conflict between ruling classes (patrcians) and Roman citizens (plebeians)" from about 367 BCE.<sup id="cite_ref-524" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-524">[524]</a></sup>

During the early history of the office (443-38 B.C.), censors were elected on average about every nine years (Austin 1982). The censors were always two in number and held office for eighteen months. Their primary duty was to conduct a census of the Roman people, which involved taking statements under oath from adult male heads of households as to the members of their family and their property holdings; on the basis of these formal declarations, the censors assigned every adult male to a tribe, to an economic class, and to a place within the comitia centurata, and every household's taxes to the state were calculated according to the assessed value of its property.

237 BC - Corsica et Sardinia; these two islands were taken over from the Carthaginians and annexed soon after the Mercenary War, in 238 BC and 237 BC respectively.
197 BC - Hispania Citerior; along the east coast of the (Iberian Peninsula); part of the territories taken over from the Carthaginians .
197 BC - Hispania Ulterior; along the southern coast of the (Iberian Peninsula); part of the territories taken over from the Carthaginians in the Second Punic War.
147 BC - Macedonia; mainland Greece. It was annexed after a rebellion by the Achaean League.
146 BC - Africa; modern day Tunisia and western Libya; home territory of Carthage; annexed after the destruction of Carthage in the Third Punic War.
129 BC - Asia; formerly the Kingdom of Pergamon in western Anatolia (modern Turkey) by its last king, Attalus III, in 133 BC.
120 BC - Gallia Narbonensis (southern France); prior to its annexation it was called Gallia Transalpina (Gallia the other side of the Alps) to distinguish it from Gallia Cisalpina (Gaul this side of the Alps, in northern Italy). It was annexed following attacks on the allied Greek city of Massalia (Marseille).
67 BC - Creta et Cyrenae; Cyrenaica was bequeathed to Rome in 78 BC. However, it was not organised as a province. It was incorporated into the province of Creta et Cyrenae when Crete was annexed in 67 BC.
63 BC - Pontus et Bithynia; the Kingdom of Bithynia (in North-western Anatolia - Turkey) was bequeathed to Rome by its last king, Nicomedes IV in 74 BC. It was organised as a Roman province at the end of the Third Mithridatic War (73-63 BC) by Pompey who incorporated the eastern part of the defeated Kingdom of Pontus into it in 63 BC.
63 BC - Syria; Pompey annexed Syria at the end of the Third Mithridatic War.
58 BC - Cilicia et Cyprus; Cilicia was created as a province in the sense of area of military command in 102 BC in a campaign against piracy. The Romans controlled only a small area. In 74 BC Lycia and Pamphylia (to the east) were added to the smal Roman possessions in Cilicia. Cilicia came fully under Roman control towards the end of the Third Mithridatic War - 73-63 BC. The province was reorganised by Pompey in 63 BC. Cyprus was annexed and added to this province in 58 BC.
46 BC - Africa Nova (eastern Numidia - Algeria), Julius Caesar annexed eastern Numidia and the new province called Africa Nova (new Africa) to distinguish it from the older province of Africa, which become known as Africa Vetus (Old Africa).

</p><p>From c300 BCE "Although the pontiffs continued to be extremely important as expert interpreters of the law, both before and after the passage of the Ogulnian Law, Cn. Flavius's actions [publication of the legis actiones and the legal calendar] simply removed any lingering pretense that the patrician college of pontiffs exercised a monopolistic control of the civil law. Like the increase in number of priests responsible for consulting the Sibylline Books in 368 B.C., this augmentation resulted from the fact that in Roman aristocratic culture these prominent priesthoods were viewed as being akin to public magistracies and as bestowing similar status and prestige. Roman society was becoming increasingly secularized, Roman religion was coming more and more under the influence of Greek culture, and these two trends were seriously eroding the traditional patrician claim to special expert religious knowledge. High-ranking plebeians, who were peers of the most prominent patricians in every other way, were eager to become members of these exclusive religious clubs and thereby to top off their public careers with the added distinction of a priestly office."<sup id="cite_ref-637" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-637">[637]</a></sup>

The Greeks observed the practice with some astonishment. [...] Extension of citizen privileges to communities and peoples within Italy was generous but not startling. A similar generosity toward slaves stood in a different category. The large majority of slaves acquired in this period came from abroad, prisoners of war reduced to servitude or captives purchased on the slave mart. [...] Whatever the motives, [...] the fact of frequent manumission is notable and meaningful. The ready entrance of freedmen into the citizen body signified a level of comfort with foreigners that was unmatched elsewhere in the classical world. What counts here is not liberality or generosity, but the presumption that citizenship could be shared by those of alien birth. Assimilation to Roman ways sufficed to authorize the award of full civic privileges. Romans evidently did not worry about diluting the purity of the stock. Nor did they balk at the exercise of political rights by those whose roots lay in Spain, Cilicia, or Syria. Numbers cannot be ascertained. But the citizenry plainly swelled substantially through the absorption of former slaves. Augustus eventually put on the brake - but not on racial grounds.

<dd> <b>♠ Ideological thought equates men and women ♣ absent ♥</b> "To begin with, until fairly late in Roman history, women lacked individual names in the proper sense. Claudia, Julia, Cornelia, Lucretia, are merely family names with a feminine ending. Sisters had the same name and could be distinguished only by the addition of `the elder' or `the younger', `the first' or `the second', and so on. In the not uncommon case of marriage between paternal cousins, mother and daughter would have the same name, too. No doubt this was very confusing: a welcome confusion, one is tempted to suggest, since nothing could have been easier to eliminate. No great genius was needed to think up the idea of giving every girl a personal name, as was done with boys. It is as if the Romans wished to suggest very pointedly that women were not, or ought not to be, genuine individuals but only fractions of a family. Anonymous and passive fractions at that, for the virtues which were stressed were decorum, chastity, gracefulness, even temper and childbearing. They loved their husbands, to be sure--though we need not believe everything that husbands said when their wives were dead--but as one loves an overlord who is free to seek his pleasures elsewhere and to put an end to the relationship altogether when and if he so chooses. [...] Save for relatively minor exceptions, a woman was always in the power of some man--of her paterfamilias or of her husband or of a guardian. In early times every marriage involved a formal ceremony in which the bride was surrendered to her husband by the paterfamilias: he `gave her away' in the literal sense. Then, when so-called `free' marriages became increasingly common--free from the ancient formalities, that is, not free in the sense that the wife or her husband had made a free choice of partner ± she remained legally in the power of her paterfamilias. [...] It would probably be a safe guess that women of the lower classes were therefore more `emancipated', more equal de facto if not in strict law, more widely accepted as persons in their own right than their richer, more bourgeois, or more aristocratic sisters. This is a common enough phe- nomenon everywhere. No doubt they were freer in all senses ± far less inhibited by legal definitions of marriage or legitimacy, less bound by the double standard of sexual morality." <sup id="cite_ref-768" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-768">[768]</a></sup></dd>

The assertions of leaders and the writings of intellectuals regularly affirmed their distinctiveness. A contrast with other peoples loomed large in the development of a self-perception. The history of Rome had, after all, taken shape in a setting that involved confrontations with other cultures right from the start. [...] Stereotypes abound.

The Greeks observed the practice with some astonishment. [...] Extension of citizen privileges to communities and peoples within Italy was generous but not startling. A similar generosity toward slaves stood in a different category. The large majority of slaves acquired in this period came from abroad, prisoners of war reduced to servitude or captives purchased on the slave mart. [...] Whatever the motives, [...] the fact of frequent manumission is notable and meaningful. The ready entrance of freedmen into the citizen body signified a level of comfort with foreigners that was unmatched elsewhere in the classical world. What counts here is not liberality or generosity, but the presumption that citizenship could be shared by those of alien birth. Assimilation to Roman ways sufficed to authorize the award of full civic privileges. Romans evidently did not worry about diluting the purity of the stock. Nor did they balk at the exercise of political rights by those whose roots lay in Spain, Cilicia, or Syria. Numbers cannot be ascertained. But the citizenry plainly swelled substantially through the absorption of former slaves. Augustus eventually put on the brake - but not on racial grounds.

<dd> <b>♠ Ideological thought distinguishes men and women ♣ present ♥</b> "To begin with, until fairly late in Roman history, women lacked individual names in the proper sense. Claudia, Julia, Cornelia, Lucretia, are merely family names with a feminine ending. Sisters had the same name and could be distinguished only by the addition of `the elder' or `the younger', `the first' or `the second', and so on. In the not uncommon case of marriage between paternal cousins, mother and daughter would have the same name, too. No doubt this was very confusing: a welcome confusion, one is tempted to suggest, since nothing could have been easier to eliminate. No great genius was needed to think up the idea of giving every girl a personal name, as was done with boys. It is as if the Romans wished to suggest very pointedly that women were not, or ought not to be, genuine individuals but only fractions of a family. Anonymous and passive fractions at that, for the virtues which were stressed were decorum, chastity, gracefulness, even temper and childbearing. They loved their husbands, to be sure--though we need not believe everything that husbands said when their wives were dead--but as one loves an overlord who is free to seek his pleasures elsewhere and to put an end to the relationship altogether when and if he so chooses. [...] Save for relatively minor exceptions, a woman was always in the power of some man--of her paterfamilias or of her husband or of a guardian. In early times every marriage involved a formal ceremony in which the bride was surrendered to her husband by the paterfamilias: he `gave her away' in the literal sense. Then, when so-called `free' marriages became increasingly common--free from the ancient formalities, that is, not free in the sense that the wife or her husband had made a free choice of partner ± she remained legally in the power of her paterfamilias. [...] It would probably be a safe guess that women of the lower classes were therefore more `emancipated', more equal de facto if not in strict law, more widely accepted as persons in their own right than their richer, more bourgeois, or more aristocratic sisters. This is a common enough phe- nomenon everywhere. No doubt they were freer in all senses ± far less inhibited by legal definitions of marriage or legitimacy, less bound by the double standard of sexual morality." <sup id="cite_ref-774" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-774">[774]</a></sup></dd>

They valued marriage and marital harmony, but the striking fact is that only one surviving author of the Roman empire, Musonius Rufus, made an unambiguously (p. 681) strong case for sexually exclusive marriage. Plutarch, in his Advice to the Bride and Groom, ultimately urged women to bear a husband’s escapades lightly. The Roman model of marriage simply did not demand sexual exclusivity from men. To call it a double standard is to trivialize the problem. The Greeks and Romans operated with a dual standard, two patently different sets of expectations in sexual behavior. This pattern was rooted in social structure. Female chastity was enforced in the name of ensuring patrimonial legitimacy. While men were viciously punished for violating free women, they were permitted to use dishonored women—prostitutes, concubines, and slaves—as sexual partners. Public law reinforced the system by protecting the sexual honor of respectable women and exposing dishonored women to the remainder of male desire. Salvian complained that Roman policy amounted to “forbidding adulteries, building brothels.” The average age at marriage strengthened the dual standard, with men entering marriage nearly a decade after sexual maturity. Young men were simply assumed to enter marriage with sexual experience. Married men also enjoyed sexual freedom with slaves and prostitutes, since adultery was determined by the status of the woman involved.150 Flagrant excess was poor form, but hardly damnable." <sup id="cite_ref-778" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-778">[778]</a></sup>

This statement may seem to be a truism, but it actually expresses the two fundamental features of Roman religion: that the Roman religious system concerned itself primarily with the health of the Roman community, and that it was a religion of place. The primary purpose of the public religious system was to protect and enhance the community of the Romans; the modern notion of a separation of church and state would have been unthinkable to the Romans. The welfare of the city and its inhabitants was ensured by a series of rituals by which the Romans attempted to secure the goodwill of the gods, and the primary role of the religious authorities in Rome was to ensure that these rituals were performed in the proper way, at their proper time, and in their proper place. The second point follows from the first: Roman rituals were performed in specific places around the city of Rome in order to protect the city.

<dl><dd><b>♠ charity ♣ {present; absent} ♥</b> Roman attitudes to charity were rather complex--a comprehensive summary may be found in Parkin <sup id="cite_ref-780" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-780">[780]</a></sup>--of which the following is an extract. "Cicero and Seneca are perhaps our most forthcoming sources on private pagan charity, and some of their comments look at first glance very promising for this enquiry. Cicero says that if one has money, it should be used for good deeds - beneficentia - and generosity - liberalitas - through which one may win fame and the love of the masses (amor multitudinis). However, so that money is not wasted, it must be given only to suitable (idonei), needy (indigentes, tenuiores, inopes) people, and in a measured way (Off. 1.68, 2.36-7, 2.52-5, 2.61-2, 2.69). Seneca claims to help a needy person, an egens or pauper (Clem. 2.6.2; Ben. 4.10.4-5; Ep. 120.2), and says that he expects no other return than gratitude, and that it satisfies him to do what is necessary: he calls such giving a social act, a socialis res (Ben. 3.8.3, 4.10.5, 4.11.1, 5.11.5). On closer examination, however, it quickly becomes clear that the ‘needy’ in question in both Cicero and Seneca’s thought are respectable citizens, and not the most desperate members of their society. Seneca advocates giving to a poor man <i>of worth</i>, who will be grateful, where a rich man may not. Cicero provides more detailed guidelines: the worthy should be virtuous and respectful, should have a special relationship with the giver, and should give a return. This is the semiotics of patronage. Indeed, Seneca makes this explicit: tossing a beggar a coin does not constitute a beneficium. [...] Liberality, doing good works and mercy (liberalitas, beneficentia and clementia) feature among the Roman virtues, and are symptoms of the much-prized humanitas. Misericordia, or pity, however, is more complicated and was not always portrayed as a positive characteristic. The Stoics, in particular, saw in it sickness and disturbance of the soul. Their ethics dictated that the wise man was to feel no pain over the misfortunes of his neighbour, for pity brings grief. [...] The influence of the harsh Stoic attitude to emotion is more evident in Seneca’s writing, in which we find obedient acknowledgement that pity is the error of a weak soul, which is brought low by the sight of a stranger’s misery (Clem. 2.5.1, cf. 2.6.4). Seneca elaborates: pity comes from the sight of misery and misfortune which has happened to people who do not deserve it (Clem. 2.5.4). The wise man does not experience this weakness, but gives alms to the anonymous poor in the street and is as ready to help as someone who feels pity (cf. Cic. Tusc. 4.43-57; Acad. 2.44.135; Sen. De Ira 1.9.2). This is an important statement. Not only does Seneca by implication advocate almsgiving whilst rejecting that such acts must necessarily be the consequence of pity, but he also implies that other, less enlightened, people do give to beggars out of pity.8 So it seems that Seneca and, to a lesser extent, Cicero prize moral principles which are not necessarily in step with the charitable practices of their society.9 Indeed, the Stoics’ stern rejection of pity and other human emotions earned them criticism from other ancient thinkers. Many people, Seneca has to admit, consider pity to be a virtue (Clem. 2.4.4).</dd>

<p><b>♠ Human sacrifice ♣ 3:133-81 BCE; 0:81-31 BCE ♥</b> Human sacrifice was forbidden by Rome, but as a legal matter; unclear if religious doctrine, such as it was, had anything to say on the matter of human sacrifice specifically. "By the late Republic, magic was brought under an earlier general law on murder and poisoning, the lex Cornelia desicariis et veneficiis of 81 B.C. The category of venenum, which included both poisoning and magic, caught the magician who was, in the words of Apuleius, 'popularly believed to hold discourse with the immortal gods and thus to have the power to do everything he wanted by the mysterious force of certain incantations.' The precise wording of the law does not survive, but we have a late third or early fourth Century A. D. commentary on it: impious and nocturnal rites indicated magical practices; rites involving human sacrifice were illegal, as were rites that enchanted, bewitched or bound anyone. Human sacrifice was thought characteristic of magic. In the imperial period such a ritual was regarded as a monstrous perversion of legitimate animal sacrifice, and so utterly 'foreign'; the Roman authorities sought to eradicate it, whether performed by Roman Citizens or by others.74 Their actions against the Druids provide a clear example both of their increasingly stringent moves against human sacrifice, and also of the extension of the category of magic (as it became defined by this particular form of perverted ritual). The first stage, under Augustus, was a prohibition on the cult for Roman Citizens; then the cult was proscribed in the Gallic provinces themselves." <sup id="cite_ref-787" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-787">[787]</a></sup>

(The earlier sacrifice occurred in 228 BCE when the Gauls were invading, and a later one apparently occurred ca. 114 after another military defeat in Illyria (see Gary Forsythe, A Critical History of Early Rome, pp 331-2). Pliny the Elder (28.3) also writes: 'Our own age even has seen a man and a woman buried alive in the Ox Market, Greeks by birth, or else natives of some other country with which we were at war at the time. The prayer used upon the occasion of this ceremonial, and which is usually pronounced first by the Master of the College of the Quindecimviri, if read by a person, must assuredly force him to admit the potency of [prayer] formulæ; when it is recollected that it has been proved to be effectual by the experience of eight hundred and thirty years.'" <sup id="cite_ref-788" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-788">[788]</a></sup> "Eckstein (1982) has demonstrated that on at least three later occasions the Romans buried male and female Greek and Gallic couples alive in the Forum Boarium to insure against military defeat and the capture of the city.

The second occasion was in 216 B.C., in the aftermath of Hannibal’s defeat of the Romans at Cannae and the ensuing defection of many of Rome’s allies.

The meal has been interpreted as a symbolic compensation to doomed victims or as a ritual device to turn lowly, vile human sacrificial victims into worthy, noble sacrifices.37 Since the banquet was offered to all victims (gladiators, bestiarii, and even Christian noxii), it seems to have been retained as an archaic remnant, and as such it recalls the originally horizontal status of all arena victims.38 Like the ambiguous love/hate dynamics of Aztec sacrifices or Greek scapegoat rituals (discussed in ch. 4 below), this was a traditional preparation of generic victims, not a privilege acquired by professional gladiators over time." <sup id="cite_ref-798" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-798">[798]</a></sup> "While munera were prominent in the age in which Christianity emerged, the killing in public of humans, supposedly as a duty or offering to the spirit of the dead, at a funeral at Rome is not attested until 264 BC. Even if the early, private funeral munus required human life, the gladiatorial munus was not a regular part of the official festival calendar until the late first century BC. The gladiatorial munus was not purely a secular event, but human sacrifice in the arena was not a traditional element of official Roman religion."<sup id="cite_ref-799" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-799">[799]</a></sup> "Dynasts, and soon emperors, put on grander and more complex shows, using funeral and triumphal honors and the festival calendar as excuses. By the late first century BC Rome had what might be called ‘conglomerate spectacles’, what Ville calls munera legitima, multi-dimensional entertainments combining any or all of the once distinct elements discussed above. Different events were held in sequence throughout the day: venationes in the morning gave way to meridiani, the midday games - essentially executions - and munera followed in the afternoon.105 Such conglomerate spectacles conflated pretexts (e.g. funerals, victory ludi, magisterial duty, electoral largesse, hunts, public banquets, patronage, punishment, vengeance) and were soon institutionalized by autocracy. From the circus to the theater, formerly separate elements continued in combination, with violence as the common mortar." <sup id="cite_ref-800" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-800">[800]</a></sup> "In origin rituals of piety, punishment, or reassurance, spectacles of death, through expansion and recurrence, became ritualized entertainment.94 On the decline of morality after 146 owing to excessive prosperity, Florus (1.47.10, Loeb) says that the excessive size of slave establishments led to Servile Wars: ‘How else could those armies of gladiators have risen against their masters, save that a profuse expenditure, which aimed at winning the common people by indulging their love of shows, had turned what was originally a method of punishing enemies into a competition of skill (supplicia quondam hostium artem faceret)?’ In other words, politics turned damned victims into performers. Pliny tells us that Gaius Terentius Lucanus, who celebrated his grandfather’s death with a show of thirty pairs in the Forum in the second half of the second century, began the practice of publicly exhibiting commissioned pictures of gladiatorial shows.95 Displays were effective. In 122 Gaius Gracchus, seeking popular support as tribune, took down the barriers built around an arena in the Forum for a gladiatorial show and opened spectatorship without payment to all Romans.96 Politicians responded to the Romans’ desire to watch gladiators, and punitive performances in spectacles developed a hierarchy of craft or entertainment value." <sup id="cite_ref-801" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-801">[801]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b>♠ bravery ♣ present ♥</b> "Courage was fundamental, the essential foundation to any aristocrat’s struggle for eminence, ‘‘nearly the most important thing in every state,’’ Polybius reported, ‘‘but especially in Rome’’ (Polyb. 31.29.1). Those whose accomplishments on the battlefield won them renown were recognized as the Republic’s natural leaders, a connection made explicit in the aftermath of Cannae. Losses in that disaster and prior reverses had so depleted the ranks of the Senate that a special effort had to be undertaken to replenish its membership. The men selected were, first, those who had held various minor public offices, then ‘‘those who had spoils taken from the enemy on display in their homes or who had been decorated for saving the life of a citizen in combat’’ (Livy 23.23.5-6; see also Chapters 16 and 24). The civic crown, a wreath of oak leaves awarded for saving a citizen’s life, was bestowed for an act of exceptional gallantry: one had not only to save another’s life but slay the enemy threatening him without giving ground in the fight (Gell. NA 6.5.13). Likewise a young aristocrat won spoils by stripping the enemy he killed in individual combat in a duel or in the general meˆle ́e of battle (Gell. NA 2.11.3). This principle extended to all the decorations for valor awarded to soldiers; they bespoke courage in circumstances when there was no need to endanger one’s life, bravery ‘‘above and beyond the call of duty,’’ in other words. Worn in religious processions, they formed an important element in one’s public image (Polyb. 6.39.1-10; see also Chapter 13). Renown (gloria) seen in the visible tokens of one’s courage and heard in others’ praise of one’s exploits (laus) paved the way to public office, at least initially. [...] Superior courage in combat thus set some men apart from others and fit them to lead. As such, it served as a central element within the system of values that justified the dominance of the Republic’s upper class. Outstanding valor was thought to have accumulated in certain families, so that over time their descendants came to be viewed as having a greater store of it than others and hence a greater claim on public offices and positions of leadership." <sup id="cite_ref-840" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-840">[840]</a></sup></dd>

They were maintained, essentially unchanged, as maximum rates during the imperial time right down to the 6th century... Justinian, under the influence of Christianity, was not favourably disposed towards the charging of interest. He tightened the usury laws and reduced the ordinary maximum rate to 6% and to 4% for senators. A special concession was made to those 'qui ergasteriis praesunt vel aliquam licitam negotiationem gerunt': they could charge up to 8%. Regarding policy, it is interesting to see that the problem of usury was tackled in Roman law by way of penal sanctions."<sup id="cite_ref-859" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-859">[859]</a></sup>   "Bankers appear at Rome in the late fourth century BCE, the institution having been imported from the Greek world where banks had existed since the fifth century. Romans occasionally appointed public bankers (i.e. the quinqueviri mensarii in 352 BCE and the triumviri mensarii 216 BCE) to deal with emergencies but their responsibilities and capabilities seem to have been quite limited. Argentarri (private bankers) assayed and changed money, but also accepted deposits, made payments on behalf of clients and came to have an important role at auctions where they provided credit to buyers. Nummularii were active in Italy by the end of the second century, but confined their activities to assaying and money changing until well into the imperial period. Barlow argues that 'a tremendous expansion of Roman banking and moneylending' began in the late second century BCE. Coactores argentarii ('deposit bankers') appear early in the first century, as did the tessarae nummulariae which may have facilitated the long-distance transport of coinage.

This entire nexus of the comitia centuriata, census, tribal organization, and state taxation was attributed to King Servius Tullius by the ancient tradition."<sup id="cite_ref-955" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-955">[955]</a></sup> "In the earliest days of the Republic Rome's taxes were quite modest, consisting mainy of a wealth tax on all forms of property, including land, houses, slaves, animals, money and personal effects. The basic rate was just .01 percent, although occasionally rising to .03 percent. It was assessed principally to pay the army during war. In fact, afterwards the tax was often rebated (Jones 1974: 161).

It is worth nothing that this law was passed by the Roman army at Sutrium, the Latin colony on Rome's Etruscan frontier.
