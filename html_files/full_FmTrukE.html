<p><b> ♠ Duration  ♣ 1775-1886 CE ♥ </b> 'Chuuk was settled by the first century A.D. In the fourteenth century, a cult center was established on Moen Island. It was abandoned in the eighteenth century following a fresh immigration from neighboring atolls. Japan replaced Germany as the ruling power in World War I and was in turn replaced by the United States under United Nations Trusteeship in 1945. In 1986 Chuuk and its surrounding atolls became a state within the newly independent Federated States of Micronesia. Protestant missionaries and traders came in the 1880s and Roman Catholic missionaries after 1900. Japan sought to develop Chuuk economically and introduced elementary education in Japanese. Education was much expanded under American administration, and many Chuukese learned English. Some went to college in Guam, Hawaii, and the United States mainland. The American administration introduced representative government.' <sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ quasi-polity ♥ </b> Traditionally, authority did not extend beyond the atoll and was shared among multiple chiefs on one island. Chuuk was somewhat more fragmented than other Micronesian societies: 'Throughout most of Micronesia the maximum independent autonomous political unit was the high island or the atoll, often subdivided into more than one polity. At the time of European contact, Satawan Atoll in the Mortlocks had four separate communities, each with its own leader, which sometimes fought one another. Palau had two confederations of villages or districts, each independent of the other, and the villages themselves had considerable autonomy. Pohnpei had five petty states, although traditions of a unified rule for the whole island are apparent from an earlier period. Chuuk was extremely fragmented politically, with several independent communities on each of the six larger high islands. The Marshalls and the Gilberts had larger polities and integrated groups of separate atolls under a high chief; these expansionist states achieved their fullest development after the introduction of firearms by Europeans.' <sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none ♥ </b> SCCS variable 84 'Higher Political Organization' is coded 'Absent', not 'Peace group', 'Alliances', 'Confederation', 'International organization'. Truk was in contact with other islands, although the specifics of these connections are not always known: 'The Trukic-speaking people of the Mortlock Islands still maintained active trading links with Puluwat, the Hall Islands, Truk, Nukuoro, and Ngatik when they were studied by Girschner (1912:181-183). They had made voyages to Ponape up to about two generations earlier, and the names of the last navigators to make them were still remembered. These atolls were the obvious conduit by which information and ideas must have come from Ponape to Truk. Ponapean influence on the Mortlocks and, by extension, on Truk is evident in the number of clan names that echo Ponapean names and titles. 24 The Mortlock Islanders also echo Ponapean practice regarding honorific titles in their use of the prefix sowu- ‘lord, master of’ for chiefly lineages, a practice that was not picked up in Truk for local chiefly lineages, but is reflected in the titles of the legendary island overlords, such as Sowuwóóniiras, Sowufa, and Sowumwáár.' <sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> 'In the light of evidence now available, then, it seems most reasonable to conclude that the cult of Kachaw was introduced into Truk via the Mortlock Islands from Ponape (see the discussion of this possibility by King and Parker [1984:254-256]). Whether its introduction was the work of Ponapeans in alliance with Mortlock Islanders or of Mortlock Islanders with Ponapean connections we cannot now say.' <sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> We have assumed that no permanent alliances were present in what appears to be the period of regional disintegration that this sheet covers. However, oral traditions and archeological evidence indicate that the Chuuk islands experienced a higher degree of regional integration prior to the 18th century: 'I mention the foregoing in order to show that the present political and learned traditions of Truk derive from a set of older institutions, which they still echo. These institutions involved the political domination of Truk by a presumably immigrant clan whose patron god was Sowukachaw, for whom a shrine was maintained on Achaw Peak, the spiritual seat and source of supernatural power of that dominant clan. A dual system of titles, perhaps not unlike that in Ponape, may have been a feature of the organization of rank and authority, providing the basis for a subsequent division of Truk into the rival political and magico-religious leagues of immediate precolonial times. Truk and Ponape were not the only places in Micronesia to have a cult that associated kingship or high chiefship with a thunder god and basaltic stone. Mention has already been made of the sacred basaltic stones at Nan Moadol on Ponape and the association of one of them with the god of thunder. Basaltic peaks on Ponape were spirit places, and basaltic monoliths the abodes of spirits. This association of basalt with spirits appears [Page 561] even in the Marshall Islands. On Namu and Aur atolls, there were shrines with basaltic stones on them at the places of origin of the clans of paramount chiefs (Finsch 1893:396). The one on Namu, thrown into the sea by a zealous missionary, embodied a clan’s founder (Pollock 1977; Erdland 1914:345); and according to Erdland (1914:343), the totem of the high chiefly clan on Ebon was the thunder, Läköta (‘Sir Cloud’, see ļa- and kōd¸o in Abo et al. 1976). From Ngatik, near Ponape, the Bishop Museum has in its possession an old photograph of an altar. On top of it, according to a notation, is the “stone god,” from its appearance a block of basalt.' <sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> The Spanish were present in Micronesia from the 16th century onwards, but did not govern the Chuuk islands directly: 'Micronesia has a complicated colonial history. Guam, the southernmost of the Mariana Islands, became the first inhabited Pacific island to be visited by a European when the Portuguese navigator and explorer Ferdinand Magellan landed there in 1521. The Marianas became the first European colony in Micronesia in 1668, when Spain took control of the island chain. In 1670 the indigenous Chamorro people rebelled, and a quarter century of sporadic warfare followed. That conflict, along with diseases introduced by Europeans, reduced the local population from about 100,000 to 4,000. Most of the survivors were relocated to colonial settlements, and many Chamorro women married Spanish or Filipino troops. In the process, much of Chamorro culture was destroyed, although the language continued to be widely spoken in the early 21st century. Other nations that staked colonial claims in various parts of Micronesia included Germany, Britain, the United States, Japan, and Australia.' <sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>

<dd> <b> ♠ Linguistic family  ♣ Oceanic-Austronesian ♥ </b> 'Although it is clear that people first settled Micronesia about 3,500 to 2,000 years ago, archaeological investigations there have been limited by the difficulty of excavating on small densely populated islands whose landscape has often been disturbed by storms. As a result, language rather than archaeology has provided the most insight into the history of early settlement. For example, the languages of eastern and central Micronesia are closely related to Austronesian languages that exist to the southeast in Melanesia. The languages spoken in the west, specifically those of Palau, the Marianas, and Yap, are closely related neither to those in the east nor to one another. These islands on the western edge of Micronesia seem to have been settled from the Philippines and Indonesia. The large number of mutually unintelligible Micronesian languages is a sign of the region’s great cultural diversity. The following islands have mutually unintelligible languages: Nauru, the Gilberts, the Marshalls, Kosrae, Pingelap, Mokil, Pohnpei, Ngatik, the Mortlocks, Chuuk, the Puluwat area, the Woleai area, Yap, Palau, and the Marianas. The languages of the islands from the Marshalls and the Gilberts through the Woleai area in the above list appear to be more closely related to each other than to the remaining languages and have been referred to as “nuclear Micronesian.” The languages of Palau, Yap, and the Marianas are relatively distinct from each other and from other Micronesian languages, although they are clearly Austronesian in their general affiliation. The Chamorro language, spoken in the Marianas, has undergone much influence from Spanish and probably also from the Philippine Tagalog language after more than four centuries of Western contact.' <sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup></dd>

On the high islands, people also wanted access to lagoons, although easily defensible sites were sometimes preferred, such as the tops of steep cleared slopes.' <sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup> 'In aboriginal times there used to be associated with most lineages a dwelling house, jimw. This house varied in size depending on the number of its inhabitants. Since married men normally went to live in the jimw of their wives’ lineages, the occupants of an jimw were the women of a lineage and their husbands. The only males of the lineage who resided there were boys below puberty. A large jimw was usually partitioned off into sleeping compartments along its side walls under the eaves, one for each married woman and her husband with their small children, and a separate one for the unmarried girls past puberty. The house had a sand floor spread over with coconut fronds. Its occupants slept and sat on mats plaited from pandanus leaves. The central part of the house formed a sort of living room in which minor cooking was done over an open fire, ordinary meals were taken, and where the members of the household whiled away the time before going to bed.' <sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> 'Not all houses were of this type, for some were much smaller, without partitions, and were occupied by only one or two couples. Such houses were used when a lineage had only a few women, or when a man brought his wife to live on his own land instead of going to live in her lineage household. In the latter case it was customary to build a separate house for the man and wife, since it is normally taboo for a man to sleep in the same house with his sisters. A small house might also be built alongside the main one if the latter became too crowded.' <sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup> The settlement pattern became more concentrated in the colonial period, with households merging into villages: 'Chuuk was divided into small districts, each consisting of a small island or a wedge-shaped segment of a larger one. Not clustered into villages, households were scattered on rising land back from the shore. With population growth many of the once looser neighborhoods have become more densely settled villages. Land holdings were scattered.' <sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup> 'The old, large lineage house is in little use today. The Trukese now live in smaller houses of the old type or in new-style houses, raised on posts and built of planks with corrugated iron roofs. These smaller houses are still occupied by the women of a lineage, either singly or in pairs, and are clustered together either by lineage or by descent line. [Page 68] Thus the old pattern of organization is still maintained even though the physical arrangement has been somewhat modified.' <sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup> Land was held by individuals as well as lineages: 'Land was held privately both by individuals and matrilineal, corporate descent groups. Rights in undeveloped space, productive soil, trees and gardens were separable. When soil and breadfruit trees were given in grant, the grantor retained residual rights and the grantee acquired provisional rights. Grantors and grantees could be either individuals or corporations. Full rights went to the survivor on the death or extinction of the other.' <sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup>

<p>The Chuukese/Trukese were divided into multiple clans and lineages: 'Chuuk's population is divided into a number of dispersed, matrilineal clans. Within any one district the several lineages are usually but not always of different clans. There are also personal kindreds. As a principle of clan and lineage membership, descent is matrilineal, but otherwise kinship is reckoned bilaterally.' <sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup> 'The domestic unit was an extended family, based on the women of a lineage or sublineage. It consisted of at least one experienced older woman and two more younger women of childbearing age together with their husbands. Unmarried sons and brothers slept apart in their lineage's meeting house. Extended family households continued through the periods of foreign administration.' <sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup> District chiefs were chosen from the dominant lineage of an area: 'In each district the lineage with title to its space held the chiefship. The several lineages with full or residual title to plots of soil had full residential rights. Lineages with only provisional titles to plots of soil in grant from other lineages had only conditional residential rights. Lineages with full residential rights maintained symbolic hearths where, with their client lineages, they prepared food to present to the chief in recognition of his lineage's ownership of the space.' <sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup> 'A district chiefship was divided between the oldest man in the senior female line in the chiefly lineage and the oldest man in the lineage generally. The latter was executive chief, or "chief of talk," and the former symbolic chief, or "chief of food." Food presentations were made to the symbolic chief. Sometimes the symbolic and executive functions fell to the same individual; often they did not. The symbolic chief was surrounded by his lineage brothers and by his sons, who acted as his agents. These followers and his sisters and daughters were of chiefly rank, distinct from commoners. Through conquest, a lineage might gain the chiefship in more than one district and establish a junior branch as the chiefly lineage in the conquered district. The now subordinate district rendered food presentations to the superordinate one. Most districts were linked in two rival leagues based on competing schools of magic and ritual relating to war, politics, and rhetoric. A chief's authority derived from two things. His lineage's ownership of the district's space entitled him to presentations of first fruits at stated times of the year. More importantly, it gave him authority over the conservation and use of the district's food resources. His authority also derived from his connection with the sky world, its gods, and their superhuman power to accomplish purposes. There was, therefore, a degree of sacredness associated with chiefs.' <sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup> Traditionally, authority did not extend beyond the atoll and was shared among multiple chiefs on one island. Chuuk was somewhat more fragmented than other Micronesian societies: 'Throughout most of Micronesia the maximum independent autonomous political unit was the high island or the atoll, often subdivided into more than one polity. At the time of European contact, Satawan Atoll in the Mortlocks had four separate communities, each with its own leader, which sometimes fought one another. Palau had two confederations of villages or districts, each independent of the other, and the villages themselves had considerable autonomy. Pohnpei had five petty states, although traditions of a unified rule for the whole island are apparent from an earlier period. Chuuk was extremely fragmented politically, with several independent communities on each of the six larger high islands. The Marshalls and the Gilberts had larger polities and integrated groups of separate atolls under a high chief; these expansionist states achieved their fullest development after the introduction of firearms by Europeans.' <sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup> There was a degree of differentiation between chiefs and ritual specialists: 'No regular religious duties were attached to the chief’s office. They were performed, instead, by various specialists. A chief was concerned, however, that the proper specialists [Page 144] engage in their respective activities at appropriate times, at least when the welfare of the entire district was involved. He also used to set the times for dances, which were a popular form of entertainment before the missionaries banned them.' <sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup> We have assumed that the institution of district chief predates the colonial period.

</p><p>'Ritual practices were conducted by their own specialists. They included spirit mediums, breadfruit summoners, fish summoners, healers, masters of spells, masters of sorcery, builders, navigators, diviners, and most importantly the masters of magic and ritual relating to war and politics.

Ritual was also associated with divination, curing, warfare, political meetings, house building, and courtship.' <sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup> Mediums communicated with the dead: 'In traditional belief, spirit beings were widely distributed in the sky, under the sea, and on land. The important places among spirit lands in the sky were: a region under the dome of Heaven, home of the gods who could take human form; a region in the south from which came all the plant and marine life that gave people food; and a region named 'Achaw' or 'Kachaw,' abode of the ancestors of many Chuukese clans and particularly of the clans associated with the chiefship and the special bodies of magical lore from which chiefly power derived. Spirits could accomplish their intentions at will and were thus the source of all that was MANAMAN (mana), such as efficacious spells, medicines, and rituals. Good souls of the dead were consulted through mediums. The Chuukese also invoked in spells the spirits inhabiting the dome of Heaven, presided over by 'Great Spirit,' and the spirits associated with particular crafts and major bodies of lore.' <sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup> Diviners, Healers, and Mediums were involved in the treatment of illness: 'Sickness was believed to result from the 'bite' of a malevolent spirit, or of any other spirit one had offended or that was controlled by a ritual specialist one had offended or by a sorcerer. Sickness might also result from soul loss. In all but the latter case, treatment involved the use of medicines to be applied externally, to be drunk, or to be inhaled. For soul loss, a spirit medium was consulted to help find and restore the soul. Divination was used as a diagnostic aid in cases of severe or prolonged illness. Massage was used to treat bruises, local infections, and muscle ailments.' <sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup> Diviners accepted payments from apprentices in exchange for secret knowledge: 'There are systems of knowledge which are subject to special rules of their own. [Page 56] For example, to learn knot divination a pupil must pay the diviner ( sowupwe) even if the latter is his own father or mother’s brother. An jitag (a sort of lawyer, general, diplomat and orator all rolled into one, who occupies the most prestigeful position in Trukese society) is alleged never to teach his own children as much as he teaches his sister’s children. This contention does not, however, appear to be supported by the genealogical connections of the past jitag of Romonum Island. Despite special rules governing specific forms of incorporeal property, their over-all organization is analogous to that of corporeal property and does not require a new conceptual framework to make them intelligible.' <sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup> Spirit mediums were an exception to this rule, as their expertise did not rely on knowledge per se: 'All religious practitioners as well as craftsmen and magicians are owners of the knowledge necessary to exercise their specialties. The Trukese make no distinction between them and other skilled personnel. There is one important exception to this rule, the spirit medium ( wäättwa or wään ëny). His (or her) position is not based on knowledge so much as on having been possessed by a spirit. This spirit is in no way classed as the medium’s property, nor can it be inherited automatically by a son or lineage mate. The position of a spirit medium, therefore, is different from that of a property holder, except as he uses his abilities to diagnose illness.' <sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup> The Chuuk islands experienced a higher degree of regional ceremonial integration prior to the 18th century (see above under 'preceding quasi-polity').

<p>There were no troops or police forces in the native system: 'There were no police. A chief's brothers or sons might act on his behalf to intimidate or attack someone who had offended him. But it was control of magical power, either by the chief or one his brothers or sons, that made improper conduct liable to punishment. Major craft specialists could also make ill those who violated the taboos of their craft. Finally, members of chiefly lineages and their close associates were likely to have knowledge of sorcery. All such knowledge gave punitive power to chiefs and important specialists. People stressed maintaining the appearance of propriety in behavior so as not to give just cause for offense.' <sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup> Prior to 'pacification', violent conflict played out in raids and battles between rival groups of armed men: 'Within districts, conflict arose over land, succession to chiefship, theft, adultery, and avenging homicide. Between districts, it arose over attentions to local women by outside men, the status of one district as subordinate to another, and rights of access to fishing areas. Formal procedures for terminating conflict between districts involved payments of valuables and land by the loosing to the winning side. Fighting involved surprise raids and prearranged meetings on a field of battle. Principle weapons were slings, spears, and clubs. Firearms, introduced late in the nineteenth century, were confiscated by German authorities in 1903. Martial arts included an elaborate system of throws and holds by which an unarmed man could kill, maim or disarm an armed opponent.' <sup id="cite_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup> Competition between rival chiefs over the control of land and people was a major factor: 'Traditional Micronesian life was characterized by a belief in the stability of society and culture. People suffered occasional natural disasters, such as cyclones or droughts, but their goal after encountering one of these was to reconstitute the previous state of affairs. Wars occurred in most areas from time to time, mainly at the instigation of competing chiefs. At stake was the control of land—a limited resource—and followers, but there were usually few casualties. Living in small communities on small territories, Micronesians learned to adjust to their neighbours, to remain on good terms with most of them most of the time, and to develop techniques of reconciliation when fights did break out. Micronesians traditionally depended on the cultivation of plant crops and on fishing in shallow reef waters. Because arable land was in short supply for the relatively dense population, Micronesians had a strong practical basis for their attachment to locality and lands. Land rights were usually held through lineages or extended family groups, often backed up by traditions of ancestral origins on the land.' <sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup> Conflict among chiefs and their followers did not terminate entirely with 'pacification', although the population was disarmed in the early 20th century: 'In 1904 the disarming of the Truk people was undertaken by the “Kondor.” There were 436 guns and 2,531 cartridges confiscated. For better control the government appointed six head-chiefs, banished some swashbucklers who did not want to submit, and turned out the Japanese. With this a peaceful development was initiated. The missions (Protestant mission since 1879, Catholic mission since 1912) were able to work undisturbed. Unfortunately, the German government took little notice of Truk, since it was too preoccupied with the other islands. Yet many things were accomplished. Under the last director of the station, A. Überhorst, the lagoon was given new impetus in every respect. The relationship between officials and the population was usually a good one, under Mr. Überhorst even a cordial one. Anyone who was on Truk in those years certainly did not see any bad treatment of the natives. Much was done also with regard to health; in particular Dr. Mayer and his wife traveled from island to island without rest in order to take care of the sick. If during the Japanese occupation a young naval officer was not ashamed to assert that the Germans had done nothing for the islands, anyone who lived on the islands during the Japanese period can only say from the heart: “God protect the poor Truk people under the Japanese.”' <sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup> 'On the main islands the German government introduced head chiefs (somol lap) who carried the flag. There were six of them, one each on Poloas, Uman, Fefan, Wöla, Udot, and Pol /Pul/. The smaller islands likewise belonged to the sphere of power of the head chiefs. But even this institution could not link the tribes together within themselves or with one another. Some of the lower chiefs sympathize with the head chief for egotistical reasons; others fight against him violently for the same reasons. One who is with him today might be against him tomorrow because he somehow stepped on his toes. It is often enough for the subchief to fight the head chief if his neighboring chief supports him. Thus the picture is constantly changing. [Page 125] There is a continuous, sometimes quiet, sometimes open, warfare of the subchiefs against the head chiefs, the lower chiefs among themselves, the common people against the chiefs. The main reason for this disagreeable phenomenon is the limitless egotism of the Truk people. Everyone strives more or less to be something of a chief also. Strong families who do not like the chief attempt to isolate themselves and choose one from their midst. In addition to this, there are also old family enmities and disputes about land. It is obvious that the islands will never be able to achieve peaceful development in this manner. It is difficult to say who is most to blame for it. In any case the chiefs are not to be pitied, because they behave themselves accordingly. They are to be blamed mostly for the exploitation of the people, their corruptibility, and partiality. Many of them unhesitatingly accept money and objects and help the giver, no matter how many times he is in the wrong.' <sup id="cite_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup> We have assumed that the institution of district chief predates the colonial period.

<p><b> ♠ Formal legal code ♣ absent ♥ </b> SCCS variable 149 'Writing and Records' is coded as ‘1’ or ‘None’, not ‘Mnemonic devices’, or ‘Nonwritten records’, or 'True writing, no records', or ‘True writing; records’. Bollig, writing in the colonial period, claims that tribal laws were fluid rather than fixed, although the colonial administration increasingly sought to impose its own regulations: 'The main task of the chief is the laying down and execution of the bu[unknown]un fanu, that is, the tribal laws. In practice the bu[unknown] is usually illusory, since nobody wants to follow it. Not for nothing do the Truk people say sarcastically about the conditions on their islands: “ en sob me bu[unknown]un, each district has its own laws,” or what is even worse: “ en me bu[unknown]un,” freely translated: “So many heads, so many meanings.” Moreover, it is a duty of the chief to communicate to the people the regulations of the government, to see that they are carried out, and to collect the head tax.' <sup id="cite_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-69">[69]</a></sup> Apparently, many customary regulations were no longer enforced under foreign administration: 'The effect of this ruling was to deprive the granting corporation of its residual title; once the grant was made, the grantee had full title. The grantee need not now render first fruits or obtain the grantor’s approval for transactions he wished to arrange. The head of the granting corporation could no longer claim to be sowuppwún; this title now belonged to the head of the recipient corporation if he wished to claim it. Some people on Romónum continue to follow traditional practice and continue to render gifts of first fruits to the traditional sowuppwún as a matter of courtesy, and there are some who still try to assert their right to first fruits under the traditional system. No one is compelled to follow traditional practice and a number of people no longer do so. It is my impression that scarcely anyone would do so if he felt that he would be seriously inconvenienced by it.' <sup id="cite_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-70">[70]</a></sup> 'The value of residual title to tracts of “soil” had helped to hold lesser corporations of immediate siblings together in lineages in the traditional social system. Except as other interests countervail, Romónum’s traditional lineage organization has been weakened. Indeed, before I learned about rulings of the courts, I had gained an impression that Romónum’s lineages were less frequently a unit of reference in community affairs than they had been in 1947. Talk of dissension within the lineages led me to the intuitive judgment that the lineage organization was weaker and looser than it had been. I cannot pretend to have examined all the different possible causes of this, but if my impression was correct, the court’s ruling regarding the jural relations of grantor and grantee in land transactions seems likely to have been an important contributing factor.' <sup id="cite_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup> Accordingly, inferences are difficult here. We have decided to follow the SCCS codes in this case.
</p><p><b> ♠ Judges ♣ absent ♥ </b> SCCS variable 89 'Judiciary' is coded as ‘1’ or 'absent'. Writing in the colonial period, Bollig describes the resolution of disputes in public meetings: 'The chief does all these duties in the kobu[unknown], the public meeting. Men as well as women are invited to this kobu[unknown]. All the participants are called together by the blowing of the large shell from the chief’s house. The kobu[unknown] takes place in the udd, the large men’s house. All the dealings of the tribe are discussed in it, marital matters, land matters, quarrels, in short, all the linen, whether clean or dirty, is spread out before all eyes. Everybody is allowed to talk and present his complaints. Of course there is no lack of amusing scenes too. Sometimes the people become so excited that the parties insult each other, grab each other, and come to blows, so that the meeting has to be dissolved. The following remark was made in a kobu[unknown] which I attended: “He is a bad fellow because he stole my log.” The person insulted in such a manner jumped up angrily and defended himself so convincingly that the accuser let his head sink and replied dejectedly: “ Kinisou, mei bu[unknown]me rem, excuse me, you are right.” In another kobu[unknown] a subchief said to the head chief: “I do not like you as head chief, for you put some into paradise, others into hell.” With this plain allusion to his partiality, the head chief became very excited, while the audience laughed. From the same chief came the familiar quotation: “ siwilin ni efot, ni efot; siwilim mas eu, mas eu, ina Lamalamen Moses, /116/ tooth for tooth, eye for eye, that is the religion of Moses.” As one sees, the chief concerned had not read the Protestant Bible in vain and knew very well how to cloak his thirst for revenge very nicely. Things go along quite pleasantly in the kobu[unknown] of the Truk people. Each one chatters as long and as [Page 127] much as he likes. If he uses sharp, objectionable expressions, wiser ones will certainly call out to him: “ a emuen, it is enough.” Some smoke, some eat. One sits on the floor, another one on an upturned bowl, or anywhere else. Here and there one also sees some who are asleep, tired from listening for a long time. In short it goes along in true Kanaka fashion, and the result of the kobu[unknown], usually lasting for hours, is “much ado about nothing.” The matter at issue remains as it was, or it has become even more complicated. The government has often tried to give the kobu[unknown] a more serious air, but quite in vain. The main person at the kobu[unknown] is the chief, who makes the decision in the individual cases. Formerly his decision was absolutely decisive for all questions. In more recent times appeal to a higher authority, to the head chief and the government, has been possible. The government has also pruned the jurisdiction of the chief. Some things are reserved solely for the head chief, some solely for the government representative. During the kobu[unknown], the chief is surrounded by his relatives and advisors who watch over him. If he wants to say something that does not suit them, they call out to him: “ a niku[unknown], that is too much.”' <sup id="cite_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-72">[72]</a></sup>

Traditional forms of house construction provided good protection against heavy rainstorms. Some of the houses in the Marianas appear to have been constructed on stone pillars. The so-called latte stones of this area—paired rows of large stone pillars with capstones—are thought to have been the foundations of raised houses. Latte stones can be quite tall: the quarries in which they were fashioned indicate that some were 20 feet (6 metres) tall or more, although more-typical examples are less than 15 feet (4.5 metres) in height. Because latte sites are relatively few when compared with the estimated population at the time of their construction, experts have conjectured that the stone foundations may have been used exclusively by chiefs or other wealthy people.

They live together for the most part in small villages on the seashore. Isolated families also live scattered in the mountains on their plantings. Thanks to the German government, there are good roads around the island.

Most of them work only as much as they have to. Eating and sleeping, and eating again, fill up their time. And their uncleanliness is indescribable. It is almost as if they had no feeling at all for any order and cleanliness. Around the house filth, rags, food remains; in it, the same. To be sure, they have a word for broom ( böbö), but rarely use it. They also bathe, even several times a day, and yet are never clean. If a tree falls across the path, it remains there. Everybody who takes the path has to climb over it. If a bridge collapses, it remains for months and years, until it is replaced.

Islanders traditionally used canoes for sea travel: 'All Micronesians relied heavily on water travel, although the high islanders used canoes principally in the sheltered coastal waters of their home islands. Micronesian canoes had a single hull with one outrigger. Canoes used in protected waters were often simple dugouts, but the oceangoing vessels, found especially in the central Carolinian atolls, the Marshalls, and the Gilberts, had sides built up of irregular planks that were caulked and sewn together with cord made from coconut-husk fibre.' <sup id="cite_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-79">[79]</a></sup></dd></dl>

After burial, the grave was watched by close kin for four nights to see if the good soul would possess one of them as its future medium. On the fourth day after burial, the deceased's immediate effects were burned and the good soul ascended to Heaven in the smoke. Everyone had two souls, a 'good' and a 'bad.' The good soul came from the sky world and returned there after death. The bad soul became a ghost that might be dangerous and cause illness. By the middle of the twentieth century all of Chuuk's people were at least nominally Christian, either Protestant or Catholic, and Christianity had become the focus of religious life.' <sup id="cite_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-81">[81]</a></sup> 'Several people drifted back in the neighborhood of the grave, and the nephew of the deceased brought a small wooden cross which he and Andy pounded in at the head of the grave.

Kitty brought a small kerosene lamp which was placed by the cross in a wooden box which later received a corrugated iron cover to keep the rain out.

In Palau, Yap, and the western atolls, meetinghouses were used mostly by men, while farther east, women and children also entered them freely much of the time. Canoe houses were another important form of building throughout Micronesia. Those big enough to store the larger canoes were on the scale of meetinghouses and often were used as such in some areas. Small buildings for the isolation of menstruating women were common in the western Carolines, and they continued to be used in Yap until well into the 20th century.' <sup id="cite_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-83">[83]</a></sup> 'Each jimw used to have associated with it a menstrual hut ( jimwerä). It was built in the same manner as a small jimw, but on a very small scale. Here women of the lineage were isolated during their first menstruation, and here they prepared and ate their meals apart during subsequent menstruations. At childbirth, an expectant mother retired to the jimwerä at the onset of labor pains and remained there until after delivery. Menstrual huts are no longer built or used.' <sup id="cite_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-84">[84]</a></sup> Goodenough also describes communal earth ovens: 'Each lineage of normal complement used to have, and still has, a fanag, which may [Page 69] be translated as “hearth” (lit. “ashes”). It is the site of a lineage’s earth ovens ( wuumw). [Cooking in aboriginal times was done in earth ovens, especially when food was to be prepared in quantity. The oven consists of a hollow in the ground which is filled with stones. Cooking is done by building a fire on the stones, then lining the hollow with the hot stones, placing the food wrapped in green leaves on them, and covering the whole over with earth. The moisture from the leaves and green grass on the stones steams the food.] It may or may not be covered by an open-sided, thatch-roofed hut. The fanag is the work place for the members of the lineage. Whenever, as a corporation, a lineage must prepare food in quantity to present to the district chief or to pay off obligations to the residual title holders of land to which it holds provisional title, its men assemble and work at the fanag. A small lineage may have no fanag of its own, its men using that of their fathers’ lineage and joining forces with their fathers’ lineage in the preparation of food for feasts and ceremonies involving the entire district. In aboriginal times the fanag was not necessarily located in the vicinity of the jimw, but it frequently was.' <sup id="cite_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-85">[85]</a></sup></dd></dl>

This regard for the night is easy to understand if one [Page 227] considers the tropical heat during the day. There is also the fact that one cannot be observed so easily at night. Therefore the Truk people do many important things at night. If the night is dark, dry coconut fronds are taken along as torches to be lighted if necessary.

Not for nothing do the Truk people say sarcastically about the conditions on their islands: “ en sob me bu[unknown]un, each district has its own laws,” or what is even worse: “ en me bu[unknown]un,” freely translated: “So many heads, so many meanings.” Moreover, it is a duty of the chief to communicate to the people the regulations of the government, to see that they are carried out, and to collect the head tax.' <sup id="cite_ref-95" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-95">[95]</a></sup> Islanders performed poetry and storytelling: 'Performing arts included dancing, storytelling, playing the noseflute and bamboo Jew's harp (in courtship serenading), singing, and poetry and rhetoric.

But Goodenough describes oral traditions that cover myth and past migrations (see also 'general variables' for material about Chuukese prehistory): 'IN THE ORAL HISTORY OF TRUK AND PONAPE in the Caroline Islands of Micronesia (see Figure 1), a place called Kachaw is the source of some clan ancestors and, especially, of politically important immigrants. Kachaw also appears as a place in Carolinian navigational lore. Until very recently, at least, most Micronesian scholars have accepted as fact that Kachaw is the island of Kosrae (Kusaie), situated about 560 km east southeast of Ponape. This identification has led to historical inferences about the role of Kosrae in Ponapean and Trukese prehistory. Critical examination of the linguistic and contextual evidence, however, indicates that in traditional Micronesian lore Kachaw referred to something quite different, namely the sky or a region of sky. It is as such that Kachaw was important in Trukese and Ponapean cosmology, religion, and legends of origin. Before I develop this argument, let me summarize how Kachaw is talked about in Trukese and Ponapean lore.' <sup id="cite_ref-97" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-97">[97]</a></sup></dd>

Islanders traditionally engaged in trading expeditions and barter trade: 'At the present time, sailing canoes suitable for long trips remain in use only in the small islands of the Caroline group scattered widely over the ocean from Truk westward. The language and culture found on these islands relate them clearly to Truk, whereas most of them fell historically under the hegemony of Yap to the west—a tie which Lessa (1956) has demonstrated is by no means completely extinct. Both Truk and Yap possess volcanic soils which can support crops impossible of cultivation on the sandy coral islets which lie between. Trade therefore provided the impetus for travel to and from the high islands, and there was in addition considerable social visiting back and forth between all the islands. Some voyages, apparently of exploration, have also been recorded extending over hundreds of miles to Guam and even remoter islands. Trips of up to 200 miles or so are still made, although with reduced frequency. Canoes are also used on a few islands other than those mentioned above for interisland, but essentially local, travel to Truk and Ponape.' <sup id="cite_ref-98" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-98">[98]</a></sup> 'The acquisition of property on Truk is usually done by means of barter. Lands, houses, and canoes are bartered. Smaller units of exchange are sebi (wooden bowls), deig (curcuma), faupar (red shell disks), hip mats, modesty bands, fishing nets, aromatic oils, coconut cord, home-grown tobacco, and sleeping mats. These products of native industry are not present in like quantity or in like quality on all the islands. Thus, Sapesis on Fefan is famous for its fine bowls, Pol for curcuma and oils, Iluk for its fine hip mats.' <sup id="cite_ref-99" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-99">[99]</a></sup> 'Weaving generally takes place at certain times, especially when the canoes from the low islands are expected, the inhabitants of which barter for things. In former times not very nice [Page 186] customs were associated with weaving.

Money was introduced by the colonial administration: 'The impact of these economic changes upon the Trukese was great. Just as under the Germans law and order were made the province of the administration, a step which can be reversed (without chaos) only by a long and intelligently directed course of evolution, so under the Japanese the step to a money economy and dependence upon some categories of imported goods was carried far enough beyond the German beginnings so that it too has become irreversible. While the Trukese were not indoctrinated in the more skilled techniques, such as deep-sea fishing and boat-building, there were many jobs available at manual labor, an ever-increasing flow of trade goods upon which to spend the earnings thereof, and head taxes to assure that those who did not work cut copra. The Trukese began to travel more and more on Japanese boats (many of which they have now taken over and operate), to use a wider variety of Japanese tools, to eat (although not depend upon) rice and canned fish, and to wear clothese exclusively of foreign material.' <sup id="cite_ref-102" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-102">[102]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b> ♠ Debt and credit structures ♣ absent ♥ </b> Caughey describes gift exchange in matrimonial arrangements: 'When a proper request has been made and both groups have agreed on a marriage, the two lineages engage in a public exchange of valuables. The boy’s lineage presents the girl’s lineage with a large quantity of breadfruit, since its collection and preparation is men’s work. Several days later, the girl’s lineage responds with a gift of fish, since much fishing is women’s work. As indicated before, lands may also be exchanged at this time. Despite such exchanges the first months of marriage constitute a [Page 122] tentative arrangement. If the partners turn out to be incompatible or if the members of either lineage find the character of the new spouse unacceptable, the marriage may be ended easily. Divorce at this stage has few significant repercussions. When the new wife becomes pregnant for the first time, this change in the status of the marriage is marked by a formal exchange of food. In the past it provided another opportunity for lineage competition. If the girl’s lineage decided to compete, they would return a gift of food conspicuously larger than that which they had received. If the boy’s lineage accepted the challenge, they would counter with an even larger gift and so on back and forth. When the wife bears a child, the situation changes, and the marriage should become more stable. As the father’s heir, the child sets up the transfer of valuables from the husband’s to the wife’s lineage. Furthermore, the wife’s lineage can no longer casually throw out the husband, since he has strong claim to the custody of the children.' <sup id="cite_ref-103" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-103">[103]</a></sup> Bollig writes about gift exchange in relation to mortuary ritual: 'If the sick person is a chief or some other respected personality, then the other chiefs bring gifts ( sau), such as coconuts, fish, and sugar cane, as a farewell to him, in case he should not recover. When it seems that his end is near, the consternation and the mourning are great throughout the house. The women take the sick person in their arms, on the lap. They are able to remain in this exhausting position for hours. They try to show their sympathy for the dying person in every possible way. It is a touching sight when six to seven women have such a poor soul “under treatment.” One caresses his feet, [Page 218] another one holds his hands in her’s, a third one strokes his hair, in short, each one tries in some way to be kind to the sick person as an expression of her love.' <sup id="cite_ref-104" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-104">[104]</a></sup> Chiefs were owed first fruits: 'As a reward for his faithful activity, the chief receives the muen, that is, the first fruits from the yields of the fields and trees, for example, breadfruit, bananas, and taro. It is said that many chiefs go to the fields in order to inspect their condition so that if the occasion arises they can check the deliveries. The Truk chiefs do not have any other legal claims. Nevertheless their subjects give them assistance in their own interests. The chief usually receives the best part from festive meals and fishing. If there is fishing with mention of the name of the chief, however, he receives everything, and nobody is allowed to withhold anything. Woe to the one who in former times did not pay his tribute properly. He had no prospect of a long life. It is said of the old chiefs that they always had the blow shell beside them. When the puk, puk of the shell resounded from the chief’s house, the people knew its meaning immediately. They quickly came running in order to /117/ learn the wishes of the tyrant. At one time he would desire kon (pounded breadfruit), at another time fish, then [Page 128] bananas, then coconuts to drink. The chiefs today no longer dare commit these outrages but they still have sufficient means to obtain some things on the side. They announce a dance, for example, or hold an efilul (celebration in connection with house-building, held when the frame is erected). They certainly do not come out short at the feast connected with this. As a matter of fact, most chiefs understand very well how to entice from their people whatever they might like to have.' <sup id="cite_ref-105" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-105">[105]</a></sup> But it appears that no 'third party' institutions for the regulation of debt were present.</dd>
<dd><b> ♠ Store of wealth ♣ absent ♥ </b> Writing in the colonial period, Swartz claims that Chuukese households stored money and wealth items in their homes: 'In strictly interpersonal disputes between spouses, the wife’s brothers often side with the husband. One morning I heard a young man shouting at his wife that she had lost the key to the locked box she shared with him. (Everyone has a box that can be locked, in which prayer books, money, or other valuables are kept.) As I approached the house, the woman rushed out carrying her infant daughter and followed by her husband, who was brandishing a machete. He shouted “You are very disobedient,” and struck her across the chest with the flat of the machete. The woman staggered back and began to wail that the baby had been cut. Her brother, who was with me, ran to her and began shaking her. “See the price of your disobedience!” he told her. The brother explained afterward that his sister was not virtuous ( mirit) and that she “drove everyone crazy.” The woman’s brothers must also protect a man’s marital rights with their sister if the husband fulfills his obligations to them.' <sup id="cite_ref-106" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-106">[106]</a></sup> We are unsure whether this practice has a pre-colonial equivalent.

Men as well as women are invited to this kobu[unknown]. All the participants are called together by the blowing of the large shell from the chief’s house. The kobu[unknown] takes place in the udd, the large men’s house. All the dealings of the tribe are discussed in it, marital matters, land matters, quarrels, in short, all the linen, whether clean or dirty, is spread out before all eyes.

A conch is blown at about nine o’clock by the island policeman or secretary as a signal for all who are not fishing or otherwise legitimately occupied to remain in their houses. Anyone who is seen and recognized thereafter at any distance from his own house is called before the chief and is usually at a loss to explain himself. This does not, however, involve the girl whom he intended to meet or met (unless he has just escaped from the house amid hue and cry and is thus identified), and the worst consequence is usually a few days of enforced labor on the island’s paths, to which little stigma is attached.' <sup id="cite_ref-110" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-110">[110]</a></sup> 'In former times an important item in a chief’s equipment was the conch-shell trumpet ( sewi).

The Chuuk Islands, which form part of the eastern Caroline Islands, are encircled by a barrier bank composed of some 85 sand and coral islets. The bank (often referred to as a reef) encloses a lagoon 822 square miles (2,129 square km) in area and has a diameter of some 40 miles (65 km). Chief islands of the group are Weno (formerly Moen), Tonoas, Fefan, Uman, Uatschaluk (Udot), and Tol. The islands were sighted by the Spanish explorer Álvaro Saavedra in 1528. They were visited occasionally by 19th-century traders and whalers and were included in the German purchase of parts of Micronesia from Spain (1899). Annexed by Japan (1914) and strongly fortified for World War II, the islands (known as the Truk Islands until 1990) were heavily attacked, bypassed, and blockaded by the Allies during the war. The sunken hulls of Japanese ships remain there, along with ruined weapons and fortifications on land. Together with the other islands in what are now the Federated States of Micronesia, the Chuuk group was part of the U.S.-administered United Nations Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands from 1947 to 1986.' <sup id="cite_ref-113" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-113">[113]</a></sup> 'The high islands of the Chuuk group have mangrove swamps along their coasts, as well as rainforests in the central mountainous areas.

The islands are popular with scuba divers, who come to explore the lagoon’s shipwrecks, many of which have become foundations for new reef growth. The largest urban area is on Weno; the rest of the population resides mostly in traditional villages scattered around the islands. Chuuk has a commercial dock and an international airport, both located on Weno. Total land area 49.1 square miles (127.2 square km). Pop.

Formal procedures for terminating conflict between districts involved payments of valuables and land by the loosing to the winning side. Fighting involved surprise raids and prearranged meetings on a field of battle. Principle weapons were slings, spears, and clubs.

Of great importance, too, was a knowledge of the various holds in a system of hand-to-hand encounter remotely reminiscent of Japanese jiujitsu. To acquire these skills required considerable practice. In aboriginal times the various lineages used to hold periodic month-long training course in their respective meeting houses. Although each political district fought engagements as a united military group, training was given independently by the various lineages. Those present were the men of the lineage, the husbands of its women, and the sons of its men, in conformance with the pattern of confining the transmission of knowledge to one’s children and one’s lineage mates. It is said that by no means everyone knew all of the various weapons nor all of the tricks of hand-to-hand fighting. Knowledge of the proper magic was required in the manufacture of the several weapons and also to increase the effectiveness of their use thereafter.

So they went in the door of the house. The chief said, “Spear them!” So they stabbed with their spears, but the young men warded them all off; they grabbed the spears and hurled them away. Then they slashed with the knives, but the two men got them too, tucked them under their arms and then plowed in. Then the chief told them to stop, to wait a minute, for these were remarkable people. He asked, “Who are you?” “We.” “Who?”, and they told him their names. Then they threw their arms around them and greeted them and were very happy. They asked them where they had come from, and they told them, and they were still happier. Then they got out food, and they and all their relatives sat down to eat.

[Page 54] They made the war plans during the so-called otout (banana eating). That is, the ida[unknown] took his bananas and put the individual fruits on a mat. Then he explained the campaign plan to his pupils and the other warriors. One banana signified a reef, another one a canoe, and so on. By moving the bananas back and forth, he made the situation clear and indicated to them how the enemy might possibly be attacked or how his attack could be repulsed.

<p><b> ♠ Standing armies ♣ absent ♥ </b> There were no troops or police forces in the native system: 'There were no police. A chief's brothers or sons might act on his behalf to intimidate or attack someone who had offended him. But it was control of magical power, either by the chief or one his brothers or sons, that made improper conduct liable to punishment. Major craft specialists could also make ill those who violated the taboos of their craft. Finally, members of chiefly lineages and their close associates were likely to have knowledge of sorcery. All such knowledge gave punitive power to chiefs and important specialists. People stressed maintaining the appearance of propriety in behavior so as not to give just cause for offense.' <sup id="cite_ref-136" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-136">[136]</a></sup> Prior to 'pacification', violent conflict played out in raids and battles between rival groups of armed men: 'Within districts, conflict arose over land, succession to chiefship, theft, adultery, and avenging homicide. Between districts, it arose over attentions to local women by outside men, the status of one district as subordinate to another, and rights of access to fishing areas. Formal procedures for terminating conflict between districts involved payments of valuables and land by the loosing to the winning side. Fighting involved surprise raids and prearranged meetings on a field of battle. Principle weapons were slings, spears, and clubs. Firearms, introduced late in the nineteenth century, were confiscated by German authorities in 1903. Martial arts included an elaborate system of throws and holds by which an unarmed man could kill, maim or disarm an armed opponent.' <sup id="cite_ref-137" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-137">[137]</a></sup> Competition between rival chiefs over the control of land and people was a major factor: 'Traditional Micronesian life was characterized by a belief in the stability of society and culture. People suffered occasional natural disasters, such as cyclones or droughts, but their goal after encountering one of these was to reconstitute the previous state of affairs. Wars occurred in most areas from time to time, mainly at the instigation of competing chiefs. At stake was the control of land—a limited resource—and followers, but there were usually few casualties. Living in small communities on small territories, Micronesians learned to adjust to their neighbours, to remain on good terms with most of them most of the time, and to develop techniques of reconciliation when fights did break out. Micronesians traditionally depended on the cultivation of plant crops and on fishing in shallow reef waters. Because arable land was in short supply for the relatively dense population, Micronesians had a strong practical basis for their attachment to locality and lands. Land rights were usually held through lineages or extended family groups, often backed up by traditions of ancestral origins on the land.' <sup id="cite_ref-138" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-138">[138]</a></sup> Conflict among chiefs and their followers did not terminate entirely with 'pacification', although the population was disarmed in the early 20th century: 'In 1904 the disarming of the Truk people was undertaken by the “Kondor.” There were 436 guns and 2,531 cartridges confiscated. For better control the government appointed six head-chiefs, banished some swashbucklers who did not want to submit, and turned out the Japanese. With this a peaceful development was initiated. The missions (Protestant mission since 1879, Catholic mission since 1912) were able to work undisturbed. Unfortunately, the German government took little notice of Truk, since it was too preoccupied with the other islands. Yet many things were accomplished. Under the last director of the station, A. Überhorst, the lagoon was given new impetus in every respect. The relationship between officials and the population was usually a good one, under Mr. Überhorst even a cordial one. Anyone who was on Truk in those years certainly did not see any bad treatment of the natives. Much was done also with regard to health; in particular Dr. Mayer and his wife traveled from island to island without rest in order to take care of the sick. If during the Japanese occupation a young naval officer was not ashamed to assert that the Germans had done nothing for the islands, anyone who lived on the islands during the Japanese period can only say from the heart: “God protect the poor Truk people under the Japanese.”' <sup id="cite_ref-139" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-139">[139]</a></sup> 'On the main islands the German government introduced head chiefs (somol lap) who carried the flag. There were six of them, one each on Poloas, Uman, Fefan, Wöla, Udot, and Pol /Pul/. The smaller islands likewise belonged to the sphere of power of the head chiefs. But even this institution could not link the tribes together within themselves or with one another. Some of the lower chiefs sympathize with the head chief for egotistical reasons; others fight against him violently for the same reasons. One who is with him today might be against him tomorrow because he somehow stepped on his toes. It is often enough for the subchief to fight the head chief if his neighboring chief supports him. Thus the picture is constantly changing. [Page 125] There is a continuous, sometimes quiet, sometimes open, warfare of the subchiefs against the head chiefs, the lower chiefs among themselves, the common people against the chiefs. The main reason for this disagreeable phenomenon is the limitless egotism of the Truk people. Everyone strives more or less to be something of a chief also. Strong families who do not like the chief attempt to isolate themselves and choose one from their midst. In addition to this, there are also old family enmities and disputes about land. It is obvious that the islands will never be able to achieve peaceful development in this manner. It is difficult to say who is most to blame for it. In any case the chiefs are not to be pitied, because they behave themselves accordingly. They are to be blamed mostly for the exploitation of the people, their corruptibility, and partiality. Many of them unhesitatingly accept money and objects and help the giver, no matter how many times he is in the wrong.' <sup id="cite_ref-140" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-140">[140]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Inter-polity wars ♣ present ♥</b>  Given the fleeting nature of alliances and the fluid character of socio-political organization, differentiating between inter-polity and internal wars can be difficult.
</p><p>Districts routinely fought each other: "Within districts, conflict arose over land, succession to chiefship, theft, adultery, and avenging homicide.

</p><p>"War! That is a word that made every Truk heart beat faster in olden times. Truk was one big battlefield. Island fought against island, tribe against tribe.

</p><p>He also mentions what appears to be a form of human sacrifice: "The spirit Paladiu on the island of Falanu is even more modest. Human excrement satisfies him as an offering.

</p><p>Bollig also claims the ritual mutilation of dead enemies: "It was the corpse of an enemy warrior who had been treacherously killed. It was set against a tree stump, with the face toward the country of the enemy. The face was terribly disfigured, in that the lips were cut off. The mouth stood open, prevented from closing by a spike of bone. In its hand the corpse held a spear which likewise was directed toward the enemy."<sup id="cite_ref-163" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-163">[163]</a></sup>
</p><p>Disagreement:
</p><p>LeBar denies the cannibalization of enemies: "Informants denied that slain enemies were ever eaten on Truk. A variant way of handling the dead in the old days required that the corpse be wrapped in mats and hung in the house. Relatives might show their fondness for the deceased by eating a bit of the flesh or drinking a few drops of the body fluids collected in a bowl beneath the corpse."<sup id="cite_ref-164" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-164">[164]</a></sup> We have provisionally coded the variable 'present' as Bollig provides more material overall, but expert feedback is needed on the matter.

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from military ♣ absent ♥</b> 'There were no police. A chief's brothers or sons might act on his behalf to intimidate or attack someone who had offended him. But it was control of magical power, either by the chief or one his brothers or sons, that made improper conduct liable to punishment. Major craft specialists could also make ill those who violated the taboos of their craft. Finally, members of chiefly lineages and their close associates were likely to have knowledge of sorcery. All such knowledge gave punitive power to chiefs and important specialists. People stressed maintaining the appearance of propriety in behavior so as not to give just cause for offense.' <sup id="cite_ref-358" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-358">[358]</a></sup></dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from legislative ♣ absent ♥</b> There were no legislative institutions comparable to a state structure. Writing in the colonial period, Bollig describes the resolution of disputes in public meetings: 'The chief does all these duties in the kobu[unknown], the public meeting. Men as well as women are invited to this kobu[unknown]. All the participants are called together by the blowing of the large shell from the chief’s house. The kobu[unknown] takes place in the udd, the large men’s house. All the dealings of the tribe are discussed in it, marital matters, land matters, quarrels, in short, all the linen, whether clean or dirty, is spread out before all eyes. Everybody is allowed to talk and present his complaints. Of course there is no lack of amusing scenes too. Sometimes the people become so excited that the parties insult each other, grab each other, and come to blows, so that the meeting has to be dissolved. The following remark was made in a kobu[unknown] which I attended: “He is a bad fellow because he stole my log.” The person insulted in such a manner jumped up angrily and defended himself so convincingly that the accuser let his head sink and replied dejectedly: “ Kinisou, mei bu[unknown]me rem, excuse me, you are right.” In another kobu[unknown] a subchief said to the head chief: “I do not like you as head chief, for you put some into paradise, others into hell.” With this plain allusion to his partiality, the head chief became very excited, while the audience laughed. From the same chief came the familiar quotation: “ siwilin ni efot, ni efot; siwilim mas eu, mas eu, ina Lamalamen Moses, /116/ tooth for tooth, eye for eye, that is the religion of Moses.” As one sees, the chief concerned had not read the Protestant Bible in vain and knew very well how to cloak his thirst for revenge very nicely. Things go along quite pleasantly in the kobu[unknown] of the Truk people. Each one chatters as long and as [Page 127] much as he likes. If he uses sharp, objectionable expressions, wiser ones will certainly call out to him: “ a emuen, it is enough.” Some smoke, some eat.

Writing in the colonial period, Bollig describes the resolution of disputes in public meetings: 'The chief does all these duties in the kobu[unknown], the public meeting. Men as well as women are invited to this kobu[unknown]. All the participants are called together by the blowing of the large shell from the chief’s house. The kobu[unknown] takes place in the udd, the large men’s house. All the dealings of the tribe are discussed in it, marital matters, land matters, quarrels, in short, all the linen, whether clean or dirty, is spread out before all eyes. Everybody is allowed to talk and present his complaints. Of course there is no lack of amusing scenes too. Sometimes the people become so excited that the parties insult each other, grab each other, and come to blows, so that the meeting has to be dissolved. The following remark was made in a kobu[unknown] which I attended: “He is a bad fellow because he stole my log.” The person insulted in such a manner jumped up angrily and defended himself so convincingly that the accuser let his head sink and replied dejectedly: “ Kinisou, mei bu[unknown]me rem, excuse me, you are right.” In another kobu[unknown] a subchief said to the head chief: “I do not like you as head chief, for you put some into paradise, others into hell.” With this plain allusion to his partiality, the head chief became very excited, while the audience laughed. From the same chief came the familiar quotation: “ siwilin ni efot, ni efot; siwilim mas eu, mas eu, ina Lamalamen Moses, /116/ tooth for tooth, eye for eye, that is the religion of Moses.” As one sees, the chief concerned had not read the Protestant Bible in vain and knew very well how to cloak his thirst for revenge very nicely. Things go along quite pleasantly in the kobu[unknown] of the Truk people. Each one chatters as long and as [Page 127] much as he likes. If he uses sharp, objectionable expressions, wiser ones will certainly call out to him: “ a emuen, it is enough.” Some smoke, some eat.

Not for nothing do the Truk people say sarcastically about the conditions on their islands: “ en sob me bu[unknown]un, each district has its own laws,” or what is even worse: “ en me bu[unknown]un,” freely translated: “So many heads, so many meanings.” Moreover, it is a duty of the chief to communicate to the people the regulations of the government, to see that they are carried out, and to collect the head tax.' <sup id="cite_ref-371" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-371">[371]</a></sup> Accordingly, the below variables may not be relevant to the pre-colonial Chuuk.

Everybody is allowed to talk and present his complaints. Of course there is no lack of amusing scenes too. Sometimes the people become so excited that the parties insult each other, grab each other, and come to blows, so that the meeting has to be dissolved. The following remark was made in a kobu[unknown] which I attended: “He is a bad fellow because he stole my log.” The person insulted in such a manner jumped up angrily and defended himself so convincingly that the accuser let his head sink and replied dejectedly: “ Kinisou, mei bu[unknown]me rem, excuse me, you are right.” In another kobu[unknown] a subchief said to the head chief: “I do not like you as head chief, for you put some into paradise, others into hell.” With this plain allusion to his partiality, the head chief became very excited, while the audience laughed. From the same chief came the familiar quotation: “ siwilin ni efot, ni efot; siwilim mas eu, mas eu, ina Lamalamen Moses, /116/ tooth for tooth, eye for eye, that is the religion of Moses.” As one sees, the chief concerned had not read the Protestant Bible in vain and knew very well how to cloak his thirst for revenge very nicely. Things go along quite pleasantly in the kobu[unknown] of the Truk people. Each one chatters as long and as [Page 127] much as he likes. If he uses sharp, objectionable expressions, wiser ones will certainly call out to him: “ a emuen, it is enough.” Some smoke, some eat. One sits on the floor, another one on an upturned bowl, or anywhere else. Here and there one also sees some who are asleep, tired from listening for a long time. In short it goes along in true Kanaka fashion, and the result of the kobu[unknown], usually lasting for hours, is “much ado about nothing.” The matter at issue remains as it was, or it has become even more complicated. The government has often tried to give the kobu[unknown] a more serious air, but quite in vain. The main person at the kobu[unknown] is the chief, who makes the decision in the individual cases. Formerly his decision was absolutely decisive for all questions. In more recent times appeal to a higher authority, to the head chief and the government, has been possible. The government has also pruned the jurisdiction of the chief. Some things are reserved solely for the head chief, some solely for the government representative. During the kobu[unknown], the chief is surrounded by his relatives and advisors who watch over him. If he wants to say something that does not suit them, they call out to him: “ a niku[unknown], that is too much.”' <sup id="cite_ref-374" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-374">[374]</a></sup> The judicial powers of the chiefs were diminished somewhat in the colonial period: 'The chief’s authority to punish no longer goes very far. Once master over life and death, now he can only order imprisonment or hard labor. The hard labor usually consists of pulling grass on public roads or carrying stones to canoe wharves. Nevertheless the people do not hurt themselves at this work and get out of it whenever they can. Instead of pulling grass, they sit smoking and talking on the road. They also know how to appear sick in order to be left completely free. The feeding of condemned persons is a matter for his relatives. For the duration of the punishment the natives live in the jail ( kalapus) . Each head chief has two kalapus, one for men and the other for women. On some islands the kalapus contributed greatly to the depravity of morals, since both sexes were housed in the same room. Similarly the wardens of the prisoners used the opportunity to satisfy their passions and to do business on the side by hiring out the imprisoned women.' <sup id="cite_ref-375" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-375">[375]</a></sup> 'On the other hand, the chief acquired a number of restrictions on the exercise of his power which either did not exist before, or which had not been so clear and consistent. It was not possible to appeal a chief’s judicial decisions, or to go to higher authority to change or reverse a chief’s plans for coordinated activity. With the coming of the American administration a further restriction appeared in the, theoretically at least, independent community legislature to whose laws even the chief is subject. Under the Americans there is also an independent judiciary, so that the chief is no longer allowed, in theory, to mediate interlineage disputes. On balance, however, it would seem that the chiefs’ coordinating and planning powers were increased despite the new restrictions. The provision of effective and usable sanctions probably outweighs all the new limits imposed on the chiefs’ powers.' <sup id="cite_ref-376" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-376">[376]</a></sup> But colonial forces also backed chiefly resolutions in a manner not possible in the pre-colonial period: 'The Germans also provided effective force to support the chief’s decisions. Anyone refusing to obey a chief’s orders or rejecting his decision in a dispute was liable to internment in the “calaboose” spoken of so approvingly by the old man at the beginning of this paper. The might of the German, and, in turn, the Japanese and American administrations stood behind a chief’s words; and although some kind of appeal from his decisions was usually possible, the likelihood of anyone refusing to obey his clearly expressed mandates and escaping unscathed had become rather small.' <sup id="cite_ref-377" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-377">[377]</a></sup> Prior to colonization, direct coercion and sorcery were employed instead: 'There were no police. A chief's brothers or sons might act on his behalf to intimidate or attack someone who had offended him. But it was control of magical power, either by the chief or one his brothers or sons, that made improper conduct liable to punishment. Major craft specialists could also make ill those who violated the taboos of their craft. Finally, members of chiefly lineages and their close associates were likely to have knowledge of sorcery. All such knowledge gave punitive power to chiefs and important specialists. People stressed maintaining the appearance of propriety in behavior so as not to give just cause for offense.' <sup id="cite_ref-378" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-378">[378]</a></sup> 'Sorcery is a more direct if more secret form of aggression and is practically precluded from being applied within the lineage by the fact that the spells used are in each case the property of a given lineage. While it is not clear whether they would be considered effective, it is very doubtful that they would be used against others who knew them or could be expected to know them. Data on sorcery are difficult to obtain for no one admits to being a sorcerer. Those cases of afflictions (blindness, psychosis, and paralysis) which were definitely attributed to a given sorcerer always applied to someone on another island, angry because his wife had been taken away, his property trespassed upon, or the like. Although various people on Romonum were said to know certain techniques of sorcery and many people expressed a fear of being sorcerized, no one would say that a given person had actually sorcerized anyone. The detailed body of knowledge of procedures in sorcery which exists and the circumstantial accounts of how it was formerly used certainly suggest very strongly that in the past Trukese deliberately sorcerized other Trukese. Whether this is the case today, however, is an open question. In the past [Page 150] it was used by master magicians, both against rival magicians and against the laity, and was also used in the punishment of thieves; but then as now sorcery was primarily the result of one person’s animosity against another and as such acted as a sanction against acts which might antagonize another. Thus anxiety about sorcery is another factor weighing the balance in favor of conformist behavior.' <sup id="cite_ref-379" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-379">[379]</a></sup> 'Another weak point of the chiefs is partiality. Members of the chief’s kin group, blood relatives, and friends are not readily punished, not even for serious crimes. On the other hand, poor devils whom the chief cannot bear are sentenced to hard labor for the slightest reason or are reported to the government as “disobedient ones” or “rebels.” In the old days the Truk chiefs did away with troublesome persons by means of the knife; today they do it by means of lies and false denunciations.' <sup id="cite_ref-380" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-380">[380]</a></sup> It is therefore difficult to ascertain how the resolution of disputes was handled prior to colonization. We have assumed that the resolution (or strong-arming) of disputes by chiefs and their brothers fits in better with 'non-state judiciary' than with 'legal system'.

This, however, lasts only as long as there are no quarrels among the families.' <sup id="cite_ref-385" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-385">[385]</a></sup> Elder brothers held supervision rights over property owned by the sib: 'In contrast to this indirectly communistic property, there is also that which is directly communistic, for example, land. They call it fanu uon ar puipui, land of their brotherhood. Yet the oldest brother plays a special part in connection with all the property. He not only has the supervision and usufruct right to the property of the younger siblings, which goes back to the common [Page 132] father, but he can also withdraw it from them. Since this not infrequently happens, the oldest is usually also the richest in each family. /121/ The oldest has no rights over the property which the younger ones have obtained from other sources. To make up for the fact that the oldest has such extensive rights, he has the obligation to care for his siblings in certain ways.' <sup id="cite_ref-386" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-386">[386]</a></sup> According to Bollig, disputes over land rights were common: 'The land rights of the Truk people are not based on justice, but on the right of the stronger, the cleverer. There is hardly a plot of land with a clear legal history, and for that reason there are the constant assertions of legal claims, the eternal lawsuits over land. The boldest and most cunning persons always have the best land on Truk. Pretenses for bringing legal claims to foreign property before the chief are easily found in the confused conditions. And once they are found, the Kanakas’ inexhaustible power of invention and art of lying take care of making them convincing to others. That briberies of chiefs, interpreters, and witnesses play a tremendous part in this is obvious, considering the character of the Truk people. No means is too wicked for them in order to “profit. ”' <sup id="cite_ref-387" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-387">[387]</a></sup> 'A source of land disputes is the exchange of lands. For example: Soni and Soledon exchange two pieces of land. Soni now cultivates his land, while Soledon lets it lie fallow. Soledon dies. His children, who are not on good terms with Soni, cancel the exchange and take possession of the productive piece of land as property of their deceased father. Soni resists. The parties quarrel for years. Sometimes the one wins, sometimes the other, but no one yields.' <sup id="cite_ref-388" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-388">[388]</a></sup> In practice, the boundaries between land owned by different individuals could be vague: 'The boundaries of the lands are very vague. They change continually under the hands of both neighbors. Sometimes the one, sometimes the other one, goes beyond them. Then they quarrel. What A has planted B tears out, with the argument that it is already on his territory. What B has planted A tears out, with the same argument. Now which of the two is right?' <sup id="cite_ref-389" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-389">[389]</a></sup> 'With such uncertain legal conditions it is not at all surprising that quarrels over land are daily events on Truk. Every death, every divorce, every new marriage has a coil of rats’ tails in quarrels as a result. The boundless egotism of the Truk natives is responsible for all this. Everybody wants to have as much as possible. A Trukese can quarrel for years about a tree, a plant, or a foot of land, even though he has plenty of trees that are not producing anything because of lack of care. The German government gave the natives land documents on which the owner, along with all his pieces of land, was recorded. /123/ The hopes placed on this have not been fulfilled. Today everything is as confused as before.' <sup id="cite_ref-390" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-390">[390]</a></sup> Rights in land were differentiated from rights in plantings: 'The Truk people are familiar with a distinction of the ground from what is planted on it. Thus, somebody may possess a piece of land, but the trees that stand on it belong to other people. They or their parents once planted the trees on his property, which is permissible according to Truk customs. If the owners of the trees are dishonest, they need only clear the field beginning from the trees, continue to cultivate, and the poor owner is dispossessed. What confused situations that causes in the case of an eventual transfer of the piece of land to another is easily understandable. I myself have had difficulties for years, since certain people still held on to “their” trees after the piece of land had long been the property of the mission. Only the felling of the trees put an end to all claims.' <sup id="cite_ref-391" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-391">[391]</a></sup> Ownership was claimed and asserted through material markings: 'The natives try to document their right of ownership to pieces of land by clearing something on it from time to time, or they build huts on the individual pieces of land, which they then inhabit temporarily. Dying fathers give their children directions to bury them on their pieces of land so that their grave might thus be proof of ownership for the future. One can often hear in the kobu[unknown] that this is precisely what the people refer to.' <sup id="cite_ref-392" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-392">[392]</a></sup> 'The riri, that is, to bind, forms a strange title deed on the Truk Islands. For example, somebody sees a tree which bears many fruits. Since he would like some too, he takes the ubud of a coconut palm and wraps it around a branch of the tree in order to make his intention known publicly. In many cases the owner resists such oppression and tears off the ubud. But also in many cases he keeps quiet in order to avoid bigger quarrels.' <sup id="cite_ref-393" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-393">[393]</a></sup> 'I myself have had experiences with the riri in that the girls “bound” pineapples for themselves on my plot of land, which I did not allow, of course. The riri is also done in connection with animals, only by words here, of course. They say, for example: “ A riri lon lelugei enan tugo, it is bound in my heart, this chicken, ” that is, it is my property. Then they also further take the wor d riri with a moral obligation. One says, for example: [Page 135] “U a riri uon enan a[unknown]a[unknown], I am bound to that work, ” that is, I am obliged to do it. In any case the former riri is the root of the latter.' <sup id="cite_ref-394" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-394">[394]</a></sup> Land could be transferred through barter in the manner of other goods: 'The acquisition of property on Truk is usually done by means of barter.

Smaller units of exchange are sebi (wooden bowls), deig (curcuma), faupar (red shell disks), hip mats, modesty bands, fishing nets, aromatic oils, coconut cord, home-grown tobacco, and sleeping mats.

<dd><b>♠ Lease ♣ present ♥</b> According to Fischer, lease arrangements were an artefact of the colonial period: 'Rent for money is purely a foreign introduction and is still poorly understood on some of the outer islands. On Puluwat recently the owner of the plot on which the sub-dispensary stands was worried about accepting rent from the island. He believed that after a number of years as he gradually received the full value of the land in money his title to the land would inexorably slip away from him. On the other hand, he did want to be paid for the food trees cleared away to prepare the site of the building.' <sup id="cite_ref-403" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-403">[403]</a></sup> But prior to colonization, senior lineages and dominant clans could grant residential and usufruct rights to junior groups on a provisional basis: 'In each district the lineage with title to its space held the chiefship. The several lineages with full or residual title to plots of soil had full residential rights. Lineages with only provisional titles to plots of soil in grant from other lineages had only conditional residential rights. Lineages with full residential rights maintained symbolic hearths where, with their client lineages, they prepared food to present to the chief in recognition of his lineage's ownership of the space.' <sup id="cite_ref-404" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-404">[404]</a></sup> Individuals could also grant provisional land rights to other individuals: 'Land was held privately both by individuals and matrilineal, corporate descent groups.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Lease Rights ♣ absent ♥</b> There was no state structure that could enforce provisional titles. However, chiefs occasionally confiscated property granted to junior lineages and provisional title holders in case of disobedience (such as failure to deliver food prestations on the occasion of feasts): 'As noted above, the relations between a chief and the people of his district are patterned largely after the relations between the parties in divided ownership. As provisional title holders to territory, the various lineages owe the chief periodic gifts of produce from the land. These gifts are rendered at stated times in connection with feasts given in the chief’s honor. He fixes the time for these feasts in accordance with a seasonal calendar: two feasts during the breadfruit season, and two more during the turmeric season. The men of the various lineages prepare breadfruit in giant wooden bowls while the women fish. Other types of food are also collected. On the day of the feast each lineage brings its food in a procession, the men carrying the giant bowls on frames and chanting as they walk. The food is carried into the meeting house of the chief’s lineage. The chief then selects the largest bowl for himself and his lineage mates and redistributes the rest of the food to the assembled population. The distribution is made according to lineage and is roughly proportional to the size of each lineage. The contributions which each lineage makes are also proportional to the size of its membership and the amount of productive land which it controls. If a lineage fails in this obligation, the chief has the right to confiscate its holdings. Should he indicate dissatisfaction with the contribution of a particular lineage, its members will hasten to prepare additional food and other gifts to mollify him.' <sup id="cite_ref-406" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-406">[406]</a></sup></dd></dl></dd>

The lands that he has jointly with his brothers, however, are taken by them. It frequently happens that the brothers, in case the children are minors, take all the lands in order to administer them, whereby one piece or another remains in their hands forever. In general the father considers only the children from the present marriage. Children from former marriages, who live with the mother’s relatives, are not considered. For that they would have had to rejoin him again later.

<p><b>Marriage</b>
</p>
<dl><dd> <b>♠ Monogamy ♣ {absent; present} ♥</b> The Chuukese were organized according to membership in matrilineal clans: 'Chuuk's population is divided into a number of dispersed, matrilineal clans. Within any one district the several lineages are usually but not always of different clans. There are also personal kindreds. As a principle of clan and lineage membership, descent is matrilineal, but otherwise kinship is reckoned bilaterally.' <sup id="cite_ref-431" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-431">[431]</a></sup> 'The domestic unit was an extended family, based on the women of a lineage or sublineage. It consisted of at least one experienced older woman and two more younger women of childbearing age together with their husbands. Unmarried sons and brothers slept apart in their lineage's meeting house. Extended family households continued through the periods of foreign administration.' <sup id="cite_ref-432" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-432">[432]</a></sup> According to Goodenough, levirate/sororate marriages were practiced: 'Marriage took place for women a bit before and for men a bit after the age of 20. Premarital courtship was covert and included sexual relations. Residence was usually matrilocal. Divorce, common before the birth of children, was rare thereafter. It could be initiated by either spouse and was often instigated by the wife's brothers. Levirate and sororate remarriages were valued. To keep soil and trees that had been granted to the children of a lineage's men circulating back, marriage preferences with one or another kind of cousin, varying from locality to locality, were widespread.' <sup id="cite_ref-433" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-433">[433]</a></sup> According to Bollig, polygyny was fairly widespread, partly as a result of levirate/sororate marriages: 'Polygamy (1) 1 a akaruu, he has two wives; a akaulu[unknown]at, he has three wives, etc. is very widespread on Truk. Men with two to nine wives are numerous. One becomes polygamous through the death of his brother, for out of brotherly love he has an obligation to take the widow for himself (levirate marriage). Another one marries a widow with daughters and takes the latter, as soon as they are old enough, as secondary wives. A third takes the sisters of his wife for himself, which is the case for most polygamous situations. The reasons for polygamy vary. One wants to keep landed property together by this means, or to concentrate it in his hands; another wants to have workers, since the secondary wives fish for him. Strangely enough, the motive forces for polygamy are said to be mostly the women themselves. They offer their daughters, sisters, [Page 109] and nieces to their husbands as secondary wives, in order that no strange family come in. This happens especially if they have no children, for if a strange woman comes in and gives birth to children, they will be pushed aside. They try to prevent this by means of the above measure. If polygamy has come about in this way, a peaceful life together is possible, for the women stay together in their own interests. But if the women come from different families or tribes, living together is out of the question. They live apart, and the man has the pleasant task of going back and forth. Unpleasantness and jealousy between the rivals are the order of the day. First one and then the other thinks she is being slighted. First one is tired, then the other. And the husband must always be on the move in order to keep everybody happy. Some polygamous situations which I knew were changing constantly. At one time the husband had four, then some ran away, later they increased to six, etc. A somewhat decent family life is inconceivable. The eventual /101/ children always go with the mother, but the father knows the means for drawing them to him when they are older, so that he will have a work force. Some polygamists are very generous with their wives. They are quickly ready to hand them over to their unmarried relatives, because it gives them advantages. They are able to take a new one and still consider the old one indirectly as their own.' <sup id="cite_ref-434" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-434">[434]</a></sup> Bollig claims that polyandry was rare: 'Polyandry seems to be rarer. I knew of only one case, in which two brothers had a common wife.' <sup id="cite_ref-435" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-435">[435]</a></sup> But Caughey claims that while polygamy was present, monogamy was the norm for most: 'In the traditional society polygynous marriages rarely occurred. Since marriage sets up heavy obligations to the wife’s lineage, most men did not want to increase this burden, especially by marrying into different lineages. Interpreted differently, the same reasons provided the rationale for those few cases of polygny that did occur. A man who married more than one wife demonstrated his importance and power. It showed that he was capable of engaging in burdensome social relationships with more than one lineage or that he was able to turn this subordinate relationship into one where he dominated. A famous man of bravery on Fáánakkar was once married at the same time to five wives from four different lineages. Later, in a grand gesture of kindness, he gave one of them away to a wifeless brother.' <sup id="cite_ref-436" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-436">[436]</a></sup> Expert confirmation is needed on the matter.</dd>

<dd> <b>♠ Elite Concubinage ♣ absent ♥</b></dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Typical number of extramarital partners ♣ ♥</b> The classification of variables is slightly misleading here as some writers claim that extramarital sexual relations were somewhat common. Goodenough provides a general description of courtship and sexual relations: 'Marriage took place for women a bit before and for men a bit after the age of 20. Premarital courtship was covert and included sexual relations. Residence was usually matrilocal. Divorce, common before the birth of children, was rare thereafter. It could be initiated by either spouse and was often instigated by the wife's brothers. Levirate and sororate remarriages were valued. To keep soil and trees that had been granted to the children of a lineage's men circulating back, marriage preferences with one or another kind of cousin, varying from locality to locality, were widespread.' <sup id="cite_ref-437" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-437">[437]</a></sup> According to Goodenough, premarital sexual relations were common: 'LIKE many other Oceanic peoples, the natives of Truk allow their adolescents considerable freedom in sexual matters. There is no stigma of any kind attached to young men or women who have sexual relations before marriage. No value whatsoever is attributed to virginity in girls or boys. All informants agree that girls normally start having intercourse when, at about the age of fourteen, their breasts become fairly well developed. The initial sexual experiences of boys occur at a somewhat later age, between the ages of sixteen and seventeen.' <sup id="cite_ref-438" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-438">[438]</a></sup> Bollig claims that 'licentious' behavior was common and tolerated: 'Inemes, the Venus of the Truk people, has to be mentioned separately, because her cult is very different in character from that of the other spirits. She is the protectress of lechery, and everything that goes with it is dedicated to her. None of the gods and spirits has as extensive a circle of worshipers as Inemes. This fact alone is proof of the low moral position of the Truk people, who know no distinction between licit and illicit sexual intercourse and who, despite the oloudd have no conception of chastity and even less of virginity.' <sup id="cite_ref-439" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-439">[439]</a></sup> 'There is another detestable custom which likewise derives its origin from Inemes. It is the puanelö or nadelö (1). A number of young fellows get together and announce their licentiousness. They hang up the faren I[unknown]emes, decorate it with wreaths, necklaces, etc., paint themselves yellow from head to foot, and roam about to find companions in their lechery. Women and girls who do not want to co-operate are sprinkled with “magic oil” so that their hair falls out and ugly wounds and boils appear.' <sup id="cite_ref-440" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-440">[440]</a></sup> 'During this time also moonlight dances in honor of Inemes are performed. They are the notorious ouönu dances.' <sup id="cite_ref-441" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-441">[441]</a></sup> 'It is not surprising that so many marriages break up as a consequence of these ouönu dances. The licentiousness of the women is worst during this time. Since it is forbidden to pick coconuts, they lie in wait for the men so as to catch any in the act of violating the prohibition. If they have happily found one, they tear his clothes, scratch him, take away his food, etc. That is the detestable worship of Inemes, a dark point in the lives of the Truk natives, who otherwise are so congenial.' <sup id="cite_ref-442" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-442">[442]</a></sup> 'Jealousy among the women is in general not very great. It is worse among some men, who on account of it treat their wives like slaves. Wherever the wives go, they accompany them. They never make long trips, in order always to be able to be home at night. At the slightest suspicion, they beat their wives. Men of this type are not popular. Their jealousy is smiled at pityingly by the more liberal-minded. It is worthless, for the women are slier than the men in this respect. A word, a glance, a movement, a dropped stone, the flashing of a mirror reveals the intentions of the faithless one to her lover, without the neighborhood noticing anything. Even the harmless smoking is used in reaching an understanding. The woman rubs the tip of the cigarette with some aromatic oil and hands it to the man she desires to win. He immediately tastes the oil and knows what the woman wants of him. Thus, there are innumerable ways of reaching an understanding between those who have bad intentions. This refined system of adultery is not surprising, however, in the case of a people among whom Inemes, the goddess of lechery, swings her scepter.' <sup id="cite_ref-443" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-443">[443]</a></sup>  Writing in the colonial period, Gladwin claims that children conceived through adultery were integrated into matrilineal kin groups without much consternation: 'Another aspect of kinship deserves mention. As we have seen this is a matrilineal society, which means that the social placement of a child in the lineage and wider social groupings depends in most respects upon his tie with his mother. The Trukese take this quite literally and therefore pay little or no attention to who may [Page 51] be the child’s actual biological father, even though this may be perfectly obvious. While the unmarried mother may find herself in a somewhat embarrassing social position, as far as can be determined no stigma whatsoever attaches to the child. Children of adulterous unions similarly are simply considered to be the children of the man to whom their mother was married at the time of their birth. Perhaps most important of the problems resolved by this device is that of children fathered by foreigners. At the present time there are literally hundreds of children whose appearance unmistakably shows them to have had Japanese fathers, and who in another society could readily form a class of half-breeds or mestizos with highly disruptive effects for themselves and the society as a whole. But on Truk they are simply Trukese children, treated no differently from any others, and properly furnished with mothers and fathers. Those who have seen the deep cleavage formed in societies elsewhere by mestizo groups can readily appreciate the degree of the good fortune of the Trukese in this regard. There are a few true half-castes on Truk, descendents of early traders who married Trukese women and raised their children themselves; these people consider themselves half-castes and are treated as such. But because this limited group can expand only slightly, not being augmented by further foreign transgressions, they can have little harmful effect and, in fact, have used the business knowledge passed down to them from their fathers or grandfathers to make major contributions to the economic adjustment of Truk under American administration.' <sup id="cite_ref-444" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-444">[444]</a></sup> It is difficult to quantify a 'typical number of extramarital partners' from these descriptions.</dd></dl>

<b>Legal rights are different on the basis of:</b>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>♠ Gender ♣ present ♥</b> Chuukese followed a gendered division of labour: 'Traditionally, men gardened, cooked and processed food in bulk (in the earth oven), did deep-water fishing, engaged in war and public affairs, and practiced the arts of canoe and house building and of wood, shell, and stone working. Women wove, plaited mats, prepared meals (as distinct from food in bulk), did inshore fishing, and took main responsibility for child care. Men and women have both entered into school teaching, clerical work, and administration.' <sup id="cite_ref-445" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-445">[445]</a></sup> Women were excluded from some ceremonial activities due to gendered ritual taboos: 'A few dances are also connected with the worship of the spirits. These are the dugia (dance with kurukur, that is, staffs of orange wood) and the älimod, a dance which is performed in a sitting position. The former is a men’s dance; the latter may be performed by both sexes. During the entire dancing period the dancers are shut up in the udd. This is surrounded by a fence which no unbidden person, especially no woman, may approach. No indecent word occurs in these spirit dances, in contrast to the other dances. They say that the spirits do not like indecent things in connection with the men, a statement which does not correspond with their views on other occasions.' <sup id="cite_ref-446" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-446">[446]</a></sup> 'The pue is handled in different ways. The most important and solemn pue is the girot. The soupue makes the girot in the udd in the /66/ presence of his pupils. Women are not allowed to watch. As a matter of fact no woman is allowed to make any kind of pue.' <sup id="cite_ref-447" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-447">[447]</a></sup> 'After the apu[unknown]etou, the canoe, which is called faremai (= önumai) if it is a rowing canoe, is tested. It goes out on the sea for the kitir (rowing or sailing race). No woman is allowed to board the faremai, and no food may be put in it. The food must go with the other canoes. In the center of the new canoe sits the souatomai, who caresses the canoe and invokes the spirits. Having reached water favorable for navigation, the crew starts to row, and the vessels shoot across the broad surface with the speed of arrows. The invocations of the suatomai become more and more animated; the iéfot, iéfot of the rowers, wilder and wilder. Strange /74/ canoes passing by must be careful about coming too close to the faremai, for it is sacred.' <sup id="cite_ref-448" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-448">[448]</a></sup> Men in turn were excluded from some female-gendered activities, such as childbirth: 'It is not so simple for a child to be born on Truk. One can call it a near miracle if a child escapes all who struggle for its life before and after birth. The woman in childbirth is separated from the other occupants of the house. She often occupies a little house built especially for the birth. One or another older woman from among the relatives, called soufam or souetikar (midwives), is to be found with her. Entrance is forbidden to all men.' <sup id="cite_ref-449" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-449">[449]</a></sup> According to Caughey, lineage leaders were usually male and brothers had authority over sisters: 'A lineage is conceived of as a group of siblings ( pwiipwi). In a group of real siblings, males have authority over females and the “eldest brother” ( mwaaniichi) is the leader. Within the lineage, the oldest male of the oldest generation is usually the “lineage leader” ( mmwen noon eterekes, [Page 65] “first inside of the lineage”).' <sup id="cite_ref-450" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-450">[450]</a></sup> According to Bollig, brothers were owed respect by sisters: 'As long as the children are small, they run around completely naked. When they become bigger and approach maturity, the boys receive their akadöwar (modesty band), the girls their atok (hip mat). From the day when the boy has his band he is considered a youth. The sister, when meeting him, must aporo, that is, bow. An old custom to indicate the age of a boy is connected with this modesty band. To the question, “How old is the boy?” comes the answer, for example, “ etö efärin” (= akadöwar), that is, a modesty band, which means that he has grown beyond the age of a boy. The natives do not have any precise estimate of their age. None of them is able [Page 99] to say how old he is with any exactness. To designate the stages of age, they have mönukol (1) 1 Literally: the conceived. , sediben (2) 2 “It has no will.” semirid (3) 3 “It cannot think.”  = child, that is, very small children. For somewhat bigger ones, the expressions äd, säri (boy), le[unknown]in (girl) are used; at maturity, whether married or not, öluöl (youth), fabul (young woman). Adult persons are called muan (man), fefin (woman).' <sup id="cite_ref-451" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-451">[451]</a></sup> However, women could hold property even without the husband's consent (Chuukese lineages were matrilineal): 'The position of the Truk woman in legal respects is not degrading. They are not weakly in the hands of the husband. I have seen men who were terribly henpecked. The women have their property, are able to acquire, buy, and sell without the husband’s consent. The children also belong exclusively to them. They have little work and for the most part are treated well, even if only to prevent them from running away. It is considered wrong to beat women.' <sup id="cite_ref-452" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-452">[452]</a></sup> We are unsure whether the above examples constitute differences in 'legal rights', but have assumed so for the time being.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Social class ♣ present ♥</b> As a clan-based society, the Chuukese were stratified according to lineage rather than social class: 'Chuuk's population is divided into a number of dispersed, matrilineal clans. Within any one district the several lineages are usually but not always of different clans. There are also personal kindreds. As a principle of clan and lineage membership, descent is matrilineal, but otherwise kinship is reckoned bilaterally.' <sup id="cite_ref-453" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-453">[453]</a></sup> 'The domestic unit was an extended family, based on the women of a lineage or sublineage. It consisted of at least one experienced older woman and two more younger women of childbearing age together with their husbands. Unmarried sons and brothers slept apart in their lineage's meeting house. Extended family households continued through the periods of foreign administration.' <sup id="cite_ref-454" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-454">[454]</a></sup> Chiefly status was tied to lineages in full ownership of territorial districts: 'In each district the lineage with title to its space held the chiefship. The several lineages with full or residual title to plots of soil had full residential rights. Lineages with only provisional titles to plots of soil in grant from other lineages had only conditional residential rights. Lineages with full residential rights maintained symbolic hearths where, with their client lineages, they prepared food to present to the chief in recognition of his lineage's ownership of the space.' <sup id="cite_ref-455" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-455">[455]</a></sup> Male chiefs were attached to the senior lineages of matrilineal descent groups: A district chiefship was divided between the oldest man in the senior female line in the chiefly lineage and the oldest man in the lineage generally. The latter was executive chief, or "chief of talk," and the former symbolic chief, or "chief of food." Food presentations were made to the symbolic chief. Sometimes the symbolic and executive functions fell to the same individual; often they did not. The symbolic chief was surrounded by his lineage brothers and by his sons, who acted as his agents. These followers and his sisters and daughters were of chiefly rank, distinct from commoners. Through conquest, a lineage might gain the chiefship in more than one district and establish a junior branch as the chiefly lineage in the conquered district. The now subordinate district rendered food presentations to the superordinate one. Most districts were linked in two rival leagues based on competing schools of magic and ritual relating to war, politics, and rhetoric. A chief's authority derived from two things. His lineage's ownership of the district's space entitled him to presentations of first fruits at stated times of the year. More importantly, it gave him authority over the conservation and use of the district's food resources. His authority also derived from his connection with the sky world, its gods, and their superhuman power to accomplish purposes. There was, therefore, a degree of sacredness associated with chiefs.' <sup id="cite_ref-456" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-456">[456]</a></sup> Bollig claims that members of chiefly lineages received preferential treatment in judicial matters due to nepotism: 'Another weak point of the chiefs is partiality. Members of the chief’s kin group, blood relatives, and friends are not readily punished, not even for serious crimes. On the other hand, poor devils whom the chief cannot bear are sentenced to hard labor for the slightest reason or are reported to the government as “disobedient ones” or “rebels.” In the old days the Truk chiefs did away with troublesome persons by means of the knife; today they do it by means of lies and false denunciations.' <sup id="cite_ref-457" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-457">[457]</a></sup> We are unsure whether the above examples constitute different 'legal rights' stratified according to 'social class', but have assumed so for the time being.</dd>

They are not weakly in the hands of the husband. I have seen men who were terribly henpecked. The women have their property, are able to acquire, buy, and sell without the husband’s consent.

It frequently happens that the brothers, in case the children are minors, take all the lands in order to administer them, whereby one piece or another remains in their hands forever. In general the father considers only the children from the present marriage. Children from former marriages, who live with the mother’s relatives, are not considered.

Thus, somebody may possess a piece of land, but the trees that stand on it belong to other people. They or their parents once planted the trees on his property, which is permissible according to Truk customs. If the owners of the trees are dishonest, they need only clear the field beginning from the trees, continue to cultivate, and the poor owner is dispossessed. What confused situations that causes in the case of an eventual transfer of the piece of land to another is easily understandable. I myself have had difficulties for years, since certain people still held on to “their” trees after the piece of land had long been the property of the mission. Only the felling of the trees put an end to all claims.' <sup id="cite_ref-471" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-471">[471]</a></sup> According to Bollig, land disputes were common: 'The land rights of the Truk people are not based on justice, but on the right of the stronger, the cleverer. There is hardly a plot of land with a clear legal history, and for that reason there are the constant assertions of legal claims, the eternal lawsuits over land. The boldest and most cunning persons always have the best land on Truk. Pretenses for bringing legal claims to foreign property before the chief are easily found in the confused conditions. And once they are found, the Kanakas’ inexhaustible power of invention and art of lying take care of making them convincing to others. That briberies of chiefs, interpreters, and witnesses play a tremendous part in this is obvious, considering the character of the Truk people. No means is too wicked for them in order to “profit. ”' <sup id="cite_ref-472" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-472">[472]</a></sup> Bollig attributes this issue to land exchanges and vague boundaries: 'A source of land disputes is the exchange of lands. For example: Soni and Soledon exchange two pieces of land. Soni now cultivates his land, while Soledon lets it lie fallow. Soledon dies. His children, who are not on good terms with Soni, cancel the exchange and take possession of the productive piece of land as property of their deceased father. Soni resists. The parties quarrel for years. Sometimes the one wins, sometimes the other, but no one yields.' <sup id="cite_ref-473" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-473">[473]</a></sup> 'The boundaries of the lands are very vague. They change continually under the hands of both neighbors. Sometimes the one, sometimes the other one, goes beyond them. Then they quarrel. What A has planted B tears out, with the argument that it is already on his territory. What B has planted A tears out, with the same argument. Now which of the two is right?' <sup id="cite_ref-474" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-474">[474]</a></sup> 'With such uncertain legal conditions it is not at all surprising that quarrels over land are daily events on Truk. Every death, every divorce, every new marriage has a coil of rats’ tails in quarrels as a result. The boundless egotism of the Truk natives is responsible for all this. Everybody wants to have as much as possible. A Trukese can quarrel for years about a tree, a plant, or a foot of land, even though he has plenty of trees that are not producing anything because of lack of care. The German government gave the natives land documents on which the owner, along with all his pieces of land, was recorded. /123/ The hopes placed on this have not been fulfilled. Today everything is as confused as before.' <sup id="cite_ref-475" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-475">[475]</a></sup> It is unclear whether these disputes were endemic even before colonization or a consequence thereof. Bollig also describes strategies for claiming and asserting rights over land and plantings:  'The natives try to document their right of ownership to pieces of land by clearing something on it from time to time, or they build huts on the individual pieces of land, which they then inhabit temporarily. Dying fathers give their children directions to bury them on their pieces of land so that their grave might thus be proof of ownership for the future. One can often hear in the kobu[unknown] that this is precisely what the people refer to.' <sup id="cite_ref-476" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-476">[476]</a></sup> 'The riri, that is, to bind, forms a strange title deed on the Truk Islands. For example, somebody sees a tree which bears many fruits. Since he would like some too, he takes the ubud of a coconut palm and wraps it around a branch of the tree in order to make his intention known publicly. In many cases the owner resists such oppression and tears off the ubud. But also in many cases he keeps quiet in order to avoid bigger quarrels.' <sup id="cite_ref-477" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-477">[477]</a></sup> 'I myself have had experiences with the riri in that the girls “bound” pineapples for themselves on my plot of land, which I did not allow, of course. The riri is also done in connection with animals, only by words here, of course. They say, for example: “ A riri lon lelugei enan tugo, it is bound in my heart, this chicken, ” that is, it is my property. Then they also further take the wor d riri with a moral obligation. One says, for example: [Page 135] “U a riri uon enan a[unknown]a[unknown], I am bound to that work, ” that is, I am obliged to do it. In any case the former riri is the root of the latter.' <sup id="cite_ref-478" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-478">[478]</a></sup> A wide variety of goods could be transferred through barter: 'The acquisition of property on Truk is usually done by means of barter. Lands, houses, and canoes are bartered. Smaller units of exchange are sebi (wooden bowls), deig (curcuma), faupar (red shell disks), hip mats, modesty bands, fishing nets, aromatic oils, coconut cord, home-grown tobacco, and sleeping mats. These products of native industry are not present in like quantity or in like quality on all the islands. Thus, Sapesis on Fefan is famous for its fine bowls, Pol for curcuma and oils, Iluk for its fine hip mats.' <sup id="cite_ref-479" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-479">[479]</a></sup> While rights in land were unevenly distributed, the above examples demonstrate that everyone could own and exchange property.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>♠ recruitment of chief executive ♣ equal ♥</b> The population was stratified according to lineages: 'The Truk people are divided into hundreds of tribes and tribelets, whose number of members exhibits the greatest dissimilarities. There are some who number scarcely 10 and some who count 100 to 200 members. The most varied kin-groups live together in such a tribe. Thus, the tribe of the Sabu people on the island of Iluk, amounting to about 120 persons, includes members of the kin groups Witö, Atau, Soborelo[unknown], Ipä[unknown]es, Sobu, [Page 124] and Fesinim, some of whom came into the tribe through adoption and some through marriage. The members of a tribe usually live together in irregularly laid out, small communities. Only a few live in the mountains by themselves.' <sup id="cite_ref-494" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-494">[494]</a></sup> Chiefs were members of senior lineages: 'Each tribe has its chief ( somol ki), often even two or three. The chiefs, as a rule, are taken from the kin group which was the dominant one from the beginning and perhaps first settled on the land concerned. Thus, on Uman the Fesinim kin group rules; on Poloas, Immo; and on Fefan, Soufar. The Pue kin group rose in this island and occupies many a chief’s seat. Atau governs on Faituk, Sepelo on Udot, after Ipä[unknown]es perished in the wars, and Sapulupi on Wöla. In all there might be 400 to 500 chiefs. If one considers that the total population of the Truk lagoon hardly amounts to 12,000 people, the number of chiefs must be designated as unnaturally large. In spite of the fact that one such chief has a small area with few people under him, compactness and co-operation are missing. Although the chief proudly calls himself awen fanu, mouth of the land, lugen fanu, heart of the land, or säli[unknown]en fanu, ear of the land, he generally has little to say. Only some one or other understands how to keep his people together, because he knows how to gain influence as a result of previous warlike deeds or personal cunning and lack of consideration. In addition to this, several who live in his territory come from other tribes, pay tribute to their homeland chief, and do not concern themselves about him.' <sup id="cite_ref-495" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-495">[495]</a></sup> They were succeeded by brothers and brothers' sons: 'There is always provision for a successor for a deceased chief. The children are not qualified to inherit, but eo ipso his brothers, and, to be sure, according to age. If there are no longer any brothers, then come the children of the brothers. It is said of somebody who has improperly become chief that he is not popun somol ( popun = tribe), that is, legitimate chief.' <sup id="cite_ref-496" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-496">[496]</a></sup> 'When a chief becomes old and weak, he usually has a younger person at his side who performs the more difficult tasks.

<dd> <b>♠ Corvée labor to a landowner ♣ present ♥</b> Chiefs were owed first fruits: 'As a reward for his faithful activity, the chief receives the muen, that is, the first fruits from the yields of the fields and trees, for example, breadfruit, bananas, and taro. It is said that many chiefs go to the fields in order to inspect their condition so that if the occasion arises they can check the deliveries. The Truk chiefs do not have any other legal claims. Nevertheless their subjects give them assistance in their own interests. The chief usually receives the best part from festive meals and fishing. If there is fishing with mention of the name of the chief, however, he receives everything, and nobody is allowed to withhold anything. Woe to the one who in former times did not pay his tribute properly. He had no prospect of a long life. It is said of the old chiefs that they always had the blow shell beside them. When the puk, puk of the shell resounded from the chief’s house, the people knew its meaning immediately. They quickly came running in order to /117/ learn the wishes of the tyrant. At one time he would desire kon (pounded breadfruit), at another time fish, then [Page 128] bananas, then coconuts to drink. The chiefs today no longer dare commit these outrages but they still have sufficient means to obtain some things on the side. They announce a dance, for example, or hold an efilul (celebration in connection with house-building, held when the frame is erected). They certainly do not come out short at the feast connected with this. As a matter of fact, most chiefs understand very well how to entice from their people whatever they might like to have.' <sup id="cite_ref-501" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-501">[501]</a></sup> Junior lineages and provisional title holders owed food prestations to chiefs on the occasion of feasts: 'As noted above, the relations between a chief and the people of his district are patterned largely after the relations between the parties in divided ownership. As provisional title holders to territory, the various lineages owe the chief periodic gifts of produce from the land. These gifts are rendered at stated times in connection with feasts given in the chief’s honor. He fixes the time for these feasts in accordance with a seasonal calendar: two feasts during the breadfruit season, and two more during the turmeric season. The men of the various lineages prepare breadfruit in giant wooden bowls while the women fish. Other types of food are also collected. On the day of the feast each lineage brings its food in a procession, the men carrying the giant bowls on frames and chanting as they walk. The food is carried into the meeting house of the chief’s lineage. The chief then selects the largest bowl for himself and his lineage mates and redistributes the rest of the food to the assembled population. The distribution is made according to lineage and is roughly proportional to the size of each lineage. The contributions which each lineage makes are also proportional to the size of its membership and the amount of productive land which it controls. If a lineage fails in this obligation, the chief has the right to confiscate its holdings. Should he indicate dissatisfaction with the contribution of a particular lineage, its members will hasten to prepare additional food and other gifts to mollify him.' <sup id="cite_ref-502" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-502">[502]</a></sup></dd>

Yet I have also heard of cases in which the prisoners were spared on please of the women and were later released. The slain enemies were cut into pieces. /106/ In the frenzy some drank their blood or cut pieces from the soft parts, roasted them, and ate them to cool their vengeance.' <sup id="cite_ref-503" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-503">[503]</a></sup> He also mentions what appears to be a form of human sacrifice: 'The spirit Paladiu on the island of Falanu is even more modest. Human excrement satisfies him as an offering. During a war human sacrifices seem to have been offered also. At least cases are known where captives had their throats cut over the graves of those who had fallen, so that the blood would be sprinkled over them.' <sup id="cite_ref-504" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-504">[504]</a></sup> Bollig also claims the ritual mutilation of dead enemies: 'When the plans were ready and the preparations completed, the entire body of troops gathered opposite the enemy territory at a place which was suitable for the battle (rasen moun). Here the ida[unknown] put up the önusoso or soönu (erected spirit). This önusoso was a wooden figure which represented a human being or an animal, for example, shark, hake. In some cases a corpse itself was used. For example, such a soönu was to be found on the premises of the mission on Fautuen. It was the corpse of an enemy warrior who had been treacherously killed. It was set against a tree stump, with the face toward the country of the enemy. The face was terribly disfigured, in that the lips were cut off. The mouth stood open, prevented from closing by a spike of bone. In its hand the corpse held a spear which likewise was directed toward the enemy.' <sup id="cite_ref-505" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-505">[505]</a></sup> LeBar denies the cannibalization of enemies: 'Informants denied that slain enemies were ever eaten on Truk. A variant way of handling the dead in the old days required that the corpse be wrapped in mats and hung in the house. Relatives might show their fondness for the deceased by eating [Page 223] a bit of the flesh or drinking a few drops of the body fluids collected in a bowl beneath the corpse.' <sup id="cite_ref-506" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-506">[506]</a></sup> We have provisionally followed Bollig as heprovides more material overall, but expert feedback is needed on the matter..</dd>

</p><p><b>Description of the Normative Ideology</b>
</p><p>Religious beliefs centred on mana and spirit beings: 'In traditional belief, spirit beings were widely distributed in the sky, under the sea, and on land. The important places among spirit lands in the sky were: a region under the dome of Heaven, home of the gods who could take human form; a region in the south from which came all the plant and marine life that gave people food; and a region named 'Achaw' or 'Kachaw,' abode of the ancestors of many Chuukese clans and particularly of the clans associated with the chiefship and the special bodies of magical lore from which chiefly power derived. Spirits could accomplish their intentions at will and were thus the source of all that was MANAMAN (mana), such as efficacious spells, medicines, and rituals. Good souls of the dead were consulted through mediums. The Chuukese also invoked in spells the spirits inhabiting the dome of Heaven, presided over by 'Great Spirit,' and the spirits associated with particular crafts and major bodies of lore.' <sup id="cite_ref-507" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-507">[507]</a></sup> Illness was attributed to the agency of malevolent spirits: 'Sickness was believed to result from the 'bite' of a malevolent spirit, or of any other spirit one had offended or that was controlled by a ritual specialist one had offended or by a sorcerer. Sickness might also result from soul loss. In all but the latter case, treatment involved the use of medicines to be applied externally, to be drunk, or to be inhaled. For soul loss, a spirit medium was consulted to help find and restore the soul. Divination was used as a diagnostic aid in cases of severe or prolonged illness. Massage was used to treat bruises, local infections, and muscle ailments.' <sup id="cite_ref-508" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-508">[508]</a></sup> A variety of ritual specialists were active: 'Ritual practices were conducted by their own specialists. They included spirit mediums, breadfruit summoners, fish summoners, healers, masters of spells, masters of sorcery, builders, navigators, diviners, and most importantly the masters of magic and ritual relating to war and politics. Their knowledge was private property passed down to their children and junior lineage mates.' <sup id="cite_ref-509" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-509">[509]</a></sup> 'Major ceremonies were those associated with death, communicating with good souls of the dead, summoning breadfruit, and making food presentations to chiefs. Ritual was also associated with divination, curing, warfare, political meetings, house building, and courtship.' <sup id="cite_ref-510" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-510">[510]</a></sup> The Chuuk islands experienced a higher degree of regional ceremonial integration prior to the 18th century (see above under 'preceding quasi-polity'). Whatever information is available on this would have to be covered in an additional data sheet.
</p><p>Note: We have not found much material on morality and ideology. Accordingly, the below information may be incomplete. As no written records explicating normative ideology were present, values have to be inferred from oral histories and everyday behavior: 'When the people of Fáánakkar talk about character and valuables, they assume certain definitions and rules, but they [Page 160] also typically retell or allude to a set of standard illustrative stories in which the rules are encoded. That is, each value label conjures up in people’s minds a series of basic images embodied in a stock of stories about people who behaved with extraordinary bravery, arrogance, or strong thought. Sometimes these stories are based on the semi-legendary exploits of people in the old days ( e.g., the story of how C.J. killed the outer island sorcerer or the tale about the arrogance of N.P., and how he was stabbed by the wronged chief’s nephew). Other stories involve the dramatic behavior of people in the community today ( e.g., accounts of major boundary disputes, knife fights, sorcery battles, and sumptuous feasts). The situations and events in these stories provide a person with standards for measuring the conduct of other people and guidelines for behaving.'  <sup id="cite_ref-511" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-511">[511]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Rulers are legitimated by gods ♣ present ♥</b> According to Goodenough, chiefs were thought to be connected with the sky world, its gods and its mana: 'A chief's authority derived from two things. His lineage's ownership of the district's space entitled him to presentations of first fruits at stated times of the year. More importantly, it gave him authority over the conservation and use of the district's food resources. His authority also derived from his connection with the sky world, its gods, and their superhuman power to accomplish purposes. There was, therefore, a degree of sacredness associated with chiefs.' <sup id="cite_ref-512" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-512">[512]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Rulers control supernatural energy ♣ present ♥</b> Chiefs and their associates employed sorcery for coercive purposes: 'There were no police. A chief's brothers or sons might act on his behalf to intimidate or attack someone who had offended him. But it was control of magical power, either by the chief or one his brothers or sons, that made improper conduct liable to punishment. Major craft specialists could also make ill those who violated the taboos of their craft. Finally, members of chiefly lineages and their close associates were likely to have knowledge of sorcery. All such knowledge gave punitive power to chiefs and important specialists. People stressed maintaining the appearance of propriety in behavior so as not to give just cause for offense.' <sup id="cite_ref-513" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-513">[513]</a></sup> However, sorcery was employed in interpersonal conflicts as well, meaning that chiefs had no exclusive control over it: 'Sorcery is a more direct if more secret form of aggression and is practically precluded from being applied within the lineage by the fact that the spells used are in each case the property of a given lineage. While it is not clear whether they would be considered effective, it is very doubtful that they would be used against others who knew them or could be expected to know them. Data on sorcery are difficult to obtain for no one admits to being a sorcerer. Those cases of afflictions (blindness, psychosis, and paralysis) which were definitely attributed to a given sorcerer always applied to someone on another island, angry because his wife had been taken away, his property trespassed upon, or the like. Although various people on Romonum were said to know certain techniques of sorcery and many people expressed a fear of being sorcerized, no one would say that a given person had actually sorcerized anyone. The detailed body of knowledge of procedures in sorcery which exists and the circumstantial accounts of how it was formerly used certainly suggest very strongly that in the past Trukese deliberately sorcerized other Trukese. Whether this is the case today, however, is an open question. In the past [Page 150] it was used by master magicians, both against rival magicians and against the laity, and was also used in the punishment of thieves; but then as now sorcery was primarily the result of one person’s animosity against another and as such acted as a sanction against acts which might antagonize another. Thus anxiety about sorcery is another factor weighing the balance in favor of conformist behavior.' <sup id="cite_ref-514" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-514">[514]</a></sup>

</p><p><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of monogamy ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> According to Bollig, polygyny was fairly common: 'Polygamy (1) 1 a akaruu, he has two wives; a akaulu[unknown]at, he has three wives, etc. is very widespread on Truk. Men with two to nine wives are numerous. One becomes polygamous through the death of his brother, for out of brotherly love he has an obligation to take the widow for himself (levirate marriage). Another one marries a widow with daughters and takes the latter, as soon as they are old enough, as secondary wives. A third takes the sisters of his wife for himself, which is the case for most polygamous situations. The reasons for polygamy vary. One wants to keep landed property together by this means, or to concentrate it in his hands; another wants to have workers, since the secondary wives fish for him. Strangely enough, the motive forces for polygamy are said to be mostly the women themselves. They offer their daughters, sisters, [Page 109] and nieces to their husbands as secondary wives, in order that no strange family come in. This happens especially if they have no children, for if a strange woman comes in and gives birth to children, they will be pushed aside. They try to prevent this by means of the above measure. If polygamy has come about in this way, a peaceful life together is possible, for the women stay together in their own interests. But if the women come from different families or tribes, living together is out of the question. They live apart, and the man has the pleasant task of going back and forth. Unpleasantness and jealousy between the rivals are the order of the day. First one and then the other thinks she is being slighted. First one is tired, then the other. And the husband must always be on the move in order to keep everybody happy. Some polygamous situations which I knew were changing constantly. At one time the husband had four, then some ran away, later they increased to six, etc. A somewhat decent family life is inconceivable. The eventual /101/ children always go with the mother, but the father knows the means for drawing them to him when they are older, so that he will have a work force. Some polygamists are very generous with their wives. They are quickly ready to hand them over to their unmarried relatives, because it gives them advantages. They are able to take a new one and still consider the old one indirectly as their own.' <sup id="cite_ref-557" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-557">[557]</a></sup> Polyandry, on the other hand, was rare: 'Polyandry seems to be rarer. I knew of only one case, in which two brothers had a common wife.' <sup id="cite_ref-558" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-558">[558]</a></sup> But Caughey claims that monogamy was the norm: 'In the traditional society polygynous marriages rarely occurred. Since marriage sets up heavy obligations to the wife’s lineage, most men did not want to increase this burden, especially by marrying into different lineages. Interpreted differently, the same reasons provided the rationale for those few cases of polygny that did occur. A man who married more than one wife demonstrated his importance and power. It showed that he was capable of engaging in burdensome social relationships with more than one lineage or that he was able to turn this subordinate relationship into one where he dominated. A famous man of bravery on Fáánakkar was once married at the same time to five wives from four different lineages. Later, in a grand gesture of kindness, he gave one of them away to a wifeless brother.' <sup id="cite_ref-559" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-559">[559]</a></sup>

<dl><dd><b>♠ charity ♣ absent ♥</b> Philanthropic foundations were introduced in the colonial period. Prior to colonization, informal patterns of self-help, neighbourly assistance and support from the matrilineage fulfilled these functions: 'Within its district each lineage owns a particular plot of land which is regarded as its “true home” or “lineage center” ( imweyiche). The dwelling houses of resident members are typically clustered at this site, and members living elsewhere frequently return here to visit. Persons residing at the lineage center will include some genealogical members of the lineage plus other people who have current links to resident members.

He also has lesser but important rights and obligations to members of his father’s lineage and to members of his spouse’s lineage (for a man this will also be the lineage of his children).

<dd><b>♠ production of public goods ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> It appears that there was little production of public works other than feasts prior to colonization (see below). Details on the construction of men's houses and the extent of cooperation involved therein are still needed.

<dd><b>♠ communal dining ♣ present ♥</b> Islanders prepared food for feasts held by chiefs: 'As noted above, the relations between a chief and the people of his district are patterned largely after the relations between the parties in divided ownership. As provisional title holders to territory, the various lineages owe the chief periodic gifts of produce from the land. These gifts are rendered at stated times in connection with feasts given in the chief’s honor. He fixes the time for these feasts in accordance with a seasonal calendar: two feasts during the breadfruit season, and two more during the turmeric season. The men of the various lineages prepare breadfruit in giant wooden bowls while the women fish. Other types of food are also collected. On the day of the feast each lineage brings its food in a procession, the men carrying the giant bowls on frames and chanting as they walk. The food is carried into the meeting house of the chief’s lineage. The chief then selects the largest bowl for himself and his lineage mates and redistributes the rest of the food to the assembled population. The distribution is made according to lineage and is roughly proportional to the size of each lineage. The contributions which each lineage makes are also proportional to the size of its membership and the amount of productive land which it controls. If a lineage fails in this obligation, the chief has the right to confiscate its holdings. Should he indicate dissatisfaction with the contribution of a particular lineage, its members will hasten to prepare additional food and other gifts to mollify him.' <sup id="cite_ref-563" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-563">[563]</a></sup> Bollig describes the preparations for a festival: 'Both develop a feverish activity. The men prepare whole mountains of food. Whatever is found in the plantings is dragged out. The women too get no rest. They are constantly squatting in the water in order to snatch at a little tail. If the supplies of their own tribe are not sufficient, friends on other islands have [Page 201] to help out, for which equal help is given to them in a similar situation. There is movement on all roads on the morning of the fadanap day, for no Kanaka wants to be absent when there is something to chew. All are loaded with bananas, pineapples, sugar cane, coconuts, and fish, which they carry to the chief’s house, where everything is piled up. Very rich ones also bring such European goods as rice, biscuits, salmon; indeed, even beer and liquor could not be lacking in Japanese times. The most festive moment is the bringing of the large madün bowls. Cautiously they come rocking along, carried on the shoulders of strong men. The carriers are painted, /183/ adorned, and sing their emoir. When the fadanap participants are in two parties, they approach from different sides, singing to each other. But usually one tribe or the other takes it badly, since ancient hostility prevails among all the tribes. They quarrel with each other, throw food at their heads, and not infrequently bring knives and spears into play.' <sup id="cite_ref-564" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-564">[564]</a></sup> Hospitality was expected, but food sorcery was designed to discourage the abuse of hospitality obligations: 'General food sorcery can be used to aggress against and attempt to control the actions of people who take too great advantage of hospitality patterns. These patterns require that all persons who are present any time food is consumed be invited to participate in the meal. The only strong sanction that can be used against those who become more or less permanent guests is the threat of food sorcery. In addition, these sanctions can be manipulated to keep relatives eating at home, in which case they can also be induced to contribute their labor to help in supplying provisions.' <sup id="cite_ref-565" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-565">[565]</a></sup> 'The food sorcery of sub-division B placed a restraint on those who would take undue advantage of hospitality patterns. It can work two ways, by helping prevent depredations on a lineage’s own food supply, and sometimes through illness, reminding lineage members that their safest place is back home helping their own lineages.' <sup id="cite_ref-566" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-566">[566]</a></sup></dd>

<p><b>Supernatural beings (e.g., gods, spirits, ancestors)</b>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>♠ Number of officially sanctioned supernatural beings ♣ polytheistic ♥</b> 'Besides Önulap, the Jupiter of the Truk people, there is still a large number of others, in part male, in part female, in part sympathetic, in part unsympathetic. The gods in their customs are often not a bit better than the Truk people themselves. They eat, drink, dance, play, marry, and also perform many a trick which is not at all appropriate for gods. Even Önulap, although the best one in the sky, is a true old Kanaka chief, who lies on his mat in his hut and stares straight ahead. Just like the Truk regions, they have also transplanted in the sky the inhabitants with their good and bad qualities. Is one justified in ridiculing or blaming them, since we have observed the same thing among anciently civilized peoples. Let us look more closely at some of these gods. Semenkoror (father of wisdom) is a brother of Önulap. Human beings are in debt to him for many skills, for which he stands in the highest esteem among all the natives. Silelap (the master), Äremei (achiever), Ämarourou (chatterer), Nugeila[unknown] (the mediator in the sky), Soukuli[unknown], Ororofit, Semoutut (the one not moving). Nothing was to be learned about the activities of these gods individually.'<sup id="cite_ref-577" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-577">[577]</a></sup> 'The most unsympathetic one of all is Olfäd (the treader). He was given the name “Treader” because, according to a legend, he is supposed to have produced a great number of small islands near Uman by a step with his foot. That is, a girl whom he wanted to marry reproached him for his poverty, whereupon in anger he trod [Page 8] these islands out of the sea. The most extraordinary things are told about Olfäd. On account of his cunning, his evil tricks, he is unpopular among gods and human beings.'<sup id="cite_ref-578" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-578">[578]</a></sup>  'Besides the gods, there is also a large number of goddesses, among whom the two sisters Nisärere and Nipälou are the most interesting. They are regarded as patronesses of the art of weaving and are frequently invoked by the women.'<sup id="cite_ref-579" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-579">[579]</a></sup> 'Neanean (the wisher) is a happy goddess. She need only wish for something and it is there immediately.'<sup id="cite_ref-580" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-580">[580]</a></sup> 'What Olfäd is among the gods, Inemes (mother of the face) is among the goddesses. Her love potions and love magic confuse all hearts. She is the protectress of lechery, the Venus of the Truk people. Opinions vary concerning her appearance. Some call her ugly, infected with a skin disease; others, as pretty. The latter seems to be the correct one.'<sup id="cite_ref-581" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-581">[581]</a></sup> 'Inemes also has a daughter, who has the significant name of Ururupuin (night flirt). With regard to morals she has the same point of view as her mother.'<sup id="cite_ref-582" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-582">[582]</a></sup> 'The Truk people think of the sky as inhabited by gods, and the earth, by spirits. Yet all these spirits come from Önulap and are subject to his leadership.'<sup id="cite_ref-583" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-583">[583]</a></sup> 'Nigoubub (the procreatress) is a female spirit. She produced earth and human beings at Önulap’s command. The islanders conceive of Nigoubub as a female eel at whose breast the earth rests. When she turns, the earth trembles. That is the Truk people’s explanation for earthquakes. Women who desire children or those who are in labor worship Nigoubub. Nigoubub’s companion is Niro[unknown]epü[unknown] (she who hears the sound). She lives in holes in the earth in the shape of a large crab. She comes out at night and creeps about. The sound of the steps of approaching human beings drives her away. If she bites a person in the foot, he will become deaf. In the säd (3) 3 säd is low water along the land. live the tölöken (4) 4 tol is peak, comb in the case of chickens, dorsal fin in the case of fish. ken = sharp, pointed. [illegible]. They are the creators and rulers of the säd and of the fish living in these quarters. Loubon (he who lives in the interior) is an important tölöken. Weather and typhoons are subject to him.'<sup id="cite_ref-584" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-584">[584]</a></sup> 'Creators and rulers of the deep waters are the osen madau (voices of the sea) and the nidudun (female sea-divers). The former are male, the latter female. They are often mentioned in the rales of the seafarers.'<sup id="cite_ref-585" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-585">[585]</a></sup> 'On the mountains dwell the notorious osen tuk (voices of the mountains), who have already devoured many a human being. The one called Önun pelien or Resim (5) 5 resim = rainbow. is regarded as the ruler of the rainbow and therefore especially dangerous for seafarers. The rainbow does not evoke any friendly feelings among the islanders, since they consider it a sign of death. Among the women Soumöröges is loved and hated, for the children’s souls are subject to him. He brings them and takes them away again upon the death of the child. Kir is a malicious spirit who dries up the breasts of nursing women.'<sup id="cite_ref-586" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-586">[586]</a></sup> 'Spirits, the so-called önunumai (3) 3 önu = spirit, mai = breadfruit. , also dwell in the trees, [Page 14] especially in the breadfruit trees. Säli[unknown]eruu (the two-eared) is a spirit who sows discontent among human beings. Ke de Säli[unknown]eruu, you should not be two-eared, is an admonition frequently given to those who let themselves be influenced by all sides.'<sup id="cite_ref-587" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-587">[587]</a></sup> 'Spirits, the önunupun, are likewise found in the earth. All these spirits, whose number is boundless, are more or less forces of nature, phenomena which the natives are unable to explain and therefore ascribe to spirits. The natives imagine these nature spirits in every possible shape. Some are hardly distinguishable from true human beings. Others have long hair all over their bodies and the teeth of a boar. Some have eyes in front and in back, etc. Many islanders [unknown]bstinately maintain that they have seen such beings. They play an important part in the old legends [unknown]and tales. The story of brave men who defeated and rendered harmless such man-eating spirits always excites general applause among the audience. According to the view of the Truk people everything has a soul, even plants and animals. But their souls perish with the matter. The /14/ human being has two souls, a [unknown]unuot and a [unknown]unu[unknown]au, that is, a good one and a bad one, or, better said, a beautiful soul and an ugly soul. The beautiful soul resembles a beautiful person; the ugly soul, an ugly person. The manner of existence of these two souls is different. The [unknown]unu[unknown]au has grown together with the body and cannot leave it during its lifetime. [Page 15] The [unknown]unuot, on the other hand, rests on the shoulder of the person. It is lightly winged, like a bird, and can fly away. But an absence of some time would result in the early death of the person. The natives maintain about insane persons that they no longer have any [unknown]unuot. The Truk people explain dreams by the flying away of the good soul. On Truk “A dreams of B” means nothing but that the souls of A and B have flown away and have met in the gathering of the souls of the deceased. If one frightens an islander so that he starts, he will say: “ A äsilo [unknown]uni,” that is, “my soul has flown away.” When a dying person has ceased struggling, it is said: “ A lo [unknown]unun, his soul has gone away.”'<sup id="cite_ref-588" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-588">[588]</a></sup></dd>

Having everything go well is brought about by the protection of the önu; things go badly because of their inflicting punishment on human beings. Thus, everything adverse in the world is punishment for the violation of the commands or prohibitions which the önu, and especially Önulap, have imposed on h human beings. The Truk people also say about disagreeable events: tinien Önulap, that is, decree of the “Great Spirit.” When an önu punishes a human being, the natives express this in the phrase önu a ku, the spirit has bitten. This “bite” manifests itself in various ways: by the swelling of limbs, stiff neck, maimings, epilepsy, sudden death, etc. The “bites” are regularly directed [Page 29] against a person’s life, which accounts for the fact that the natives are concerned about manau, life, more than anything else.

"The fate of one's good soul after death was not a matter of reward or punishment for good or evil deeds.

He then propped Mwaatejinyk’s mouth open with a stick so that his ghost would go and devour the Mwej people in revenge.

<dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of human reciprocity ♣ inferred present ♥ </b> This is 20th century ethnographic data but has continuity from late 19th century practices: Gods had control of a spirit power that could influence how well other's lives went in terms of work and property. An enuusor was a kind of spirit that could dish out power to mediums with knowledge of sorcery and spells. If one was "effective" in building houses, fulfilling family and social duties etc. they had a better chance of becoming a spirit who could influence the lives of their kin from the afterlife: "A person who appeared to be well above the average in effectiveness might be seen as having a good soul with a better than average chance of becoming an enuusor (effecting spirit)" <sup id="cite_ref-601" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-601">[601]</a></sup>.

<dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of kinship obligations ♣ inferred present ♥ </b> "Quarrels among siblings were most regrettable and could, if serious, bring illness to themselves or their children through the displeasure of their deceased elders." <sup id="cite_ref-605" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-605">[605]</a></sup> This is 20th century ethnographic data but has continuity from late 19th century practices: "There was much talk also of demons and ghosts; and adults made no effort to conceal their own fear of them from their children. Illness was attributed to the malevolence of demons and ghosts. A person was vulnerable to attack by them when he was away from human settlement and was alone. This is frequent reference in Gladwin's data to parents warning children against going off by themselves (Gladwin and Sarason 1953). Good spirits of the dead, whose favor could be helpful, would also punish their living relatives with sickness and death for improper behaviour and ill will among people who were close kin." <sup id="cite_ref-606" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-606">[606]</a></sup> Based on early 20th century accounts: Spirits of the soil could give elephantiasis through biting those who remained on their taro patches too late into the day.

In the 19th century, the people of Truk as a whole were considered highly aggressive in comparison to those of other areas in Micronesia. “As is well known, 19th century whalers and other travelers avoided Truk because of its reputation for belligerency toward outsiders, and within the atoll itself warfare was frequent. Although the Spanish held title to Truk from 1885 to 1889 and theoretically administered it [Page 174] from their base at Ponape, they actually did not govern the island. The bellicose nature of the people of Truk was a factor in the Spanish avoidance of the area” (Swartz 1965:17). My information about warfare on 19th century Faanakkar clearly fits this picture as do the reports of Germans who lived on Truk in the early 20th century. “Truk was one big battlefield. Island fought against island, tribe against tribe. On one day two villages were co-operating; on the next day they were fighting each other. There was constant killing in an ever changing situation” (Bollig 1927:104). Evidently aggressiveness was also common on 19th century Romonum. In tracing the history of Romonum from 1850 to 1903, Goodenough notes that the history begins with a fight, and his account shows that it was permeated by assassinations, bloody feuds, sorcery battles, and warfare with neighboring islands (1951:148-161). Gladwin and Sarason (1953:41) provide additional supporting evidence. It also appears that this aggressive behavior was associated with an ideal of bravery similar to that on Faanakkar. An example from Goodenough’s history of Romonum will illustrate this point. The incident begins just after assassins, who sneaked up to his meeting house and poked their rifles through the thatch wall, have shot and killed the chief Mwaatejinyk: “All of the occupants of the wuut fled in panic except for Wenejog... Mwaatejinyk’s grandson. He picked up his grandfather’s body and carried it out of the wuut to prevent its falling into the assassin’s hands. Carrying it down to the north shore of the island, he proceeded west along the rocks on the shore and then climbed back up to... where Mwaatejinyk had lived.... Here Wenejóg buried his grandfather in an upright position leaving his head above ground and facing in the direction of the Pwereka 1 house (his enemy’s lineage center).... He then propped Mwaatejinyk’s mouth open with a stick so that his ghost would go and devour the Mwej people in revenge.

They slept on the same mat with their mothers. By age 3 they were expected to begin to look after themselves. Children were lectured on correct social behavior, but were not held fully accountable for it until they became junior adults. Parents used switches to punish. Often persuaded to do what others wanted with promises that were broken afterwards, children learned to be wary of the intentions of others. They enjoyed much freedom to play, sharpening their physical skills. Transmission of special lore and knowledge became increasingly important as children grew to be young adults. The eldest son and eldest daughter were treated differently from other children. Their persons were inviolate, their wishes were honored, and they were not liable to physical punishment.'<sup id="cite_ref-622" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-622">[622]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b>♠ respect for authority ♣ inferred present ♥</b> Chiefs were owed food prestations for feasts: 'As noted above, the relations between a chief and the people of his district are patterned largely after the relations between the parties in divided ownership. As provisional title holders to territory, the various lineages owe the chief periodic gifts of produce from the land. These gifts are rendered at stated times in connection with feasts given in the chief’s honor. He fixes the time for these feasts in accordance with a seasonal calendar: two feasts during the breadfruit season, and two more during the turmeric season. The men of the various lineages prepare breadfruit in giant wooden bowls while the women fish. Other types of food are also collected. On the day of the feast each lineage brings its food in a procession, the men carrying the giant bowls on frames and chanting as they walk. The food is carried into the meeting house of the chief’s lineage. The chief then selects the largest bowl for himself and his lineage mates and redistributes the rest of the food to the assembled population. The distribution is made according to lineage and is roughly proportional to the size of each lineage. The contributions which each lineage makes are also proportional to the size of its membership and the amount of productive land which it controls. If a lineage fails in this obligation, the chief has the right to confiscate its holdings. Should he indicate dissatisfaction with the contribution of a particular lineage, its members will hasten to prepare additional food and other gifts to mollify him.'<sup id="cite_ref-624" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-624">[624]</a></sup> Interactions between chiefs and commoners were regulated by a number of taboos: 'Everyone who was not a consanguineal or affinal relative of the chief was heavily “taboo from setting himself above” him. This involved saying “ faajiro” as an expression of respect on meeting a chief. If further required that one crouch or crawl in the chief’s presence if he was seated, for it was forbidden to have one’s head on a higher plane than his. One avoided initiating social interaction with a chief, unless the need was urgent, in which case one made him a gift and then waited the chief’s pleasure. One could not persist in refusing a chief’s request without being guilty of namanam tekija (arrogant behavior), nor could one address him harshly or belligerently. For persons other than his relatives, a chief occupied the most heavily taboo status with respect to behavior of this kind. (The other categories of persons who shared this status with the chief were jiuag and pwëny (navigators).) His consanguineal and affinal kinsmen, however, behaved toward him in accordance with the status positions which he occupied as their kinsman, at least as far as their being “taboo from above” him was concerned. Other formalities were also accorded a chief. When he walked along a path with a party of people, he went first, unless the path was difficult. In the latter event someone went ahead to clear the way. While crawling behavior and the expression “ faajiro” are no longer exhibited, a chief still walks first today and the people still feel themselves to be “taboo from above” him.'<sup id="cite_ref-625" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-625">[625]</a></sup> 'Arrogance' was socially censured according to Caughey: 'These two styles of social interaction seem to be associated with a difference in character values. In writing about Romónum culture in the modern period, ethnographers never mention the ideal of strong thought, and although there are brief allusions to bravery it is not presented as a significant ideal. The literature on Romonum does refer, again and again, to the other major character value we found on Faanakkar, the importance of mosonoson, which is translated as “humility” or “respectfulness” as opposed to namanam tekiya, which is translated as “haughtiness” or “arrogant behavior”. Given these translations of the value labels and the examples furnished, it appears that the meanings of these terms are similar on Romonum and Faanakkar.'<sup id="cite_ref-626" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-626">[626]</a></sup> 'It is expected that people will despise a person of arrogance and that there will be much hostile gossip about him. The resulting shame has driven a number of persons to suicide. Because they hate him, it is also assumed that people will eagerly seek a chance to do him in, and that he will become a target for “foul play” ( sorongngaw). This term refers to sorcery and other stealthy aggressive acts such as ambush and arson. Elders frequently warn younger kinsmen who are acting rudely to be more respectful, lest they meet an early death. Another [Page 51] person’s failure to offer even a single required word of respect is sometimes considered adequate justification for using sorcery against him. Conversely, respectfulness is universally praised. It is also assumed that other people will feel sympathy towards such a person and treat him, in turn, with kindly respectfulness.'<sup id="cite_ref-627" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-627">[627]</a></sup> It is unclear whether his comments apply only to the colonial period or whether the pre-colonial period is included here as well.

<dd><b>♠ purity ♣ present ♥</b> Incest within the kin group was prohibited: 'There are not many obstacles to marriage on Truk. Under all conditions marriage within the same kin group is absolutely forbidden (totemism), even if the common root goes back ten degrees. For various kin groups marriage is not permitted, for relatives of the first degree, and, to be sure, in the direct line and collateral line. Therefore marriages between father and daughter, mother and son, and brother and sister are [Page 108] regarded as reprehensible. In this connection adopted siblings and half siblings are regarded as true siblings. It very often happens, however, that a man who marries a widow with an adult daughter takes the latter as a second wife. That is regarded as entirely proper. I have known of one single case in which a Truk chief married his own daughter and had several children with her. The natives frown upon such illegal marriages. They call them, rather crudely, pupulun pig (pig marriage).'<sup id="cite_ref-628" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-628">[628]</a></sup> 'All the Truk people are divided into eila[unknown] (kin groups / Sippen/). The mother is bearer of the eila[unknown]. In any case this is connected with the doctrine of Nigoubub, who, as the origin of life, is also female. All children follow the eila[unknown] of the mother. Marriage within the same eila[unknown] is not permitted. A Witö woman may never marry a Witö man. Such a marriage is regarded as incest and is never permitted, even if the common ancestors of the loving couple lie many generations back. On the other hand, marriages between uncle and niece, male cousin and female cousin, father and stepdaughter are not rarities, as long as the eila[unknown] is different. Marriages within the same eila[unknown] were formerly punished by death. Even now this [Page 89] marriage is still detested, even among Christians. I was acquainted with a single case, and the common judgment was: “The man is bad, for he married his sister.” One inquires about the eila[unknown], for example, in the case of women, “ fin med en? (Woman, what sort are you?),” whereupon the answer comes, for for example, “ fin Witö.” For men, the question runs, “ muan meden? (Man, what sort are you?).”'<sup id="cite_ref-629" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-629">[629]</a></sup> Notions of purity/impurity were associated with dirt, food and intercourse: '1. An unclean person is one who has stepped into sonepuin (1) 1 son = sediment, dregs; puin, night. The soiling can easily happen during nocturnal wanderings on the beach, which the Kanakas use as a toilet. The uncleanness lasts two, four, six, or eight days. During this time the one concerned must refrain from all religious acts. He himself can choose the number of days in proportion to his repentance and his zeal in the worship of the spirits. But it is expressly required that it must be an even number of days or nights, since the odd numbers are unfavorable.'<sup id="cite_ref-630" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-630">[630]</a></sup> 'An unclean person is one who has already partaken of food.

An unclean person is one who has had sexual intercourse, no matter whether marital or extramarital, since the natives make no distinction in this. This defect is designated with the expression u se oloudd, that is literally, I have not slept in the udd (men’s house). Namely, one must consider the fact that no woman was allowed to enter the udd in olden times. Therefore the men who stayed there overnight could not have sexual intercourse. For that reason the expression “to sleep in the udd” means the same as to be continent. Standing in contrast to oloudd is olaim. It means to sleep in the im (dwelling), therefore, to have sexual intercourse.'<sup id="cite_ref-632" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-632">[632]</a></sup> Accordingly, abstinence was required for the performance of some tasks: 'This oloudd is also a condition for other activities, as well as in connection with offerings, probably because they are subject to the influence of the spirits in a special way. It is required: If the men are obliged to be continent for one of the reasons mentioned above, this does not hold eo ipso for the women as well. They remain completely untouched. One can imagine what bad effects this practice, praiseworthy in itself, must have on family life during a long period. Only in the case of the weierek do the women on some islands also seem to be obligated to be continent. For example, if a man has bad luck because sharks spoil his fishing, he accuses his wife as though she were to blame for it on account of her incontinence. Other islands, on the other hand, deny the obligation of the women.'<sup id="cite_ref-633" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-633">[633]</a></sup> Pregnancy, menstruation and childbirth were also associated with impurity: 'The woman who is menstruating or pregnant has something unclean, contemptible, about her. She is isolated from the others; no one who holds a “religious position” as ida[unknown] may enter the little dwelling, prepare her food, or eat anything intended for her. The prohibition ends when the condition does.'<sup id="cite_ref-634" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-634">[634]</a></sup> 'As long as the child is small, the mother remains free of all work.

They have little understanding for moral defect. One who commits a bad deed and [Page 42] thereby becomes feienau has “sinned.” One who does not fall into this has not committed a sin. That in general is the principle of all Truk people. The conception of sin in the Christian sense is lacking among them.

This family has in the past consisted of a group of own sisters, their spouses, their daughters, married and unmarried, and their unmarried sons and brothers, residing matrilocally. Today, the demise of the large family house has sometimes led to [Page 19] a grouping of sisters’ houses around a common family hearth. In other cases today, where it is more economically beneficial, married couples will reside patrilocally, while still others will set up nuclear family households. Families will often gain additional recruits from various sources such as teen-age children, dissatisfied with treatment in their own homes, who may be taken in as a pwipwi (sibling of the same sex) by some member of the family who happens to take a temporary or permanent liking to them, or among orphans and their spouses if they are still too young to set up households of their own at the time they are left without families. Cooperation for the benefit of the family extends outside this unit but within this unit it is more rigidly regulated. Other units formed for procuring biologic necessities are informal, transitory and voluntary except for those associated with the public welfare. In this last instance the chief generally assigns certain quantities of work to each family unit, who may in turn apportion it among their members as they see fit. This is done in the case of food for feasts, building of public works, etc.'<sup id="cite_ref-637" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-637">[637]</a></sup> Males had obligations to their matrilineage as well as father's and wives' lineages:  'Within its district each lineage owns a particular plot of land which is regarded as its “true home” or “lineage center” ( imweyiche). The dwelling houses of resident members are typically clustered at this site, and members living elsewhere frequently return here to visit.

<dd><b>♠ bravery ♣ present ♥</b> According to Caughey, the value placed on bravery and competitiveness varied considerably from island to island in the colonial period:  'Ideal character is not defined this way on Fáánakkar. Respectfulness is a major value there but, as we have seen, it is balanced by an equally heavy emphasis on the aggressive and competitive ideals of bravery and strong thought. None of the accounts of modern Romónum, including the life histories, give any indication that these two character values are major preoccupations on that island. It also appears that acts which would be seen as manifestations of bravery on Fáánakkar are [Page 173] viewed as arrogant on Romónum, while actions which could be defined as cowardice on Fáánakkar are viewed as respectful on Romónum. Swartz shows that it is not only inappropriate or unjustified aggression that is considered wrong on Romónum, all aggression is defined as “haughty” (1958:475). Fighting with kinsmen is very bad, fighting with outsiders is less bad, but fighting is haughtiness (1965:32) and “all ‘haughty’ behavior is bad” ( Ibid.:32). One exception is wife beating, “when a woman violates the proscriptions on ‘haughty behavior’ or is disobedient, her husband may beat her” (1958:472) but “these values (of humble or nonhaughty behavior) also apply to men and combine with the threat of divorce to limit overt aggression against his wife” ( Ibid.:473). In all other relationships, even when someone has grossly violated the norms in a haughty way, aggressive retaliation is not approved; “even the punishing of a criminal is seen as aggressive or haughty” (1965:33). In short, on Romónum, “the cultural norm categorically proscribes aggression” ( Ibid.:38). Clearly this is not true on Fáánakkar where people want to be, and want to be known as, persons who are capable of successful aggression. On Fáánakkar the ideal type, the person of “true bravery”, does not usually engage in unjustified or unprovoked aggression (although he shows he is capable of it) but he must be ready and eager to respond competitively and aggressively when challenged, especially by another’s arrogance. To remain humble in the face of another’s challenge is not respectfulness; it is cowardice, and on Fáánakkar, this is despised at least as much as is arrogance.'<sup id="cite_ref-644" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-644">[644]</a></sup> But he also claims that prior to colonization, belligerence was generally valued in men: 'Any aggression by another is a test of bravery.'<sup id="cite_ref-645" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-645">[645]</a></sup> 'However, on Romónum it appears that neither the exclusive stress on respectfulness, nor the “prohibition of aggression” (Swartz 1965:37), nor the unaggressive style of social conduct were characteristic prior to the German pacification of Truk in 1903.

On Fáánakkar, the traditional values of bravery and strong thought have also persisted, and along with respectfulness, they are still important measures of character. On Romónum overt aggression has very much declined, and the aggressive and competitive components of bravery and strong thought are no longer prominent. It also appears that a shift in the meaning of these terms may have taken place such that several classes of behavior encompassed within the traditional ideal of bravery are now condemned as arrogance. In fact, Swartz believes that the people of modern Romónum “consider all the warfare that went on before foreign control to have been ‘haughty”’ (1965:32).'<sup id="cite_ref-647" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-647">[647]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ respect for property ♣ present ♥</b> The material is somewhat contradictory. Bollig claims that deliberate destruction of property was a common act of revenge: 'The Truk people are a little nation that always knows how to twist things so that one’s own self does not come out short. Just because everybody thinks only of himself and wants to have everything, damage in material connections is the most sensitive for them. Whoever wants to take revenge on another and deal him a blow need only do some kind of damage against him and he is stricken. That is why damage to houses and canoes, felling trees, uprooting young plants, and killing domestic animals out of a thirst for revenge so frequently occur.'<sup id="cite_ref-648" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-648">[648]</a></sup> This seems to fit in with Caughey's claim that destruction and theft of property could serve as a demonstration of dominance and bravery: 'To steal openly from others is admirable in that it shows a person’s dominance and demonstrates that he is not intimidated by the aggressive powers of others.'<sup id="cite_ref-649" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-649">[649]</a></sup> On the other hand, Goodenough claims that property rights were generally respected in social settings and that the threat of social censure served as deterrence against infringements on property rights: 'The possibility of stealing seems to arouse considerable anxiety in the Trukese today as well as formerly, and this despite the fact that they scrupulously respect each other’s rights when in anyone else’s company. They seem always ready to attribute the worst of motives to their fellows.'<sup id="cite_ref-650" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-650">[650]</a></sup> 'One might assume that dependence on private sanctions for breaches of this kind would provide a situation in which powerful persons and lineages could take advantage of weaker ones. While this has happened, the entire community is likely to unite against a too frequent offender. The property system does not depend, however, on the threat of direct retribution alone. Trouble makers tend to be socially isolated. Even their own lineage mates may eventually withdraw support if their activities too frequently put the lineage in embarrassing situations. These less formal sanctions are usually effective, and a person or group is not likely to violate another’s property rights deliberately and openly except with the definite purpose of precipitating a show-down.'<sup id="cite_ref-651" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-651">[651]</a></sup> According to Goodenough, chiefs generally avoided direct interference and instead resorted to moral exhortations: 'In aboriginal times no formal action was taken by the community against a thief. It was up to the individual and his corporation (lineage) to collect damages or kill the offender, the latter action frequently leading to a feud with the offender’s lineage. If the identity of a thief was unknown, divination was resorted to in order to discover it. The injured party demanded restitution or payment. If the thief refused, a fight resulted. District chiefs did not interfere directly in such matters. Informants indicated that for them to do so would have been to court the enmity of the entire community. On the other hand, a chief used to preach to his people about the evils of stealing and exhort them to respect each other’s rights in order to hold down dissension within his district.'<sup id="cite_ref-652" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-652">[652]</a></sup> We have provisionally coded 'present', but expert feedback might be needed on the matter.</dd></dl>
<p><b>♠ Moralistic punishment by human religious agents ♣ absent ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. The literature makes it clear that the Chuukese believed that transgressions could be punished by supernatural beings<sup id="cite_ref-653" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-653">[653]</a></sup>. It's worth noting that incest was punished<sup id="cite_ref-654" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-654">[654]</a></sup>--though it's not clear by whom. eHRAF provides a general description of ritual specialists: 'Ritual practices were conducted by their own specialists. They included spirit mediums, breadfruit summoners, fish summoners, healers, masters of spells, masters of sorcery, builders, navigators, diviners, and most importantly the masters of magic and ritual relating to war and politics. Their knowledge was private property passed down to their children and junior lineage mates.'<sup id="cite_ref-655" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-655">[655]</a></sup> Spirit mediums were important, but we have found no evidence of them being involved in moralistic punishment: 'In the space of this work we shall consider only the direct residing, which manifests itself in the belief in the nanönu / uanönu/. It is to be recalled that, according to the views of the islanders, the spirit which has appeared at the invocation of the spirits takes up residence on the far. The uanönu is in the service of this far and the spirit sojourning on it. He makes the far, hangs it up, tends to the asor, calls the spirit to jump down from it and settle on his neck. In this condition he speaks with the spirit, asks him questions in the spirit language, presents to him the people’s wishes, and also receives many a revelation. The common people prefer to have recourse to the uanönu in their religious needs. All the spirits, except for Onulap, seem ready to jump down, but especially those of the most recently deceased. The uanönu like to see the souls of deceased children coming down to them, because they have the advantage of being wenewen, that is, sincere, while adults are even able to deceive the uanönu. Some uanönu asserted that never yet had the soul of a deceased Christian come down to them. Anyone /61/ men, women, boys, girls, can be chosen as uanönu or uomar, that is, canoe of the spirit. The choice is wholly at the discretion of the spirit.'<sup id="cite_ref-656" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-656">[656]</a></sup> 'As soon as someone in the tribe has died, the people gather and tempt the soul so that it will settle down on the far and choose one of the persons present as uanönu. If the spirit grants this plea, the one chosen is regarded as uanönu until the spirit leaves him again. If the people have a request about which the spirit is to give information, he is summoned. The uanönu is the medium. The summoning takes place amid certain ceremonies. At night the people gather in the udd in which the far is hung. A quantity of food and other objects is collected, in part as asor [Page 68] for the önu, in part as gifts for the uanönu, in order to make them both obliging. Then the dancers grasp the kurukur and dance the spirit dance ( dugia), in order to show the spirit their veneration. The uanönu lies calmly on his mat and waits for the right moment. He suddenly feels as though goose flesh were spreading over him. He jumps up, takes hold of the kurukur, and jumps about, while he shouts hi, hi... It is not long before he feels by the heaviness of his neck that the spirit is sitting on him. He stands still, begins to tremble, bends under the weight of his neck, and sometimes even begins to foam. He presses his lips together hard so as not to speak quickly, since he might easily falsely announce the spirit’s words because of hurrying too fast. Finally the people call to him: “ Wäsi me[unknown]inom, tell your revelations.” The uanönu now asks the spirit: “ E seiö, who are you?” (In ordinary speech: en iö?) Whereupon the spirit begins to talk. The people pose their questions, express their wishes, which the uanönu communicates to the spirit in spirit language and receives the answer in the same language. The summoning is not always done in this fussy manner. Some uanönu are so easily susceptible that it suffices to strike them on the arm with an ubud, and they begin to tremble.'<sup id="cite_ref-657" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-657">[657]</a></sup> 'The performance does not always turn out as desired. It might be that the spirit who settles down is an “ onu[unknown]au or önurot, which the people notice at once by the furious, wild behavior of the uanönu. Then they quickly hide everything dangerous, such as knives, fire, etc., so that the uanönu cannot cause a disaster for anybody, for it has often happened, as the natives asserted, that such a raging one /62/ threw all kinds of things at the heads of those present and ran after them with bush knives. If, on the other hand, the uanönu speaks calmly and softly, the people are delighted, for the spirit is an önusor. Unfortunately, however, the revelations not infrequently turn out to be wholly a fraud. Then the natives grumble about the false uanönu and önumaken (liar spirit), but they do not so quickly lose faith in the business. Next time it will turn out better.'<sup id="cite_ref-658" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-658">[658]</a></sup> 'The uanönu also has the privilege of seeing the souls of human beings and the spirits in dreams. Thus an uanönu in Param told me one he had seen at night, while sleeping, a number of spirits in the middle of the island, as they danced together. The soul of a man who was still living was also present. That could become dangerous for the poor fellow, however, because how easily might the fickle soul stay away entirely, and then he would have to die. Therefore, as soon as a native hears that a dreaming uanönu has seen his soul, there is nothing more urgent for him to do than to wrap up a few good things, go to the uanönu, and ask him if he would catch again the one that escaped. That is, the uanönu also knows this art. It is called ama[unknown]un. The uanönu makes a certain safei, pours it into a coconut shell, and looks in. All the souls that have flown away now gather in this safei and look like drops of blood. He fishes out the foreign souls by means of a sou and throws them away. The soul of the petitioner, however, remains. The uanönu gives the safei with the captured soul to the unfortunate one to drink and he goes away beaming with joy. He has his soul back and need not die yet, while the uanönu has the gifts. Envious souls on Truk say about the uanönu that they see the most at precisely those times when their chests are the emptiest.'<sup id="cite_ref-659" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-659">[659]</a></sup> 'There is still another kind of uanönu, called mo[unknown]epui. These indeed see the human souls that have flown away, but do not understand the art of getting them back. They do not play any role among the Truk people.'<sup id="cite_ref-660" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-660">[660]</a></sup> 'The uanönu has another task during the performance of the spirit dances. The uanönu stands with the safei in the middle of his rows of dancers. This spot is called poönu, that is, bed of the spirit. No one may crowd close to this place. When the procession goes to the dancing place, the uanönu goes before his tribe, his blow-shell in one hand, giddun, /63/ that is, coconut offering for the spirit, in the other. When he steps into the udd, he throws down the coconut. He stations himself wherever it falls, and his dancers crowd around him. He gives them some of the safei to drink, so that the evil sorcery of the troops of dancers and their leaders will not harm them. Then [Page 70] he rubs his shell with curcuma and puts it down with the opening upwards. While the troop is dancing, the uanönu of the other party does all kinds of sorcery in order to disturb the dance. He likewise takes his shell, rubs it with charcoal, and puts it down with the opening downwards. His companions tie an ubud around their necks as a sign for the dancers that they should hang themselves. It now depends on which of the two parties can practice better sorcery. The defeated party is put to shame during the dance. The dancers’ voices fail.'<sup id="cite_ref-661" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-661">[661]</a></sup> 'A number of binin surround the uanönu. Besides the above-mentioned ones, which also hold for most of his ro[unknown] colleagues, he is not allowed to eat apot or oranges. The people must be careful not to sneeze in his presence, for the spirits do not like that. If the uanönu wants to get rid of his spirit -- which is not at all rare -- he only need bathe in stinking apot water, and the spirit will no longer come to him.'<sup id="cite_ref-662" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-662">[662]</a></sup> 'There are a great many of these uanönu on Truk. On the island of Fefan, which numbers scarcely 2,000 people, there are more than 90 of them, some of whom still practice their profession. Although these uanönu do not have the authority of the ida[unknown], they still sincerely contribute their share in supporting heathen customs and practices and keeping the spirit cult alive. Many a movement toward Christianity in tribes still heathen was suppressed by the intrigues of the uanönu. Although, on the one hand, many a former uanönu, men and women, came over to Christianity, on the other hand, it was precisely the uanönu still practicing who were the most obstinate opponents of the faith, even more than the ida[unknown].'<sup id="cite_ref-663" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-663">[663]</a></sup> Other ritual specialists were associated with warfare and politics: 'During the battle the ida[unknown] is near his men. If he wants to see the fighting ended, he throws himself between the lines of the ones fighting and cries, “ e bue le iou,” whereupon the warriors reply, “ e bue le iou (it shall be finished),” and the fighting stops. Anyone who does not obey this call is “bitten” by the ida[unknown] and is killed in the next battle. If there are people of the ida[unknown] who were killed in the battle, they may not be buried immediately, because the ida[unknown] must first inspect their position. Namely, if one lies with his feet toward the region of the enemy, as though he wanted to give him a kick, then there are no difficulties about the burial. But if it is the opposite, then the ida[unknown] first has to bring the corpse into the proper position. While singing, he pushes and turns the dead until his feet fortunately have the desired direction. Only then may his comrades carry him away. As respected as the ida[unknown] is by his own party, so is he hated by the opposite party, since they not unjustly attribute the war to his intrigues. If he falls into the hands of the enemy, he is tortured alive in front of the enemy soönu.'<sup id="cite_ref-664" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-664">[664]</a></sup> These specialists employed sorcery to retaliate against their enemies and people who slighted them, but we have found no evidence of third-party moralistic punishment: 'The ida[unknown] are also masters in the sphere of sorcery. Their word is regarded as puitikar (hot), which means destructive. An ordinary bite of the ida[unknown] causes a swollen throat. A curse cast by him on an unfortunate person devours the latter’s soul, that is, his life.'<sup id="cite_ref-665" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-665">[665]</a></sup> 'The occasion for this curse is the anger of the ida[unknown] because the careless so-and-so is so disrespectful as to make noise in his vicinity. It is no wonder that the people are afraid of a man who has such power in his mouth. Yet it is to be added for the vindication of the honor of the ida[unknown] that he also possesses various safei which end the effects of the bites and curses. Good pay, however, is a preliminary condition.'<sup id="cite_ref-666" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-666">[666]</a></sup> Sorcery was a common means of retaliation: 'What embitters life most for the Truk natives is the boud (sorcery to harm one). The boud occurs in innumerable forms. Nearly all souro[unknown] know how to make the boud with the help [Page 83] of their önu; the ida[unknown] in particular is a feared souboud. Yet there are also very distinct souboud who, with the help of an önu[unknown]au, are able to bring all kinds of trouble to human beings. How often one can hear from sick people the words: “ Emen a boud [unknown]eniei, somebody has cursed me, bewitched me.” The boud prevents women from giving birth, disturbs children’s growth, makes limbs swell, spoils one’s work, steals the [unknown]unuot, and brings inevitable death. Fear of the boud is a true tyranny for the unhappy, heathen Truk people.'<sup id="cite_ref-667" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-667">[667]</a></sup> 'A radical boud is the uwuli or umuni aramas (roasting human beings). If the souboud cannot get at a person whom he hates, he will kill him symbolically, which soon has as a consequence his actual death. For this purpose he sends his wife into the lölö to search for “his fish” ( iken ro [unknown]). The fishing women know the meaning. As soon as they have caught the fish, they lament the person condemned to death. They bring the fish to the souboud, who breaks the backbone bends it everywhere, and then roasts it. He buries the roasted fish or secretly puts it under the cursed person’s sleeping mat. The fala[unknown] (cookhouse) in which the act has taken place is abandoned and no longer used in the future, because the curse clings to it.'<sup id="cite_ref-668" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-668">[668]</a></sup> 'The person concerned, however, the one who was sentenced to death in this fashion, still has a chance to escape his fate if he learns about the boud soon enough. He simply has himself /75/ “roasted” again by a souro[unknown], whereby the first “roasting” is neutralized. The souro[unknown] makes a hole in the ground in the house of the person concerned, puts the counter- safei in it, and covers it with hot stones so that it steams. Over this he spreads coconut fronds together with the sleeping mat of the “patient.” The latter now has nothing else to do but to lie on it for a time. The boud is destroyed by this simple method, and the threat to life removed.'<sup id="cite_ref-669" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-669">[669]</a></sup> 'Even more common than the uwuli aramas is the uwuli ton solä (roasting of thieves). If somebody has had something stolen, he goes to the souatömen so that the latter will help him take revenge on the thief. The souatömen now does the following: [Page 84] He takes a fishing pole and line, ties a small crab to it, sits down in the grass, and sings. In this song he now mentions the names of all those who are suspected of the thievery. As soon as he pronounces the name of the culprit, a kinom or kuen (dark, ugly leguan) jumps out of the grass and bites into the crab. The souatömen seizes the animal, breaks all its bones, and roasts it in a coconut shell. The thief now pines away and must die. But again it is in the hands of the souatömen to put an end to this harsh sentence if the client wishes it in a fit of pity. He rubs the “roasted one” with a protective safei, and the spell is lifted.'<sup id="cite_ref-670" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-670">[670]</a></sup> 'In former times the natives hardly dared walk across the sandy shore, for the footprints impressed in the soft sand could easily bring about their ruin. If a souboud saw the prints of someone hated by him, he lifted them up, put them in a bowl, and cooked them together with a certain safei. If the sorcery was successful, the feet and legs of the person in question would swell.'<sup id="cite_ref-671" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-671">[671]</a></sup> 'Jealous women likewise sometimes let themselves be carried away and have recourse to the boud. For example, if a mother sees that the child of her neighbor is growing better than her own, she makes the safeien usiwör, and the bewitched child will become a cripple.'<sup id="cite_ref-672" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-672">[672]</a></sup> 'The soumaram ( maram, moon) is feared as a sorcerer. In the opinion of the Truk people he has a mysterious connection with the moon. When the moon appears in the west ( sikauru, first quarter) the natives do not dare pronounce the moon’s name in the presence of the soumaram. /76/ Instead of “a li[unknown]maram, the moon shines,” they say, “ a war ewe samol, that chief appears,” since the moon is the chief of the night.'<sup id="cite_ref-673" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-673">[673]</a></sup> 'Some souboud also have a method for harming people by throwing a sorcery- safei into people’s land or house at night. The most suitable nights for this are those between the first quarter and full moon, and, to be sure, toward morning. The souboud wraps his head, throat, hands and feet with ubud and, swaying his body back and forth while singing, he approaches the house. As a precaution, however, he has a few precious things [Page 85] with him as pen manauan (ransom). Namely, at the time of the boud the occupants of the houses are on the lookout in order to catch a possible souboud. He now hopes, in case he should be detected in his dirty work, to savelhimself from punishment by means of gifts. This does not always seem to succeed, however, for on many islands it is told how such souboud would be paid their reward with the bush knife. The souboud also has a method for recognizing whether his sorcery is effective against a given house or not. He pours safei into a bowl, puts some glowing stones into it, and inoffensively passes the house in question. If the steam of the safei goes toward the house, the boud will be successful; if not, he must repeat it.'<sup id="cite_ref-674" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-674">[674]</a></sup> However, this does not seem to constitute third-party moralistic punishment. Clarification on the difference between retaliation and punishment is needed.

<dd> <b>♠ exile ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Goodenough mentions a case of a man who had to flee his island due to a feud: 'Remaining in the older house were two sisters, Nijeejice, who was married to Cëëppywn (P3a), and Nijeejinen, who was married to Mwaatejinyk (P2a). In the feud between Pwereka 2 and Pwereka 3a following the murder of Jöku, Cëëppwyn and Mwaatejinyk were on opposing sides, and the former was eventually forced to flee Romonum, going to live for a time on Moen. When Mwaatejinyk became island chief he gave his children the plots of Neemwëc (720-470), Neeceemej (420-460), Neejimwetä (390-450), and Neeram (460-490), and built a house for his wife and daughters at Neeceemej, thereby establishing the Söör 2a descent line. Full or residual title to the soil of these plots is now considered the property of this descent line. When Cëëppwyn returned from exile, he gave his children the land plot Neejöör (540-470), where he, too, built a house for his wife and daughters, who founded the present Söör 2b descent line. All three descent lines continued to operate as a single lineage with one wuut—the old one at Fënykytiw was moved to Neetupw (580-350)—and one fanag, forming an over-all corporation holding full or residual title to the old sööpw lands collectively called Pwowunög.'<sup id="cite_ref-677" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-677">[677]</a></sup> However, this does not seem to constitute exile in our sense of the term.

</p>
<dl><dd> <b>♠ The state regulates banking ♣ absent ♥</b> Note: In the period immediately preceding colonization, the Chuuk Islands were not governed by a state. Instead, the Chuukese/Trukese were divided into multiple clans and lineages sharing resources: 'Chuuk's population is divided into a number of dispersed, matrilineal clans. Within any one district the several lineages are usually but not always of different clans. There are also personal kindreds. As a principle of clan and lineage membership, descent is matrilineal, but otherwise kinship is reckoned bilaterally.' <sup id="cite_ref-687" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-687">[687]</a></sup> 'The domestic unit was an extended family, based on the women of a lineage or sublineage. It consisted of at least one experienced older woman and two more younger women of childbearing age together with their husbands. Unmarried sons and brothers slept apart in their lineage's meeting house. Extended family households continued through the periods of foreign administration.' <sup id="cite_ref-688" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-688">[688]</a></sup> District chiefs were chosen from the dominant lineage of an area: 'In each district the lineage with title to its space held the chiefship. The several lineages with full or residual title to plots of soil had full residential rights. Lineages with only provisional titles to plots of soil in grant from other lineages had only conditional residential rights. Lineages with full residential rights maintained symbolic hearths where, with their client lineages, they prepared food to present to the chief in recognition of his lineage's ownership of the space.' <sup id="cite_ref-689" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-689">[689]</a></sup> 'A district chiefship was divided between the oldest man in the senior female line in the chiefly lineage and the oldest man in the lineage generally. The latter was executive chief, or "chief of talk," and the former symbolic chief, or "chief of food." Food presentations were made to the symbolic chief. Sometimes the symbolic and executive functions fell to the same individual; often they did not. The symbolic chief was surrounded by his lineage brothers and by his sons, who acted as his agents. These followers and his sisters and daughters were of chiefly rank, distinct from commoners. Through conquest, a lineage might gain the chiefship in more than one district and establish a junior branch as the chiefly lineage in the conquered district. The now subordinate district rendered food presentations to the superordinate one. Most districts were linked in two rival leagues based on competing schools of magic and ritual relating to war, politics, and rhetoric. A chief's authority derived from two things. His lineage's ownership of the district's space entitled him to presentations of first fruits at stated times of the year. More importantly, it gave him authority over the conservation and use of the district's food resources. His authority also derived from his connection with the sky world, its gods, and their superhuman power to accomplish purposes. There was, therefore, a degree of sacredness associated with chiefs.' <sup id="cite_ref-690" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-690">[690]</a></sup> Traditionally, authority did not extend beyond the atoll and was shared among multiple chiefs on one island. Chuuk was somewhat more fragmented than other Micronesian societies: 'Throughout most of Micronesia the maximum independent autonomous political unit was the high island or the atoll, often subdivided into more than one polity. At the time of European contact, Satawan Atoll in the Mortlocks had four separate communities, each with its own leader, which sometimes fought one another. Palau had two confederations of villages or districts, each independent of the other, and the villages themselves had considerable autonomy. Pohnpei had five petty states, although traditions of a unified rule for the whole island are apparent from an earlier period. Chuuk was extremely fragmented politically, with several independent communities on each of the six larger high islands. The Marshalls and the Gilberts had larger polities and integrated groups of separate atolls under a high chief; these expansionist states achieved their fullest development after the introduction of firearms by Europeans.' <sup id="cite_ref-691" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-691">[691]</a></sup> Accordingly, many of the below variables are not relevant to the pre-colonial Chuuk.</dd>

Four mighty corner posts ( ur) are driven into the ground, on which longitudinal beams ( dilöu) extending across are set and lashed. On the longitudinal beams rest the crossbeams (outam), and, to be sure, in the case of larger udd, three of them, the thick one in the middle. Into the crossbeams are inserted small posts, on which then directly rests the heavy ridge-beam ( uin), which, like all beams, consists of one piece. The beams are not nailed since the old Truk people were unfamiliar with iron. They took wooden pegs or tied the beams together with coconut cord, which can hold for decades. The modern Truk people do use nails. Finally, the rafters are put up and lashed, and the framework is completed. One might think that this work would be done quickly, but far from it, for the natives have to be always changing and turning so that the house will not be crooked and humpy. They are not familiar with measuring instruments; everything is done by eye. Although some udd are beautifully and precisely constructed, nevertheless nothing of true art is to be noted, for it would have to be the rafters, which are crudely notched here and there and even more crudely painted with black, white, or red paint.' <sup id="cite_ref-692" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-692">[692]</a></sup> Volume was measured in 'handfuls': 'These linear measures are also used in part as dry measures insofar as the people put the finger or the hand into the bowl and thus determine the height from the ground. The hand too is a dry measure; epö is a handful.' <sup id="cite_ref-693" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-693">[693]</a></sup> So far, no information on weights has been found. However, Bollig mentions some linear measures: 'These linear measures are also used in part as dry measures insofar as the people put the finger or the hand into the bowl and thus determine the height from the ground. The hand too is a dry measure; epö is a handful.' <sup id="cite_ref-694" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-694">[694]</a></sup> 'They are not all alike in style either. Every island and also every important canoe-builder ( soufalafal) have their own style ( sän). The word sän means rope, because in hewing the keel, /129/ which has considerable influence on the usefulness of the canoe, the measuring is done with a piece of rope. The cances are differentiated according to the method of measuring. Thus, one distinguishes sänin Ku (old name for Mortlock), sänin Poluot, säniged, etc.' <sup id="cite_ref-695" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-695">[695]</a></sup> Accordingly, we have presumed no standardization of weights and meisures prior to the colonial period.</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Guarantee stability of coin value ♣ absent ♥</b> Prior to colonization, Chuukese exchange systems were not monetized. Islanders traditionally engaged in trading expeditions and barter trade: 'At the present time, sailing canoes suitable for long trips remain in use only in the small islands of the Caroline group scattered widely over the ocean from Truk westward. The language and culture found on these islands relate them clearly to Truk, whereas most of them fell historically under the hegemony of Yap to the west—a tie which Lessa (1956) has demonstrated is by no means completely extinct. Both Truk and Yap possess volcanic soils which can support crops impossible of cultivation on the sandy coral islets which lie between. Trade therefore provided the impetus for travel to and from the high islands, and there was in addition considerable social visiting back and forth between all the islands. Some voyages, apparently of exploration, have also been recorded extending over hundreds of miles to Guam and even remoter islands. Trips of up to 200 miles or so are still made, although with reduced frequency. Canoes are also used on a few islands other than those mentioned above for interisland, but essentially local, travel to Truk and Ponape.' <sup id="cite_ref-696" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-696">[696]</a></sup> 'The acquisition of property on Truk is usually done by means of barter. Lands, houses, and canoes are bartered. Smaller units of exchange are sebi (wooden bowls), deig (curcuma), faupar (red shell disks), hip mats, modesty bands, fishing nets, aromatic oils, coconut cord, home-grown tobacco, and sleeping mats. These products of native industry are not present in like quantity or in like quality on all the islands. Thus, Sapesis on Fefan is famous for its fine bowls, Pol for curcuma and oils, Iluk for its fine hip mats.' <sup id="cite_ref-697" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-697">[697]</a></sup> 'Weaving generally takes place at certain times, especially when the canoes from the low islands are expected, the inhabitants of which barter for things. In former times not very nice [Page 186] customs were associated with weaving. When the women had completed their work, they put on the new mats and gathered on the shore.' <sup id="cite_ref-698" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-698">[698]</a></sup> Money was introduced by the colonial administration: 'The impact of these economic changes upon the Trukese was great. Just as under the Germans law and order were made the province of the administration, a step which can be reversed (without chaos) only by a long and intelligently directed course of evolution, so under the Japanese the step to a money economy and dependence upon some categories of imported goods was carried far enough beyond the German beginnings so that it too has become irreversible. While the Trukese were not indoctrinated in the more skilled techniques, such as deep-sea fishing and boat-building, there were many jobs available at manual labor, an ever-increasing flow of trade goods upon which to spend the earnings thereof, and head taxes to assure that those who did not work cut copra. The Trukese began to travel more and more on Japanese boats (many of which they have now taken over and operate), to use a wider variety of Japanese tools, to eat (although not depend upon) rice and canned fish, and to wear clothese exclusively of foreign material.' <sup id="cite_ref-699" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-699">[699]</a></sup></dd>

<dd> <b>♠ Non-state enforcement ♣ present ♥</b> So far, we have found no material on contracts per se. But prior to colonization, senior lineages and dominant clans could grant residential and usufruct rights to junior groups on a provisional basis: 'In each district the lineage with title to its space held the chiefship. The several lineages with full or residual title to plots of soil had full residential rights. Lineages with only provisional titles to plots of soil in grant from other lineages had only conditional residential rights. Lineages with full residential rights maintained symbolic hearths where, with their client lineages, they prepared food to present to the chief in recognition of his lineage's ownership of the space.' <sup id="cite_ref-700" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-700">[700]</a></sup> Individuals could also grant provisional land rights to other individuals: 'Land was held privately both by individuals and matrilineal, corporate descent groups. Rights in undeveloped space, productive soil, trees and gardens were separable. When soil and breadfruit trees were given in grant, the grantor retained residual rights and the grantee acquired provisional rights. Grantors and grantees could be either individuals or corporations. Full rights went to the survivor on the death or extinction of the other.' <sup id="cite_ref-701" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-701">[701]</a></sup> We are unsure whether this constitutes a contract according to our Code Book, but have assumed so for the time being. There was no state structure that could enforce provisional titles. However, chiefs occasionally confiscated property granted to junior lineages and provisional title holders in case of disobedience (such as failure to deliver food prestations on the occasion of feasts): 'As noted above, the relations between a chief and the people of his district are patterned largely after the relations between the parties in divided ownership. As provisional title holders to territory, the various lineages owe the chief periodic gifts of produce from the land. These gifts are rendered at stated times in connection with feasts given in the chief’s honor. He fixes the time for these feasts in accordance with a seasonal calendar: two feasts during the breadfruit season, and two more during the turmeric season. The men of the various lineages prepare breadfruit in giant wooden bowls while the women fish. Other types of food are also collected. On the day of the feast each lineage brings its food in a procession, the men carrying the giant bowls on frames and chanting as they walk. The food is carried into the meeting house of the chief’s lineage. The chief then selects the largest bowl for himself and his lineage mates and redistributes the rest of the food to the assembled population. The distribution is made according to lineage and is roughly proportional to the size of each lineage. The contributions which each lineage makes are also proportional to the size of its membership and the amount of productive land which it controls. If a lineage fails in this obligation, the chief has the right to confiscate its holdings. Should he indicate dissatisfaction with the contribution of a particular lineage, its members will hasten to prepare additional food and other gifts to mollify him.' <sup id="cite_ref-702" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-702">[702]</a></sup> We have presumed this to be a type of 'non-state enforcement' of contracts.</dd>

<p><b>♠ Famine relief ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Note: Prior to colonization, the Chuukese were organized in lineages headed by clans rather than in a state. Accordingly, some of the below variables are irrelevant as they presume a public health framework. Bollig claims that no communal provisions were made for the case of famine: 'Although the natives have sufficient food supplies in normal times, or could have, nevertheless times of famine are not unfamiliar to them. Causes of famine might be a typhoon or a long drought. A lack of rain for three to four months can be disastrous for the islands, since, with the thin layer of humus, all the plantings /166/ die. In such times of famine many cases of death always occur; the families broke up, because everybody was only concerned with saving his own skin. The people cut down the coconut trees and ate the heart (faunepon), which resulted in the death of many. There was no longer any order. Looting theft, and murder were the order of the day. Especially clever ones carried soil onto very high trees and raised some tobacco there.' <sup id="cite_ref-703" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-703">[703]</a></sup> 'An old saying gives the following advice for a famine: “ nugu sebi, nugu neif, nugu lul. Protect the bowl, the knife, the coconut cord.” That is, one who has a bowl can make himself mogemog (arrowroot) when other foodstuffs are exhausted. This mogemog grows wild in great quantities and, although the Truk people like to eat it, is hardly noticed because it requires too much work. But anyone who also has the other two things besides the bowl, he can climb the coconut palms, cut the blossom stalk, fasten a bowl to it, and thus procure for himself the fortifying palm wine. This gives him a chance to struggle through until better times come.' <sup id="cite_ref-704" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-704">[704]</a></sup> Islanders relied on crabs and bitter yams in times of famine: 'When fishing is unsuccessful due to unfavorable weather, famine prevails in the huts of the Kanakas, and many a person is hungry and mournfully hangs his head. Others,on the other hand, who are more courageous, roam through the mangrove swamps for mussels or look for crabs in the crab holes on the shore. As bait they hold a fern frond in the crab hole. When the crab seizes the fern with its claws, they quickly pull it out. The natives know very well how to grasp the animal in such a manner that they cannot be pinched by the claws.' <sup id="cite_ref-705" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-705">[705]</a></sup> 'Yam The yam (Dioscorea sp.), termed eep, is rarely used as a food.

Varieties are classified on the basis of their color, whether or not they have thorns and if so whether many or few, how fast they mature, how large the corm grows and what its consistency and taste are like after being cooked. Almost all of the Colocasia varieties mature in about six months or so. Many of the older varieties of Cyrtosperma take at least three years to mature. Some varieties, such as simiten, are reported to mature in little more than a year. Many of these early maturing varieties are recent introductions but they are very popular, have become quite widespread and are frequently planted. One early maturing variety whose name, six months ( sikismont) is an English translation of the Ponapean name ( sowunpwong wennew), was introduced to Lukunor years ago by a couple of men who worked on a sailing vessel which stopped at Ponape and heighboring islands. It is apparently grown only on Lukunor and a few neighboring islands. However, the magic [Page 95] of its name has gained for it a wide reputation and many people would like to try it out. This variety would be extensively propagated if it were made available, though some might be disappointed since it does not quite live up to its name, taking a year, sometimes a little less than a year, to grow to maturity. In regard to Cyrtosperma, the tasty, rapidly maturing varieties are the most highly desired but they seem to be less hardy.

<p><b>♠ Food storage ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> According to SCCS variable 20 'Food Storage' 'Individual households', not 'Communal facilities', 'Political agent controlled repositories', or 'Economic agent controlled repositories' were present, coded in the SCCS as ‘2’. Bollig and Goodenough describe the fermentation of breadfruit: 'Truk’s small land area and limited animal resources force its inhabitants to rely for food almost exclusively on vegetable and marine resources. The staple food is supplied by the breadfruit tree, which is well suited to the steep slopes, its roots preventing soil erosion. Since it provides a seasonal crop, breadfruit is stored and fermented in pits for the lean period, when the diet is further supplemented with taro, sweet potatoes, and manioc.' <sup id="cite_ref-709" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-709">[709]</a></sup> 'Since the breadfruit tree does not bear throughout the year, the natives must preserve the surplus so that it, together with the yields from the plantings, will help them through to the next breadfruit harvest. In this period of preserving, all the men and boys are busy with picking ( amomo). With baskets and the iass (picker) they set out in order to relieve the trees of their burden. All the fruit is heaped up in piles at a certain place. A funnel-shaped pit ( nas) has been dug out there and lined with banana leaves. The shell of the fruit is scraped out with a tiger shell ( [unknown]i[unknown]i), which is ground like a plane, the core is cut out, the fruit split into pieces and thrown into the pit. The whole is covered with banana leaves and grass and weighted with large stones. Some time later the fruit begins to ferment, and a yellowish-white mass is formed, which smells sourish.' <sup id="cite_ref-710" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-710">[710]</a></sup> 'All kinds of breadfruit are preserved together on Truk. On other islands they are carefully sorted out, whereby better apot, mar (name of the preserved food) is supposed to be produced. A mar contains hundreds, even thousands, of fruits. If one considers that each family makes several nas for the lean months, it is clear that one tree cannot feed a family. The apot keeps for years. If more is made in the following year, it [Page 161] is mixed with the old, which is thereby improved. It must be hard to digest, however, since some get a stomachache from eating it. Even at a long distance one can smell the nas, and the breath of those who have eaten apot. For the majority of the natives it is a delicacy. In their “cookbook” there are many recipes for its preparation. They mix it with grated coconut or coconut milk, or knead it in sea water is order to kill the smell somewhat ( marepupu). These recipes, however, are used only on better occasions. Usually it is baked as it comes from the pit.' <sup id="cite_ref-711" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-711">[711]</a></sup> Fish and other sea animals were roasted and stored in baskets: 'The Truk people still must usually have animal food to accompany the vegetable main dish, or else it will not slide down. The accompanying food is usually fish. The preparation of the fish is a matter for the women and girls, who perform their task with skill and intelligence, although the procedure is a little dirty. The larger fish, with scales and entrails, are simply put on the open fire; the smaller ones, several at a time, are first wrapped in a breadfruit leaf. The fact that, in addition, the cook spits into the fire or blows her nose in it does not spoil the appetite of any true Trukese. During the work she must very carefully watch the animals wandering about, for whatever animals the hut shelters prowl around the fire in order to grab something. Depending upon the circumstances, mussels, cray-fish, and other sea animals are added to the fish on the open fire. After the work is finished, everything roasted is put into the food baskets hanging from the roof, out of which it is then taken as needed. After a very short time under the tropical sun the animals begin to smell. But though the smell may be ever so strong, no Truk native will throw away a good bite on account of it. One does not hear anything about illnesses as a consequence of eating such food. They seem to be completely immune.' <sup id="cite_ref-712" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-712">[712]</a></sup> We have assumed that stored fish and breadfruit served individual families and domestic units rather than villages or even lineages. This remains in need of confirmation. According to Mahony, Cyrtosperma was stored in swamps for use in times of famine: 'A large number of varieties of Colocasia and Cyrtosperma are recognized but there are only a few varieties of Alocasia, one of which is never eaten.

[Page 56] For example, to learn knot divination a pupil must pay the diviner ( sowupwe) even if the latter is his own father or mother’s brother. An jitag (a sort of lawyer, general, diplomat and orator all rolled into one, who occupies the most prestigeful position in Trukese society) is alleged never to teach his own children as much as he teaches his sister’s children. This contention does not, however, appear to be supported by the genealogical connections of the past jitag of Romonum Island. Despite special rules governing specific forms of incorporeal property, their over-all organization is analogous to that of corporeal property and does not require a new conceptual framework to make them intelligible.' <sup id="cite_ref-726" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-726">[726]</a></sup> Spirit mediums relied on the experience of possession rather than a transmitted system of knowledge: 'All religious practitioners as well as craftsmen and magicians are owners of the knowledge necessary to exercise their specialties. The Trukese make no distinction between them and other skilled personnel. There is one important exception to this rule, the spirit medium ( wäättwa or wään ëny). His (or her) position is not based on knowledge so much as on having been possessed by a spirit. This spirit is in no way classed as the medium’s property, nor can it be inherited automatically by a son or lineage mate. The position of a spirit medium, therefore, is different from that of a property holder, except as he uses his abilities to diagnose illness.' <sup id="cite_ref-727" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-727">[727]</a></sup> Accordingly, there was no institutional framework providing 'public health'.

<dd> <b>♠ Care of orphans  ♣ absent ♥</b> Orphans were taken in by the extend family rather than cared for within a public health framework: 'The cooperative extended family is responsible for the provision of material wealth for its members. This family has in the past consisted of a group of own sisters, their spouses, their daughters, married and unmarried, and their unmarried sons and brothers, residing matrilocally. Today, the demise of the large family house has sometimes led to [Page 19] a grouping of sisters’ houses around a common family hearth. In other cases today, where it is more economically beneficial, married couples will reside patrilocally, while still others will set up nuclear family households. Families will often gain additional recruits from various sources such as teen-age children, dissatisfied with treatment in their own homes, who may be taken in as a pwipwi (sibling of the same sex) by some member of the family who happens to take a temporary or permanent liking to them, or among orphans and their spouses if they are still too young to set up households of their own at the time they are left without families. Cooperation for the benefit of the family extends outside this unit but within this unit it is more rigidly regulated. Other units formed for procuring biologic necessities are informal, transitory and voluntary except for those associated with the public welfare. In this last instance the chief generally assigns certain quantities of work to each family unit, who may in turn apportion it among their members as they see fit. This is done in the case of food for feasts, building of public works, etc.' <sup id="cite_ref-728" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-728">[728]</a></sup> Orphaned infants were fed by related women or neighbours: 'The feeding of the child is primarily a matter for the mother. But other women in the house do not hesitate to help the mother in the nursing. One can see children who have been able to walk and talk for a long time and are still suckled. The European feeding-bottle has also successfully made a way for itself and is filled with goat’s milk or condensed milk. If the mother of a suckling dies or if she cannot feed it enough, it is lost in most cases. The women try to feed it with curcuma or chew sugar cane which the little one must suck from their lips, but it is not much use. On the whole mortality is high among the little children of Truk. Many die from intestinal catarrh, fevers, and misery.' <sup id="cite_ref-729" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-729">[729]</a></sup></dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Care of elderly ♣ absent ♥</b> The elderly were taken care of within the family rather than within the framework of a public health infrastructure: 'In Truk it makes expecially good economic sense to produce at least one child. Parents want children in order to have someone to care for them in old age and to have someone to help with their work. The love of children and of relatives is expressed as based on mutual dependence, and feelings of independence are repressed.' <sup id="cite_ref-730" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-730">[730]</a></sup> According to Fischer, treatment of the elderly differed according to gender: 'The old man and woman (the chiinn&amp;aunknown;p): After the female passes the menopause she is considered to be an old woman. This is the period of her life of which she is most afraid. If she has had no children and becomes too weak to work she becomes an unwelcome burden upon her more distant relatives. If she has children her status depends somewhat upon how much her children love her. This frequently turns out to be much less than she would expect. If she has grandchildren she may become useful as a baby sitter, while the younger woman works, but more frequently she is expected to provide what food and care she can for the pregnant daughter or daughter-in-law or for the same woman if she has a young child. It is not uncommon for her to be beaten by her own children. Her attempts to keep the good will of others is shown in her changed attitude toward eating. When the anthropologist inquired from Amywo why his wife Aryko ate such a little bit of food and saved the best parts for him, he said, ‘Yes, she is just like an old woman in this. She just picks a little bit at her food and saves the rest for her relatives.’ All old women [Page 38] are not in this unenviable position. Some, especially those who have had large famililies, are secure among their many children, and are not much of a burden to any one of them. If they have gained the respect and love of their children they may be treated in something approaching the ideal manner for treatment of parents in this culture, which is that the parent has only to express a desire to have the children go to great lengths to achieve it for them. There are also certain superstitions associated with neglect of a duty to feed an older person. This is illustrated in Fyciko’s reaction to the following part of a dream: ‘Later I stayed at home and the mother of Siro and Rooke came - she is dead. She was eaten by a soope (ghost) in my dream. Afterwards I screamed loudly, but just a little noise came out because of the soope. Then the soope carried me to Siro’s mother. There was a house. Then Siro’s mother said to me ‘What are you doing?’ I said the soope had eaten me. Then the woman said she would make medicine and the soope wouldn’t eat me. She told me she would get a stick of fire because that was the medicine of the soope. I was very frightened because I thought I would be dead. Afterwards Eniina looked for me and asked the people of the house ‘Where is Fyciko?’ I said, ‘I am here.’ ‘What are you doing here?’ ‘Because a soope ate me, therefore I am here.’ Then she asked, ‘Which one ate you?’ I said, ‘The soul of your sister.’' <sup id="cite_ref-731" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-731">[731]</a></sup> 'The old man is not quite so unfortunate as the old woman. No old man on Romonum had lost so much vigor that he was unable to work. Like the old woman, if he is able, he is expected to provide some food for his grandchildren and their mothers. Unlike the old woman, he is frequently [Page 40] a respected and important figure, who will be called upon for advice from his large store of wisdom. This is especially true if he has been a figure of importance in his youth. If he is weak he is supported by his children or relatives or friends. Young people are admonished to be nice to people because if they should be left alone in old age without children or other relatives, people will love them and will take them in and feed them.' <sup id="cite_ref-732" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-732">[732]</a></sup> Bolling claims that elderly persons without support networks were left to fend for themselves: 'From the above statements one sees that the lot of the sick is on the average good among the natives; to be sure, the Kanaka is not overindulged either. Only the fate of old, sick people who no longer have any close relatives or are afflicted with a contagious illness is not enviable. They are left in dirt and excrement and lie without care. Someone will barely condescend to give them anything to eat and drink. On trips I often found dying persons, without food, without clothing, who were treated simply like a mangy animal. In heathendom love does not extend very far. Those natives who do not belong to the family of a sick person, generally take no notice of him and do not even visit him; at most one makes the malicious remark: “ deiwet e bue le pa, it serves him right, he will die.” To be sure, the family of the Kanaka does not want any strange visitors, out of fear of evil sorcery.' <sup id="cite_ref-733" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-733">[733]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<b>♠ State pensions for elites ♣ absent ♥</b> In the period immediately preceding colonization, the Chuuk Islands were not governed by a state. Instead, the Chuukese/Trukese were divided into multiple clans and lineages sharing resources: 'Chuuk's population is divided into a number of dispersed, matrilineal clans. Within any one district the several lineages are usually but not always of different clans. There are also personal kindreds. As a principle of clan and lineage membership, descent is matrilineal, but otherwise kinship is reckoned bilaterally.' <sup id="cite_ref-734" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-734">[734]</a></sup> 'The domestic unit was an extended family, based on the women of a lineage or sublineage. It consisted of at least one experienced older woman and two more younger women of childbearing age together with their husbands. Unmarried sons and brothers slept apart in their lineage's meeting house. Extended family households continued through the periods of foreign administration.' <sup id="cite_ref-735" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-735">[735]</a></sup> District chiefs were chosen from the dominant lineage of an area: 'In each district the lineage with title to its space held the chiefship. The several lineages with full or residual title to plots of soil had full residential rights. Lineages with only provisional titles to plots of soil in grant from other lineages had only conditional residential rights. Lineages with full residential rights maintained symbolic hearths where, with their client lineages, they prepared food to present to the chief in recognition of his lineage's ownership of the space.' <sup id="cite_ref-736" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-736">[736]</a></sup> 'A district chiefship was divided between the oldest man in the senior female line in the chiefly lineage and the oldest man in the lineage generally. The latter was executive chief, or "chief of talk," and the former symbolic chief, or "chief of food." Food presentations were made to the symbolic chief. Sometimes the symbolic and executive functions fell to the same individual; often they did not. The symbolic chief was surrounded by his lineage brothers and by his sons, who acted as his agents. These followers and his sisters and daughters were of chiefly rank, distinct from commoners. Through conquest, a lineage might gain the chiefship in more than one district and establish a junior branch as the chiefly lineage in the conquered district. The now subordinate district rendered food presentations to the superordinate one. Most districts were linked in two rival leagues based on competing schools of magic and ritual relating to war, politics, and rhetoric. A chief's authority derived from two things. His lineage's ownership of the district's space entitled him to presentations of first fruits at stated times of the year. More importantly, it gave him authority over the conservation and use of the district's food resources. His authority also derived from his connection with the sky world, its gods, and their superhuman power to accomplish purposes. There was, therefore, a degree of sacredness associated with chiefs.' <sup id="cite_ref-737" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-737">[737]</a></sup> Traditionally, authority did not extend beyond the atoll and was shared among multiple chiefs on one island. Chuuk was somewhat more fragmented than other Micronesian societies: 'Throughout most of Micronesia the maximum independent autonomous political unit was the high island or the atoll, often subdivided into more than one polity. At the time of European contact, Satawan Atoll in the Mortlocks had four separate communities, each with its own leader, which sometimes fought one another. Palau had two confederations of villages or districts, each independent of the other, and the villages themselves had considerable autonomy. Pohnpei had five petty states, although traditions of a unified rule for the whole island are apparent from an earlier period. Chuuk was extremely fragmented politically, with several independent communities on each of the six larger high islands. The Marshalls and the Gilberts had larger polities and integrated groups of separate atolls under a high chief; these expansionist states achieved their fullest development after the introduction of firearms by Europeans.' <sup id="cite_ref-738" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-738">[738]</a></sup> Accordingly, we can not assume a system of state pensions prior to colonization: 'Japan replaced Germany as the ruling power in World War I and was in turn replaced by the United States under United Nations Trusteeship in 1945. In 1986 Chuuk and its surrounding atolls became a state within the newly independent Federated States of Micronesia. Protestant missionaries and traders came in the 1880s and Roman Catholic missionaries after 1900. Japan sought to develop Chuuk economically and introduced elementary education in Japanese. Education was much expanded under American administration, and many Chuukese learned English. Some went to college in Guam, Hawaii, and the United States mainland. The American administration introduced representative government.' <sup id="cite_ref-739" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-739">[739]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Funding for festivals ♣ absent ♥</b> Note: Prior to colonization, the Chuukese were organized in lineages headed by chiefs rather than in a state. Accordingly, many of the below variables are irrelevant as they focus on the public funding of events and institutions or the presence of full-time specialists. Islanders prepared food for feasts held by chiefs: 'As noted above, the relations between a chief and the people of his district are patterned largely after the relations between the parties in divided ownership. As provisional title holders to territory, the various lineages owe the chief periodic gifts of produce from the land. These gifts are rendered at stated times in connection with feasts given in the chief’s honor. He fixes the time for these feasts in accordance with a seasonal calendar: two feasts during the breadfruit season, and two more during the turmeric season. The men of the various lineages prepare breadfruit in giant wooden bowls while the women fish. Other types of food are also collected. On the day of the feast each lineage brings its food in a procession, the men carrying the giant bowls on frames and chanting as they walk. The food is carried into the meeting house of the chief’s lineage. The chief then selects the largest bowl for himself and his lineage mates and redistributes the rest of the food to the assembled population. The distribution is made according to lineage and is roughly proportional to the size of each lineage. The contributions which each lineage makes are also proportional to the size of its membership and the amount of productive land which it controls. If a lineage fails in this obligation, the chief has the right to confiscate its holdings. Should he indicate dissatisfaction with the contribution of a particular lineage, its members will hasten to prepare additional food and other gifts to mollify him.' <sup id="cite_ref-740" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-740">[740]</a></sup> Bollig describes the preparations for a festival: 'Both develop a feverish activity. The men prepare whole mountains of food. Whatever is found in the plantings is dragged out. The women too get no rest. They are constantly squatting in the water in order to snatch at a little tail. If the supplies of their own tribe are not sufficient, friends on other islands have [Page 201] to help out, for which equal help is given to them in a similar situation. There is movement on all roads on the morning of the fadanap day, for no Kanaka wants to be absent when there is something to chew. All are loaded with bananas, pineapples, sugar cane, coconuts, and fish, which they carry to the chief’s house, where everything is piled up. Very rich ones also bring such European goods as rice, biscuits, salmon; indeed, even beer and liquor could not be lacking in Japanese times. The most festive moment is the bringing of the large madün bowls. Cautiously they come rocking along, carried on the shoulders of strong men. The carriers are painted, /183/ adorned, and sing their emoir. When the fadanap participants are in two parties, they approach from different sides, singing to each other. But usually one tribe or the other takes it badly, since ancient hostility prevails among all the tribes. They quarrel with each other, throw food at their heads, and not infrequently bring knives and spears into play.' <sup id="cite_ref-741" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-741">[741]</a></sup> 'A dance festival ( pine) in a village is a happy event, not only for the village itself, but for the whole region. Practicing goes on untiringly for weeks and months beforehand. The dance tunes resound from the shore until late into the night. The closer the day comes, the greater the zeal. Everybody is on their feet. Great quantities of food must be prepared, whole baskets of fish will be roasted, so that the stomach will not come out short either. Some dancers travel around to the neighboring islands and beg for dancing jewelry from friends and acquaintances in order to be able to shine properly. On the morning of the day of the dance they come streaming from all sides, by land, by water, dancer and spectator, their /176/ dance adornment in little baskets. Gay activity increases in front of the dance house. In the huts, under the coconut palms, everywhere unembarrassed toilettes are being made. Mothers paint their stark naked little ones. How happily their little eyes shine, because today they will look beautiful. The adults help each other. Here a woman rubs her husband, there the sister her brother, from head to foot. The people as a whole are a yellow mass. The neck is decked out with faupar, wreaths of flowers. Bands of faupar are wound around arms and legs. The men wear on their heads the mätaritu, the thick, yellow dance wreath made of coconut fibers, and, in addition, enormous wooden combs with bird’s feathers, indeed, whole wings.' <sup id="cite_ref-742" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-742">[742]</a></sup> 'The women and girls wear freshly colored hip mats; their arms are adorned with tortoise-shell rings, on the head sits a wreath made of four precious tortoise-shell rings. What one individual has on his body in the way of adornment amounts to hundreds of marks. A happy, festive mood prevails on the dance place. The dancers stand to one side. One recognizes them by the rich adornment and the ubud which they have wound around their hips. They hold one more brief dress rehearsal in order to see whether everything goes well. Then the shell resounds. Everybody rushes into the dance house in order to gain a good place. The rows of dancers sit on the floor gravely and ceremoniously. It is an important day.' <sup id="cite_ref-743" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-743">[743]</a></sup> Festival were accordingly not 'publicly funded', but their organization depended on food pretations provided by lineage members.

In some districts only the chief’s lineage has one; in others only the well established lineages. At one time or another every lineage on Romonum has had its own wuut. When a man’s lineage is without a meeting house, he attends that of his father’s or his wife’s lineage.' <sup id="cite_ref-744" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-744">[744]</a></sup> 'Under aboriginal conditions a lineage’s wuut was not necessarily located near its jimw. It frequently stood by the shore, where it served as a canoe house ( wutten waa) as well as a meeting house ( wutten mwiic). A meeting house was not in itself taboo to women, although normally they did not enter it if men other than their husbands were present. Both men and women, however, could be present together at such feasts and dances as did not exclude one sex and were held in the meeting house. During certain ceremonies, men kept away from the meeting house and it was used exclusively by women. The women of a lineage could hold meetings of their own in its wuut.' <sup id="cite_ref-745" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-745">[745]</a></sup> 'Its wuut was the place where the unmarried young men of a lineage slept. Its older men, and at times the husbands of its women, also slept there whenever they were observing important sexual taboos. A meeting house was the lounging place for men during the evening, where they visited and told stories. In it visitors from other islands and districts were received, entertained, and put up for the night.' <sup id="cite_ref-746" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-746">[746]</a></sup> 'All the old lineage meeting houses of Romonum are gone today. All over Truk, however, every district still maintains at least one meeting house. Women enter them more freely now than they used to, because the unmarried men no longer sleep there. The latter now go to sleep in the houses of non-taboo relatives. Several unmarried men may together occupy a small hut for sleeping purposes, the hut being built in the style of an jimw rather than of an wuut. The district meeting house is still the place where the men sleep before a ball game or track meet. Guests are still entertained there, and it still is the place for feasts and district meetings. All local governmental functions are carried on in the district wuut.' <sup id="cite_ref-747" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-747">[747]</a></sup> Regional ceremonial centres were present until the 18th century, but were abandoned in the immediate pre-colonial period: 'I mention the foregoing in order to show that the present political and learned traditions of Truk derive from a set of older institutions, which they still echo. These institutions involved the political domination of Truk by a presumably immigrant clan whose patron god was Sowukachaw, for whom a shrine was maintained on Achaw Peak, the spiritual seat and source of supernatural power of that dominant clan. A dual system of titles, perhaps not unlike that in Ponape, may have been a feature of the organization of rank and authority, providing the basis for a subsequent division of Truk into the rival political and magico-religious leagues of immediate precolonial times. Truk and Ponape were not the only places in Micronesia to have a cult that associated kingship or high chiefship with a thunder god and basaltic stone. Mention has already been made of the sacred basaltic stones at Nan Moadol on Ponape and the association of one of them with the god of thunder. Basaltic peaks on Ponape were spirit places, and basaltic monoliths the abodes of spirits. This association of basalt with spirits appears [Page 561] even in the Marshall Islands. On Namu and Aur atolls, there were shrines with basaltic stones on them at the places of origin of the clans of paramount chiefs (Finsch 1893:396). The one on Namu, thrown into the sea by a zealous missionary, embodied a clan’s founder (Pollock 1977; Erdland 1914:345); and according to Erdland (1914:343), the totem of the high chiefly clan on Ebon was the thunder, Läköta (‘Sir Cloud’, see ļa- and kōd¸o in Abo et al. 1976). From Ngatik, near Ponape, the Bishop Museum has in its possession an old photograph of an altar. On top of it, according to a notation, is the “stone god,” from its appearance a block of basalt.' <sup id="cite_ref-748" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-748">[748]</a></sup> 'A high island, such as Kosrae or Ponape, clearly had to be the source of the basaltic stones in the atolls. But those who carried them and who introduced the cult had to be seafarers, and the seafarers, we have seen, were the atoll dwellers in Micronesia. Kosrae was obviously visited by Marshall Islanders, for the names of a number of places in the Marshalls were known in Kosrae (Sarfert 1919-20:218, 224). It is tempting to consider it the source of the basalt in Namu and Aur. But the Ponapean tradition that people from Namu were in some way associated with Isohkelekel, including mention of their clan name (Fischer, Riesenberg, and Whiting 1977:68, n. 22), makes it more likely that the basalt and the cult were brought to the Marshalls by Marshallese adventurers returning from Ponape.' <sup id="cite_ref-749" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-749">[749]</a></sup> Accordingly, we have assumed that their archeological remains did not serve ceremonial functions in the pre-colonial period.</dd>

Kachaw also appears as a place in Carolinian navigational lore. Until very recently, at least, most Micronesian scholars have accepted as fact that Kachaw is the island of Kosrae (Kusaie), situated about 560 km east southeast of Ponape. This identification has led to historical inferences about the role of Kosrae in Ponapean and Trukese prehistory. Critical examination of the linguistic and contextual evidence, however, indicates that in traditional Micronesian lore Kachaw referred to something quite different, namely the sky or a region of sky. It is as such that Kachaw was important in Trukese and Ponapean cosmology, religion, and legends of origin.

Until very recently, at least, most Micronesian scholars have accepted as fact that Kachaw is the island of Kosrae (Kusaie), situated about 560 km east southeast of Ponape. This identification has led to historical inferences about the role of Kosrae in Ponapean and Trukese prehistory. Critical examination of the linguistic and contextual evidence, however, indicates that in traditional Micronesian lore Kachaw referred to something quite different, namely the sky or a region of sky. It is as such that Kachaw was important in Trukese and Ponapean cosmology, religion, and legends of origin. Before I develop this argument, let me summarize how Kachaw is talked about in Trukese and Ponapean lore.' <sup id="cite_ref-757" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-757">[757]</a></sup></dd></dl>

One even finds very pretty figures among the children and young people. Unfortunately, they age very quickly, since their development proceeds rapidly and they marry at an age when our children are still playing around. Persons 15 to 25 years old look as if they were 30. People 50 years old are worn out and often frightfully ugly.' <sup id="cite_ref-759" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-759">[759]</a></sup> 'The Truk people share the fate of most of the peoples of the South Seas, who are not allotted a very long future. Malignant illnesses eat up the strength of the islanders, enemies for whom they are no match, since their blood is spoiled through and through as a result of immorality, marriages between relatives, child marriages, and undernourishment. This can be noticed even among small children. They are hardly half a year to a year old when sores break out over the whole body, especially on the lips, fingers, feet, and genital parts. The natives call it rub (frambesia). For some /195/ the body becomes one single boil. The sores disappear again after some time, only to break out anew here and there later on.

<dd> <b>♠ Infant mortality ♣ ♥</b> Bollig claims that infant mortality was high among the Chuukese: 'The feeding of the child is primarily a matter for the mother. But other women in the house do not hesitate to help the mother in the nursing. One can see children who have been able to walk and talk for a long time and are still suckled. The European feeding-bottle has also successfully made a way for itself and is filled with goat’s milk or condensed milk. If the mother of a suckling dies or if she cannot feed it enough, it is lost in most cases. The women try to feed it with curcuma or chew sugar cane which the little one must suck from their lips, but it is not much use. On the whole mortality is high among the little children of Truk. Many die from intestinal catarrh, fevers, and misery.' <sup id="cite_ref-761" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-761">[761]</a></sup> However, he does not provide precise figures.</dd></dl>
<p><b>Disease</b>

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Endemic disease ♣ ♥</b> Mahony describes a number of diseases. However, it appears that at least some of these were introduced during the colonial period: 'Before introducing the main problems and issues taken up in the current study, some attention needs to be given to the incidence and prevalence of disease in Truk. The main disease problems in Truk, as in the Trust Territory generally, are similar to those faced in many under-developed or developing areas. They [Page 11] consist of a variety of infectious diseases, some of which have a high endemic prevalence, some of which occasionally sweep through the islands in huge epidemics, and several of which are major contributing causes of death.' <sup id="cite_ref-762" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-762">[762]</a></sup> 'Other infectious diseases which have sometimes occurred in epidemic proportions in recent years include measles (rubeola), German measles, whooping cough (pertussis) and poliomyelitis. It should be noted that the Trust Territory administration in 1964 launched a mass immunization program for smallpox, tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough, poliomyelitis, typhoid and paratyphoid fever. This program is beginning to provide protection against some of the more serious epidemic diseases.' <sup id="cite_ref-763" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-763">[763]</a></sup> Gladwin and Mahony disagree on the prevalence of tuberculosis in the colonial period: 'Disease can never be avoided but with the exception of tuberculosis, which is apparently recent in the area and takes a serious toll, there are no diseases which could be called menacing. Smallpox was quite a killer between its introduction in the last century and the beginning of vaccination under the Japanese, but is now virtually unknown. The anopheles mosquito is not present, so there is no malaria; amebic dysentery exists, but probably because water is not drunk from the springs is never epidemic. Even syphilis is interdicted by the closely related skin disease yaws, although it is interesting and disturbing to speculate upon the possible consequences of the eradication of yaws (through the use of penicillin by the American administration) upon the resistance to syphilis of the rising generations.' <sup id="cite_ref-764" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-764">[764]</a></sup>  'Examination of Table I indicates that influenza syndrome, amoebiasis, chicken pox and mumps are serious endemic problems. The incidence of tuberculosis does not seem inordinately high, which indicates that this health problem is not as serious as has sometimes been thought. The same may be said of filariasis. The table shows that the hospital turned up only four cases of filariasis infection over a twelve-month period. Despite this apparently low incidence, a survey of 600 Trukese in 1966 showed that 14% carried microfilariae in their bloodstreams indicating a fairly high prevalence. Nevertheless, few of these cases had any active symptoms of the disease.' <sup id="cite_ref-765" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-765">[765]</a></sup> Bollig claims that consumption was prevalent: 'Consumption works hand in hand with vermination to exterminate the islanders. It is the consequence of the frequent influenza and pleurisy. Anyone who sees how the natives sleep on the cold floor in the wind, even if they perspire or have fever, how they run around for hours in wet rags, can only be astonished that they do not all die from consumption.' <sup id="cite_ref-766" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-766">[766]</a></sup> Bollig mentions an endemic skin rash of sorts: 'The Truk people share the fate of most of the peoples of the South Seas, who are not allotted a very long future.

[Page 215] As long as the natives have sufficient fresh food, breadfruit, for example, the illness claims few victims.

<p><b>♠ Tribute ♣ present ♥</b>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>♠ Staple ♣ present ♥</b> Chiefs were owed first fruits within their own districts: 'As a reward for his faithful activity, the chief receives the muen, that is, the first fruits from the yields of the fields and trees, for example, breadfruit, bananas, and taro. It is said that many chiefs go to the fields in order to inspect their condition so that if the occasion arises they can check the deliveries. The Truk chiefs do not have any other legal claims. Nevertheless their subjects give them assistance in their own interests. The chief usually receives the best part from festive meals and fishing. If there is fishing with mention of the name of the chief, however, he receives everything, and nobody is allowed to withhold anything. Woe to the one who in former times did not pay his tribute properly. He had no prospect of a long life. It is said of the old chiefs that they always had the blow shell beside them. When the puk, puk of the shell resounded from the chief’s house, the people knew its meaning immediately. They quickly came running in order to /117/ learn the wishes of the tyrant. At one time he would desire kon (pounded breadfruit), at another time fish, then [Page 128] bananas, then coconuts to drink. The chiefs today no longer dare commit these outrages but they still have sufficient means to obtain some things on the side. They announce a dance, for example, or hold an efilul (celebration in connection with house-building, held when the frame is erected). They certainly do not come out short at the feast connected with this. As a matter of fact, most chiefs understand very well how to entice from their people whatever they might like to have.' <sup id="cite_ref-783" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-783">[783]</a></sup> Junior lineages and provisional title holders were expected to deliver food prestations on the occasion of feasts: 'As noted above, the relations between a chief and the people of his district are patterned largely after the relations between the parties in divided ownership. As provisional title holders to territory, the various lineages owe the chief periodic gifts of produce from the land. These gifts are rendered at stated times in connection with feasts given in the chief’s honor. He fixes the time for these feasts in accordance with a seasonal calendar: two feasts during the breadfruit season, and two more during the turmeric season. The men of the various lineages prepare breadfruit in giant wooden bowls while the women fish. Other types of food are also collected. On the day of the feast each lineage brings its food in a procession, the men carrying the giant bowls on frames and chanting as they walk. The food is carried into the meeting house of the chief’s lineage. The chief then selects the largest bowl for himself and his lineage mates and redistributes the rest of the food to the assembled population. The distribution is made according to lineage and is roughly proportional to the size of each lineage. The contributions which each lineage makes are also proportional to the size of its membership and the amount of productive land which it controls. If a lineage fails in this obligation, the chief has the right to confiscate its holdings. Should he indicate dissatisfaction with the contribution of a particular lineage, its members will hasten to prepare additional food and other gifts to mollify him.' <sup id="cite_ref-784" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-784">[784]</a></sup> In case of conquest, subordinate districts were required to deliver food prestations to the victors: 'A district chiefship was divided between the oldest man in the senior female line in the chiefly lineage and the oldest man in the lineage generally. The latter was executive chief, or "chief of talk," and the former symbolic chief, or "chief of food." Food presentations were made to the symbolic chief. Sometimes the symbolic and executive functions fell to the same individual; often they did not. The symbolic chief was surrounded by his lineage brothers and by his sons, who acted as his agents. These followers and his sisters and daughters were of chiefly rank, distinct from commoners. Through conquest, a lineage might gain the chiefship in more than one district and establish a junior branch as the chiefly lineage in the conquered district. The now subordinate district rendered food presentations to the superordinate one. Most districts were linked in two rival leagues based on competing schools of magic and ritual relating to war, politics, and rhetoric. A chief's authority derived from two things. His lineage's ownership of the district's space entitled him to presentations of first fruits at stated times of the year. More importantly, it gave him authority over the conservation and use of the district's food resources. His authority also derived from his connection with the sky world, its gods, and their superhuman power to accomplish purposes. There was, therefore, a degree of sacredness associated with chiefs.' <sup id="cite_ref-785" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-785">[785]</a></sup> We have considered this to be a form of tribute between districts.

<p><b>♠ Wages ♣ absent ♥</b> Prior to colonization, the Chuukese system of production subsistence-based. eHRAF provides a general description of  subsistence, crafts, and trade: 'In the past, swidden gardens with dry taro, turmeric, and sugar cane were few and small. Breadfruit, supplemented by wet taro, was the staple. Being seasonal, breadfruit was preserved by fermenting in pits. Copra has become the only export. Fishing was important.' <sup id="cite_ref-788" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-788">[788]</a></sup> 'Traditionally, men gardened, cooked and processed food in bulk (in the earth oven), did deep-water fishing, engaged in war and public affairs, and practiced the arts of canoe and house building and of wood, shell, and stone working. Women wove, plaited mats, prepared meals (as distinct from food in bulk), did inshore fishing, and took main responsibility for child care.' <sup id="cite_ref-789" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-789">[789]</a></sup> 'Traditional crafts included: making outrigger paddle canoes; building houses; woodworking (to make bowls, storage chests, spears); gardening; cordage (to make rope, string, slings); working stone (for sling stones), shell (for adz blades), and coral (for breadfruit pounders); preparing medicines; loom weaving with hibiscus and banana fibers (to make loin clothes, wraparound skirts, shirts, mosquito canopies); plaiting (of baskets, mats); and other leaf working (for thatch, sun hats).' <sup id="cite_ref-790" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-790">[790]</a></sup> 'In traditional times, the atoll people around Chuuk traded with Pohnpei, Yap, and the Mariana Islands. The major export from Chuuk to the atolls was processed turmeric in the form of sticks that were used as a cosmetic. The major imports were woven pandanus mats and sennit cord, both of which were also produced on Chuuk. Sometimes, important men on Chuuk would trade for outrigger canoes or contract with men on atolls to make the canoes for them. Men from the atolls were also sometimes retained to sail the canoes of Chuukese men.' <sup id="cite_ref-791" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-791">[791]</a></sup> Commercial activities were introduced under Japanese occupation: 'Okinawans developed commercial fishing during Japanese rule; and some commercial fishing on a small scale was continued by the Chuukese after World War II. Under American rule, the principle source of cash income was government employment as teachers and program administrators. Tourism was unimportant.' <sup id="cite_ref-792" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-792">[792]</a></sup> Accordingly, the below variables are not relevant to the pre-colonial Chuuk.
