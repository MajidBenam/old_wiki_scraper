<p>"Unlike the West, it did not originate as an independent peasant community with common meadowland and distribution of arable land, but was a taxable unit whose boundaries were defined by the fisc. The Byzantine rural community was only an economic unit in so far as this served the purpose of taxation. Membership of the village community resulted from inscription on the tax list. It was this principle which determined other forms of peasant settlements, individual farmsteads and hamlets. In Byzantine rural economy the most important role was played by the typical village settlement in which the farmsteads formed a close nucleus round which the arable land of the peasants was grouped. The Byzantines called this kind of settlement a chorion. In addition there were also individual farms situated in the middle of an agricultural estate. These were called ktesidia and for purposes of taxation were linked with the nearest village settlement as a taxable unit. The so-called hamlets (agridia), consisting of a widely distributed group of houses and farms, were treated in the same way."<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ racing day ♥</b> "The concept of entertainments in the ancient and medieval world is problematic. To a modern reader it implies marginal and inessential activities geared to offer pleasure to individuals and groups. In the Graeco-Roman world public performances and spectacles were an essential element in the life of a properly constituted community. In both east and west rich citizens were required to undertake the funding of such events, for the benefit of all their fellow citizens. Moreover, the most important spectacles were provided as part of festivals, held in honour of divinities—including the emperors. In order to ensure that such spectacles were as excellent as possible, they were presented within the framework of a contest. Not only did sportsmen compete in athletic activities, but plays, recitals, and musical entertainments were presented within a competitive structure, which both ensured the production of excellence, and also emphasized the importance of victory: this latter aspect came to have increasing prominence, and to be stressed and appropriated by rulers." <sup id="cite_ref-284" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-284">[284]</a></sup> "Chariot races were the most important events in the life of the ordinary Byzantine citizen, and race days were occasions for excessive gambling, roistering, eating, and shouting-providing a particular kind of excitement and entertainment not available to him in any other facet of his life. The spectator chose a circus colour, and supported it for the sake of the supporting; 'and he shoved, screamed and lost his temper for the pleasure of it, for the intoxication of taking sides.' As a colour partisan, the Byzantine gambled his self-esteem on the outcome of the race, and this enthusiastic backing of a racing colour gave him an opportunity for contest, rivalry, and risk that was otherwise denied him in an increasingly authoritarian society." <sup id="cite_ref-285" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-285">[285]</a></sup> "During the mid-day interval of a typical racing programme, spectators remained in their seats and were entertained by a wide variety of performers. A series of individual acts or turns were presented: these included dancers, wild beasts, clowns, and on occasion, some of the spectators themselves. Mimes and singers performed, and acrobats walked a tightrope strung high above the circus floor. It is not certain how these activities evolved over the years, but they were recorded as an important and popular part of the festivities during the tenth century." <sup id="cite_ref-286" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-286">[286]</a></sup> NOTE: It was difficult to choose between this ritual and the imperial procession (described, for example, by McCormick <sup id="cite_ref-287" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-287">[287]</a></sup>--but it does seem that chariot races attracted the largest number of people to a single location.</dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ racing day ♥</b> "The concept of entertainments in the ancient and medieval world is problematic. To a modern reader it implies marginal and inessential activities geared to offer pleasure to individuals and groups. In the Graeco-Roman world public performances and spectacles were an essential element in the life of a properly constituted community. In both east and west rich citizens were required to undertake the funding of such events, for the benefit of all their fellow citizens. Moreover, the most important spectacles were provided as part of festivals, held in honour of divinities—including the emperors. In order to ensure that such spectacles were as excellent as possible, they were presented within the framework of a contest. Not only did sportsmen compete in athletic activities, but plays, recitals, and musical entertainments were presented within a competitive structure, which both ensured the production of excellence, and also emphasized the importance of victory: this latter aspect came to have increasing prominence, and to be stressed and appropriated by rulers." <sup id="cite_ref-429" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-429">[429]</a></sup> "Chariot races were the most important events in the life of the ordinary Byzantine citizen, and race days were occasions for excessive gambling, roistering, eating, and shouting-providing a particular kind of excitement and entertainment not available to him in any other facet of his life. The spectator chose a circus colour, and supported it for the sake of the supporting; 'and he shoved, screamed and lost his temper for the pleasure of it, for the intoxication of taking sides.' As a colour partisan, the Byzantine gambled his self-esteem on the outcome of the race, and this enthusiastic backing of a racing colour gave him an opportunity for contest, rivalry, and risk that was otherwise denied him in an increasingly authoritarian society." <sup id="cite_ref-430" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-430">[430]</a></sup> "During the mid-day interval of a typical racing programme, spectators remained in their seats and were entertained by a wide variety of performers. A series of individual acts or turns were presented: these included dancers, wild beasts, clowns, and on occasion, some of the spectators themselves. Mimes and singers performed, and acrobats walked a tightrope strung high above the circus floor. It is not certain how these activities evolved over the years, but they were recorded as an important and popular part of the festivities during the tenth century." <sup id="cite_ref-431" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-431">[431]</a></sup> NOTE: It was difficult to choose between this ritual and the imperial procession (described, for example, by McCormick <sup id="cite_ref-432" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-432">[432]</a></sup>--but it does seem that chariot races attracted the largest number of people to a single location.</dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ funerary wailing ♥</b> "Just as women were the principal figures at the time of the birth of children, as mothers, midwives, and nurses, so women also assumed a prominent role at the time of death of a family member. First of all, they helped to prepare the corpse for burial, washing the body, sprinkling it with fragrant oils and spices, and clothing it. Then, during the wake, they were the chief mourners, demonstrating their grief by wailing, tearing their hair, lacerating their cheeks with their fingernails, beating their breasts, and ripping apart their garments. Not only female relatives of the deceased, but also hired professional female mourners sang dirges, praising the virtues and lamenting the death of the departed one. Women mourners continued their wailing and lamentations as they accompanied the corpse to the cemetery. This practice elicited criticism by church fathers who complained that the mourning women in their paroxysms of grief resembled Maenads in a Bacchic frenzy and were indulging in shameful behavior by uncovering their heads and tearing their garments so as to reveal portions of their bodies. The church urged that funeral processions be conducted in a solemn, dignified manner and provided trained choirs of men and women to sing psalms and funeral hymns." <sup id="cite_ref-492" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-492">[492]</a></sup></dd>

</p><p>For the purposes of this project we define an institution as a system of social norms that governs the behavior of individuals in certain contexts, with social norms understood simply as socially transmitted rules of behavior. Institutions are also understood as being generally persistent across generations, changing only slowly over time although sometimes changing suddenly through some shock or radical social change. A classic example of an institution is marriage, which governs the behavior of the spouses in the context of their family and household. Particular norms within this institution describe the expected division of labor, rights and obligations of the partners, their children, and in-laws, etc. Because norms are socially transmitted rules, they are an example of a cultural element (by our definition, culture is any kind of socially transmitted information). There are other definitions of norms and institutions, but the one given here was chosen for its compatibility with the theoretical framework of cultural evolution (and this definition is not incompatible with alternative ones, e.g. institutions as alternative equilibria). It is often useful to distinguish formal from informal institutions. In the following, we will ask whether an institution is legally prescribed (part of a constitution or formal law code) or something that is an unwritten rule that, nevertheless, reflects the way things are done, and are expected to be done.
</p><p>We define 'elite' as the top social, political, economic, and/or religious members of society. In the codes below, when we say to code as 'equal to top nobility', we are referring to the society's elite groups and families. 'Higher than top nobility', then, refers to the ruling family, and 'lower than top nobility' refers to all people at a lower status than the elite groups and families.

<p>While the codes above reflect a legal or explicit right of some group to constrain the executive power, below code for non-formal limits. These include social or cultural norms which limit the action that can be seen as legitimately undertaken by the executive, for instance an unwritten restriction against an executive making changes to or decisions on religious matters. It is possible to code for all four combinations of absent/present along the formal/informal institution. This means that there could be the legal right to criticize a chief executive but it’s never used, or, there may not be a law that specifies how the ruler is criticized, but there is an established practice of doing so. Where coding ‘present’ provide explanation and examples. Note that you should only code non-violent actions (so a rebellion that overthrows the head of state is not an instance of informal ‘impeachment’)

<p>In this section we are interested in whether religious or supernatural agents impose limits on executive power. These codes refer to both formal, legal restrictions as well as informal constraints including social or cultural norms which limit the action that can be seen as legitimately undertaken by the executive, for instance an unwritten restriction against an executive making changes to or decisions on religious matters. Explain in descriptive section whether the constraint was formal or informal. ‘Religious agents’ here refers to religious groups, their leaders, or even religiously motivated individuals who are not leaders (e.g., Buddhist monks, street preachers)

<dd> <b>♠ Constraint on executive by religious agents ♣ ♥</b>  absent/present/unknown</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Constraint on executive by religious institutions ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. This refers to religious practices or norms that work to constrain the activity of the executive. This differs from the above code in that this code refers to restrictions imposed without the need for religious ‘agents’ specifically to act. For example, witchcraft accusations or the threat of such accusations could serve to limit the activity of political actors and act as a normative-behavior reinforcement. Explain in paragraph what the institution is and which groups of people are constrained by it.</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Impeachment by religious agents ♣ ♥</b>  absent/present/unknown</dd>

<dd> <b>♠ Motivation by belief in supernatural agent ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. In this position, code situations when chief executives take on personal costs or otherwise make prosocial or selfless actions where it is stated or believed to be because of internalized religious conviction. For example, a ruler dedicating war spoils to a temple rather than using them for personal benefit. Unlike the previous position (subordination), which can be theoretical, here we are looking for actual instances when leaders were motivated to do prosocial acts by religious considerations</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Customary mechanism ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. There is a broadly agreed-upon or customary mechanism (although perhaps not explicitly spelled out in law – see below) for power transfer. Explain how it was accomplished</dd>

<dd> <b>♠ Number of power transitions ♣ ♥</b> All transfers of power of the chief executive/head of state, noting whether it was done according to an orderly, consensual mechanism, or as a result of contested action (e.g., rebellion, coup d’état). Enter the total number of transitions here and list each one in the paragraph. Note Dynastic transitions where applicable</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Number of contested transitions ♣ ♥</b> How many transitions were contested (out of the total entered above), regardless of which party won the contest (i.e. incumbent or contesting agent). 1. We do not count as a contested transition any challenge that begins after 365 days have elapsed of the new reign. Caveat: care must be taken to record cases just after the cut off. We want to know when the conflict started. The reign end date of the previous ruler only tells us when the contest ended. Though a major event (e.g. a battle) can occur one and a half years after the new king's coronation the infighting/contest that lead up to it often begins earlier, such as immediately after the accession, or sometime within the first year. That infighting can be ignored by any historian who wants to simplify the text to mention only the battle. 2. Multiple separate contests within the transition timeframe should be counted as ONE contested transition. (Do not take time searching for the details of multiple separate contests but if all the detail is present in the same text opportunistically record it in the description field). 3. A transition can be contested before the new ruler is officially crowned.</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Number of successful overturns ♣ ♥</b> How many contested transitions of power resulted in an overturn of the ruler. This includes breaks in the normal line of succession (i.e. a dynastic succession was broken, a different party or ethnic group took power, or a rebellion resulted in a change to the rules or procedures regarding powers transitions) or when a relative overturns the ruler unexpectedly within the expected line of succession. Note: There will often be 'succession crises' when there is no 'normal line of succession' so that there will be a 'contested transition' with no possibility of a successful overturn: i.e. 1. The dynasty ends with no heir (typical cause of a succession crisis); 2. The previous ruler has died and divided the kingdom between his sons (who then decide to fight for it all); 3. There is no formal succession procedure and every succession is a fight (e.g. Mamluk Sultanate). These cases should not qualify as a successful overturn as nobody is being overturned.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Direct ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. Direct means that the executive maintains tight control over the appointment, removal, assessment, and duties of state-level officials</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Indirect ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. Indirect means that the executive influences the activities of administrators (i.e. by ability to remove administrator from office, or by promoting certain religious or ethical norms that influence administrative behavior), but has not explicit legal authority to determine their actions. E.g. senatorial governors in the Roman Empire assigned to govern a province by the Emperor, but with little oversight once in place</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Diffused ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. Diffused means that administrators act largely on their own accord, whether they are aligned with the interests of the ruler or not. The executive retains only minimal control over the officials, typically informal pressure such as a broad agreement for reciprocal military, political, or economic aid (e.g. the control of feudal monarchs in Medieval Europe). This can include officials who are selected and removed with or without the executive's control (i.e. hereditary control of an office by a certain kin-group)</dd>

<dd> <b>♠ Bribery ♣ ♥</b> This refers specifically to the economic aspect of corruption.

Although Constantine avoided ‘’divus’’ for his person, his successors revived the custom, whence arose the Byz. usage of ‘’theios’’ for the imperial person and institutions and ‘’sakra’’ for documents."<sup id="cite_ref-565" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-565">[565]</a></sup> Emperors were also frequently depicted as gods in works of art, in frescoes and mosaics, though this appears to be a stylistic representation of reverence for the rulers rather than a declaration of divinity.<sup id="cite_ref-566" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-566">[566]</a></sup>

</p><p><b>♠ Religious reinforcement of monogamy ♣ present ♥</b> “As mentioned earlier, the central, basic norm of  the Church's attitude toward marriage during the first millennium of Christianity is the idea that the mystical union of God and Israel, of Christ and the Church, is reflected only in a marriage that is perfectly monogamous. The idea is already explicit in St. Paul: widowers are allowed to remarry but are not encouraged to do so (1 Cor. 7:39-40). Early Christian writers show a remarkable consensus in supporting that view: the consensus includes Ter- tullian, Athenagoras, the Shepherd of Hermas, Clement, and Origen. In the fourth century St. John Chrysostom composed a treatise addressed ‘’To a Young Widow’’, encouraging her to remain in her widowhood rather than succumb to human weakness and remarry. // Chrysostom's early contemporary, St. Basil of Caesarea, is the author of numerous letters, a number of which were accepted in the Byzantine Church as normative canonical texts and sanc- tioned as such by the Council in Trullo (692). He writes: "The rule establishes one year of excom- munication for those who marry a second time. Other authorities even require two years. Those who marry a third time are often excommunicated for three or four years. And such a union is not called marriage, but polygamy, or rather punishable fornication ... (noevd(av xExokaoptvriv)." This negative attitude toward second or third marriages is maintained in the ninth century by St. Theodore of Stoudios; recognizing that civil law authorized such unions, he forbids their blessing in church.'5 The canons attributed to Patriarch Nicephorus (806-815)16 also forbid the "crowning" of any marriage except the first.17 This principle, which forbade ecclesiastical sanction in cases of consecutive bigamy and trigamy, must have been challenged first in the case of emperors. In the ninth century Theodore of Stoudios deplores the evil example of Emperor Constantine V Copronymos, who was married three times.” <sup id="cite_ref-577" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-577">[577]</a></sup>

St. Basil), but in reality they rarely knew prolonged periods of peace. The Byz. considered war evil, but their attitude was tempered by the recognition of its necessity in defending their Christian empire and brethren; thus courage, prowess in arms, and good generalship were praiseworthy attributes in historical figures such as Herakleios and Basil II, or in such legendary figures as Digenes Akritas. The Byz. also bestowed praise, however, on emperors such as Alexios Komnenos, who avoided unnecessary bloodshed by sparing conquered enemies and using diplomacy to resolve conflicts. Although divine favor in war was sought through military religious service, the cults of warrior saints (see military saints), and prayers for the success of imperial expeditions (Darrouzes, ‘’Epistoliers’’ 146, 149), Byz. churchmen deplored war, esp. between Christians, and refused to sanction killing; Patriarch Polyeuktos countered the petition of Nikephoros II Phokas to have his slain soldiers declared martyrs with St. Basil’s ruling that soldiers who had killed in battle could not receive communion for three years.” <sup id="cite_ref-607" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-607">[607]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ care/harm ♣ present ♥</b> “The Byzantine Empire maintained a network of philanthropic institutions designed to shelter travellers and homeless migrants (‘’xenoi’’), provide free medical care for the ill, nurture orphans, and organize food allotments during famines (Constantelos 1991: 113). [...] Modern scholars agree that Christ’s command to assist the suffering underlay the development of specialized welfare services in Byzantium. According to Matthew’s gospel, Jesus required that Christians feed the hungry, clothe the naked, welcome the stranger, and care for the sick (Matt. 25: 34-5).” <sup id="cite_ref-615" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-615">[615]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ fairness/cheating ♣ present ♥</b> “One of Jesus' parables pictured an ‘unjust’ judge who initially was too lazy to hear the case of a widow whom an anonymous person has treated badly over some issue. She is not getting her rights and lacks the support of a husband and family, but her persistent appeals eventually win the day. Her case is heard and she is granted ‘justice’ or what is due to her. The Christian tradition came to call justice, along with prudence, temperance, and fortitude, one of the four cardinal (‘hinge’) virtues, because right human conduct pivots upon them.” <sup id="cite_ref-616" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-616">[616]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ in-group loyalty ♣ present ♥</b> "The most obvious practice that would have distinguished Christians from pagans was church attendance. Just showing up was a sign of affiliation, however incomplete in the eyes of the Church Fathers. Preachers complained about the decline in attendance on certain days or the laziness of the absent portion of the congregation and praised those who were present for the sermons. In his sermon “Against the Pagans,” Augustine at one point addresses his listeners as the “real Christians,” in contrast to the so-called Christians who had opted for the chariot races. Later, he further acknowledges their presence in church: “Thank heaven that you have come here together at all.”" <sup id="cite_ref-617" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-617">[617]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ respect for authority ♣ present ♥</b> The emperor’s authority was valued above all. “This providential man was chosen by God: his coins proclaimed the fact that he was ‘from God’ (‘’ek theou’’). His subjects called themselves ‘’douloi’’, which in the time of Thucydides had meant ‘slaves’ but now perhaps connoted something closer to ‘servants’. The ‘’basileus’’ was God’s own representative on earth who had inherited the trappings of the cult of his pagan Roman predecessors’ divinity.” <sup id="cite_ref-618" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-618">[618]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ purity ♣ present ♥</b> “Chastity is a condition of spiritual and bodily purity in which the Christian person retains control over his or her impulses and desires, presenting a life to God that reflects and realizes the condition of humanity’s first innocent formation. It refers, most often, to the restraining of the specifically sexual appetites of the body, reflecting the word’s Latin root, ‘’castus’’ (‘pure’) which also has from ancient times retained a meaning of abstinence from sexual and other sensual activities. [...] With respect to sexual purity, chastity may refer in practical terms either to a complete abstention from all sexual activity (as in the case of monastics, or as the Orthodox Church expects of all persons prior to marriage), or to the right ordering and sacred engagement of the sexual appetites within the sacramental bond of married life. But chastity as a notion is often employed to the whole spiritual and bodily demeanor of purity before God, and is not simply referring to the sexual appetites. The curbing of any and all passionate impulses may be enjoined under the call to chastity (which is why, for example, it is included as the first positive petition in the famous prayer attributed to St. Ephrem and used throughout the Great Fast); thus chastity may relate to a right practice of patience, godly conversation, the fostering of right social attitudes and activities, the refraining from gossip and slander, etc. [...] Chastity may therefore be seen as the overarching virtue of rightly ordering one’s life and activities, bodily as well as spiritually, so that the other virtues might be realized and God’s temple, the human person, made a fitting home for its King.” <sup id="cite_ref-619" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-619">[619]</a></sup></dd>

<p><b>♠ Moralistic punishment by human agents ♣ present ♥</b> There were two types of punishment that religious agents or institutions could impose on the faithful: epitimia and excommunication. The epitimion was “a penalty imposed on a penitent by the priest following sacramental confession. The term was already in use by the 4th C. (Basil the Great, PG 32:721A). As a rule these penitential exercises, mentioned in Byz. canonical and ascetical literature, presupposed repentance and consisted of prayer, fasting, Scripture reading, prostrations, almsgiving, and, on occasion, temporary exclusion from the Eucharist. They were distinguished by their largely positive character and relative mildness from such formal punishments (‘’timoriai’’) as excommunication, suspension, or deposition, which were inflicted by the church for more serious transgressions such as heresy or apostasy. Since sin was understood as a disease rather than a legally punishable crime, ‘’epitimia’’ in Byz. penitential practice and theology were viewed as corrective remedies, that is, as a form of spiritual healing. At any rate, they were never reduced to a payment or a fine due to God.” <sup id="cite_ref-624" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-624">[624]</a></sup> As for excommunication, it “entailed the exclusion of the transgressor from the community or fellowship of the church and its sacraments, esp. the Eucharist. Offending members included emperors, for example, Leo VI and Michael VIII. The separation from the church’s sacramental life was either absolute or partial, that is, it could be either temporary or for the lifetime of the individual.” <sup id="cite_ref-625" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-625">[625]</a></sup>

<dd> <b>♠ exile ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Based on the following quote, it seems that exile was a form of punishment that could be inflicted by the state, and not by religious agents—indeed, it was commonly inflicted ‘’upon’’ religious agents. “The Book of the Eparch several times mentions ‘’exoria’’ as a penalty for economic crimes; normally, however, exile was reserved for political criminals and suspects, esp. church leaders (John Chrysostom, Pope Martin I, Theodore of Stoudios, Photios, etc.).” <sup id="cite_ref-627" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-627">[627]</a></sup> Excommunication “entailed the exclusion of the transgressor from the community or fellowship of the church and its sacraments, esp. the Eucharist.” <sup id="cite_ref-628" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-628">[628]</a></sup> but the relevant entry of the ‘’Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium’’ does not say that this exclusion was physical.</dd>
