</p><p>In Andhra region post-Mauryans: "This appearance of kingship, currency and writing indicates that the basic infrastructures of a state system, which had been introduced in the Maurayn period, started functioning at the local level and transforming the megalithic/tribal society into proto or early states, basically characterized by centralized administration, stable kingship and social stratification."<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>

</p><p>In Andhra region post-Mauryans: "Along with local kingships, inscriptions of this period mention other socio-political and socio-economic institutions, particularly as nigama and gothi. Although it is not possible to comprehend the precise nature of these institutions in this period of coastal Andhra, textual and epigraphic evidence indicates that a nigama was an imporant economic and social unit larger than a village (gama), and was composed of integrated members of kin groups and occupational or professional groups. A gothi (skt. gosthi), was another important economic and social institution particularly for urban elites. Bhattiprolu inscriptions also show that these urban institutions and local kings were closely connected, as the inscriptions describe the king Kuberaka as the chief (pamukha=skt. pramukha) of a nigama and a gothi. This seems to indicate that the kings in this period of Andhra were not absolute rulers with invincible powers, but were close to chiefdoms or, in Chattopadhyaya's word, 'localities' that derived possibly from the foundations of megalithic chiefs. These 'localities' seem to have consolidated their powers in close association with urban elites that also started appearing in this period."<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>
</p><p>"The political and economic development in the post-Mauryan period progressed further under the Sadas, a regional dynasty which ruled the larger part of coastal Andhra for at least a century ... Although the historical evidence on this recently-found dynasty is still meagre, a few epigraphic records indicate the presence of a regular administrative structure indicated by titles such as an irrigation officer (?) (paniyagharika) and a scribe (lekhaka). There is also little doubt that the dynasty maintained royal coinage. Unlike the post-Mauryan coinage, which was basically uninscribed, the Sada coins were consistently inscribed with the ruler's name and kept the same design, a standing lion facing a tree ..."<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>

<p>Code the variables below for the most widespread collective ritual of the official cult. Widespread refers to the degree of coverage a ritual has in a polity and therefore to the proportion of the overall population that participates in or observes a ritual. Keep in mind that it is possible that the ritual with the highest coverage is not necessarily a mass ritual performed at one location, but can be a ritual that is performed all over the polity and of which the aggregate of all participants represent the largest degree of coverage. If there are several collective rituals that are equally widespread, code the best documented one.

<p>Unlike the preceding rituals, the most dysphoric collective ritual may not belong to the official cult, but may be practiced by another group that has a significant role in the polity. When selecting the relevant ritual do keep in mind that we are foremost interested in rituals containing the highest intensity of dysphoria even though they may contain other elements that are less emotional or even euphoric. Furthermore, we are interested in peak levels of dysphoria for participants or ritual specialists (not the audience or sacrificial victims). Also, as we are interested in how these dysphoric moments are remembered it is necessary for the participants not normally to die during the rituals. If there are several collective rituals with the same high levels of peak dysphoria, code the best documented one.

</p><p><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of monogamy ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> “First, Buddhism, like Christianity, grew out of the matrix of another religion. Consequently, Buddhism’s ethical system emerged resting squarely on a body of preestablished forms of family practice, and supported by a fairly codified sociolegal system that had already taken form under the aegis of the Brahmanical tradition, sometime before the sixth-century bce. Thus, as a relatively late arriver, Buddhism accepted, tacitly, many of the given forms of social praxis in India. And, even when Buddhism sought to redefine religious goals and family values, these efforts were manifested vis-a-vis patterns that had already been in place for centuries. In short, whatever the exact historical reasons, one will look in vain for Buddhist spokespersons seeking to redo marriage law in India or in other Asian countries.” <sup id="cite_ref-120" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-120">[120]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Ideology reinforces prosociality ♣ present ♥</b> Buddhism: “The twofold benefit of living a morally good life is linked to a twofold motivation: ‘Protecting oneself, one protects others; protecting others, one protects oneself ’ - just as each acrobat in a balancing act protects his partner by concentrating on himself, and protects himself by concentrating on his partner (see SN 47:19). If we take care of our own spiritual development, we render a service to others; and if we develop love towards others, we thereby also help ourselves. Accordingly, it is explicitly stated, someone who pursues the path of salvation only for his or her own benefit is to be censured, while the one who follows the path for one’s own benefit and for the benefit of others is to be commended (see AN 7:64).” <sup id="cite_ref-121" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-121">[121]</a></sup> “Three segments of the Noble Eightfold Path (3 - 5) are traditionally subsumed under the principle of morality (sila): ‘right speech’ (3), ‘right action’ (4) and ‘right livelihood’ (5). [...] ‘Right action’ is explained as abstaining from harming and killing sentient beings - including animals (!), and further as abstaining from ‘taking what is not given’ and from sexual misconduct, which means avoiding sexual relations with women who are still under the protection of their families, or with those who are married, betrothed, or celibate for religious reasons. From monks and nuns complete sexual abstention is demanded. ‘Right livelihood’ means abstaining from those sources of income which involve harming other beings: trading in weapons for instance, or trading in living beings, meat, intoxicants or poison; also included is the avoidance of fraud and avarice.” <sup id="cite_ref-122" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-122">[122]</a></sup> Jainism: “The ethos of storing up merit leads to all manner of positive charitable activities, for which the Jain community is justifiably famous. But all such activities are ultimately in the service of spiritual liberation. To give, for a Jain layperson, is actually a mentally purifying act - a mini-renunciation - in preparation for the ultimate renunciation for which the layperson hopes eventually to be ready - if not in this life, then in a future rebirth.” <sup id="cite_ref-123" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-123">[123]</a></sup> Asoka’s edicts: “There is no higher duty then the welfare of the whole world. And what little effort I make is in order that I may be free from debt to the creatures, that  I may render them happy here and they may gain heaven in the next world.”’... The new ideas of social and moral ethics which Asoka infused into Buddhism were in keeping with his idea of adapting a new religion to contemporary needs during a period of political and economic transition. Instead of appealing to the narrow sectarian religious interests, he stressed the conscious aplication of pristine virtues of humanitarianism in social behaviour. In the complex cultural milieu of the third century B.C., Asoka inculcated the true meaning of Dhamma - man’s responsibility to his fellow human beings.’ <sup id="cite_ref-124" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-124">[124]</a></sup>

<dl><dd><b>♠ charity ♣ present ♥</b> “Living a morally good life thus always brings a twofold benefit: Others are aided and one’s own spiritual development or karmic disposition is positively affected. This point is captured in one of the central Buddhist virtues: dana, which is ‘giving’ or ‘generosity’. ‘Giving’ creates a win-win situation. Not only is the gift’s recipient benefited but also the gift’s donor - particularly from a Buddhist point of view, since through giving one counters attachment in its deep-seated form of greedy grasping, of not letting-go.” <sup id="cite_ref-125" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-125">[125]</a></sup> Jainism: “The ethos of storing up merit leads to all manner of positive charitable activities, for which the Jain community is justifiably famous.

<dd><b>♠ morality ♣ present ♥</b> Buddhism: “If ‘thirst’ and ‘attachment’ constitute the one root of suffering - both the suffering one undergoes oneself in sansaric existence, and the suffering one inflicts upon others - it follows that any successful attempt to reduce one’s ‘thirst’ and to moderate one’s ‘attachment’ will also result in a life causing less suffering (at least less deliberately-inflicted suffering) to others - and this is what morality basically means for Buddhism: reducing suffering, alleviating suffering, causing less suffering. Morality is an intrinsic part of the path to salvation because it is part and parcel of the salvific process of overcoming ‘thirst’ and ‘attachment’.” <sup id="cite_ref-132" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-132">[132]</a></sup> Jainism: “Like Hindus and Buddhists, Jains affirm the reality of a universal moral principle of cause and effect called karma. Derived from a Sanskrit word meaning ‘act’, karma governs all action. It can be likened to Newton’s Third Law of Motion: for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. But traditional Indic worldviews do not make the sharp distinction, so typical of modern Western thought, between the realms of fact and value. Karma thus manifests not only in the form of physical laws, such as gravity, but also as a moral law governing action. If one engages in actions that are violent, or motivated by hatred, selfishness, or egotism, the universe will respond in kind, producing suffering in the one who has caused suffering to others. Similarly, if one engages in actions that are benevolent, pure, and kind, the universe will respond benevolently, and one will have pleasant experiences.” <sup id="cite_ref-133" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-133">[133]</a></sup> Asoka’s edicts: ‘In Rock Edict IX Asoka denounces the practice of many orthodox ceremonies and maintains that the practice of morality is far more important than the observance of rituals.’ <sup id="cite_ref-134" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-134">[134]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement against harm ♣ present ♥</b> “The heart of Buddhist spiritual life, whether lay or monastic, is punya (Pali punna). This term is usually translated as ‘merit’ and refers to certain significant kinds of action that are regarded as auspicious and potent deeds. Essentially, merit is good ‘karma’ (karman/kamma)&nbsp;: wholesome (kusla/kusala) deeds which plant seeds that bear fortunate and pleasant fruits, whether in this life or lives to come, and thereby create conditions for further meritorious action in the future. These are the kinds of action that conduce to the development of the qualities of the eightfold path. Moreover it is making merit that binds the lay and monastic communities together. The traditional ‘bases of merit’ are generosity (dana), ethical conduct (sila/sila), and meditation (bhavana). [...]The practice of good conduct takes the form of commitment to the five precepts usually recited in conjunction with the three refuges: (1) to refrain from harming living creatures, (2) to refrain from taking what is not given, (3) to refrain from sexual misconduct, (4) to refrain from false speech, (5) to refrain from intoxicants that cause heedlessness (see pp. 170- 2). In addition the lay disciple may on special occasions (traditionally the full moon ‘observance’ days) or for longer periods take the eight precepts, replacing the third precept (refraining from sexual misconduct) with complete sexual abstinence and adding (6) refraining from eating after midday, (7) refraining from attending entertainments and using perfumes, etc., and (8) refraining from using luxurious beds.”<sup id="cite_ref-179" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-179">[179]</a></sup> “The nature of bad action is usually illustrated by reference to a list of the ten courses of unwholesome action (karma/kamma-patha) which consist of three bodily courses of action (taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct), four vocal courses of action (lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech, frivolous speech), and three mental courses of action (covetousness, ill-will, wrong view). [...] Essentially the psychological states that motivate the ten unwholesome courses of action- strong greed, hatred, and delusion -lead to rebirth in the unhappy destinies or ‘descents’: in a hell realm, as a hungry ghost, an animal, or a jealous god.

What ‘right action’ and ‘right livelihood’ positively involve becomes clearer in the numerous practical guidelines for dealing with one’s parents, teachers, spouse, children, friends, one’s master and servant, Brahmans and Sramanas. So, for example, in the very popular Sigalovada Sutta (DN 31): Children should honour their parents, be grateful and support them when they are in need or grow old; parents should show their love to their children by teaching them virtue, training them for a profession and passing on their inheritance when it is due; [...] a husband should minister to his wife ‘by honouring her, by not disparaging her, by not being unfaithful to her, by giving authority to her, by providing her with adornments’. A wife will reciprocate ‘by properly organising her work, by being kind to the servants, by not being unfaithful, by protecting stores, and by being skilful and diligent in all she has to do’.” <sup id="cite_ref-189" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-189">[189]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of in-group loyalty ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> “As mentioned before, the development of a loving mind towards all beings, whether friend or foe, is the aim of one of the meditative practices of early Buddhism (see above p. 53f). In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsaric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21).” <sup id="cite_ref-190" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-190">[190]</a></sup> “[...] Buddhism maintained a fairly flexible posture vis-a-vis competing religions and never sought to require laity to identify themselves exclusively as Buddhist or to rely singularly on the Buddhist clergy for all their spiritual needs.” <sup id="cite_ref-191" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-191">[191]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of bravery ♣ absent ♥</b> “In marked contrast to the view of Islam about the fate of warriors who die in a holy war, the Buddha expresses the view in the Sutta Nipata (Sn.iv.308-11) that soldiers who die in battle go not to a special paradise but to a special hell, since at the moment of death their minds were bent on killing. Some texts affirm that even killing in self-defence, or in defence of family or friends, is wrongful, and in general an attitude of non-resistance in the face of violence is commended. The commentary to the Dhammapada relates how on one occasion when the Buddha's kinsmen, the Sakyas, were under attack, they allowed themselves to be slaughtered rather than break the First Precept. Other examples in the Jatakas and elsewhere speak of princes and kings who renounced their thrones rather than resorting to violence to defend their kingdoms.” <sup id="cite_ref-193" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-193">[193]</a></sup></dd>

By refraining from punishment, a king would thus support the evil-doers and become directly responsible for the growth of violence in his country. Ultimately, then, non-violence is not really an option, for non-violent rule would in fact lead to even more violence.
