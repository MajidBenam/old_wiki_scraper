For example, Structure 31 on Mound 1 at San José Mogote is a round platform which may have been used for dancing or combat, based on the use of similar structures in later periods. Other buildings include structures 14 and 19, with Monument 3 (the image of a captive carved into a stone slab) placed in a corridor between the two buildings. The use of the former is unknown as the building has been disturbed by later constructions and the reuse of blocks. The later formed the base for a large wattle-and-daub temple.<sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup>

</p><p><b>Description of the Ritual System</b>
</p><p>The Rosario polity was a continuation of the San Jose polity. San Jose Magote remained the largest urban area and the ritual system continued to develop the Earth and Sky deities. The Earth was a benevolent spirit, but it disliked having crops removed, the digging of post holes or being burnt. It would respond in anger through earthquakes. The Sky was full of celestial spirits and ancestors in the form of clouds, if angry it would respond with lightning. "Earth and Sky appear to have been the ancestors of certain male descent groups in San Jose phase villages." <sup id="cite_ref-232" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-232">[232]</a></sup>

Birth
Cranial deformationhigh status infants with cranial deformation found, children were either strapped to a fixed occipital board with a board on the forehead (tabular) or had a band tied tight around their head (anular). Tabluar deformation was the most common in the graves and could occur to male and female. One girl had annular deformation, possibly from another tribe, she was also buried atypically. <sup id="cite_ref-233" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-233">[233]</a></sup>
</p><p>Death
BurialspresentAt Tomaltepec more than 60 graves found, some have two skeletonsthe first evidence of husband and wife burials and people being treated as a pair rather than individuals. Evidence to suggest that people were dug up and reburied with their spouses. No infants or childrenonly those old enough to have gone through initiation rituals.
Six men were buried in a kneeling position (all others extended prone) which was so tight they must have been tied or wrapped. They contained half the vessels in the cemetery and most of the jade beads and it is likely they were the community leaders. <sup id="cite_ref-234" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-234">[234]</a></sup>
In small cemetery in San Jose Magote remains of all ages found. Most were buried fully extended and face down. Nearly all adults had a single jade bead in the mouth. Husband and wife pairs were present. <sup id="cite_ref-235" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-235">[235]</a></sup>

The evidence suggests that at the core of this corporate identity was the relationship between the community and the divine with sacrifice and perhaps feasting and dance as rituals through which people contacted the sacred." <sup id="cite_ref-240" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-240">[240]</a></sup> "I argue that Mound 1 represents a further 'scaling up' of public architecture and ritual performance, which engaged larger numbers of people in practices which defined the San José Mogote community and its broader polity. The evidence suggests that at the core of this corporate identity was the relationship between the community and the divine with sacrifice and perhaps feasting and dance as rituals through which people contacted the sacred. "[...] "Although people used autosacrificial bloodletting to make offerings to the deities as early as the Early Formative, the innovation of human sacrifice represents a new and more spectacular ritual practice used to communicate with the divine. It is likely that the performance of human sacrifice was restricted to Rosario-phase nobles, given that evidence for this practice was associated only with public buildings and elite residences and that only nobles carried out the ritual in later periods (Boone 1984; Schele &amp; Miller 1986). Nobles acted as intermediaries between people and the sacred realm with human sacrifice as a new ritual form probably linked to warfare. Elaborate obsidian bloodletters and the anthropomorphic brazier suggest the presence of luxury goods and ritual paraphernalia restricted to nobles." <sup id="cite_ref-241" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-241">[241]</a></sup> "Despite the emergence of hereditary nobles, it is likely that the construction of monumental buildings, the enactment of public ceremonies like human sacrifice, and the pursuit of warfare were probably still seen in communal terms. Given that hereditary inequality emerged out of a more communal and less hierarchical discourse, it is reasonable to assume that the power of nobles was dependent on their being seen as acting on the behalf of their communities. These early nobles undoubtedly had ritual and political obligations to their communities like Zapotec and Mixtec rulers at the time of the Spanish Conquest. It is likely that nobles earned the allegiance of commoners through the sponsoring of public ceremonies, including ritual feasting, as well as through success in warfare and perhaps the gifting of certain luxury goods. Nobles deployed human sacrifice as another way to maintain allegiance since it was the most potent way in which the sacred covenant could be activated to petition deities for fertility and prosperity on behalf of the community. Given the physical setting of Monument 3, the audience for these sacrifices was probably restricted, much like the setting of Middle Formative iconography dealing with human sacrifice in other parts of Mesoamerica (A. Joyce 2008b). By taking captives and offering them as sacrifices to the gods, nobles at San José Mogote demonstrated their ritual and political power as well as generosity to their communities. Human sacrifice was also a dramatic ritual performance in both its sacred and its violent qualities that would have bound people to the deities, ancestors, and other symbols of the community on whose behalf the sacrifice was realized." <sup id="cite_ref-242" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-242">[242]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ women's rituals ♥</b> NOTE: Women's rituals are here considered "most widespread" because, unlike other rituals, which were confined to specialised buildings, these ones were performed in virtually every house. Moreover, though Marcus reconstructs two possible women's rituals, only one can be coded. The divination ritual has been chosen because it is very slightly better understood. However, relevant passages describing the figurine ritual have been included here because it might be useful. "Although there is no sign of women’s tools or activities near our early public buildings, we do find evidence for women’s ritual in three places: the house (yoho quixi or yoho coba); the associated ramada or lean-to (yoho yaha or yoho yaa); and the surrounding dooryard. These activities are believed to include (1) divination by the casting of beans or maize kernels, and (2) communication with recent ancestors through the use of small solid figurines. "Let us begin with divination, which—by analogy with ethnohistoric descriptions—may have been carried out in special basins in the dooryard of the house. Such basins were waterproofed with a layer of lime plaster, then painted in one of the colors associated with the four Zapotec world directions: red, yellow, white, or black. Two such painted basins were discovered in the yard of a San José phase house, Household C3, at San José Mogote (Fig. 9). East of the house was a red-painted basin, while a yellow-painted basin lay 3 m to the south. The red-painted basin was 1.2 m in diameter and recessed 5 cm into the ground; it had been mud-plastered, given a waterproof coating of lime, then painted red with specular hematite. The yellow-painted basin was similar in every way except color. Whether there were once four basins—each painted a different color and oriented to one of the four world directions—is not known, since exposing the relevant areas of the yard would have required the destruction of a later building (Marcus 1989: fig. 8.20). "We know from sixteenth-century documents that Zapotec diviners sat on a mat and cast maize kernels onto the surface of a water-filled basin, noting whether they fell or floated in groups of 2, 3, 5, or 13. This use of water (niça) for casting lots was called tiniyaaya niça, and it was used to determine the cause and cure of illnesses affecting household members; to predict whether a particular day was auspicious for planting or marriage; or to assign a name to a newborn child. We suspect that the painted basins of Household C3 may have served for such divination (Fig. 10). "Zapotec women also petitioned their recently deceased ancestors for guidance, often doing so in or near the house where that ancestor had lived. We suspect, on the basis of ethnographic analogy, that small solid figurines— of which we have found hundreds in household context—provided the medium to which the spirits of specific ancestors could return during this petitioning. Women preferred to petition their female ancestors, which may account for the fact that the majority of these figurines are women." <sup id="cite_ref-261" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-261">[261]</a></sup> "Women’s ritual seems to have been conducted in the house, the adjacent lean-to, and the surrounding dooryard. The recently deceased ancestors—both males and females, but especially females—appear to have been the focus of much of this ritual. Small solid figurines, sometimes arranged in ritual scenes, evidently provided a venue to which the spirits of the ancestors could return; in that venue they were probably consulted, petitioned, and involved in the ongoing affairs of their descendants. Women also made figurines of animals (principally dogs and birds), which may have served the ancestors as “animal agents” like those described for China." <sup id="cite_ref-262" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-262">[262]</a></sup> "In later periods in China, animals continued to be important as lineage emblems, playing roles in ritual and in communicating with the Sky, Earth, and the dead (Chang 1980: 209).The Shang-period Chinese (1200-1000 b.c.) depicted animals on bronze vessels, including dragons or snakes. Such depictions were called wu, a term that has been translated “animal offerings.”According to K. C. Chang (1983: 65): 'to make animal offerings was a concrete means of achieving communication between heaven and earth, the dead and the living. We thus come to the inevitable conclusion that the animal designs on Shang and Chou bronzes are iconographically meaningful: they are images of the various animals that served as the helpers of shamans and shamanesses in the task of communication between heaven and earth, the spirits and the living.'" <sup id="cite_ref-263" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-263">[263]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ women's rituals ♥</b> NOTE: Though Marcus reconstructs two possible women's rituals, only one can be coded. The divination ritual has been chosen because it is very slightly better understood. However, relevant passages describing the figurine ritual have been included here because it might be useful. "Although there is no sign of women’s tools or activities near our early public buildings, we do find evidence for women’s ritual in three places: the house (yoho quixi or yoho coba); the associated ramada or lean-to (yoho yaha or yoho yaa); and the surrounding dooryard. These activities are believed to include (1) divination by the casting of beans or maize kernels, and (2) communication with recent ancestors through the use of small solid figurines. "Let us begin with divination, which—by analogy with ethnohistoric descriptions—may have been carried out in special basins in the dooryard of the house. Such basins were waterproofed with a layer of lime plaster, then painted in one of the colors associated with the four Zapotec world directions: red, yellow, white, or black. Two such painted basins were discovered in the yard of a San José phase house, Household C3, at San José Mogote (Fig. 9). East of the house was a red-painted basin, while a yellow-painted basin lay 3 m to the south. The red-painted basin was 1.2 m in diameter and recessed 5 cm into the ground; it had been mud-plastered, given a waterproof coating of lime, then painted red with specular hematite. The yellow-painted basin was similar in every way except color. Whether there were once four basins—each painted a different color and oriented to one of the four world directions—is not known, since exposing the relevant areas of the yard would have required the destruction of a later building (Marcus 1989: fig. 8.20). "We know from sixteenth-century documents that Zapotec diviners sat on a mat and cast maize kernels onto the surface of a water-filled basin, noting whether they fell or floated in groups of 2, 3, 5, or 13. This use of water (niça) for casting lots was called tiniyaaya niça, and it was used to determine the cause and cure of illnesses affecting household members; to predict whether a particular day was auspicious for planting or marriage; or to assign a name to a newborn child. We suspect that the painted basins of Household C3 may have served for such divination (Fig. 10). "Zapotec women also petitioned their recently deceased ancestors for guidance, often doing so in or near the house where that ancestor had lived. We suspect, on the basis of ethnographic analogy, that small solid figurines— of which we have found hundreds in household context—provided the medium to which the spirits of specific ancestors could return during this petitioning. Women preferred to petition their female ancestors, which may account for the fact that the majority of these figurines are women." <sup id="cite_ref-289" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-289">[289]</a></sup> "Women’s ritual seems to have been conducted in the house, the adjacent lean-to, and the surrounding dooryard. The recently deceased ancestors—both males and females, but especially females—appear to have been the focus of much of this ritual. Small solid figurines, sometimes arranged in ritual scenes, evidently provided a venue to which the spirits of the ancestors could return; in that venue they were probably consulted, petitioned, and involved in the ongoing affairs of their descendants. Women also made figurines of animals (principally dogs and birds), which may have served the ancestors as “animal agents” like those described for China." <sup id="cite_ref-290" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-290">[290]</a></sup> "In later periods in China, animals continued to be important as lineage emblems, playing roles in ritual and in communicating with the Sky, Earth, and the dead (Chang 1980: 209).The Shang-period Chinese (1200-1000 b.c.) depicted animals on bronze vessels, including dragons or snakes. Such depictions were called wu, a term that has been translated “animal offerings.”According to K. C. Chang (1983: 65): 'to make animal offerings was a concrete means of achieving communication between heaven and earth, the dead and the living. We thus come to the inevitable conclusion that the animal designs on Shang and Chou bronzes are iconographically meaningful: they are images of the various animals that served as the helpers of shamans and shamanesses in the task of communication between heaven and earth, the spirits and the living.'" <sup id="cite_ref-291" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-291">[291]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from military ♣ inferred absent  ♥</b> While there is evidence of an emerging elite the nature of leadership is still unclear. Given the focus on raiding it is unlikely that rulers were separate from the ‘military’. ‘The brazier and tomb still do not constitute definitive evidence of a system of ranked descent groups, but they do suggest that by the Rosario phase there may have been more use of a rhetoric that claimed a connection between wealth, status, power, and ancestors. The use of the term "chiefdom" might be appropriate for this social formation, with the proviso that we still cannot be sure that ranked descent groups were part of the social matrix.’ <sup id="cite_ref-324" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-324">[324]</a></sup>  More influential members of society also began to emerge more prominently during this period, who organised labour for the construction of large public structures and elaborate tombs.

These early nobles undoubtedly had ritual and political obligations to their communities like Zapotec and Mixtec rulers at the time of the Spanish Conquest. It is likely that nobles earned the allegiance of commoners through the sponsoring of public ceremonies, including ritual feasting, as well as through success in warfare and perhaps the gifting of certain luxury goods.

Given that hereditary inequality emerged out of a more communal and less hierarchical discourse, it is reasonable to assume that the power of nobles was dependent on their being seen as acting on the behalf of their communities. These early nobles undoubtedly had ritual and political obligations to their communities like Zapotec and Mixtec rulers at the time of the Spanish Conquest. It is likely that nobles earned the allegiance of commoners through the sponsoring of public ceremonies, including ritual feasting, as well as through success in warfare and perhaps the gifting of certain luxury goods. Nobles deployed human sacrifice as another way to maintain allegiance since it was the most potent way in which the sacred covenant could be activated to petition deities for fertility and prosperity on behalf of the community. Given the physical setting of Monument 3, the audience for these sacrifices was probably restricted, much like the setting of Middle Formative iconography dealing with human sacrifice in other parts of Mesoamerica (A. Joyce 2008b). By taking captives and offering them as sacrifices to the gods, nobles at San José Mogote demonstrated their ritual and political power as well as generosity to their communities. Human sacrifice was also a dramatic ritual performance in both its sacred and its violent qualities that would have bound people to the deities, ancestors, and other symbols of the community on whose behalf the sacrifice was realized." <sup id="cite_ref-568" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-568">[568]</a></sup></dd>

Their repertoire included pot or well irrigation - a labor-intensive strategy that can be employed in many alluvial zones of the valley. One aspect of well irrigation is that it can be implemented by a single farmer or the members of one household. Early Oaxaca farmers also likely secured water by building modest check dams and small channels to divert water from seasonal runoffs and the temporary streams that run during the rainy season. These irrigation techniques also required no central management and little or no labor from outside the household. Neither large-scale irrigation systems nor massive networks of canals have been important during the long history of this region.’ <sup id="cite_ref-651" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-651">[651]</a></sup>
