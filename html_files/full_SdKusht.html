</p><p><b>♠ Religion Genus ♣ Egyptian Religions ♥</b> In the last millennium CE, a number of change occurred in Egyptian religion. They include: 1. A renewed "quest for new religious solutions which emphasized individual salvation.

Traditional preparations for the afterlife continued, but people were also determined to enjoy their daily pleasures while they were still alive." <sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> 2. "Although weak and foreign dynasties tried to revive the myth of the god-king in order to support their royal status, the political power of the king continued to decline, along with his influence on religion." <sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> 3. An "increased association between the temples and lay people. One noticeable feature was an increase in the custom of setting up personal statues inside the temples so that the owners could benefit from the regular rituals for the gods (which were the same as those performed in earlier periods), and thus receive sustenance from the divine food offerings. It also emphasized the owner's devotion to the god, and gave him a claim on the deity's attention. This tradition emphasized the fact that the gods were now regarded as better guarantors of individual postmortem protection than the age-old mortuary cults." "One of the most characteristic developments of this later period is the importance of animal cults." <sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> 4.

<dl><dd>Towards the end of the preceding Thebes-Libyan period, the northern reaches of the Nile River were invaded by Amun-worshipping Kushites from the south who had built up a strong state based in Napata, in the Sudan, at the foot of Gebel Barkal mountain.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup> The first Kushite ruler of Egypt, Piye, was crowned in Napata;<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> this remained the capital of the Kushite Empire until c. 716 BCE, when the entire Nile Valley up to the delta was acquired under Shabaka,<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup> who then moved the capital and royal residence from Napata to Memphis in order to emphasize the foreign dynasty's respect for traditional Egyptian customs.<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup> Kushite rule of Egypt (the Twenty-fifth Dynasty) occurred within an extremely complex political climate that has been the cause of much debate among historians. The Twenty-third Dynasty of the preceding Thebes-Libyan Period survived throughout this period, only to be toppled by the first ruler of the Saite Kingdom, Psamtek I (r. 664-610; Twenty-sixth Dynasty). The Egyptologist Jeremy Pope concludes that the 'Double Kingdom' (Kushite and Libyo-Egyptian) had some form of 'nominal unity' across a large territory.<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>Population and political organization
</p>
<dl><dd>Scholars debate the extent to which there was a centralized bureaucracy in Egypt under Kushite rule. In Lower Nubia, the Kushite king may have exercised power through 'invisible elites' such as merchants, pastoralists, and local potentates - 'a striking contrast with the bureaucratic formalization of Upper Egypt'.<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup> Archaeologist Robert Morkot has argued that the Twenty-fifth Dynasty kept the Egyptian administrative system largely unchanged, making only relatively minor alterations such as appointing new individuals or families to official positions.<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup> However, Jeremy Pope believes that we cannot use New Kingdom analogies to draw conclusions about Kushite governing principles, and that 'central authority and administration had disappeared' in this period.<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup> The Egyptian position of vizier probably continued but was 'deprived of effective power'.<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>What is not in doubt is that the Kushite king was a powerful military ruler and, in the Libyan tradition, likely made marriage alliances with the elite throughout Egypt.<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup> In general, Kushite rule drew its power from military capacity and the day-to-day workings of local government were left in the hands of the Egyptian dynasts.<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup> Nubians and Egyptians also shared a common set of religious practices. King Piye, who successfully invaded Egypt, boasted of his divine legitimacy on a stele: 'Amon of Napata has made me sovereign over every people',<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup> and established an official cult of Amun around 780-760 BCE; his sister became priestess.<sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup> The existing powerful religious offices in Upper Egypt were also important for Kushite rule: the position of God's Wife (or Divine Adoratrice) at Thebes was maintained due to its political utility, and Kushite royals were installed as high priests.<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup> In earlier times, the high priest at Thebes had exercised both civil and military authority, but the Kushites maintained their own Kushite military commanders, while civil authority was given initially to Kushite governors and later to 'Theban bureaucrats'.<sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup> The end of Kushite rule in Egypt and the beginning of the Saite Dynasty furnishes a rare example of a peaceful transition, involving the adoption of the Saite princess Nitocris by the last Kushite Divine Adoratrice of Amun, Amenirdis II, in 656 BC.<sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Kushite-period Memphis, where the chief royal residence was based,<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup> is thought to have had a population of perhaps 65,000; the first capital, Napata, about 43,000. The Kushite Empire spanned roughly 600,000-700,000 square kilometres, but it is difficult to find reliable estimates for its population.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Opet ♥</b> "The processions of images of the holy family of Thebes and of other sanctified beings (including statues of kings of olden times) setting forth from the huge brightly painted temples, and making their slow progress along formally arranged avenues with carefully stage-managed halts at intermediate way-stations, and the occasional excitement of a 'miracle': all this brought to the city as a whole spectacle and munificence which regularly reinforced the physical and economic dominance of the temples. And for the greatest of the festivals the king came to Thebes in person to be at the centre, and to absorb some of the power that the occasion generated. "This most important of festivals was the Festival of Opet. It came round every year, in the second month of the season of Inundation. In the mid-18th Dynasty it lasted for eleven days. By the end of the reign of Rameses III in the 20th it had been lengthened to no less than twenty-seven days. At that time at Medinet Habu the festival was celebrated by the distribution of 11,341 loaves, 85 cakes, and 385 jars of beer. The core of the festival was an unusually long procession of images of the holy family of Thebes. The route lay between Karnak itself and the temple of Luxor (Figure 97, p. 266). In the time of Hatsheput the outward journey was made by land, using the newly built southward extension of courts and pylons at Karnak, pausing at six way-stations, whilst the return journey was by river. By the late 18th Dynasty both the outward and the return journeys were being made by river. Each of the deities travelled in a separate barge, towed by smaller boats and by gangs of men on the bank, who could include high court officials, hauling on ropes. It was one of the occasions when the public could present pleas to the gods before their portable barques, and before colossal <i>ka</i>-statues of the king (see below for the meaning of <i>ka</i> [divine essence - EC]). Detailed scenes of the processions, depicting also the soldiers, dancers and musicians who followed the progress of the barges from the bank, were carved on the walls of Luxor temple, the destination of the festival. "[...] "[...] The procession of the Opet Festival took the king to the temple. Leaving the crowds outside he entered and proceeded in the company of priests to the enlcosed chambers at the back. There, in a charges incense-laden atmosphere and the mystic presence of the god Amun (and his ithyphallic manifestation Amun-Min), the king and his <i>ka</i> were merged, and the king's person transformed. When the king reappeared, he did so miraculously transformed into a divine being, 'Foremost of all the living <i>Kas</i>.' His reappearance in public freshly transfigured was the real climax, the moment of cheering which implied that the miracle had worked and had been accepted as having worked." <sup id="cite_ref-177" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-177">[177]</a></sup> The following relates to festivals more generally: "Commoners could participate by witnessing a sacred performance, by communing with the gods through prayer and oracles, or simply by singing, dancing, and feasting. For ordinary Egyptians, festivals were a time of sensory stimulation through sound movements, scents, and the nervous anticipation of being in the company of the divine. Festivals were community affairs, a time for the residents of a village or town to abandon their daily tasks and come together in celebration. [...] Their repeated commemoration was part of the rhythm of life, providing security through predictability. This was particularly true of the celebrations marking the renewal of the king (such as the Opet or the Decade Festival), which symbolized the victory of order over chaos. [...] "Festivals also served to bolster state control and promote royal ideology. [...] The Opet and Sed (jubilee) festivals specifically commemorated the renewal of the king's power. [...]. "Festivals presented logistical and economic challenges. They required huge amounts of bread, beer, wine, and precious incense, and the preparation for the larger festivals involved massive mobilization of people and resources. If the king was to attend, the additional needs of the members of the royal court had to be met. This apparently meant that citizens could be subject to an unreasonable requisitioning of supplies. The Edict of Hormheb (Dynasty 18) expressly forbade the 'agents of the queen's estate' from harassing the 'local mayors, oppressing them and searching for the [supplies] for the trip downstream ... each year during the [festival of Opet].' According to the decree, 'The agents of the royal quarters would approach the mayors saying 'give the supplies which are lacking for the journey, for look, pharaoh is making the trip to the festival of Opet.'" <sup id="cite_ref-178" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-178">[178]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Khoiak ♥</b> "Osiris, the primary deity of the dead and the legendary first ruler of Egypt, was a god who symbolized eternal rebirth through the story of his own resurrection. His festival was celebrated in the fourth month of inundation, from the twelfth to the thirtieth day, when the Nile receded and crops began to sprout - a potent natural symbol of resurrection. The festival is known as Khoiak, after the name of the month in which it was celebrated. It is known from Middle Kingdom texts (the Ikhernofert stela and texts of King Neferhotep) and from a great number of private stelae and Middle Kingdom monuments from Abydos. Though we lack the overall 'script' for the festival, because the earlier records refer only to isolated events, later records, including Roman-era texts from the walls of the rooftop chapels of the Temple of Hathor at Dendera (Fi. 21), provide a fuller account of the Khoiak festival."[...] "Unlike the localized Opet or Decade festivals, which were celebrated only in Thebes, the Khoiak Festival was celebrated throughout the country. The broad geographic spread of the festivities commemorated the dispersal of the parts of Osiris's body across all parts of Egypt. [...] "The festival had two major components, both of which provided opportunities for public participation. The first part of the festival was a dramatic reenactment of the death and resurrection of Osiris and the defeat of his foes. This was performed before the public, much like a Christian passion play. [...] The religious drama followed a set script, laid down on a papyrus scroll that kings could cite to prove the authenticity of the festivals they held.  [...] The second aspect of the festival was the manufacture, procession, and ceremonial internment of Osiris figurines. New images of Osiris, his ennead (the eight gods associated with him), and the jackal god Wapwawet were made, and sacred boats, sledges, and shrines were constructed to convey the divine statues through the necropolis. "During the festival, the king was supposed to play the role of Horus, the faithful son who avenged the murder of Osiris. However, Middle Kingdom accounts indicate that the king appointed a surrogate to represent him during the festival, just as the First Priest of the god acted on behalf of the king in daily temple rituals (see Chapter 3). At Abydos, the priests claim to have played the role of deities, but we do not know whether they donned costumes or simply stood as representatives of the gods. Some parts of the ritual enactment took place in the temple to which the public had no access. Other parts took place where the gathered crowds could watch and participate. "The festival began with the arrival of the royal delegation. Within the dark confines of the Osiris Temple, a priest offered myrrh, wine, and other 'divine products' to 'Osiris, in all his identities.' The official Ikhernofert claimed that within the temple of the statue of Osiris was embellished with lapis, turquoise, gold, and 'all precious stones' and was clothed with garments. The statue was then placed in a new naos of gold, silver, copper, <i>sesnedjem</i>-wood, and cedar. Construction of the naos and of the god's boat was overseen by Ikernofert himself. "These preliminary acts complete, the procession set out from the temple and made itself visible to the waiting throngs. It set out through the necropolis, led by the statue of Wepwawet (especially appropriate, because his name means 'Opener of the Ways'), who acted as the protector of the gods. Dramatic tension was fueled by a reenactment of the attack on Osiris by the company of Seth, which retold the story of Osiris's murder on 'the sandbanks of Nedit.' [...] One can imagine the screams and groans from the assembled onlookers as the two factions clashed and Osiris was slain. As in passion plays, this sequence always concluded with the triumph of good, as the priest representing Horus defeated Seth's company. In his speech of victory, he proclaimed: 'I avenged Wennofer (Osiris) on that day of great fighting, and I felled all his enemies in the sandbanks of Nedit.' "The victory of Horus was followed by a 'great procession' simulating the sorrowful funeral of Osiris. [...] "Once at the tomb of Osiris, participants enacted the funeral rites and recited an invocation to Re - 'Come down to me!' - to bring the life-giving forces of the sun back to the dead god. Several references to dancing suggest that some of the ritual dance, perhaps to celebrate the victories of Horus and Thoth, was performed. Finally, the procession returned to the Osiris Temple, and the statue of the god was restored to its shrine. "The public participated in the festivals of Osiris through their observation of the procession presented during Khoiak but also in more personal and intimate ways, especially through the creation and manipulation of images of the mummiform god. [...] "Some of these figurines were made during the Khoiak Festival, kept for a year, and then ritually buried, whereas others became a part of an individual's funerary equipment." <sup id="cite_ref-230" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-230">[230]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ daily offering ♥</b> "The daily offering ritual was performed in every functioning temple three times a day, in imitation of human meal times. [...] The offering ritual is known from the Old Kingdom, from the Pyramid Texts and the economic records of Neferirkare at Abu Sir, and it continued to be the essential temple ritual throughout Egyptian history. "The ritual consisted of the physical maintenance of the god, followed by the presentation of food and drink. All ritual actions were made in the name of the king, and it is he who is shown in the temple reliefs, although in reality a priest acted in his stead. Each morning as the sun rose, the temple staff would assemble for duty. The daily ritual involved a variety of ranks of priests - <i>wabs</i>, lector priests, and God's Fathers are specifically mentioned. The Chief Priest would be specially purified in a section of the temple called the <i>per duat</i> or 'the house of morning.' There, he washed his body with water, was purifed with incense, and rinsed his mouth with natron. Texts record, 'There was performed for him all ceremonies that are performed for the king,' transforming him from a priest into a proper surrogate for the king. He then joined the other priests, who had also undergone purification. They gathered the materials needed for the ritual and proceeded to the temple's sanctuary. Before entering, they began a series of recitations that accompanied their preparations - the utterance for lighting the fire; the utterances for taking the incense, putting the brazier on the censer, and putting incense on the fire; and, finally, the 'utterance for advancing to the holy place.' The sense that the ritual was in theory performed by the king is evidence in the Chief Priest's first ritual words: 'It is the king who sends me.' "Each step of the ritual was highly symbolic, referred to mythic events, and was accompanied by a set liturgy. To begin the ritual, the priest awakened the god who slept in the sealed shrine. Holding a candle, he entered the sanctuary, chanting, 'Awake in peace! May your awakening be peaceful!' He broke the seals of the door bolts of the shrine, and drew back the bolts - an action that was equated with removing the fingers of Seth from the eye of Horus. The priest then 'opened the sight of the god' as he swung open the doors of the shrine, and he 'kissed the ground,' prostrating himself before the god's shrine. Each ritual step was punctuated with a specific recitation and an offering of incense and adoration of the deity. In preparation for removing the god from his shrine, the priest scattered pure white sand on the floor of the sanctuary, symbolizing the mound of creation from which all life sprang. He then recited a liturgy for 'Laying Hands Upon the God,' and removed the statue from the shrine, placing it on the sand. After more purifications, the priest removed the deity's outer linen garments and jewelry and wiped away the unguents from the previous day's ritual. Once the statue was suitably cleansed, the priest offered the god lengths of red, white, and green cloth that symbolized the blood of Isis, the uraeus, and fertility. This was followed by the presentation of green and black eye cosmetics. The god was adorned with bracelets, a broad collar, and anklets, and given the appropriate scepters and headdress. The statue was then wrapped in his 'great garment', probably a linen wrapper such as those that were found with the divine statues in the tomb of Tutankhamun. "Now fully awakened and ready for the day, the god was presented with flowers, food, and drink. Economic texts specify that the food offerings consisted of grain, vegetables, wine, and cuts of meat and fowl. When the god was considered to be done, an interval that is not specified in the texts, the food was taken away and the god was readied for sleep. After further purifications, the god was returned to his shrine, the doors closed and seal. As a final ritual, the king performed the 'Bringing of the Foot,' in which he grasped a broomlike <i>had</i>-plant and backed out of the sanctuary, sweeping his footprints from the room. This procedure not only left the sanctuary in good order, but, it was believed, also prevented evil from approaching the god, presumably by following the footprints of the priest-king. "A version of this ritual was repeated at midday and in the evening. The evidence for how elaborate these other two daily rituals were is inconclusive, but it is clear that the morning service was the most complete. The evening service may have been essentially food offerings, but the shrine was not opened, and the activity took place in the antechamber rather than directly before the god." <sup id="cite_ref-268" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-268">[268]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Feast of the Valley ♥</b> "The 'Beautiful Feast of the Valley' was celebrated only in Thebes (Map 2). [...] "The Feast of the Valley was observed once a year, on the first day of the second month of summer in conjunction with the appearance of the new moon. It lasted for two days. The first record of the feast dates to Dynasty 11. The festival was most popular in the New Kingdom, the Ramesside Period, and Dynasties 25-26, but there are references to the festival as late as 117 BC during the reign of Ptolemy VIII. By that time, however, the festival had likely changed character, taking on more Osirian overtones. [...] "The focus of the festival was the parade of statues portraying the gods and deceased royalty (Plate VIII). [...]  The procession, led by the king, was accompanied by throngs of priests who carried the great fans signifying the presence of the deity and by huge crowds of locals.[...]"[...] "Graffiti note that priests watched for the procession from the heights of the west bank. It must have been an exciting and prestigious duty, for some of the priests recorded that they stood lookout for several years in a row. One the flotilla was spotted, mobs of people who lived on the west bank joined the crowd that had followed the procession from the east. Everyone was dressed in his or her finest white linen clothing, clutching flowers and food offerings as they greeted the 'divine arrival' as it moored on the west bank."[...] People crowded around the pageant clamoring for a view of the gods. One can imagine the roadways and canals of the west bank lined with people laden with bouquets of flowers and baskets of offerings, and crying out in honor of the gods."[...] "During the first day of the festival, the procession wound its way through the necropolis. The musicians and onlookers made - intentionally - a lot of noise, for according to the texts, those buried in the western necropolis harkened to the sound of the procession. The clamor enlivened them and caused them to emerge from their tombs to see Amun and to meet with their families." During the festival, priests could participate by carrying the divine boat or walking alongside it, holding the broad fans that announced the divine presence. A much larger number of ordinary people took part as well, by observing the procession and enacting rituals at the family tombs. For them, the most important aspect of the Feast of the Valley was the sensual communion between the living and the dead that took place at the tombs.[...]"[...] The properties of smell, sound, and taste were thought to be capable of transcending the barrier between life and death to reach the deceased and bring him or her into the celebration.

The spirits were encouraged to join the procession: 'May you be in the crew of the royal boat and may you hear the clamor in the temples in wester Thebes. May you see Amun in the Beautiful Feast of the Valley and follow him to the temple precincts.' "Bands of musicians circulated through the necropolis visiting individual tombs.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Festival of Amuhotep I ♥</b> "Not all Egyptian festivals were celebrations of joy and rebirth. The festival of Amunhotep I, celebrated by the residents of Deir el Medina on the Theban west bank, commemorated the death of King Amunhotep I. It was a somber occasion, akin to the Shiite Muslim commemoration in the month of Muharram of the death of Imam Hussein. "Amunhotep I, the second king of Dynasty 18 (ca. 1526-1505 BC), was especially revered by the workmen of Deir el Medina. He had institited the state-supported organization of those workmen who, under his successor, Thutmose I, settled in the village of western Thebes. The festival of Amunhotep I is attested from the reign of Amunhotep III (ca. 1350 BC), and it continued as late as Dynasty 25. The festival started on the accession day of Thutmose I - the day his father, Amnuhotep, died. The festival lasted for four days, with each day dedicated to a different activity. Although the festival focused on the workmen and on their association with Amunhotep, the texts clearly indicate that the men's wives and children also took part. "On the first day of the festival, Amunhotep's statue was brought out of its shrine on the west bank to 'greet' the public. The next day was devoted to a feast in the necropolis. This was followed by a 'feast of meditation' as the residents of the village reflected on the deified king and his death. The last day was for the 'appearing' of the king; it was probably on this day that the statue was transported to the Valley of the Kings. Scenes of the procession show the statue being carried or dragged over the sand on a sledge pulled by four pairs of men; one of these wears a leopard-head ornament on his cloak. Two other priests, holding the large feather fans that indicated the divinity of the image, stand beside the statue. Other scenes show a larger procession made up of twelve men."[...] "As the procession passed the onlookers, they struck their faces with their hands and wept, intoning: 'They make mourning for you oh, Amunhotep the one for whom it is blessed to weep!' Texts from Deir el Medina indicate that this was an official holiday for the workers, and they were issued special rations of cream and fat. As with the Feast of the Valley, copious amounts of beer and wine were consumed over the four days of the festival. "An important part of the festival was the consultation of the oracle of the deceased king (see Chapter 6). The close association of the villagers of Deir el Medina with Amunhotep made the deified king a trusted mediator of local disputes. In the community, the deceased king was referred to as 'the vizier who looks into hearts, whose abomination is falsehood.' The oracle of Amunhotep took the form of a statue of the king, and so - unlike most other oracles housed in shrouded shrines - Amunhotep's oracle was especially approachable.</dd>
<dd>"The royal statue as oracle was used to determine administrative issues, such as the appointment of officials.

</p><p><b>♠ Description of the Normative Ideology ♣ ♥</b> In the last millennium CE, a number of change occurred in Egyptian religion. They include: 1. A renewed "quest for new religious solutions which emphasized individual salvation. Generally, people were perhaps less optimistic that a virtuous life would bring them a blessed eternity, and more reliance was placed on the gods as a source of comfort. Traditional preparations for the afterlife continued, but people were also determined to enjoy their daily pleasures while they were still alive." <sup id="cite_ref-644" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-644">[644]</a></sup> 2. "Although weak and foreign dynasties tried to revive the myth of the god-king in order to support their royal status, the political power of the king continued to decline, along with his influence on religion." <sup id="cite_ref-645" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-645">[645]</a></sup> 3. An "increased association between the temples and lay people. One noticeable feature was an increase in the custom of setting up personal statues inside the temples so that the owners could benefit from the regular rituals for the gods (which were the same as those performed in earlier periods), and thus receive sustenance from the divine food offerings. It also emphasized the owner's devotion to the god, and gave him a claim on the deity's attention. This tradition emphasized the fact that the gods were now regarded as better guarantors of individual postmortem protection than the age-old mortuary cults." "One of the most characteristic developments of this later period is the importance of animal cults." <sup id="cite_ref-646" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-646">[646]</a></sup> 4. "One of the most characteristic developments of this later period is the importance of animal cults." <sup id="cite_ref-647" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-647">[647]</a></sup> Because it doesn't seem that these changes affected most of the variables we are interested in, it seems reasonable to infer continuity with earlier periods in terms of equality, prosociality, slavery, human sacrifice, and morality. Indeed, the the first millennium BCE was characterised by a "deep-rooted revival of things past that affected many aspects of Egypt's court culture, religion, script, literature, art, architecture, and burial practices." <sup id="cite_ref-648" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-648">[648]</a></sup>

Phrases translated as “to marry” include “to establish a household” (grg pr), “to enter a household” (ʿq r pr n) and, in later periods, “to live together” (ḥms jrm) with someone. [...] Given the definitions of marriage in ancient Egyptian society, there was nothing inherent in the relationship to prevent polygamy—a man could, in theory, cohabit with more than one woman in pursuit of offspring. Polyandry, in which one woman has multiple husbands at the same time, is unattested. In practice, however, polygamy was uncommon outside of the royal family; cases of polygamy among nonroyals are uncommon and often ambiguous. The Egyptians tended toward multiple marriage in the form of serial monogamy rather than polygamy, since the ease and acceptance of divorce—as well as the mortality rate—made marriage and remarriage the most common pattern for individuals with multiple spouses. The infrequency of polygamy may also be a function of the expense of keeping additional wives and their children; the domestic dynamics of having multiple wives and the physical limitations of the home could also be limiting factors.

[...] In the Middle Kingdom we encounter a new image of Re. Several hymns to the sun god tell how he created the world solely for humankind. Human beings are made in his image, and he provides them with everything they need for life. Evil, however, does not come from the god but from mortals' own rebellious hearts, and for this they are judged in the underworld.

<p><b>Supernatural Enforcement of Morality</b>

<dl><dd>For this section, include any type of supernatural punishment or reward either in this lifetime (e.g., curses, good fortune) or in the afterlife (e.g., hell, reincarnation). This includes generalized impersonal punishment/reward (e.g., karma, mana) as well as punishment by specific supernatural beings. Include specific details of the nature and extent of punishment/reward in the description. Code “compound” moral actions (e.g., filial piety = kin + respect) in multiple categories as necessary. Morality categories are based on Moral Foundations Theory (Haidt &amp; Graham, 2007) and Morality-As-Cooperation theory (Curry, 2016).</dd>
<dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement against harm ♣ present ♥</b> "The classic exposition of judgment at death comes in the Book of Going Forth by Day (the Book of the Dead) texts numbered BD 30 and BD 125 by the nineteenth-century Egyptologist Karl Richard Lepsius, and the associated illustration in which the heart of the deceased is weighed against the goddess Maat (“what is right”). [...] In the first part, the deceased is led into the “broad court of the Two Maats,” to declare innocence of wrongs before the great god (List A), and before the full tribunal of forty-two divine assessors, including Osiris and Ra (List B). The texts conclude with announcements by the deceased of purity and initiation into the afterlife. The declarations of innocence (often called “negative confession” in Egyptology) form the most explicit statement in Egyptian texts of maat (m3ʿt; “what is right”), by delineating its opposite, wrongdoing. [...] The sequence of declarations varies between manuscripts. In List A, in the Book of the Dead of Nebseny, thirty-six declarations of innocence are given, opening with “I have not done evil to anyone” and “I have not slain the sacred herd” (interpreted in some manuscripts as humankind). Other declarations of List A include the religious norms “I have not blasphemed,” “I have not harmed the offering-loaves of the gods,” “I have not removed the offerings of the blessed dead,” and, related, the affirmation of sexual rules “I have not copulated” (in some versions “with a male”) and “I have not ejaculated” (in some versions “in the sanctuary of my city god”). Other rules concern probity in administrative measurement: “I have not reduced the aroura land-measure”; “I have not tampered with the counter-poise of the scales.”" <sup id="cite_ref-756" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-756">[756]</a></sup> “This development was to culminate in chapter 125 of the New Kingdom Book of Going Forth by Day(Lichtheim, 1976, pp. 124-132), which deals with the judgment before the god of the netherworld, Osiris.
