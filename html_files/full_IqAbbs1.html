This resulted also in the loss of an independent military. The Caliph still retained prestige and could influence legitimacy in its former territory.  In 1258 CE Baghdad, the capital, was sacked by the Mongols and this extinguished the last vestigial  power of the Abbasid Dynasty, although the Abbasid Caliphate was restored in Cairo in 1261. <sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

<dl><dd>In 750 CE, following a revolt, Abbasid rulers took power from the Umayyad Dynasty under Abu al-'Abbas al-Saffah. To secure his rule, Abu al-'Abbass al-Saffah sought to destroy the male line descending from Fatima and Ali,<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> and had about 300 members of the Umayyad family killed.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> The last 80 Umayyads were tricked into attending a banquet with their hosts in Damascus and massacred there.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> (One twenty-year-old prince, Abd al-Rahman, famously managed to escape this fate: he dodged assassins all the way to Spain, where he founded an Umayyad Emirate). The First Abbasid Caliphate Period ended in 946 CE when the Daylamite Buyids from northwestern Iran reduced the caliph to a nominal figurehead. Ironically, given the bloody manner in which the dynasty began, the final Abbasid caliph was rolled up in his own carpet and trampled to death by Mongol horsemen in 1258 CE.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> The zenith of the Abbasid period is considered to be the reign of Harun al Rashid (763-809 CE), whose rule is described in <i>The Thousand and One Nights</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p><i>Population and political organization</i>
</p>
<dl><dd>The capital of the Abbasid Caliphate eventually settled at Baghdad, but in the earlier years the central administration was run from Kufa (750-762 CE), Al-Raqqah (796-809 CE), Merv (810-819 CE),<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> and Samarra (836-870 CE).<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> The Abbasid caliph, spiritual leader of the Sunni Muslim world and commander-in-chief of its army, left the day-to-day administration to his vizier and heads of the diwans in the complex bureaucracy.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The departments were divided into three main areas of responsibility: the chancery (<i>diwan-al-rasa'il</i>); tax collection (<i>diwan al-kharif</i>); and army administration (<i>diwan al-jaysh</i>).<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> Professional officials and soldiers were paid both in cash and in kind.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> The task of organizing the 'collection and payment of revenues' fell to the Abbasid military.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> However, while it was a professional institution, it lacked a rigid hierarchy or a well-defined officer class.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> Below the caliph himself, the top military rulers were the provincial governors in Iraq, Mesopotamia, Egypt, Syria, Western Iran and Khuzistan. In Iraq and Egypt, local government was divided into a hierarchy of districts, with subdivisions (<i>kura</i>, <i>tassuj</i> and <i>rustaq</i>) used for assessing taxation, which was passed to the governor.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> Within the Abbasid Caliphate there were also relatively independent vassals, who were required to pay tribute to the central government at Baghdad.<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> The law code was based largely on <i>sharia</i> law and the <i>ijma' </i>(legal opinions of religious scholars).<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The Abbasid state provided centres of medical care, built ornate public markets, often with drinking fountains, and furnished welfare for the poor.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup> As paper technology diffused from China, libraries became a common fixture in the cities of the caliphate. In Baghdad, the Khizanat al-Hikma, or 'treasury of wisdom', became a refuge for scholars, providing access to a large collection as well as free lodgings and board.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup> Each important city included an official called the <i>saheb al-sorta</i>, who was responsible for maintaining public order, and the <i>amir al-suq</i>, in charge of regulating the bazaar.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The territory possessed by the caliphate was lost in dramatic fashion, shrinking from 11.1 million square kilometres in 750 CE, to 4.6 million around 850 CE, to just 1 million square kilometres half a century later as Egypt, Afghanistan and Central Asia were all lost.<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup> Nevertheless, in 900 CE the core region of Abbasid control in the Middle East still had a substantial population of about 10 million people.<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup> Over 300,000 (or maybe 900,000) of these lived in Baghdad,<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup> which by this date had probably outgrown Byzantine Constantinople.</dd></dl>

</p><p>Direct control took place in territories closest to the imperial centre. Iraq, Mesopotamia, Egypt, Syria, Western Iran and Khuzistan were governed directly. Other areas were largely autonomous. In some territories military governors were appointed while in others local elites paid tribute and maintained autonomy. These tributes would have been paid to one of the departments associated above. <sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup> Beginning in 945 CE, the Caliphate lost substantial powers of authority and was reduced in its ability to control outlying territory. <sup id="cite_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup>

<p>In theory the Caliphate and governors were the head of the Sunni faith, but in practice local religious scholars (ulama) and aesthetics (Sufis) increasingly attracted the wider populace as definers of doctrine. Unlike the Orthodox or Catholic faith, the structure of the Islamic faiths were not clearly hierarchical and all were equal before Allah. <sup id="cite_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-64">[64]</a></sup>

<p>The above estimate is an oversimplification. The Shurta (police) and the Haras (guards) were responsible for the securing the capital and the security of the Caliph. <sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup> In the earlier period the Caliphate relied on the service of Arab tribes from Arabia. As the empire expanded this system changed to a professional standing army paid for in cash. Given the fractured nature of the military structure this ranking system is not fully representative. By 833 CE, two totally separate military establishments existed under the caliphs. Shakiriya were entire tribal groups serving under their chiefs, and the second were Ghilman, slave soldiers serving in regiments. Each of these had separate hierarchies. Each of these also their own internal structures with soldiers recruited from Syria using older Byzantine ranks, whereas mercenary tribes recruited from North Africa or Central Asia served under their clan leaders. There were also differences depending of where the individuals were serving. Permanent garrisons differed from temporary soldiers used for a campaign. From  833 CE, Turkic tribesmen became increasingly integral to the military of the Caliphate. By 936 CE, the Caliph lost even the pretext of military authority. <sup id="cite_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup>

At the beginning of this period, these stipends could be thought of as the hereditary right of those whose names appeared in the diwan registers. During the course of the second/eighth century, the Caliphs and their representatives forced a transformation so that the stipend became a true salary, a payment for work done. Unlike their contemporaries in the West, the soldiers of the Caliphs were never given land grants in lieu of salaries. Sometimes they might be given houses or plots of land on which to build, but not to provide an alternative income. One the rare occasions when larger land grants were given to soldiers it was as a reward for past services, rather than payment for continuing and future ones. Both Umayyads and 'Abbasids normally maintained the separation of the military from tax-collecting: apart from dire emergencies, soldiers were never given the right to collect taxes with which to pay themselves. This was always done by the government diwans."<sup id="cite_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup>

One of the many simple ways of getting around the ban on interest, for example, goes something like this: Imagine Yusuf wants to borrow 100 dirhams from Ahmed. Ahmed sells Yusuf a book, for, say, 120 dirhams, payable <i>in a year's time.</i> Yusuf then sells the book back to Ahmed <i>immediately</i> with cash, for 100 dirhams. Thus Ahmed still has his book, Yusuf trousers 100 dirhams but he has an obligation to pay for the book he 'bought' for 120 dirhams ... twelve months later."<sup id="cite_ref-135" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-135">[135]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b> ♠ Incendiaries ♣ present ♥ </b>  Greek fire: "The Arabs, however, soon learned the exact composition of the combustible mixture and used it themselves in Asia, where they transmitted it to the Chinese. Indeed, by the year 850 even crew members of Arab trading vessels in the Indian Ocean would use it to protect their ships against pirates, and during the reign of the Abbasid Caliph al-Mutawakkil each corps of archers in the infantry had a special division of naphtha-throwers called naffatun, who wore fireproof suits, perhaps of asbestos, and hurled "grenades" at the enemy by hand or with catapults. Some of the "grenades" were astoundingly similar in size and shape to those used in modern times: round iron - or clay - jars which contained the flammable mixture and exploded shortly after the lids were opened."<sup id="cite_ref-158" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-158">[158]</a></sup>  Persians threw vessels filled with sulphur, asphalt and naphtha into the enemy bulwarks. The first mention of the common place use of naphtha as an incendiary device in the annals of Islam is in connection with a raid in India in 777. During the siege of Heraklia in 803, however, stone balls wrapped in linen and covered with burning naphtha were hurled by mangonels against the ramparts. The fire would cling to the stones and cause them to burst. From that time onwards, the caliphate employed corps of naphtha-throwers and the Muslim fleets were provided with it as well. In order to protect themselves, people covered flammable materials with newly flayed animal skins and those who handled the naphtha wore clothes saturated with talc. Naphtha-filled glass grenades appeared first in 934, unless in that year the weapons were actually incendiary javelins, but the use of fire grenades was firmly established a few years later. ... The latest historian of Greek fire, Maurice Mercier, admits that during the thirteenth century, people began to use grenades filled with mealed gunpowder, called 'Syrian jugs', which had a most explosive force.'<sup id="cite_ref-159" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-159">[159]</a></sup></dd>

</p><p>The Abbasid Caliphate recruited from its own population, as well as purchasing and training non-muslim slave soldiers known as the Ghilman, later referred to as the Mamelukes. The Caliphate also recruited entire ethnic groups from the frontiers to serve the Caliphate. One of the innovations of the Caliphate was to recruit outside of the original Arab tribes for both administrative and military purposes. Permanent military garrisons were placed in Syria facing the Byzantine frontier, and outpost placed in other areas deemed at risk. The Shakiriya were calvary units recruited from tribal peoples in North Africa and the Steppe, whilst the second and increasingly important force were the Ghilman, non-muslim slave soldiers serving the Caliphate and counterbalancing the other forces. Turkic forces increasingly monopolized the chance to serve in the armed forces from Arabs.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Hajj ♥</b> "In the pilgrimage to Mecca, the hajj, ancient Arab rites have been taken over and spiritualized. The pilgrimage is performed during the last lunar month, Dhu'l­hijja. People who come to Arabia at other times can perform the lesser pilgrimage, umra, which consists mainly of the circumambulation of the Ka'ba and the running between two hillocks called Safa and Marwa. Pilgrimage to a sacred place requires a ritual consecration. Thus, at a certain distance from Mecca the men, with shaven heads, put on a special garment, ihram, consisting of two white unsewn pieces of cloth that cover their whole body; women put on a covering garment. Pilgrims greet the sacred precincts with the call labbaika, "Here I am at Thy service!" The rites that have to be performed include the sevenfold circumambulation of the Ka'ba (where one tries to kiss the black stone in its southeastern corner) and a sevenfold running between Safa and Marwa, which are now connected by covered arcades. But the central rite is the "staying" on the hill 'Arafat*, a distance of some eight miles from Mecca, on the ninth day of the month. There, sermons are given, and on the way back the 'stoning of Satan' is performed by casting seven pebbles three times at a certain place. After that, on the tenth day of the month, each pilgrim slaughters a sheep or larger animal in Mina. Those staying home do the same. This part of the ritual commemorates the day when Abraham was ordered to sacrifice his son Isma'il, whose place was then taken by a ram. After the Feast of Offering the pilgrim can return from the sacred state, ihram, into the normal state, when the cutting of hair and nails, as well as sex, are again permitted. Killing any creatures inside the sacred area is considered a major sin. The pilgrimage should be performed only when the pilgrim is in good health and can undertake the journey without major difficulties, especially without incurring debts; this shows the realistic approach of Islam to religious practice. In former centuries the pilgrimage was a dangerous undertaking for those who came from distant lands, whether they traveled overland in the caravans which started, with great pomp, in Cairo or Baghdad, or sailed from India or Malaysia on fragile boats. (Air travel is not always very safe either.) Yet modern Muslims sometimes express the view that these slow, arduous journeys prepared them better for the great event than the brief trip by air, which barely leaves leisure to meditate on the experience of visiting the center of their religion. On their return the pilgrims bring a vessel filled with wholesome water from the well Zamzam, from which Hagar once drank. They are received by their families with pride and joy, and are called Hajji. Those who die during the pilgrimage are regarded as martyrs, shahid, "witness" for their faith. Doubtlessly the meeting of people from all parts of the world in Mecca and their common worship at the central sanctuary of Islam does much to strengthen the feeling of unity among Muslims. Through the centuries many scholars and pious people extended their stay in Mecca and exchanged their religious views with colleagues from other parts of the world. The sojourn near the Ka'ba inspired important theological and mystical works: the comprehensive commentary on the Koran by Zamakhshari (called by the honorific title Jar Allah, "God's neighbor" due to his prolonged stay in Mecca) grew out of the author's stay in Mecca. Even more evident is the influence of the Meccan experience on the most comprehensive work of Islamic theosophy, the Futuhat al­makkiyya, of Ibn 'Arabi, which was "revealed" to the author while he was circumambulating the Ka'ba. Furthermore, it is important to remember that almost all reform movements in the fringe areas of the Islamic world were triggered off by the pilgrimage. Faithful believers from Bengal and Nigeria, from Morocco and Central Asia, who had lived for some time in Mecca and exchanged their views with others who, like them, had experienced what seemed to be the 'true Arabic Islam', returned to their Page 39countries to fight the numerous indigenous superstitions and customs which had infiltrated the Islam of the masses and which now appeared to them like remnants of ancient paganism."<sup id="cite_ref-246" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-246">[246]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Friday prayer ♥</b> "The Friday prayer is a duty of the community; it contains a short sermon, khutba*, which consists of two parts. It gives some advice usually based on the Koran or the hadith, and a prayer for the ruler of the government. To be mentioned in the khutba meant to be the legitimate ruler. Women rarely attend the Friday prayer but prefer to pray at home.The daily prayers are explained in the Koran as acts of humility and adoration. At the end of the prayer the Muslim can mention his/her personal requests. While traveling or in war or under duress, one can perform the noon and afternoon or sunset and night prayers together. One also has numerous opportunities to perform additional prayers of two or more rak'a each, e.g., during solar or lunar eclipses; when performing the rain prayer; when entering or leaving the house or the mosque—in short, some pious Muslims use every opportunity to perform a brief salat. The belief in the purifying power of ritual prayer is intense; the Prophet compared it to a stream of water that washes off sins five times a day. The performance of the prayer at the prescribed time constitutes ideally a means of educating Muslims to punctuality, cleanliness, and, since there is no ranking in the mosque, equal participation in the life of the community. Prayer can also lead to ecstatic experiences, and when one observes a praying Muslim who is oblivious of everything around him and seems to have drawn himself, as it were, out of this world to stand humbly before the Lord, one realizes best whence Islam derives its vital strength.To perform the salat, a clean spot suffices, be it in the fields, in the train, or in one's shop or office. A small prayer rug guarantees the cleanliness of the place. However, even in the Prophet's lifetime a place for congregational worship was established, called masjid, "the place where one prostrates" (hence the word Mosque). The great mosque, where the Friday prayer is held and which was found in each quarter, is called jami'*, "the gathering [mosque]."Mainly in the eastern part of the Islamic world, one finds small open prayer places called musalla*, and for the gathering of large congregations at the two 'id*, the end of Ramadan and the Feast of Offerings, one sometimes uses an 'idgah*, a vast enclosure with a prayer niche."<sup id="cite_ref-285" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-285">[285]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Friday prayer ♥</b> "The Friday prayer is a duty of the community; it contains a short sermon, khutba*, which consists of two parts. It gives some advice usually based on the Koran or the hadith, and a prayer for the ruler of the government. To be mentioned in the khutba meant to be the legitimate ruler. Women rarely attend the Friday prayer but prefer to pray at home.The daily prayers are explained in the Koran as acts of humility and adoration. At the end of the prayer the Muslim can mention his/her personal requests. While traveling or in war or under duress, one can perform the noon and afternoon or sunset and night prayers together. One also has numerous opportunities to perform additional prayers of two or more rak'a each, e.g., during solar or lunar eclipses; when performing the rain prayer; when entering or leaving the house or the mosque—in short, some pious Muslims use every opportunity to perform a brief salat. The belief in the purifying power of ritual prayer is intense; the Prophet compared it to a stream of water that washes off sins five times a day. The performance of the prayer at the prescribed time constitutes ideally a means of educating Muslims to punctuality, cleanliness, and, since there is no ranking in the mosque, equal participation in the life of the community. Prayer can also lead to ecstatic experiences, and when one observes a praying Muslim who is oblivious of everything around him and seems to have drawn himself, as it were, out of this world to stand humbly before the Lord, one realizes best whence Islam derives its vital strength.To perform the salat, a clean spot suffices, be it in the fields, in the train, or in one's shop or office. A small prayer rug guarantees the cleanliness of the place. However, even in the Prophet's lifetime a place for congregational worship was established, called masjid, "the place where one prostrates" (hence the word Mosque). The great mosque, where the Friday prayer is held and which was found in each quarter, is called jami'*, "the gathering [mosque]."Mainly in the eastern part of the Islamic world, one finds small open prayer places called musalla*, and for the gathering of large congregations at the two 'id*, the end of Ramadan and the Feast of Offerings, one sometimes uses an 'idgah*, a vast enclosure with a prayer niche."<sup id="cite_ref-322" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-322">[322]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Nowruz ♥</b> "Under the Fatimids, Nawruz was expressed in an official celebration in which gifts were bestowed on officials and their families. It appears, however, that a carnival increasingly became its main function. The people drank wine and beer; there were those who ambushed travelers and sprayed them with filthy water or wine, and others threw eggs on one another. Even emirs and dignitaries were exposed to this sort of ridicule, and, to rescue themselves, they had to pay 'ransom.' Slapping one another with boots or leather mats in public places was possibly a remnant of a pagan ritual. Sexual overtones were expressed in the play of water games, causing men and women to become wet so that naked bodies could be seen through clothes. In 1188, the public gathering of transvestites and prostitutes is reported. Masquerades are reported during the celebration of 975. Puritan scholars of the Mamluk period lamented the adverse effect of the festival on both the common people and the learned. They reported that schools were shut down and turned into playgrounds and that teachers were insulted and sprayed with water. These writers found it detestable that the participants were able 'to commit all kinds of evil,' that 'there was no interdiction [to any sort of behavior] and no authority imposed.' "The high mark of Nawruz in medieval Cairo was the procession of the Emir of Nawruz, usually a wanton who was either naked or dressed in colorful clothes, his face besmeared with lime or flour and a beard of fur attached to his face, on his head a special cap made of palm leaves, riding a donkey in the streets. He held a sort of register in his hand, 'visited' homes of dignitaries to collect 'debts,' and punished those who refused to pay. Manifest in this procession is the carnivalesque element of status reversal and riotous revelry a ́la medieval Christian festivals such as the King of Fools." <sup id="cite_ref-359" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-359">[359]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Arafat wuquf ♥</b> The key ritual within the wider sequence of rituals that makes up the Hajj. “On the morning of the ninth, [pilgrims] proceed towards ‘Arafat, a plain 14.5km (nine miles) from Mina, where the central rite of the Hajj, wuquf (standing) on ‘Arafat, takes place between noon and sunset, during which time many heartfelt prayers are offered. The scene reminds Muslims of the gathering on the Day of Judgement. If any pilgrim misses this event, his/her Hajj is not valid and has to be done again another year. This does not apply to any other rite, all of which can be done over a longer period or compensated for with an offering. This is the time for the pilgrims to read the Qur’an, glorify God and pray most earnestly for forgiveness and everything else they wish for. Particularly recommended for glorification and repetition is this prayer, ‘There is no God but Allah alone, with no partner. Dominion and praise belong to Him, who gives life and death. Goodness is in His hands and He has power over everything.’ This just gives a succinct summary of the Islamic faith and connects the individual pilgrim to what Ibrahim and Muhammad brought and uttered. Pilgrims normally face towards the Ka‘ba while reciting these prayers, as they do for the five daily prayers, believing that, by doing this, their prayers are more likely to be accepted.” <sup id="cite_ref-400" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-400">[400]</a></sup>. This ritual is coded here as dysphoric due to the fact that pilgrims are required to stand for several hours (between noon and sunset) under the sun’s heat. A contemporary account, dating to 1997, notes that the “heat is virtually unbearable” <sup id="cite_ref-401" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-401">[401]</a></sup>. However, it is worth noting that, due to peculiarities of the Islamic calendar, this ritual may sometimes be performed at a time of the year when the temperature is less hot than at other times, and when there are fewer others between noon and sunset than at other times. Moreover, a few informal online sources suggest that those who cannot stand in the sun for the duration of the ritual are allowed to be in the shade and/or sit down. Still, though relatively mild, this appears to be the most dysphoric ritual within Sunni Islam.</dd>

<dd><b>♠ human sacrifice of an out-group member ♣ absent ♥</b> [Text from sacrifice codings by Agathe] No source could be found that explicitly states Islam’s condemnation of human sacrifice. However, the fact that no source could be found that even ‘’mentions’’ human sacrifice in connection with Islam (beyond the occasional lurid, and dubious, tabloid headline), combined with the fact that a lot of information is available on the beliefs and practices underlining this religion, strongly suggests that human sacrifice is not part of the Islamic ritual repertoire. ““Our” present religions, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, sometimes called Abrahamic religions, have the theme of human sacrifice right at their inception, with the founding father, Abraham. We are accustomed to the story, which remains a text of “terror and trembling,” as Kierkegaard put it. Abraham is commanded by god to “sacrifice” his only son Isaac, and he is willing to do so (Gen. 22). The Hebrew term for this sacrifice is colah, “make to rise upwards,” as fire and smoke rise to heaven;10 the action is to cut the throat with a knife and to burn the corpse on wood—the knife and wood expressly mentioned in the text. The human victim must be fettered in order to receive the deadly cut. Abraham does obey his god’s command, without even an attempt at protest. The text enjoys the paradox: “the son that you love”; “and the two walked together” (Gen. 22.1-19: 2;. In Muslim tradition, the place where Abraham “bound” his son is the rock on the temple hill of Jerusalem, which, since Khalif Omar, is covered by the “temple dome” with its golden cupola. Of course, an angel stops Abraham’s action at the last moment, pointing to an animal for sacrifice. The text says God was “testing” (nissah) Abraham, and his submissive obedience is highly rewarded. The text also states that god accepted the ram “instead of” (tachath) Isaac. One way to discard the terror of the story is to introduce a perspective of historical progress: God was replacing human sacrifice by animal sacrifice. This could be termed an advance in civilization. The Islamic interpretation comes close to this interpretation, as it makes this a founding myth for el eid.”</dd></dl></dd></dl>

These so-called narrators of the Quran had effectively limited the powers of the caliphs by claiming the supremacy of their powers over the caliphs. ... Moreover, as the caliphs were not considered to be rightful and just rulers, strictly following the Quran, the Sunni Islamic lawyers stipulated that on these occasions, the Umma had the right to disobey, impeach, or remove such rulers by all possible means, including revolutionary ones. That stipulation highlighted the nature of the caliphs as only temporary rulers subject to the Quran (the Ulema would explain any issues in the people's lives that were missing from the Quran)."<sup id="cite_ref-438" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-438">[438]</a></sup></dd></dl>

"Legal training, for example, required not just familiarity with legal discourse and a growing corpus of rulings but also knowledge of Arabic grammar, morphology, and rhetoric. Women, aside from a minority in the upper classes, often did not have the wherewithal or time free from domestic obligations to pursue such an education. The requirements of face-to-face meetings with teachers and oral transmission were intended as a safeguard against interpolations and erroneous recording of texts, which were typically copied in unvocalized Arabic, thereby increasing the possibility of mistakes in transmission. The teacher would read the text aloud, and the student would listen and review his own copy to ensure accurate transmission. The requirement of face-to-face pedagogy, however, collided with cultural and religious norms dictating against interaction between men and women who were not related to each other by marriage or within specified degrees of kinship (maḥram). Furthermore, during the second/eighth and third/ninth centuries, scholars advocated that students begin studying ḥadīth (i.e., seeking traditions from different ḥadīth masters) only after demonstrating a good command of Arabic and the ability to memorize and convey texts accurately. According to the fourth-century ḥadīth scholar al-Rāmahurmuzī (d. ca. 360/970), Baṣrans encouraged the start of the study of ḥadīth around the age of ten, Kūfans around the age of twenty, and Syrians around the age of thirty. Following these recommendations, girls or young women who wished to excel in this arena would have had to begin pursuing their studies around the onset of puberty and/or during their child-bearing years.

They were viewed as a sign of status for their owners and were also exchanged as gifts to maintain alliances between rulers and among different kinds of elites.8 Although such slaves during the first centuries of Islam were educated in Medina and other centers, Basra appears to have become the center of their education during the Abbasid period. Their owners hosted cultural salons that often included different kinds of elites so that the owner and the educated female slave each had the opportunity to build networks. Thus, it is not surprising that educated female slaves sometimes rose to positions of power. At this time, education involved, in large part, the Arabic language, Quran, poetry, and music. Their role in entertainment contributed to the expansion of women’s education in general.9 Regulations for slavery in general and for concubines in particular, as well as social practices that valorized women’s education in what we know as the humanities, led to developments in women’s subjectivity and human rights within the exploitative context of slave labor."<sup id="cite_ref-519" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-519">[519]</a></sup></dd>

<dd> <b>♠ Ideological thought equates men and women ♣ [present; absent] ♥</b> “Both supporters and critics of Islam turn to the Qur'an, sunna, and Islamic law to justify their claims about Islam's stance towards women. For more than a millennium, differing interpretive traditions have employed these sources to address and settle disagreements over issues.//As with Judaism and Christianity, gender is an inherent aspect of God's plan for humanity from the first humans. However, unlike her Judeo-Christian counterpart, the Qur'anic Eve (unnamed in the Qur'an, but identified as Hawwa' in later sources) is not responsible for tempting Adam into eating the forbidden fruit, which results in their expulsion; they are equally responsible. Furthermore, Islam does not have a doctrine of original sin; Adam and Eve's punishment does not extend to future generations, nor is Eve's role explicitly linked to future women—though medieval scholars, such as al-Tabari, have argued that Eve was solely culpable and that her role reveals women's deficiencies (Stowasser, 1994).//The Qur'an explicitly states that men and women have equal religious responsibility before God and that male and female believers will be rewarded equally (33:35, 40:8). However, in other realms they have differentiated roles and rights. In some cases women have lesser positions than men. For example, two women's testimonies are equivalent to that of a single man (2:282), men have authority over their wives and may discipline them in the case of disobedience (nushuz, 4:34), women typically inherit less than male relatives (4:7-20), and polygamy is permitted under certain circumstances (4:3). However, the Qur'an provides some protections explicitly for women. For example, a bride directly receives the dower (mahr, 4:4), husbands are required to provide maintenance (nafaqa) for their wives (2:233), and husbands should treat their wives kindly (4:19).//Contemporary feminist scholars, particularly Fatima Mernissi (1991), have been critical of the treatment of women in the hadith literature, especially when stripped of its historical context. Mernissi argues that much of the hadith literature stands in contrast to the equality of the Qur'an and the experience of Muhammad's wives, and therefore the authenticity and chains of transmission of certain ahadith, such as the hijab and injunctions against women's political leadership, must be re-examined. Leila Ahmed (1992) undertakes such an explanation, contextualizing the relation between religion and gender in space and across time.//The interpretation and application of the Qur'an and sunna in legal matters is dependent upon a variety of factors, including the legal school, particulars of a given case, and the socio-historical context. While there is a measure of consensus between the four major Sunni schools of jurisprudence, they vary on particulars ranging from a wife's potential recourses if her husband is unable to provide her maintenance to what constitutes equitable treatment in a polygamous marriage. An important distinction between the Sunni schools of jurisprudence and Ithna 'Ashari (Twelver) Shiism is the former's explicit rejection of temporary marriage (mut'ah). In analyzing whether women are disadvantaged in comparison to men in Islamic law, Judith Tucker (2008) concludes that women's status varies substantially between issues. While women have less freedom than men to independently initiate marriage or divorce, Islamic law largely guarantees the property rights of both married and unmarried women and imposes safeguards in the case of divorce.//A key issue in Islamic exegesis is how much of Qur'anic and hadith material relates specifically to Muhammad's wives (Mothers of the Believers, Ummahat al-Mu'minun) and how much can be generalized as normative practice for all Muslim women. For example, the Qur'an indicates the special status of Muhammad's wives (33:32), and they were under certain restrictions such as not remarrying after Muhammad's death (33:52), stipulations that were not obviously applicable to other Muslim women. Another issue revolves around veiling, concerning the exact manner in which women should dress and whether veiling was a requirement of all Muslim women or merely Muhammad's wives. [...]Ahmed (1991) argues that the rise of the Abbasid dynasty, influenced by Persian and Byzantine practices, represented a decisive turning point for gender equality in public life.

[...] In the history of Islam, the first religious waqf was the mosque of Quba' in Medina. It was built upon the arrival of the Prophet Muhammad in 622. Six months later it was followed by the Mosque of the Prophet in the center of Medina. Mosques, as well as real estate that provides revenues for mosque maintenance and expenses, are in the category of religious waqf.//Philanthropic waqf aims at supporting the poor segments of society and the public interest of the community by funding such institutions as hospitals, orphanages, nursing homes, libraries, scientific research, education, public services, and care of animals and the environment. There are alsoawqaf for interest-free loans to small businesses and for maintenance of parks, roads, bridges, and dams. This started during the time of the Prophet Muhammad. On advice from the Prophet, 'Uthman, a well-to-do Companion, bought the Well of Rumah and made it into waqf, to provide everybody with free drinking water. This was followed by the waqf of 'Umar. When he asked the Prophet what to do with a palm orchard he acquired in the city of Khaybar, the Prophet said, “If you like, you may hold the property as waqf and give its fruits as charity.” <sup id="cite_ref-553" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-553">[553]</a></sup></dd>

</p><p><b>♠ Human sacrifice ♣ 0 ♥</b> "“Our” present religions, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, sometimes called Abrahamic religions, have the theme of human sacrifice right at their inception, with the founding father, Abraham. We are accustomed to the story, which remains a text of “terror and trembling,” as Kierkegaard put it. Abraham is commanded by god to “sacrifice” his only son Isaac, and he is willing to do so (Gen. 22). The Hebrew term for this sacrifice is colah, “make to rise upwards,” as fire and smoke rise to heaven;10 the action is to cut the throat with a knife and to burn the corpse on wood—the knife and wood expressly mentioned in the text. The human victim must be fettered in order to receive the deadly cut. Abraham does obey his god’s command, without even an attempt at protest. The text enjoys the paradox: “the son that you love”; “and the two walked together” (Gen. 22.1-19: 2; 8). In Muslim tradition, the place where Abraham “bound” his son is the rock on the temple hill of Jerusalem, which, since Khalif Omar, is covered by the “temple dome” with its golden cupola. Of course, an angel stops Abraham’s action at the last moment, pointing to an animal for sacrifice. The text says God was “testing” (nissah) Abraham, and his submissive obedience is highly rewarded. The text also states that god accepted the ram “instead of” (tachath) Isaac. One way to discard the terror of the story is to introduce a perspective of historical progress: God was replacing human sacrifice by animal sacrifice.

<p><b>Enforcement of Morality by Human Religious Agents</b>
For this section, include any type of punishment or reward by religious agents (defined as religious groups, their leaders, or even religiously motivated individuals who are not leaders, e.g., Buddhist monks, street preachers). These religious agents may be acting independently of the state, or as its representatives. Include specific details of the nature and extent of punishment/reward in the description. Code “compound” moral actions (e.g., filial piety = kin + respect) in multiple categories as necessary. Morality categories are based on Moral Foundations Theory (Haidt &amp; Graham, 2007) and Morality-As-Cooperation theory (Curry, 2016). In general, we are contrasting enforcement of “moral”/”prosocial” behaviours directed between humans with that of “amoral”/“procedural” behaviours directed by humans towards supernatural beings (e.g., prayers, rituals, sacrifices, taboos).

But if you turn away from them (the needy), because you are still waiting for your Lord's bounty that you are expecting, then (at least) speak to them a kind word. Do not tie your hand to your neck (do not be miserly) nor stretch it without any restraint (do not be extravagant) for then you should sit down rebuked, denuded (17:23- 9)." <sup id="cite_ref-595" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-595">[595]</a></sup> "Charitableness, helpfulness, helping one's kith and kin, concern for neighbours, assisting the weak and oppressed, and nursing the sick are all activities that are highly valued in Islamic ethics." <sup id="cite_ref-596" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-596">[596]</a></sup> "The third pillar is almsgiving, obligatory charity or welfare money for the poor (zakat). For most purposes, this involves the payment each year of two and a half per cent of one's capital or accumulated wealth and assets, excluding such items as primary residence, car and professional tools. Only certain people are qualified to receive obligatory charity. There are, of course, other forms of charity over and above the obligatory zakat, which can be donated to such recipients as seem appropriate.//Islam stands for brotherhood and social justice and it asserts that the poor and the needy have rights to the wealth of the rich. Payment of almsgiving represents the duty to care for the community's social welfare. It is a great sin not to share one's wealth with the needy and to let them suffer from hunger and disease. Zakat is a duty enjoined by God and undertaken by Muslims in the interest of society as a whole. However, it is also of humanitarian and socio-political value as well as being motivated by spiritual and moral concerns. It is an effective instrument for cultivating the spirit of social responsibility on the part of the contributor and the feeling of security and belonging on the part of the recipient. The Qur'an says 'Those who spend their wealth by night and day, in private and public shall be rewarded by their Lord. No fear shall come upon them, neither shall they grieve' (2:274)." <sup id="cite_ref-597" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-597">[597]</a></sup> "Charity does not consist merely of offering help to the needy; rather it includes anything one does which is of good to others.

The historical and legal model was the leadership of the prophet Muhammad. From the Muslim emigration (Hidjra) from Mecca to Medina in 622 - the date which would soon afterwards be fixed as the beginning of the Islamic calendar - onwards he combined the highest secular- judicial and spiritual- religious authority in his person. Later his successor/ representative ( khalifa , 'caliph') would assume this position. Constitutional law usually describes this as the function of an imam, not referring in this instance to the prayer leader in the mosque but to the head of the entire Muslim community. It states that obedience is due to him; not only as a matter of reason but also because law (shar') decrees it. This is often supported by sura 4:59 [4:62]: 'O believers, obey God, and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you (uli l-amr)!' It remains unclear who the last-named are. Classical commentaries name secular rulers (umara' , sultan) as well as religious ahl al-qur'an wa-l-'ilm) or legal scholars (fuqaha').

The Islamic territory (dar al-Islam , House of Islam), within which sharia norms were applied, was in opposition to the rest of the world, regarded as fundamentally hostile and lawless, the House of War (dar al-harb). Classical doctrine did not allow lasting peace treaties but only temporary armistices in cases where the Muslim forces were inferior. For the rest, the commitment to expand the faith (jihad) - which the scholars undoubtedly saw as a primarily military enterprise - in the sense of increasing Muslim territory remained the religious duty of a sufficient number of believers (fard kifaya). It was not possible to enact a restriction of jihad, giving it a defensive intention applying only to those countries under non-Muslim rule which were in conflict with Islamic rule. Classical doctrine did not refer to those Quranic verses which express only a defensive attitude against attack, but considered these to have been abrogated by the 'sword verses' in sura 9:29ff. (regarding abrogation cf. 2.1 above). It is probably no coincidence that this doctrine was formulated during the time of military expansion under the Umayyads and the early Abbasids."<sup id="cite_ref-606" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-606">[606]</a></sup></dd>
