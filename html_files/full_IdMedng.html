</p><p><b> ♠ Original name  ♣ Medang Kingdom ♥ </b>
</p><p><b> ♠ Alternative names  ♣ Sailendra Kingdom; Mataram Kingdom ♥ </b> Mataram Kingdom is a name used to refer to the period in which the kingdom's capital was located in Central Java, between 732 and 918. This name cannot be used in reference to the later period, when the capital shifts to East Java. It must also be distinguished from the much later Islamic polity, the Mataram Sultanate.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Peak Date  ♣ 850 CE ♥ </b> The period between 732 and 918 is said to be a golden age of Javanese culture - height of temple building projects and thus the flourishing of art and architecture.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>

One suggests that the founder of the Sanjaya dynasty was actually founder of the Sailendra dynasty, which was initially Shivaist Hindu, and changed to Mahāyāna Buddhism on the conversion of his son Panangkaran. <sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> The other theory is that there were two competing dynasties within the same polity and the Sailendra gradually assumed dominance. <sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ nominal ♥ </b> Political centralization hard to achieve, despite the lack of geographical barriers, due to the influence of local elites in eco-regions. The main political actors were the leaders of eco-region water boards who coordinated the planting of rice. "Kingdoms" began to form on the rice plains through alliance structures. <sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ alliance ♥ </b> 732-800 C.E.: alliance Dharaindra (rr. 780-800) ascended to become the Maharajah of Srivijaya. The nature of the Sailendra's close relationship with the neighbouring Srivijaya empire is complex. It seems that in earlier times, the Sailendra family was within the Srivijayan mandala (sphere of influence), and that later the Sailendra's monarch rose to become the head of Srivijaya. It is uncertain as to whether this was due to a military campaign or close alliance.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> It seems that over the course of the ninth century, however, any alliance broke down, as in 990 Medang launched a campaign against Srivijaya, leading ultimately to the downfall of Medang in 1006.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>

<dl><dd>The Medang, or Mataram, Kingdom, is the first well-attested Hindu-Buddhist kingdom in central Java. In 732 CE, in an inscription written in Sanskrit, a local ruler called Sanjaya made the 'first definite claim to kingship' known from the region.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> Over the next few centuries, his successors would extend their influence over areas suitable for irrigated rice agriculture in upland central Java. The Medang Kingdom is famous for its large-scale sacred construction projects, such as the Buddhist pilgrimage site of Borobudur (a series of ascending stone terraces decorated with stone reliefs and topped with stupas) and Prambanan, a Hindu temple complex.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>A long-standing debate about dynastic succession in late 1st-millennium CE central Java is still unresolved,<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> showing that there are still many gaps in our understanding of the kingdom. Some scholars hold that there were two competing dynasties, the Buddhist Sailendras and the Shaivite descendants of King Sanjaya, while others believe that the rulers mentioned in inscriptions were two branches of the same family. In the early 10th century CE, the centre of royal power shifted from the high volcanic plains of central Java to the east of the island, signalling the increased importance of maritime trade to the polity.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p><i>Population and political organization</i>

<dl><dd>King Sanjaya and his successors drew their legitimacy from Indic religious concepts, sometimes devoting themselves to Hindu deities (especially Shiva) and sometimes favouring Buddhist practices.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> They gathered courtly entourages about them and drew their wealth from the taxation of rice and other goods and the use of corvée labour.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> Local lords, known as <i>rakrayan</i>, and temple foundations could be granted the right to collect taxes from the population within a given parcel of land: these <i>sima</i> tax-grants were a useful way for the Medang kings to reward and ensure loyalty.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Secure population estimates for the Medang Kingdom are lacking, but in the early 11th century CE, the East Javanese settlements of Cane, Patakan and Baru each had populations of over 1000 people.<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> The demographer Peter McDonald believes the population of the island as a whole in the 14th century could have been as high as five million.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup> Evidence from Javanese inscriptions suggests that by this time, the population levels of East Javanese states had been rising ‘fairly consistently’ since the early 10th century.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ temple founding ceremony ♥</b> "The crowd was rather small, but they represented a broad spectrum of Javanese society. The most exalted were hereditary noblemen. There were several elders from nearby villages, a sculptor from the distant Dieng Plateau (who had probably been invited to the lowlands of what is now the province of Central Java to render professional services), and at least eighteen children. All had gathered to take part in a ceremony sponsored by a local noble, who was present with his wife and three sons. The occasion was the founding of a new temple.//Such gatherings were relatively common in ancient Java. [...]//These ceremonies normally followed a standard format, and that of December 27, 902 C.E., did not deviate from it. The ritual did not take long to complete. First, the noble sponsoring the building of the temple, who is referred to in the account by his tide, Rakai Panggumulan, distributed presents to all the people who had come. The distribution of gifts was an important symbolic act; ancient Indonesians nobility spent much of their energy endeavoring to acquire precious items that they could then redistribute to loyal followers as tokens of spiritual merit. The scribe recorded the noble's bounty in detail. Next, all participants decorated themselves with flowers and paint; we can only try to imagine the colors and patterns they would have drawn upon their bodies. A sacred stone was set in the center of the space where the temple would be built. Offerings were then laid upon it. The people next sat in a circle around the stone; a priest intoned curses against anyone who would dare disturb the peace of their village. With that, the brief ceremony was concluded.//Thereupon began a celebration that probably took longer than the ritual itself. The nobles, elders, sculptor, and others, many of whom were probably commoners from the village, indulged in feasting enlivened by supplies of palm wine, probably drunk from bamboo cups. The repast was succeeded by music and dancing, possibly of a solemn nature; but the Javanese sense of humor was perhaps already as well developed as it is today, for as usual there was also a performance by a buffoon.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ temple founding ceremony ♥</b> "The crowd was rather small, but they represented a broad spectrum of Javanese society. The most exalted were hereditary noblemen. There were several elders from nearby villages, a sculptor from the distant Dieng Plateau (who had probably been invited to the lowlands of what is now the province of Central Java to render professional services), and at least eighteen children. All had gathered to take part in a ceremony sponsored by a local noble, who was present with his wife and three sons. The occasion was the founding of a new temple.//Such gatherings were relatively common in ancient Java. [...]//These ceremonies normally followed a standard format, and that of December 27, 902 C.E., did not deviate from it. The ritual did not take long to complete. First, the noble sponsoring the building of the temple, who is referred to in the account by his tide, Rakai Panggumulan, distributed presents to all the people who had come. The distribution of gifts was an important symbolic act; ancient Indonesians nobility spent much of their energy endeavoring to acquire precious items that they could then redistribute to loyal followers as tokens of spiritual merit. The scribe recorded the noble's bounty in detail. Next, all participants decorated themselves with flowers and paint; we can only try to imagine the colors and patterns they would have drawn upon their bodies. A sacred stone was set in the center of the space where the temple would be built. Offerings were then laid upon it. The people next sat in a circle around the stone; a priest intoned curses against anyone who would dare disturb the peace of their village. With that, the brief ceremony was concluded.//Thereupon began a celebration that probably took longer than the ritual itself. The nobles, elders, sculptor, and others, many of whom were probably commoners from the village, indulged in feasting enlivened by supplies of palm wine, probably drunk from bamboo cups. The repast was succeeded by music and dancing, possibly of a solemn nature; but the Javanese sense of humor was perhaps already as well developed as it is today, for as usual there was also a performance by a buffoon.

<dd> <b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from judiciary ♣ absent ♥</b> 'While in a theoretical sense the king's only duty was to maintain the world order - to protect his realm, promote its prosperity, and facilitate passage to the realm of the ancestors - in practice the monarch's duties sometimes involved the application of customary law regarding land and labor. In an inscription from central Java dated 860, for example, state administrators were asked to intervene in a local dispute when the village elders and representative of a temple could not resolve the method of repaying a considerable debt owed to the local community.'<sup id="cite_ref-368" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-368">[368]</a></sup> The first king of Medang, Sanjaya, stressed in his Canggal inscription of 732 that he was 'honored by learned men as a scholar in the subtleties of the sastras', which Hall describes as 'Indian legal texts that focus on the maintenance of harmony among the social order'.<sup id="cite_ref-369" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-369">[369]</a></sup> This implies that the application of laws was considered an key function of kingship in 8th-century central Java.</dd></dl>

During such tours kings not only showed themelves to the people in areas far away from the kěraton, but also could come into contact with some members of the population ... This gave, however, an occasion to members of the population to present petitions to the king'.<sup id="cite_ref-370" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-370">[370]</a></sup>​ We could also consider the inscription of Salingsingan (880 CE), which records iron and copper smiths (called 'subalterns' by Zakharov) being summoned to the 'waiting room of the king' over a tax dispute.<sup id="cite_ref-371" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-371">[371]</a></sup> Zakharov comments that they 'lost the case', using this as an example of the might of the Javanese state,<sup id="cite_ref-372" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-372">[372]</a></sup> but it does at least indicate that commoners could obtain a hearing in the king's 'waiting room' rather than being arbitrarily punished.</dd>

<dd> <b>♠ Informal constraint on executive ♣ present ♥</b> Hall argues that 'eighth-century Javanese monarchs such as the Sailendras were important as initiators of a networked cultural integration in central Java. Their power was limited, however. Because they were economic equals to their subordinate rakrayan [regional leaders], and because the developing central Java wet-rice economy was a local and regional one that required minimal centralized economic or administrative leadership by a higher authority, leading rakrayan had few opportunities to dominate except through their ritualized sovereignty and personal power'.<sup id="cite_ref-385" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-385">[385]</a></sup> Even in the later Medang period, we have evidence of informal constraints on the king's power. Javanese monarchs in the 9th to 13th centuries CE 'did not normally have local land rights, and even their tax rights were subject to social restraint'.<sup id="cite_ref-386" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-386">[386]</a></sup> Wisseman Christie states that 'The ruler had no power to remove tax rights from his fellow rakais' (lords with tax rights over groups of villages).<sup id="cite_ref-387" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-387">[387]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Critique of executive by religious agents ♣ inferred present ♥</b> At least early on in the Medang kingdom, there is evidence of the kings taking guidance from religious agents: 'In 778, Maharaja Panangkaran founded, at the request of his spiritual teachers, a sanctuary dedicated to the Buddhist goddess Tārā.'<sup id="cite_ref-389" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-389">[389]</a></sup> This strong influence may imply that spiritual teachers could also express disapproval of the rulers' actions.</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Sanction of executive by religious agents ♣ [absent; present] ♥</b> I have not found evidence that e.g. court brahmins or Buddhist monks could impose formal or informal sanctions on the Medang kings, but it is possible that they wielded sufficient power to be able to withhold co-operation if the king's decisions displeased them.</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Constraint on executive by religious agents ♣ inferred present ♥</b> We could infer that because the Medang kings derived so much of their legitimacy from ritual sources, they would have relied on the support of various religious agents to maintain power. 'Theirs was a "ritual sovereignty" marked by the temple complexes and the patronage of monks and priests steeped in Indian learning who endowed the king with sacred powers and reinforced an aura of divine majesty.'<sup id="cite_ref-390" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-390">[390]</a></sup></dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Constraint on executive by religious institutions ♣ inferred present ♥</b> Supomo thinks that 'For the elevation of a native [Javanese] chief to the level of <i>ksatriya</i> the Brahmanic rite of <i>vrātyastoma</i> must have been performed by Brahmans. Accordingly, in areas where there was no established Brahman the chief either had to import some from outside - offering them gifts of land and other inducements - or even create them himself from amongst ambitious local groups'.<sup id="cite_ref-391" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-391">[391]</a></sup> Here we see a need for the would-be ruler to secure the co-operation of priests through gifts and 'other inducements' - it is the institution of the Hindu royal investiture ritual (proposed by Supomo) that acts as a constraint here. This discussion is relevant for the early Medang period (Supomo sees both Sanjaya and his successor Panangkaran as local <i>ratu</i> chiefs elevated to Hindu ritual kingship through these rites), but I think we can also posit a degree of constraint on the later Medang rulers by religious institutions. Reid discusses the relationship of kings in the 'charter era' of 900-1300 CE to Buddhist and Hindu religious specialists and concepts: 'Popular Buddhism remained a key mobilizing factor, but kings were increasingly able to channel it for their own accumulation of sacred power. And for such kings, even while patronizing the Buddhist pilgrimage centers, the hierarchies of Hinduism were indispensable. They required a corps of Brahmins to conduct the rituals of enthronement and legitimation as godlike <i>devaraja</i> or "king of the gods," elevated far above others by the accumulation of supernatural power.'<sup id="cite_ref-392" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-392">[392]</a></sup> There is a strong sense here that the kings relied on the support of holy men and sacred institutions.</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Impeachment by religious agents ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> According to J. G. de Casparis, the 9th-century Medang king Pikatan 'left the throne willingly and became a hermit' (though the Wanua Tengah III inscription seems to suggest that on the contrary, he died on the throne).<sup id="cite_ref-393" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-393">[393]</a></sup> However, as I have not come across any suggestion that he was pressured into this decision by religious agents, and as the historical fact of the abdication is itself disputed, I think we do not have enough evidence to code present for impeachment by religious agents.</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Subordination of the chief executive to a religious agent ♣ inferred present ♥</b> A Medang king considered himself 'a titisan dewa - a "droplet distilled from the essence of God" - whose function was to maintain contact between the kingdom on the microcosmic scale and the universe or macrocosm.'<sup id="cite_ref-394" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-394">[394]</a></sup> This seems to suggest that the kings would have acknowledged the superior power of the gods, deriving their own legitimacy from claims to link the kingdom to the wider universe.</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Motivation by belief in supernatural agent ♣ present ♥</b> Kulke describes religiously motivated state spending on public ceremonies in the early Southeast Asian kingdoms: 'The importance of the personal belief of the rulers and their priests and their magical capability is known to us already from the earliest inscriptional and literary evidence. And on special occasions there were always grand ceremonies, for example, seasonal festivities, potlatch-like "Verdienstfeste" or Vedic rituals'.<sup id="cite_ref-395" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-395">[395]</a></sup> More specifically for the Medang Kingdom, there are 'donative inscriptions' belonging to the royal family (as well as to local <i>rakrayan</i>) from the temple complex at Candi Plaosan, showing financial support from the monarchy for temple-building.<sup id="cite_ref-396" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-396">[396]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-397" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-397">[397]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<p><b>♠ State-level administrators ♣ present ♥</b> Reed describes the 'personal staffs' assembled by the rulers of emergent Southeast Asian kingdoms: 'the early South-East Asian rulers began to fashion the first indigenous polities by collecting around themselves groups of Brahmanical advisers in order to sanctify their sovereignty, to organize a governmental infrastructure and to supervise a contingent of loyal soldiers...'.<sup id="cite_ref-482" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-482">[482]</a></sup> De Casparis' has analysed the relations between central and local government in Java from 875 to 950 CE, and lists 'royal officials' as one of the 'formal channels' of contact.<sup id="cite_ref-483" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-483">[483]</a></sup> Some of these officials served at court, but some resided 'in the villages without apparently being integral parts of the village communities'.<sup id="cite_ref-484" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-484">[484]</a></sup> As there is no reason to suppose that state-level administrators were absent after 950 CE, and as they were present in the later polities of Kahuripan and Kediri, I have coded present for the remainder of the Medang period.
</p><p><b>♠ Prestige of state-level bureaucracy ♣ equal ♥</b> ​De Casparis makes a loose distinction between 'royal officials' and 'landed nobility' in this period. Royal officials included court officials such as the <i>rakryan mapatih</i> ('prime minister or grand vizir') as well as lower officials associated with the central government but resident in villages as 'outsiders'.<sup id="cite_ref-485" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-485">[485]</a></sup>​ In de Casparis' schema, the landed nobility are those 'holding titles such as rakai, rakryan (rakarayan), or pamegat'. They could extract labour and other forms of revenue from certain groups of villages known as <i>watak</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-486" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-486">[486]</a></sup> However, there seems to be some overlap: the above-mentioned rakryan mapatih had a direct relationship with the central government but could also draw wealth from a watak. It seems that both groups included very high-ranking officials as well as lower ones, and in de Casparis' description, neither one seems definitively of higher status than the other.<sup id="cite_ref-487" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-487">[487]</a></sup>

Both "Kicaka" [a type of dance mentioned in the inscription] and the "Bhīma-kumara" obviously refer to a certain episode from the Wirā taparwa, the fourth book of the Mahābhārata ... Since there is no evidence that a Javanese translation or adaptation of the Mahābhārata already existed at that time, it seems likely that the narrator of the Bhīma-kumara episode recited a Sanskrit text, and then, as in a <i>harikatha</i> [a public reading of the Sanskrit epics in India], explained it to his audience in Javanese.'<sup id="cite_ref-616" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-616">[616]</a></sup> We know from the <i>sima</i> inscriptions that both men and women were present at ceremonies such as this, so I have coded present in recognition of the didactic function of literary performance for ordinary Javanese villagers after the 10th century.</dd>

She discerns the reaction of the state against this process in the appearance of sumptuary regulations in the inscriptions of the time: 'Tax farming became a lucrative source of income for merchants with extra cash to invest, and trade wealth was transmuted into status through the establishment of private family temples by the <i>nouveau riche</i>, who invested money in creating <i>sima</i> foundations for them. One sign of the destabilization of the status system under the impact of new wealth was the appearance in inscriptions of sumptuary regulations.

These virtues that are said to be common to all humans are known as sadhārana (common) or sanatana (eternal) dharma. [...] Elsewhere Manu (VI:91- 2) asserts that avoiding backbiting, hypocrisy, greed, infatuation, anger and discontent is approved dharma for all the stages of life. The problem is that there are different views as to what the actuality of universal dharma is. Radhakrishnan, for example, argues for a sanatana dharma, based upon Advaita Vedanta thought, that is said to be present in all religious traditions. It is a kind of perennial philosophy that is at the heart of every religious tradition not just at the heart of the Hindu tradition. Others concentrate upon a universal dharma within the Hindu tradition itself but there is no absolute consensus as to what it is. Nevertheless, in theory, the ethical virtues of compassion, generosity, gratitude, and non-violence are universally regarded by most Hindus." <sup id="cite_ref-731" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-731">[731]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Number of officially sanctioned supernatural beings ♣ polytheistic ♥</b> "According to one popular formula, there are 330 million gods in Hinduism. Nevertheless, most Hindus have believed that there is ultimately one deity, and that the diversity of other gods are his or her emanations or manifestations, representing his or her agency in particular contexts. [...] The three gods most commonly worshipped as the ultimate in Hindu traditions are Visnu, Siva, and the Goddess, variously called Devi, "Goddess," and Sakti, "Power." This triad of deities must be distinguished from an overlapping group of three deities who are conceived in the Puranas and other authoritative traditions to perform particular cosmic functions-Brahma, who creates the universe anew in each vast cosmic cycle, and also, in some accounts, bestows the Veda upon humanity; Visnu, who preserves the universe by intervening to rectify problems through his avataras, "descents" or "incarnations"; and Siva, who destroys the universe at the end of each cosmic cycle. [...] [W]hichever deity is conceived as the ultimate is understood to be the source who emanates the others, both the triad who perform the aforementioned cosmic functions and lower supernatural beings, and thus to be the ultimate agent in their actions. [...] There are numerous other important deities besides those frequently conceived as a monotheistic ultimate. One of the most important of these is Ganesa, a son of Siva with the head of an elephant, believed to be a protective figure that removes obstacles. Another is Hanuman, the monkey-god who helped Rama in his battle against Ravana, idealized for his devotion to Rama and Sita. Other deities important in particular regions include the South Indian Ayappa, regarded as the son of Siva and a female avatara of Visnu; and smallpox goddesses such as the North Indian Sitala." <sup id="cite_ref-757" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-757">[757]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b>♠ High Gods (creator gods) ♣ inactive ♥</b> "Each Purana tends to focus on a specific deity as the Supreme Being responsible for creating and ordering the world. [...] Thus, [for example,] Krishna [...] is a form of the supreme God who creates, maintains, and destroys the universe. In the Bhagavad Gita , Arjuna is permitted to glimpse Krishna's cosmic form. He sees the entire universe, the sun, stars, and planets, and all the people gathered on the battlefield within the body of Krishna. Krishna tells him that everything that exists is part of himself, but that he is not limited to everything that exists. In other words, just as the Vedic Purusha extended ten finger-lengths beyond the created universe, so too Krishna is the entire cosmos and more." <sup id="cite_ref-760" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-760">[760]</a></sup> "Among the cosmic laws that constitute dharma, the law of karma, or action, is especially relevant to rebirth. By the law of karma, every thought, word, and deed carries with it a like reaction. Beings are born, live, die, and are reborn based on their actions. Every good deed brings a reward, and every bad deed a punishment. The terms 'reward' and 'punishment' are deceptive, however; for karma is not seen as a set of rewards and punishments doled out by a just God, but in impersonal terms, as the working of natural law. Karma attracts reactions to moral agents like an ethical law of gravity. Benevolent actions produce good results for the person who engages in them. Similarly, actions intended to cause suffering will lead to suffering for those who commit them." <sup id="cite_ref-761" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-761">[761]</a></sup></dd></dl>

Not all Brahmins have been priests and not all Kshatriyas have been rulers. The complexity of the caste system, regional and linguistic differences and historical change have all militated against this rigidity. [...]Brahmins have traditionally been seen as ritually more pure than Kshatriyas and more versed in religious knowledge. They are, in theory if not always in fact, the key scholars in the Hindu tradition. The Kshatriyas have traditionally been seen, again in theory if not always in practice, as the rulers who maintain society, uphold dharma and protect the householder system. They built and sponsored temples, protected their subjects and their deities and, to that extent, the Brahmins recognised a ruler's overlordship. However, the kingly role in ruling and guardianship duties involved more 'polluting tendencies' than were usual in a Brahmin's life. The Brahmins have had a dual role in society. Those who are active priests in temples have engaged in functions that involve being given gifts by worshippers and such temple priests are more involved with lower castes. Paradoxically Brahmins who are versed in promoting scholarship and in advancing religious learning but who do not act as serving priests are, in general, more widely admired because they have less contact with the public. Thus Brahmins who are not priests can be more akin to those renouncers engaged in lifelong learning and spirituality, rather than in the hurly-burly of householder life.

According to Dumont, in addition to the distinctions already outlined that fit varnas and jatis into hierarchies, another must be added. This distinction takes caste hierarchical divides beyond the kind of class distinctions found in eighteenth-century Britain or in the Ancien Regime in Europe, by stressing the opposition between purity and pollution. Caste difference, according to this classification, goes beyond class differences into this other realm of ritual purity and pollution. The Brahmins are the highest and purest varna, and the Dalits are the lowest, in that they are outside varna and are impure altogether. The other varnas rank in between. Pollution occurs in different ways. It occurs through bodily contact of one sort or another, with menstrual cycles, through birth and death, through emissions such as faeces, urine and saliva, and through contact with night-soil, dirty clothes, unswept rooms and so on. Thus marriage and sex have to function within the correct set of jatis in the correct varna. Polluting jobs such as laundering and sweeping are done by people of lower castes so that the blood of people of higher castes can remain 'pure'. Equally menstrual activity among older women makes them more 'impure' than men or pre-menstrual virgins, and therefore women are more polluting than men. They will thus often live semi-separately while menstruating, during which time they will also avoid going to the temple and therefore 'polluting' the gods. Furthermore, untouchable Dalits were prohibited from entering many temples before the post-Independence freedom-of-temple-entry legislation and even now they are kept out of some temples in many villages. [...] It is also true to say that Dumont's thesis suffers from exaggeration and other matters are important in discussing caste. Nevertheless, there is at least an element of truth in the notion that purity and pollution has relevance in any discussion of caste." <sup id="cite_ref-775" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-775">[775]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ care/harm ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> The following quote shows that caring for others is an important value in Hinduism: "According to Hindu Dharmashastras, of the four stages of life, the person who is at the householder stage is the anchor of society. The householder’s business is the maintenance and support of those in the other three stages of life: the students who have not yet entered into the world of work, the retirees who have seen the birth of grandchildren and spotted their first gray hairs, and the renunciants, those who have left behind not only the world of work and material possession but who have also left behind family and self-interest for a life focused on spiritual freedom. Householders are the ones with material wealth, and their responsibility, their dharma, is to share it with others. [...] The link between the world of the householder and the world of the renunciant is gift giving - dana. The classic image is of the renouncer with the begging bowl, making the rounds for alms. On a daily basis, in Hindu society, food is given to sannyasins and sadhus, the world renouncers who have "cast off" from the settled world of "this shore."<sup id="cite_ref-778" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-778">[778]</a></sup> However, no evidence could be found for actual enforcement of this behaviour--e.g. punishment for not giving food to renouncers. Instead, it seems any punishment or reward was believed to occur through reinarnation: "In this era, the belief in a single life span was replaced by a system of reincarnation called samsara, the cycle of rebirths. According to this system, at death one would pass on to a life in heaven or hell, depending on the merits of one’s activities in life.

<dd><b>♠ fairness/cheating ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> According to Hindu Law: "Misconduct by doctors, judges and examiners of coins has been transferred from steya to sahasa by Mādhava who has prescribed the highest punishment for a quack, a judge who punishes an innocent person and lets the guilty go scot free, and for an examiner of coins who lies about the genuineness of coins. These rules from Narada are available in all the texts under review, but Varadaraja and Devana have placed them under steya.

Soon, however, these sciences freed themselves from sacerdotal concerns and came to be established as independent subjects of enquiry, paying only lip service to the authority of the Vedas. The same may be said to be true of law which was an appendage to sacred literature only in the period of the sūtras.

According to this system, at death one would pass on to a life in heaven or hell, depending on the merits of one’s activities in life. Then, after a certain amount of time, the individual would be reborn on earth once again. The mechanism that regulated this system was karman, a word that literally means "action." Every action must have an effect. So, the effects of one’s actions in life determine what one will experience after death, and what kind of life one will have in the next birth. In this way, even if a person does not seem to receive all the rewards or punishments deserved in a particular life, the scales will be balanced in the future." <sup id="cite_ref-788" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-788">[788]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ respect for property ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Referring to commentaries on Hindu law between the eighth and fourteenth centuries CE: "The law on theft in the period under review seems to have been already well settled much earlier. Texts of this period exhibit near unanimity in their presentations. [...] Some of the subjects highlighted in these texts are: definition of theft, types of theft, punishments for various types of theft, collaborators, special laws of evidence to prove theft, liability of the state to compensate for theft and so on and so forth."<sup id="cite_ref-789" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-789">[789]</a></sup> However, it seems that Hindu Law had only a nominal link to Hindu precepts, and does not therefore count as "human enforcement of morality":  "The growth of law in India may be likened to the evolution of disciplines like grammar, poetics, etymology, and prosody etc. Early speculations on these started in the samhitās and gained strength as auxiliaries to the Vedas. Soon, however, these sciences freed themselves from sacerdotal concerns and came to be established as independent subjects of enquiry, paying only lip service to the authority of the Vedas. The same may be said to be true of law which was an appendage to sacred literature only in the period of the sūtras. Even earlier than the earliest of the known metrical smṛtis, the artha śāstra tradition had recognised that politics and administration were outside the domain of the sacred." <sup id="cite_ref-790" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-790">[790]</a></sup> Moreover, it seems that, in Hinduism, punishment or reward for certain behaviours was believed to occur mainly through reincarnation, not through the action of other humans: "In this era, the belief in a single life span was replaced by a system of reincarnation called samsara, the cycle of rebirths.

The long-term annual rate of population growth in premodern Indonesia is generally believed to have been very low, hardly exceeding 0.1&nbsp;% per annum up to 1750. According to Anthony Reid "constant low-level warfare" led to high deaths in pre-modern Indonesia - the mobilization of large armies and the taking of large numbers of captives sold into slavery. <sup id="cite_ref-851" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-851">[851]</a></sup></dd>

A particularly important example is urinary schistosomiasis, which is spread by contact with water where there live snails which form the intermediate host. A study in Madagascar found that urinary schistosomiasis spread rapidly to new areas along with the expansion of an irrigation system ... It is not known whether such problems occurred in ancient Java, but one must remember that the expansion of the irrigation system may well have caused new health problems while eliminating others'.<sup id="cite_ref-855" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-855">[855]</a></sup> However, Miksic also told us that although we don't have enough skeletal evidence to draw conclusions on people's health in the ancient Javanese kingdoms, scholars suspect that it was quite good.<sup id="cite_ref-856" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-856">[856]</a></sup> He believes that the rarity and late appearance of cities in Indonesia may have been a way of avoiding the higher disease burden and other 'dangers and inconveniences' associated with urban settlement patterns.<sup id="cite_ref-857" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-857">[857]</a></sup></dd>

On the other hand, Jákl thinks we can infer from the descriptions of food in the <i>kakawin</i> epics that the peasant diet was relatively rich and varied. He comments: 'It may be wrong to extrapolate modern dietary patterns of Javanese peasants, with their heavy reliance on rice and vegetables, back on the conditions of pre-Islamic Java. In relatively sparsely populated premodern Java, with abundant resources and few documented dietary taboos, peasants may have generally enjoyed a much more varied diet then their modern descendants.

For instance, the niche usually occupied in South Indian Śiva temples by 'Śiva Dakșiņāmūrti, the "Supreme Guru"' is replaced in Java by a 'representation of the sage Agastya. It may seem strange that a <i>ŗși</i> [an ascetic or court brahmin], however wise and powerful he may have been, should be represented on a par with deities like Durgā and Ganesa, but it is known that Agastya, for whom a temple and an image were made in east Java in 760, enjoyed special veneration in Java.

</p><p><b>♠ Other wealth distribution ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> According to Hall, the distribution of resources was one of the sources from which the regional lords (<i>rakrayan</i>) of central Java drew their power: 'Foundational to a rakrayan or ratu lord's claim to sovereignty was his continuing ability to establish reciprocity relationships and redistribution networks in which material and psychological well-being were perceived to be a consequence of local submission to an overlord's authority.'<sup id="cite_ref-924" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-924">[924]</a></sup> The Dinaya Stone of Kañjuruha, dating to 760 CE, shows the king threatening divine punishment for officials who hoarded wealth: 'At the end of the record the king stressed that if his relatives and ministers "[had] a revolting attitude towards the king's gifts" (i.e. would like to appropriate them for their personal benefit), they would go to hell. If, on the other hand, they saw fit to "augment the gifts" and performed "meritorious acts like the making of gifts, performances of sacred rites and the study (of the sacred lore), - may they protect the kingdom just like the (present) king'.<sup id="cite_ref-925" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-925">[925]</a></sup> However, new forms of wealth and power based on commerce seem to have emerged around the turn of the millennium: Hall describes wealthy members of the court elite in the 10th-13th centuries as well as newly rich families. 'Javanese consumerism in the tenth through thirteenth century era included kraton members as well as the socially ambitious.'<sup id="cite_ref-926" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-926">[926]</a></sup> 'As one historian characterizes this age: "Public grandeur [i.e., the construction of lavish temple complexes] was, for a time, displaced by private luxury"'.<sup id="cite_ref-927" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-927">[927]</a></sup>
