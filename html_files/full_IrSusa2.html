"Sometime during the fourth millennium, in the urban center of Uruk (for which the archaeological period is named), southern Mesopotamia acquired a specifically Sumerian historical identity. With the introduction of a system of writing, a gradual development from an earlier accounting system, a radical change occurred in the social organization and in the very foundations of thought. ... Susa, in its earliest period (Susa I) attached to the world of the Iranian plateau, was now (in Susa II) integrated into the early Sumerian civilization of Mesopotamia, which it interpreted with originality. Precise stratigraphic excavations conducted in recent decades have allowed us to trace developments at Susa in the Uruk phase, notably of an accounting system that preceded the slightly later appearance of writing."<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>

<p>"The development of centers on the Susiana plane, beginning with Middle Cha1colithic Chogha Mish and culminating in the rise of Susa during the Late Chalcolithic. suggests a trend towards regional control in some economic and administrative activities (Delougaz and Kantor 1996, Hole 1987b: 89-90). This trend towards centralization may also be suggested by the presence of possible elite or "Khan's" houses during this time at several sites (Hole 1987a: 41). In spite of these trends, Chalcolithic society throughout Khuzistan presents a strong egalitarian appearance. During the Middle and Late Chalcolithic, differential access to resources may have involved less archaeological1y visible items such as staples. access to water, and control over labor, as it appears to have done at this time in Mesopotamia (Stein 1994)." <sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> The Middle Chalcolithic corresponds to 4800-3900 BCE and the Late Chalcolithic corresponds to 3900-3500 BCE in this book.

However, the precise nature of the administrative activities carried out there remains unclear (see Hole 1987a: 40-41).

<p>Code the variables below for the most widespread collective ritual of the official cult. Widespread refers to the degree of coverage a ritual has in a polity and therefore to the proportion of the overall population that participates in or observes a ritual. Keep in mind that it is possible that the ritual with the highest coverage is not necessarily a mass ritual performed at one location, but can be a ritual that is performed all over the polity and of which the aggregate of all participants represent the largest degree of coverage. If there are several collective rituals that are equally widespread, code the best documented one.

<p>Unlike the preceding rituals, the most dysphoric collective ritual may not belong to the official cult, but may be practiced by another group that has a significant role in the polity. When selecting the relevant ritual do keep in mind that we are foremost interested in rituals containing the highest intensity of dysphoria even though they may contain other elements that are less emotional or even euphoric. Furthermore, we are interested in peak levels of dysphoria for participants or ritual specialists (not the audience or sacrificial victims). Also, as we are interested in how these dysphoric moments are remembered it is necessary for the participants not normally to die during the rituals. If there are several collective rituals with the same high levels of peak dysphoria, code the best documented one.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ ♥</b> In the narrative part, also give a brief description of the ritual</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ ♥</b> daily/weekly/monthly/yearly/once per generation/once in a lifetime. Code the frequency of participating in a ritual from the perspective of the ritual specialist (e.g. priest). Entertainers (acrobats, dancers, actors...) are considered as ritual specialists. If the ritual's frequency does not fit within any of the suggested categories--for example, if it is performed every three days, or every twelve years--use the category that is closest, then specify the exact frequency in the description field.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ ♥</b> daily/weekly/monthly/yearly/once per generation/once in a lifetime. Code the frequency of participating in a ritual from the perspective of the participants. This group of participants does not include the ritual specialists, like priests. It also does not include sacrificial victims. However, highly engaged audiences (audiences who are processing, jeering, ...) are considered as participants. Audiences consisting of passive spectators or witnesses are coded for in the next variable. When it is difficult to distinguish between a highly engaged audience and an audience consisting of passive spectators, code these audiences here. If the ritual's frequency does not fit within any of the suggested categories--for example, if it is performed every three days, or every twelve years--use the category that's closest, then specify the exact frequency in the description field.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ ♥</b> daily/weekly/monthly/semi-annually/yearly/once per generation/once in a lifetime.

</p><p><b>♠ Description of the Normative Ideology ♣  ♥</b> "Both sites in the mid-fourth millennium BCE present evidence for religious activities and a continuation of the strategy of incorporating religious ideas into a visual rhetoric of control spanning media. At Choga Mish a monumental complex is constructed on what is referred to as the High Mound consisting of a polygonal platform, which may have been intended as the foundation for a temple, as well as surrounding buildings and ritual features (Delougaz and Kantor 1996: 27-35). While public architecture on a similar scale at Susa is unknown for this period, fragments of monumental sculpture hint that such structures did exist. Hoards of small-scale sculpture have also been recovered at Susa. Such hoards have parallels at other sites in the Near East, where they were found in temples and other locations of special significance (Pittman 1992: 50). In addition to these architectural remains and artifacts, there are again ceramics, seals, and seal impressions in large quantities with design elements displaying continuity with those seen in previous periods at both Choga Mish and Susa. [...] With so many different human relationships signaled by even more designs and compositions, it is difficult to draw sharp distinctions between secular and ritual motifs; it is helpful to think of the design and the object that displayed it as each having the ability to support multiple parenthetical meanings, depending on their social context. Having said this, however, there are a few representations from seal impressions at both Choga Mish and Susa that appear to highlight ritual actions and figures in particular. Two seal impressions from Choga Mish illustrate a procession of humans and animals to a temple; in both cases, the identification of the building as a temple is based on the presence of gateposts and parallels in design from other sites (Delougaz and Kantor 1996: 145) (see figure 4.4). The first shows two humans—one carrying a staff, the other a mace—flanking a lion standing on its hind legs; all three figures are next to a temple also with a niched facade. The second shows a procession of four human figures—one is next to the temple with a niched façade, and the remaining three are on the other side of the gateposts with one individual carrying a vessel—and two quadrupeds, one of which appears to be a lion. A representation of a temple is also seen on a seal impression from Susa (Pittman 1992). The scene carries a narrative of conflict and also ties the struggle for power with religious institutions: the elaborate temple displays horns that recall the exaggerated wild goat horns previously depicted on ceramics, and the figure to the far left has often been called a “priest-king,” based on his frequent presence in material from Uruk in Mesopotamia. Finally, the master of animals figure seen at Susa at the end of the fifth millennium BCE also makes an appearance on a seal impression at Choga Mish (cf. figure 4.3). Here the figure is now holding two sets of two entwined snakes and lacks the horns springing from his head; the stance is nonetheless clearly resonant. Each of these examples demonstrates that continuity with the imagery of previous periods is sustained, even though the iconography associated with religious practice and belief is becoming more intricately woven into the hierarchies of political and economic activities." <sup id="cite_ref-207" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-207">[207]</a></sup>
