</p><p><b> ♠ Peak Date  ♣ 983 CE ♥ </b> The reign of Adud al-Duala from his take over of the Baghdad arm of the state, to his death. The Daylam state was nearly unified under one leader . Adud al-Duala was the first to term himself Shahanshah, King of Kings. <sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p><p>"Buyid history can be chronologically divided, roughly, into two divisions. The first half-century, up to the death of Adud al-Dawla, greatest of the Buyid rulers, in 372/983, is one of growth and consolidation when the political initiative was firmly in the hands of the princes of the ruling dynasty. From that point, however, the Buyids were on the defensive, especially in Iraq and central Iran, and political initiative passed to the hands of groups of soldiers and administrators who strove to manipulate their nominal rulers in their own interests." <sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>
</p><p>Adud al-Dawla's "rule in Fars was something of a golden age for the province as Adud al-Dawla made it the basis for his imperial schemes and, realizingthat the prosperity of the area was fundamental to his plans, took active steps to encourage both agriculture and trade."<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>

<p><b> ♠ Duration  ♣ 932-1062 CE ♥ </b> 932 CE is the probable date of 'Ali b. Būya's capture of the town of Karaj. It was the first of the areas of land that he conquered. From this town he was able to expand to regional control, by taking Fars; then to much greater control of large areas of Iraq and Iran. <sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>
</p><p>The Buyid State was plagued throughout it's existence by succession battles. After the death of 'Adud al-Duala, a fight for the succession took place. Abu Kalijar managed to bring unification back again briefly, but his unexpected death led to further disintegration of the Daylam state, at which point foreign powers began to conquer areas of Daylam land. The empire diminished until in 1062 the Daylam heartland of Shīrāz was taken by the Saljuqs. <sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ confederated state ♥ </b> The Daylam State existed in a kind of military feudal system. The Dailamites were natural warriors and a military hierarchy had emerged which was used to rule the people under Buyid control. 'Ali b.Būya took confiscated land and gave it to his generals in lieu of payment. This system had a hereditary element.
</p><p>The power system was further complicated by 'Ali b. Būya appointing his brothers as kings of areas of the empire. Rukn al-Daula ruled Isfahāhan and Ray. His coins suggest that he was sole ruler in this area since they contain only his name and the caliphs. Mu'izz al-Daula, the youngest brother, was placed in command of Buyid interests in Khūzistān, but only as a representative of 'Ali b. Būya. His coins contain his brother's name, as well as his own and the caliphs. Therefore, there existed a partially independent, partially hierarchical kingship system within the Daylam State. <sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>
</p><p>Furthermore, there existed the Caliphate in Baghdad. The Caliphate were considered religious leaders chosen by God to rule the Islamic world. They had political power by nature of their religious power. 'Ali b. Būya did not seek to overthrow the 'Abbāsid Calliph at Baghdad; instead he treated with him to gain recognition as viceroy, although he never paid the agreed tribute. <sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> Since the Buyid dynasty was in control of Baghdad it has been suggested the the calliph were the pawns of the Buyids. <sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> There continued to be several exchanges between the caliph and the ruler of the Daylam state to establish the state of power throughout the Buyid dynasty. <sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>
</p><p>Once 'Adud al-Daula had unified the Empire it existed as a confederated state with one ruler and was governed by a network of Buyid princes and other tribal leaders. There were also a number of vassal states which ruled themselves, though acknowledged the overlordship of the Buyids. <sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ alliance ♥ </b>
</p><p>Daylamites were foot soldiers but "a purely Daylamite army was not really effective since they had to find allies, usually Turks, sometimes Kurds, who could provide the cavalry to make a balanced fighting unit."<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>
</p><p>"Marriage links were an important way of consolidating alliances and links through the female line were more important than in much of Islamic society. This was especially true in the Buyid kingdom of Rayy, where traditional Daylamite customs seem to have been less affected by Islamic norms than in Fars or Iraq."<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>

<p>The Buyid dynasty originated from Shahrud Valley in northwestern Iran. Ali b. Buya, a soldier in the Abbasid state, began taking territory by forced after being removed from his position as administrator of Karaj. By 934 CE, he had reached Fars. <sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> In 945 CE the Buyids claimed Baghdad and Basra creating for themselves a stable base of power in Mesopotamia.<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup>
</p><p>The Buyid ruler was known as an amir or shahanshah, the latter "more a recognition of seniority within the family than an office with authority".<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup> The Buyids were essentially a provincial military aristocracy with an army composed partly of Daylamite infantry and slave Turkish cavalry. The regiments of the Buyid Princes often fought one another while the central government increasingly became ineffectual. "The Buyid state was divided into several appanages, of which Shiraz and Baghdad were the most important, each held by a different member of the family."<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup>
</p><p>In theory the Buyid amirs were governors under the Abbasid caliph who remained in Baghdad with powers to appoint religious officials,<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> and continued to be symbolically important (in Iraq) appearing on coinage and grants of land. Although Baghdad was the most important political, economic  and religious center, whose amir's chief secretary of the bureaucracy was formally granted the title of vizier<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup>, Fars was the heartland of the empire, with all civil servants being drawn from there.<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup> The Buyids replaced previous established bureaucratic families with Christians, Jews, and Zoroastrians.
</p><p>The Buyids paid their military using iqta holdings whereby "in lieu of salary an amir would be granted the right to collect the taxes of a given area. An iqta could thus vary in size from a whole province to much smaller subdivision, to a single town or village." However, "Under the Buyids, this system was widely credited with economic disaster, as absentee amirs sought to reap the swiftest possible profits before their iqta was removed them."<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup>

<dl><dd> "They left the caliphs in position as titular heads of state, reorganized them as the chiefs of all Sunni Muslims, conceded their right to make appointments to religious offices, and accepted the idea that their own right to make appointments to religious offices was based on caliphal recognition. The sermon at Friday prayers, government coinage, and (in Iraq) even grants of land and appointments to offices referenced the names of the caliphs. Although it was deprived of actual administrative and military power, this allowed the caliphate to mobilize the support of the Sunni population of Baghdad and to retain an important role in Baghdadi politics."<sup id="cite_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-73">[73]</a></sup></dd>

</p><p><b>Description of the Ritual System</b>
</p><p>The Buyids had an interesting ritual system derived from their political structure. The Buyid kings were Shi'i and they did act in a way which suggests they followed their sect seriously, for example they re-established the shrines of the Immams in Baghdad. However, the population they ruled over was distinctly split, with only half Shi'i. Furthermore, they allowed the Sunni Caliph to continue it's rule over the Buyid people (with various levels of authority that fluctuated throughout the duration of the polity) and it seems that the Caliph's name was read out at prayers. Despite the separate religious authority, the rituals coded in this property are Shi'i because that was the religion of the rulers.<sup id="cite_ref-241" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-241">[241]</a></sup>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Hajj ♥</b> "In the pilgrimage to Mecca, the hajj, ancient Arab rites have been taken over and spiritualized. The pilgrimage is performed during the last lunar month, Dhu'l­hijja. People who come to Arabia at other times can perform the lesser pilgrimage, umra, which consists mainly of the circumambulation of the Ka'ba and the running between two hillocks called Safa and Marwa. Pilgrimage to a sacred place requires a ritual consecration. Thus, at a certain distance from Mecca the men, with shaven heads, put on a special garment, ihram, consisting of two white unsewn pieces of cloth that cover their whole body; women put on a covering garment. Pilgrims greet the sacred precincts with the call labbaika, "Here I am at Thy service!" The rites that have to be performed include the sevenfold circumambulation of the Ka'ba (where one tries to kiss the black stone in its southeastern corner) and a sevenfold running between Safa and Marwa, which are now connected by covered arcades. But the central rite is the "staying" on the hill 'Arafat*, a distance of some eight miles from Mecca, on the ninth day of the month. There, sermons are given, and on the way back the 'stoning of Satan' is performed by casting seven pebbles three times at a certain place. After that, on the tenth day of the month, each pilgrim slaughters a sheep or larger animal in Mina. Those staying home do the same. This part of the ritual commemorates the day when Abraham was ordered to sacrifice his son Isma'il, whose place was then taken by a ram. After the Feast of Offering the pilgrim can return from the sacred state, ihram, into the normal state, when the cutting of hair and nails, as well as sex, are again permitted. Killing any creatures inside the sacred area is considered a major sin. The pilgrimage should be performed only when the pilgrim is in good health and can undertake the journey without major difficulties, especially without incurring debts; this shows the realistic approach of Islam to religious practice. In former centuries the pilgrimage was a dangerous undertaking for those who came from distant lands, whether they traveled overland in the caravans which started, with great pomp, in Cairo or Baghdad, or sailed from India or Malaysia on fragile boats. (Air travel is not always very safe either.) Yet modern Muslims sometimes express the view that these slow, arduous journeys prepared them better for the great event than the brief trip by air, which barely leaves leisure to meditate on the experience of visiting the center of their religion. On their return the pilgrims bring a vessel filled with wholesome water from the well Zamzam, from which Hagar once drank. They are received by their families with pride and joy, and are called Hajji. Those who die during the pilgrimage are regarded as martyrs, shahid, "witness" for their faith. Doubtlessly the meeting of people from all parts of the world in Mecca and their common worship at the central sanctuary of Islam does much to strengthen the feeling of unity among Muslims. Through the centuries many scholars and pious people extended their stay in Mecca and exchanged their religious views with colleagues from other parts of the world. The sojourn near the Ka'ba inspired important theological and mystical works: the comprehensive commentary on the Koran by Zamakhshari (called by the honorific title Jar Allah, "God's neighbor" due to his prolonged stay in Mecca) grew out of the author's stay in Mecca. Even more evident is the influence of the Meccan experience on the most comprehensive work of Islamic theosophy, the Futuhat al­makkiyya, of Ibn 'Arabi, which was "revealed" to the author while he was circumambulating the Ka'ba. Furthermore, it is important to remember that almost all reform movements in the fringe areas of the Islamic world were triggered off by the pilgrimage. Faithful believers from Bengal and Nigeria, from Morocco and Central Asia, who had lived for some time in Mecca and exchanged their views with others who, like them, had experienced what seemed to be the 'true Arabic Islam', returned to their Page 39countries to fight the numerous indigenous superstitions and customs which had infiltrated the Islam of the masses and which now appeared to them like remnants of ancient paganism."<sup id="cite_ref-242" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-242">[242]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Friday prayer ♥</b> "The Friday prayer is a duty of the community; it contains a short sermon, khutba*, which consists of two parts. It gives some advice usually based on the Koran or the hadith, and a prayer for the ruler of the government. To be mentioned in the khutba meant to be the legitimate ruler. Women rarely attend the Friday prayer but prefer to pray at home.The daily prayers are explained in the Koran as acts of humility and adoration. At the end of the prayer the Muslim can mention his/her personal requests. While traveling or in war or under duress, one can perform the noon and afternoon or sunset and night prayers together. One also has numerous opportunities to perform additional prayers of two or more rak'a each, e.g., during solar or lunar eclipses; when performing the rain prayer; when entering or leaving the house or the mosque—in short, some pious Muslims use every opportunity to perform a brief salat. The belief in the purifying power of ritual prayer is intense; the Prophet compared it to a stream of water that washes off sins five times a day. The performance of the prayer at the prescribed time constitutes ideally a means of educating Muslims to punctuality, cleanliness, and, since there is no ranking in the mosque, equal participation in the life of the community. Prayer can also lead to ecstatic experiences, and when one observes a praying Muslim who is oblivious of everything around him and seems to have drawn himself, as it were, out of this world to stand humbly before the Lord, one realizes best whence Islam derives its vital strength.To perform the salat, a clean spot suffices, be it in the fields, in the train, or in one's shop or office. A small prayer rug guarantees the cleanliness of the place. However, even in the Prophet's lifetime a place for congregational worship was established, called masjid, "the place where one prostrates" (hence the word Mosque). The great mosque, where the Friday prayer is held and which was found in each quarter, is called jami'*, "the gathering [mosque]."Mainly in the eastern part of the Islamic world, one finds small open prayer places called musalla*, and for the gathering of large congregations at the two 'id*, the end of Ramadan and the Feast of Offerings, one sometimes uses an 'idgah*, a vast enclosure with a prayer niche."<sup id="cite_ref-281" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-281">[281]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Nowruz ♥</b> "Of Persian origin, Nawruz (No Roz; new day), the ancient Iranian festival of the New Year, survived the Arab conquest and continued to be celebrated in Islamic lands many centuries thereafter. Originally the first day of the Persian solar year, it corresponded with the spring vernal equinox, and the duration of its celebration was six days. Medieval Islamic sources give various (folkloric) explanations for the origins of Nawruz, which involve the mythical Persian Jamshid or the biblical patriarchs Abraham and King Solomon. No Roz was the day to wear new clothes and serve food of the new season. People used to rise early in the morning, go to wells and streams, draw water in vases, and pour it over them- selves or sprinkle it on each other. Explanations for these customs varied, from considering them a good omen and a means to ward off harm to the cleansing of the smoke off of those attending the rituals of the fire of the preceding winter nights. Shi‘i explanation of the significance of Nawruz, which is ascribed to the Imam Ja‘far al-Sadiq, sees in it the day of God’s primal covenant with mankind, the day of the first rising of the sun, the day of the defeat of the Antichrist, and the day of a number of other important events." <sup id="cite_ref-355" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-355">[355]</a></sup> "Yāqut reports (Boldān, Cairo, VI, p. 258; cf. Moqaddasi, p. 431) that the Buyid (see BUYIDS) ruler ʿAżod-al-Dawla (r. 949-83) customarily welcomed Nowruz in a majestic hall, wherein servants had placed gold and silver plates and vases full of fruit and colorful flowers. He sat on a costly seat (masnad), and the court astronomer came forward, kissed the ground, and congratulated him on the arrival of the New Year. Then the king summoned the musicians and singers and invited his boon companions.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Ashura ♥</b> "The earliest reliable account of the performance of public mourning rituals which in any way resemble what we now call Muharram processions (especially with a political connotation) concerns an event which took place in 963 during the reign of Mu'izz al-Dawla, the Buyid ruler of southern Iran and Iraq. The Buyid rulers, who were themselves Shi'is, promoted this practice partly in order to enhance their religious legitimacy and to strengthen the sense of Shi'i identity in and around Baghdad. [...] The famous fourteenth-century Arab historian, Ibn Kathir states that: 'On the tenth of Muharram this year [AH 352], Mu'izz al-Dawla Ibn Buwayh, may God disgrace him, ordered that the markets be closed, and that women should wear coarse woolen hair-cloth, and that they should go into the markets with their faces uncovered/unveiled and their hair dishevelled, beating their faces and wailing over Hussein Ibn Abi Talib. The people of the Sunna could not prevent this spectacle because of the Shi'a's large numbers and their increasing power (zuhur), and because the sultan was on their side.'" <sup id="cite_ref-395" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-395">[395]</a></sup> "For the next year Ibn Kathir includes an entry stating, 'On the tenth of Muharram this year the Shi'a celebrated the 'aza’ (mourning) of Husayn as they did the year before. The Shi'is and Sunnis fought violently among each other on this day, and much property was looted.' Over the next several years, similar entries for the Muharram ceremonies appear, with the author making note of increasing tensions and violence until the end of the Buyid regime and the rise of the Saljuqs. Ten years later, he includes a remarkable entry describing the Muharram procession for that year, which he describes as a 'despicable innovation.' It seems that the religious symbolism of Karbala began to have an effect on even the Sunnis of Baghdad, such that they began to adopt a set of religious symbols of their own, resulting in a twisted historical re-creation of the early civil wars. In his entry for the year 363/973 Ibn Kathir states, 'In this year on Ashura, the despicable innovation was celebrated according to the custom of the Shi'is. A great riot broke out between the Sunnis and the Shi'is, both parties being of little intelligence. A group of Sunnis placed a woman on a camel and called her 'A’ishah, and someone took the name Talhah, and someone took the name Zubayr, and they said “We are going out to fight the followers of 'Ali!” Many people on both sides were killed.' This is not only a remarkable historical reference indicating the level to which the Ashura procession had developed under the Buyids but also an indication of its use as a symbol of the Shi'is’ communal identity as distinct from that of the Sunnis. Moreover, this particular reference shows how such developments made the Sunni community defensive of its own identity and also reveals an increasingly dangerous dichotomy of symbolic representation with lethal consequences." <sup id="cite_ref-396" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-396">[396]</a></sup></dd>

</p><p><b>♠ Description of the Normative Ideology ♣  ♥</b> It is worth noting that, for the most part, the differences between Sunni and Shi'i Islam do not affect the variables we are interested in. "The central distinguishing theological feature of Shi‘ism is the belief in rational divine justice. Contrary to the dominant Sunni position that God’s actions and commands define the nature of justice, the Shi'a contend that God is just in a manner that humans can rationally understand. This has a number of practical consequences. First and foremost, it necessitates (i) free will, because God cannot justly punish humans for actions that He compels them to perform, and (ii) an explanation for evil that does not implicate God. Second, it permits the inclusion of reason (unconnected to revealed texts) among the sources of Islamic law. This is an outcome of the belief that humans are capable of distinguishing justice from tyranny and right from wrong without recourse to revelation. Third, rational divine justice has two implications for the Imamate: (i) God acts with a necessary kindness and grace (lutf ) toward human beings because He is invested in their living successful and upright lives. This being the case, He provides continual guidance in the form of prophets and Imams. (ii) God prefers justice on Earth, which allows for (or even requires) an activist agenda that legitimizes the overthrow of a tyrannical ruler under the leadership of a qualified Imam. These three consequences of rational divine justice contrast sharply with Sunnı beliefs and clearly demarcate the boundary between the two communities. The next chapter turns to perhaps the institution most closely associated with Shiiism, the Imamate." <sup id="cite_ref-458" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-458">[458]</a></sup> "Every Shi'i group holds that ‘Al ̄ı was the legitimate successor to the Prophet based on either a formal or an informal designation. According to the Shi'a, 'Ali was not merely the rightful political head of the community but also wielded spiritual authority. He was an Imam as conceived of in the Qur'anic verses that open this chapter, guaranteeing that the community would not be led astray and providing divinely inspired leadership. [...] The historical basis for the Shi'i institution of the Imamate stems from a belief in the special qualities and role of 'Ali. A number of Muslims claimed a distinctive charismatic bond (walaya) with 'Ali during his lifetime that transcended simple loyalty or political support. In time, this veneration grew to include 'Ali's larger household and (eventually) a select number of his lineal descendants. As the heirs of the charismatic mantle of both 'Ali and the Prophet, these descendants became focal points for both Shi'i political aspirations and popular piety." <sup id="cite_ref-459" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-459">[459]</a></sup> It is possible that Buyid normative ideology included pre-Islamic elements, but it seems that one should not overestimate their importance. Moreover, no source could be found that specifically draws attention to these elements, in a way that would make it possible to code them. Overall, then, it seems safest to simply code this polity as most other Islamic ones. "The Buyid amirate is said to have been the most important exponent of the so­-called Iranian interlude in Islamic history, which separated the period of Arab ascendancy from the ensuing times of Turkish predominance. There are in the sources a few traces of old Iranian traditions, but it is difficult to determine whether they represent survivals or renewals. For example, many Buyids had Iranian names, but it is not known whether they reflect the superficial pene­tration of Islam in their homeland or a more conscious adherence to older ways. The same is true of the use of the Iranian calendar (for examples, see Helal Sabe', Ta'rik, pp. 371, 388) and of the observance of Iranian feast days, which had never been entirely given up. To what extent did the Buyid amirs revive the ancient Iranian tradition of government and statesmanship, and how close did they keep to Islamic ideals? There is no clear answer to these two questions; however, after a careful study of the sources the conclusion seems appropriate that one should not overestimate the Iranian leanings of the Buyids. First of all they were military leaders, who took part in the struggle for power and wealth going on all over the disintegrating ʿAbbasid empire, and they played their game according to the rules which were valid in those days. Of course they must have been aware of the stories praising the glorious past of Iran, and by propagating the Iranian tradition the Buyids would enhance their prestige with their compatriots; however, since they had become involved in the troublesome affairs of Iraq, it would not have been wise to overemphasize their Iranian charac­ter, which was not very popular with the common Iraqis. Furthermore we do not have any evidence that the Buyid amirs were deliberately giving their demeanor an Iranian style. They just wanted a benefit in the field of politics from claiming descent from the Sasanian kings. [...] Generally speaking the Buyids were convinced that in the society of those days, which even in Iran had been permeated by Islamic ideals and values, they had to act in accordance with these ideals and values. It was due to this conviction that they asked the ['Abbasid] caliph to legitimate their reign when it had grown into a political factor of supra-regional importance. By no means could they rely exclusively on the somewhat vague Iranian tradition they did not shrink from exploiting for their benefit, to be sure, but they knew that they needed Islamic legitimation most of all. [...] There is no reason to define the Buyid amirate as Iranian, as opposed to Islamic in some way or other." <sup id="cite_ref-460" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-460">[460]</a></sup>

<dd> <b>♠ Ideological thought equates men and women ♣ [present; absent] ♥</b> “Both supporters and critics of Islam turn to the Qur'an, sunna, and Islamic law to justify their claims about Islam's stance towards women. For more than a millennium, differing interpretive traditions have employed these sources to address and settle disagreements over issues.//As with Judaism and Christianity, gender is an inherent aspect of God's plan for humanity from the first humans. However, unlike her Judeo-Christian counterpart, the Qur'anic Eve (unnamed in the Qur'an, but identified as Hawwa' in later sources) is not responsible for tempting Adam into eating the forbidden fruit, which results in their expulsion; they are equally responsible. Furthermore, Islam does not have a doctrine of original sin; Adam and Eve's punishment does not extend to future generations, nor is Eve's role explicitly linked to future women—though medieval scholars, such as al-Tabari, have argued that Eve was solely culpable and that her role reveals women's deficiencies (Stowasser, 1994).//The Qur'an explicitly states that men and women have equal religious responsibility before God and that male and female believers will be rewarded equally (33:35, 40:8). However, in other realms they have differentiated roles and rights. In some cases women have lesser positions than men. For example, two women's testimonies are equivalent to that of a single man (2:282), men have authority over their wives and may discipline them in the case of disobedience (nushuz, 4:34), women typically inherit less than male relatives (4:7-20), and polygamy is permitted under certain circumstances (4:3). However, the Qur'an provides some protections explicitly for women. For example, a bride directly receives the dower (mahr, 4:4), husbands are required to provide maintenance (nafaqa) for their wives (2:233), and husbands should treat their wives kindly (4:19).//Contemporary feminist scholars, particularly Fatima Mernissi (1991), have been critical of the treatment of women in the hadith literature, especially when stripped of its historical context. Mernissi argues that much of the hadith literature stands in contrast to the equality of the Qur'an and the experience of Muhammad's wives, and therefore the authenticity and chains of transmission of certain ahadith, such as the hijab and injunctions against women's political leadership, must be re-examined. Leila Ahmed (1992) undertakes such an explanation, contextualizing the relation between religion and gender in space and across time.//The interpretation and application of the Qur'an and sunna in legal matters is dependent upon a variety of factors, including the legal school, particulars of a given case, and the socio-historical context. While there is a measure of consensus between the four major Sunni schools of jurisprudence, they vary on particulars ranging from a wife's potential recourses if her husband is unable to provide her maintenance to what constitutes equitable treatment in a polygamous marriage. An important distinction between the Sunni schools of jurisprudence and Ithna 'Ashari (Twelver) Shiism is the former's explicit rejection of temporary marriage (mut'ah). In analyzing whether women are disadvantaged in comparison to men in Islamic law, Judith Tucker (2008) concludes that women's status varies substantially between issues. While women have less freedom than men to independently initiate marriage or divorce, Islamic law largely guarantees the property rights of both married and unmarried women and imposes safeguards in the case of divorce.//A key issue in Islamic exegesis is how much of Qur'anic and hadith material relates specifically to Muhammad's wives (Mothers of the Believers, Ummahat al-Mu'minun) and how much can be generalized as normative practice for all Muslim women. For example, the Qur'an indicates the special status of Muhammad's wives (33:32), and they were under certain restrictions such as not remarrying after Muhammad's death (33:52), stipulations that were not obviously applicable to other Muslim women. Another issue revolves around veiling, concerning the exact manner in which women should dress and whether veiling was a requirement of all Muslim women or merely Muhammad's wives. [...]Ahmed (1991) argues that the rise of the Abbasid dynasty, influenced by Persian and Byzantine practices, represented a decisive turning point for gender equality in public life. Among elite families, the seclusion of women and concubinage became increasingly common.” <sup id="cite_ref-471" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-471">[471]</a></sup></dd>

Mernissi argues that much of the hadith literature stands in contrast to the equality of the Qur'an and the experience of Muhammad's wives, and therefore the authenticity and chains of transmission of certain ahadith, such as the hijab and injunctions against women's political leadership, must be re-examined. Leila Ahmed (1992) undertakes such an explanation, contextualizing the relation between religion and gender in space and across time.//The interpretation and application of the Qur'an and sunna in legal matters is dependent upon a variety of factors, including the legal school, particulars of a given case, and the socio-historical context. While there is a measure of consensus between the four major Sunni schools of jurisprudence, they vary on particulars ranging from a wife's potential recourses if her husband is unable to provide her maintenance to what constitutes equitable treatment in a polygamous marriage. An important distinction between the Sunni schools of jurisprudence and Ithna 'Ashari (Twelver) Shiism is the former's explicit rejection of temporary marriage (mut'ah). In analyzing whether women are disadvantaged in comparison to men in Islamic law, Judith Tucker (2008) concludes that women's status varies substantially between issues. While women have less freedom than men to independently initiate marriage or divorce, Islamic law largely guarantees the property rights of both married and unmarried women and imposes safeguards in the case of divorce.//A key issue in Islamic exegesis is how much of Qur'anic and hadith material relates specifically to Muhammad's wives (Mothers of the Believers, Ummahat al-Mu'minun) and how much can be generalized as normative practice for all Muslim women. For example, the Qur'an indicates the special status of Muhammad's wives (33:32), and they were under certain restrictions such as not remarrying after Muhammad's death (33:52), stipulations that were not obviously applicable to other Muslim women. Another issue revolves around veiling, concerning the exact manner in which women should dress and whether veiling was a requirement of all Muslim women or merely Muhammad's wives. [...]Ahmed (1991) argues that the rise of the Abbasid dynasty, influenced by Persian and Byzantine practices, represented a decisive turning point for gender equality in public life. Among elite families, the seclusion of women and concubinage became increasingly common.” <sup id="cite_ref-476" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-476">[476]</a></sup></dd>

[...] In the history of Islam, the first religious waqf was the mosque of Quba' in Medina. It was built upon the arrival of the Prophet Muhammad in 622. Six months later it was followed by the Mosque of the Prophet in the center of Medina. Mosques, as well as real estate that provides revenues for mosque maintenance and expenses, are in the category of religious waqf.//Philanthropic waqf aims at supporting the poor segments of society and the public interest of the community by funding such institutions as hospitals, orphanages, nursing homes, libraries, scientific research, education, public services, and care of animals and the environment. There are alsoawqaf for interest-free loans to small businesses and for maintenance of parks, roads, bridges, and dams. This started during the time of the Prophet Muhammad. On advice from the Prophet, 'Uthman, a well-to-do Companion, bought the Well of Rumah and made it into waqf, to provide everybody with free drinking water. This was followed by the waqf of 'Umar.

Often that violence was a response to efforts by early Muslims to curtail pre-Islamic forms of violence. Throughout human history, societal violence has been as prevalent as military violence, and in early seventh-century Arabia one finds numerous forms of societal violence. These included, for instance, female infanticide, along with the abuse of orphans, the poor, and marginal. Against such forms of societal violence, the revelations mediated through Muhammad were clear, incontrovertible challenges to the social order of tribal Mecca. For instance, they prohibit the pre-Islamic Arabian practice of female infanticide as well as other bodily and social abuses through directives set down, transmitted, and encoded in the Qur’an." <sup id="cite_ref-500" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-500">[500]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Official cult forbids human sacrifice universally ♣ inferred present ♥ </b> "“Our” present religions, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, sometimes called Abrahamic religions, have the theme of human sacrifice right at their inception, with the founding father, Abraham. We are accustomed to the story, which remains a text of “terror and trembling,” as Kierkegaard put it. Abraham is commanded by god to “sacrifice” his only son Isaac, and he is willing to do so (Gen. 22). The Hebrew term for this sacrifice is colah, “make to rise upwards,” as fire and smoke rise to heaven;10 the action is to cut the throat with a knife and to burn the corpse on wood—the knife and wood expressly mentioned in the text. The human victim must be fettered in order to receive the deadly cut. Abraham does obey his god’s command, without even an attempt at protest. The text enjoys the paradox: “the son that you love”; “and the two walked together” (Gen. 22.1-19: 2; 8). In Muslim tradition, the place where Abraham “bound” his son is the rock on the temple hill of Jerusalem, which, since Khalif Omar, is covered by the “temple dome” with its golden cupola. Of course, an angel stops Abraham’s action at the last moment, pointing to an animal for sacrifice. The text says God was “testing” (nissah) Abraham, and his submissive obedience is highly rewarded. The text also states that god accepted the ram “instead of” (tachath) Isaac. One way to discard the terror of the story is to introduce a perspective of historical progress: God was replacing human sacrifice by animal sacrifice. This could be termed an advance in civilization. The Islamic interpretation comes close to this interpretation, as it makes this a founding myth for el eid." <sup id="cite_ref-501" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-501">[501]</a></sup></dd></dl>

"Give to the near of kin their due, and also the destitute and the wayfarer, and do not squander your substance wastefully.... But if you turn away from them (the needy), because you are still waiting for your Lord's bounty that you are expecting, then (at least) speak to them a kind word. Do not tie your hand to your neck (do not be miserly) nor stretch it without any restraint (do not be extravagant) for then you should sit down rebuked, denuded (17:23- 9)." <sup id="cite_ref-523" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-523">[523]</a></sup> "Charitableness, helpfulness, helping one's kith and kin, concern for neighbours, assisting the weak and oppressed, and nursing the sick are all activities that are highly valued in Islamic ethics." <sup id="cite_ref-524" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-524">[524]</a></sup> "The third pillar is almsgiving, obligatory charity or welfare money for the poor (zakat). For most purposes, this involves the payment each year of two and a half per cent of one's capital or accumulated wealth and assets, excluding such items as primary residence, car and professional tools. Only certain people are qualified to receive obligatory charity. There are, of course, other forms of charity over and above the obligatory zakat, which can be donated to such recipients as seem appropriate.//Islam stands for brotherhood and social justice and it asserts that the poor and the needy have rights to the wealth of the rich. Payment of almsgiving represents the duty to care for the community's social welfare. It is a great sin not to share one's wealth with the needy and to let them suffer from hunger and disease. Zakat is a duty enjoined by God and undertaken by Muslims in the interest of society as a whole. However, it is also of humanitarian and socio-political value as well as being motivated by spiritual and moral concerns. It is an effective instrument for cultivating the spirit of social responsibility on the part of the contributor and the feeling of security and belonging on the part of the recipient. The Qur'an says 'Those who spend their wealth by night and day, in private and public shall be rewarded by their Lord. No fear shall come upon them, neither shall they grieve' (2:274)." <sup id="cite_ref-525" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-525">[525]</a></sup> "Charity does not consist merely of offering help to the needy; rather it includes anything one does which is of good to others. A hadith of the Prophet mentions that charity includes removing thorns from the road and smiling at one's brother. And open-handedness in spending and giving are to be practised not only towards the poor but also towards one's family, relatives, friends, neighbours, guests and even strangers. Generosity and hospitality are thus highly valued qualities among Muslims in every part of the world.

<dd><b>♠ respect for authority ♣ present ♥</b> "Classical Islamic constitutional law was concerned particularly with the issue of the legitimacy of leadership. The historical and legal model was the leadership of the prophet Muhammad. From the Muslim emigration (Hidjra) from Mecca to Medina in 622 - the date which would soon afterwards be fixed as the beginning of the Islamic calendar - onwards he combined the highest secular- judicial and spiritual- religious authority in his person. Later his successor/ representative ( khalifa , 'caliph') would assume this position. Constitutional law usually describes this as the function of an imam, not referring in this instance to the prayer leader in the mosque but to the head of the entire Muslim community. It states that obedience is due to him; not only as a matter of reason but also because law (shar') decrees it. This is often supported by sura 4:59 [4:62]: 'O believers, obey God, and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you (uli l-amr)!' It remains unclear who the last-named are. Classical commentaries name secular rulers (umara' , sultan) as well as religious ahl al-qur'an wa-l-'ilm) or legal scholars (fuqaha').

[...] Traditionally the duty of providing maintenance fell nearly exclusively on men [...].The decision-making competence within the family is closely linked to the duty to provide maintenance: significant neglect in either area is one of the few grounds on which a woman may divorce her husband. [...] Primarily, wives and needy dependent children are entitled on principle; sons until they are of age (meaning legally competent), daughters until they marry and after the husband's death or after a divorce has taken effect and the claim to alimony becomes void.

<dd><b>♠ bravery ♣ present ♥</b> "Beginning with the classical texts on Islamic law a fundamental bipartition of the world was evolved which would remain - with some modifications - the basis of all deliberation until well into the twentieth century. The Islamic territory (dar al-Islam , House of Islam), within which sharia norms were applied, was in opposition to the rest of the world, regarded as fundamentally hostile and lawless, the House of War (dar al-harb). Classical doctrine did not allow lasting peace treaties but only temporary armistices in cases where the Muslim forces were inferior. For the rest, the commitment to expand the faith (jihad) - which the scholars undoubtedly saw as a primarily military enterprise - in the sense of increasing Muslim territory remained the religious duty of a sufficient number of believers (fard kifaya). It was not possible to enact a restriction of jihad, giving it a defensive intention applying only to those countries under non-Muslim rule which were in conflict with Islamic rule. Classical doctrine did not refer to those Quranic verses which express only a defensive attitude against attack, but considered these to have been abrogated by the 'sword verses' in sura 9:29ff. (regarding abrogation cf. 2.1 above). It is probably no coincidence that this doctrine was formulated during the time of military expansion under the Umayyads and the early Abbasids."<sup id="cite_ref-534" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-534">[534]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ respect for property ♣ present ♥</b> "Theft. Traditional Islamic penal ordinances (hudud) distinguish between two kinds: al-sariqah al-sughra (simple theft), requiring amputation of the right hand, and al-sariqah al-kubra, the meaning of which is contested but which requires the amputation of the right hand and left foot. Any amputation is carried out only after stringent evidentiary requirements are satisfied. In the opinion of most jurists, a theft induced by hunger is not subject to amputation. Repeat offenders may be subject to additional amputations and imprisonment. Murder during the commission of theft results in the death penalty. Hudud ordinances are considered primarily deterrant and, due to their strict evidentiary requirements, are rarely invoked." <sup id="cite_ref-535" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-535">[535]</a></sup></dd></dl>
