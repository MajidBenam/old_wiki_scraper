Koymen has added up all those scholars whom the sources say were murdered by the Ghuzz, and his figure of fifty-five is hardly a colossal one.

</p><p><b>♠ Ethnocide ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Our codebook defines "ethnocide" as "A systematic program to replace the culture of the defeated with the culture of the victors." However, sources seem to suggest that even Seljuk rulers who presented themselves as warriors for their faith did so mostly in the interest of propaganda, and there was no true systematic program of eliminating other religious cultures or sects. "Tughrıl’s image as a Sunni ruler was burnished by his proclamation of a persecution (miªna) of various heretical religious groups, launched simultaneously in Baghdad and Nishapur in 445/1053, shortly after Tughrıl’s receipt of titles from the caliph. The symbolic intent of the miªna is underlined by the fact it does not seem to have been implemented anywhere else. In 447/1054, the Türkmen raided Ahwaz and, on Tughrıl’s instructions, occupied Khuzistan,149 on the eastern borders of Arab Iraq. Tughrıl then himself advanced to Khuzistan, claiming that he intended to perform the pilgrimage to Mecca and to lead an expedition against the Fatimids of Egypt – another piece of propaganda designed to emphasise his credentials as a legitimate Muslim ruler, for the Sunni world regarded the Ismaili Fatimids as heretics. It seems few were convinced, for rumours of an impending Seljuk invasion racked Baghdad. In the event, al-Basasiri fled, and Tughrıl entered the city peacefully in Ramadan 447/December 1055, welcomed by a splendid procession of local notables."<sup id="cite_ref-375" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-375">[375]</a></sup> "With his dual victories over Christendom at Ani and Manzikert, it is not surprising that both Muslim and Christian sources portray Alp Arslan as a religiously motivated warrior for Islam. Matthew of Edessa, for instance, describes him as ‘the venomous serpent of the Persians’, and in phrases reminiscent of Aristakes calls him ‘the instrument of divine wrath’ who ‘spread the flaming fire of death to all the Christian faithful and filled all Armenia with blood, the sword and enslavement’. Matthew records how, on the conquest of Ani, the great silver cross on the cathedral was taken and placed on the entrance to the mosque of Nakhchivan for believers to step on in contempt. Sibt b. al- Jawzi mentions similar stories of the desecration of crosses,190 suggesting a policy of deliberately stressing the jihad element of these campaigns. [...] In reality, like Tughrıl, Alp Arslan had his price: Matthew of Edessa also relates how the Armenian king of Kars managed to buy off Alp Arslan’s threatened attack by offering vassalage, cash and a lavish banquet."<sup id="cite_ref-376" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-376">[376]</a></sup>

</p><p>Amongst the military operations' against the Batiniyya, the capture of Shahdiz near Isfahan and that of Khanlanjan in 500/1107 brought the sultan much prestige; despite the fact that some of the defenders escaped to Kuhistan and to other fortresses in Fars, Ahmad b.

</p><p>Qizil-Arslan now claimed the sultanate for himself, assuming the appropriate style and privileges; but in the next year he was mysteriously murdered, possibly by one of his own amirs, possibly by Inanch Khatun, whom Qizil-Arslan had married on his brother's death. Toghril's subsequent execution of Inanch Khatun may point to the second alternative. After two years' incarceration, Toghril was released by one of the amirs of Azarbaijan. Near Qazvin he speedily defeated Inanch Khatun's two sons, Qutlugh-Inanch and the Amir-Amiran 'Umar, and drove them into Azarbaijan (588/1192). There they were again defeated, this time by their half-brother Abu Bakr who was then at Nakhchivan, but they later returned with help from Georgia and Arran and defeated Abu Bakr. Toghril was now master of Jibal, Hamadan, and Isfahan, and he had also secured the treasuries left by Pahlavan.

</p><p><b>Description of the Ritual System</b>
</p><p>The Seljuq empire was an Islamic-Persian one. It seems that they combined both Islamic ritual and traditional Persian ritual, such as the Iranian New Year festival of Nowruz which originated as a Zoroastrian festival. It is probable that the Zoroastrian rituals became homogenised with Iran and became seen as a secular Iranian festival rather than a Zoroastrian festival.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Hajj ♥</b> "In the pilgrimage to Mecca, the hajj, ancient Arab rites have been taken over and spiritualized. The pilgrimage is performed during the last lunar month, Dhu'l­hijja. People who come to Arabia at other times can perform the lesser pilgrimage, umra, which consists mainly of the circumambulation of the Ka'ba and the running between two hillocks called Safa and Marwa. Pilgrimage to a sacred place requires a ritual consecration. Thus, at a certain distance from Mecca the men, with shaven heads, put on a special garment, ihram, consisting of two white unsewn pieces of cloth that cover their whole body; women put on a covering garment. Pilgrims greet the sacred precincts with the call labbaika, "Here I am at Thy service!" The rites that have to be performed include the sevenfold circumambulation of the Ka'ba (where one tries to kiss the black stone in its southeastern corner) and a sevenfold running between Safa and Marwa, which are now connected by covered arcades. But the central rite is the "staying" on the hill 'Arafat*, a distance of some eight miles from Mecca, on the ninth day of the month. There, sermons are given, and on the way back the 'stoning of Satan' is performed by casting seven pebbles three times at a certain place. After that, on the tenth day of the month, each pilgrim slaughters a sheep or larger animal in Mina. Those staying home do the same. This part of the ritual commemorates the day when Abraham was ordered to sacrifice his son Isma'il, whose place was then taken by a ram. After the Feast of Offering the pilgrim can return from the sacred state, ihram, into the normal state, when the cutting of hair and nails, as well as sex, are again permitted. Killing any creatures inside the sacred area is considered a major sin. The pilgrimage should be performed only when the pilgrim is in good health and can undertake the journey without major difficulties, especially without incurring debts; this shows the realistic approach of Islam to religious practice. In former centuries the pilgrimage was a dangerous undertaking for those who came from distant lands, whether they traveled overland in the caravans which started, with great pomp, in Cairo or Baghdad, or sailed from India or Malaysia on fragile boats. (Air travel is not always very safe either.) Yet modern Muslims sometimes express the view that these slow, arduous journeys prepared them better for the great event than the brief trip by air, which barely leaves leisure to meditate on the experience of visiting the center of their religion. On their return the pilgrims bring a vessel filled with wholesome water from the well Zamzam, from which Hagar once drank. They are received by their families with pride and joy, and are called Hajji. Those who die during the pilgrimage are regarded as martyrs, shahid, "witness" for their faith. Doubtlessly the meeting of people from all parts of the world in Mecca and their common worship at the central sanctuary of Islam does much to strengthen the feeling of unity among Muslims. Through the centuries many scholars and pious people extended their stay in Mecca and exchanged their religious views with colleagues from other parts of the world. The sojourn near the Ka'ba inspired important theological and mystical works: the comprehensive commentary on the Koran by Zamakhshari (called by the honorific title Jar Allah, "God's neighbor" due to his prolonged stay in Mecca) grew out of the author's stay in Mecca. Even more evident is the influence of the Meccan experience on the most comprehensive work of Islamic theosophy, the Futuhat al­makkiyya, of Ibn 'Arabi, which was "revealed" to the author while he was circumambulating the Ka'ba. Furthermore, it is important to remember that almost all reform movements in the fringe areas of the Islamic world were triggered off by the pilgrimage. Faithful believers from Bengal and Nigeria, from Morocco and Central Asia, who had lived for some time in Mecca and exchanged their views with others who, like them, had experienced what seemed to be the 'true Arabic Islam', returned to their Page 39countries to fight the numerous indigenous superstitions and customs which had infiltrated the Islam of the masses and which now appeared to them like remnants of ancient paganism."<sup id="cite_ref-379" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-379">[379]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Friday prayer ♥</b> "The Friday prayer is a duty of the community; it contains a short sermon, khutba*, which consists of two parts. It gives some advice usually based on the Koran or the hadith, and a prayer for the ruler of the government. To be mentioned in the khutba meant to be the legitimate ruler. Women rarely attend the Friday prayer but prefer to pray at home.The daily prayers are explained in the Koran as acts of humility and adoration. At the end of the prayer the Muslim can mention his/her personal requests. While traveling or in war or under duress, one can perform the noon and afternoon or sunset and night prayers together. One also has numerous opportunities to perform additional prayers of two or more rak'a each, e.g., during solar or lunar eclipses; when performing the rain prayer; when entering or leaving the house or the mosque—in short, some pious Muslims use every opportunity to perform a brief salat. The belief in the purifying power of ritual prayer is intense; the Prophet compared it to a stream of water that washes off sins five times a day. The performance of the prayer at the prescribed time constitutes ideally a means of educating Muslims to punctuality, cleanliness, and, since there is no ranking in the mosque, equal participation in the life of the community. Prayer can also lead to ecstatic experiences, and when one observes a praying Muslim who is oblivious of everything around him and seems to have drawn himself, as it were, out of this world to stand humbly before the Lord, one realizes best whence Islam derives its vital strength.To perform the salat, a clean spot suffices, be it in the fields, in the train, or in one's shop or office. A small prayer rug guarantees the cleanliness of the place. However, even in the Prophet's lifetime a place for congregational worship was established, called masjid, "the place where one prostrates" (hence the word Mosque). The great mosque, where the Friday prayer is held and which was found in each quarter, is called jami'*, "the gathering [mosque]."Mainly in the eastern part of the Islamic world, one finds small open prayer places called musalla*, and for the gathering of large congregations at the two 'id*, the end of Ramadan and the Feast of Offerings, one sometimes uses an 'idgah*, a vast enclosure with a prayer niche."<sup id="cite_ref-418" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-418">[418]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Nowruz ♥</b> Though no sources were found describing specifically how Nowruz was celebrated under the Seljuqids, it is very likely that this was the most euphoric ritual celebrated in this polity, since it was very popular throughout the medieval Islamic world, particularly in polities influenced by Persian culture. "Of Persian origin, Nawruz (No Roz; new day), the ancient Iranian festival of the New Year, survived the Arab conquest and continued to be celebrated in Islamic lands many centuries thereafter. Originally the first day of the Persian solar year, it corresponded with the spring vernal equinox, and the duration of its celebration was six days. Medieval Islamic sources give various (folkloric) explanations for the origins of Nawruz, which involve the mythical Persian Jamshid or the biblical patriarchs Abraham and King Solomon. No Roz was the day to wear new clothes and serve food of the new season. People used to rise early in the morning, go to wells and streams, draw water in vases, and pour it over them- selves or sprinkle it on each other. Explanations for these customs varied, from considering them a good omen and a means to ward off harm to the cleansing of the smoke off of those attending the rituals of the fire of the preceding winter nights. Shi‘i explanation of the significance of Nawruz, which is ascribed to the Imam Ja‘far al-Sadiq, sees in it the day of God’s primal covenant with mankind, the day of the first rising of the sun, the day of the defeat of the Antichrist, and the day of a number of other important events." <sup id="cite_ref-492" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-492">[492]</a></sup> The festival involved feasting, visiting relatives, exchanging gifts, music, dancing, singing, and various forms of entertainment <sup id="cite_ref-493" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-493">[493]</a></sup>.</dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Arafat wuquf ♥</b> The key ritual within the wider sequence of rituals that makes up the Hajj. “On the morning of the ninth, [pilgrims] proceed towards ‘Arafat, a plain 14.5km (nine miles) from Mina, where the central rite of the Hajj, wuquf (standing) on ‘Arafat, takes place between noon and sunset, during which time many heartfelt prayers are offered. The scene reminds Muslims of the gathering on the Day of Judgement. If any pilgrim misses this event, his/her Hajj is not valid and has to be done again another year. This does not apply to any other rite, all of which can be done over a longer period or compensated for with an offering. This is the time for the pilgrims to read the Qur’an, glorify God and pray most earnestly for forgiveness and everything else they wish for. Particularly recommended for glorification and repetition is this prayer, ‘There is no God but Allah alone, with no partner. Dominion and praise belong to Him, who gives life and death. Goodness is in His hands and He has power over everything.’ This just gives a succinct summary of the Islamic faith and connects the individual pilgrim to what Ibrahim and Muhammad brought and uttered. Pilgrims normally face towards the Ka‘ba while reciting these prayers, as they do for the five daily prayers, believing that, by doing this, their prayers are more likely to be accepted.” <sup id="cite_ref-534" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-534">[534]</a></sup>. This ritual is coded here as dysphoric due to the fact that pilgrims are required to stand for several hours (between noon and sunset) under the sun’s heat. A contemporary account, dating to 1997, notes that the “heat is virtually unbearable” <sup id="cite_ref-535" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-535">[535]</a></sup>. However, it is worth noting that, due to peculiarities of the Islamic calendar, this ritual may sometimes be performed at a time of the year when the temperature is less hot than at other times, and when there are fewer others between noon and sunset than at other times. Moreover, a few informal online sources suggest that those who cannot stand in the sun for the duration of the ritual are allowed to be in the shade and/or sit down. Still, though relatively mild, this appears to be the most dysphoric ritual within Sunni Islam.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ yearly ♥</b> The main acts of the Hajj take place in the twelfth month of the Islamic calendar <sup id="cite_ref-536" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-536">[536]</a></sup>.</dd>

<dd><b>♠ human sacrifice of an out-group member ♣ absent ♥</b> [Text from sacrifice codings by Agathe] No source could be found that explicitly states Islam’s condemnation of human sacrifice. However, the fact that no source could be found that even ‘’mentions’’ human sacrifice in connection with Islam (beyond the occasional lurid, and dubious, tabloid headline), combined with the fact that a lot of information is available on the beliefs and practices underlining this religion, strongly suggests that human sacrifice is not part of the Islamic ritual repertoire. ““Our” present religions, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, sometimes called Abrahamic religions, have the theme of human sacrifice right at their inception, with the founding father, Abraham. We are accustomed to the story, which remains a text of “terror and trembling,” as Kierkegaard put it. Abraham is commanded by god to “sacrifice” his only son Isaac, and he is willing to do so (Gen. 22). The Hebrew term for this sacrifice is colah, “make to rise upwards,” as fire and smoke rise to heaven;10 the action is to cut the throat with a knife and to burn the corpse on wood—the knife and wood expressly mentioned in the text. The human victim must be fettered in order to receive the deadly cut. Abraham does obey his god’s command, without even an attempt at protest. The text enjoys the paradox: “the son that you love”; “and the two walked together” (Gen. 22.1-19: 2;. In Muslim tradition, the place where Abraham “bound” his son is the rock on the temple hill of Jerusalem, which, since Khalif Omar, is covered by the “temple dome” with its golden cupola. Of course, an angel stops Abraham’s action at the last moment, pointing to an animal for sacrifice. The text says God was “testing” (nissah) Abraham, and his submissive obedience is highly rewarded. The text also states that god accepted the ram “instead of” (tachath) Isaac. One way to discard the terror of the story is to introduce a perspective of historical progress: God was replacing human sacrifice by animal sacrifice. This could be termed an advance in civilization. The Islamic interpretation comes close to this interpretation, as it makes this a founding myth for el eid.”</dd></dl></dd></dl>

In fact, originally, waqf donations involved immovable properties only: they constitituted private donations that were meant to guarantee a source of income devoted to the benefits of the community (i.e. by financing the construction and maintenance of mosques, madrasas, hospitals, fountains, etc.). The extension of this system to movable properties would have affected the perpetual nature of the deed and could have also lead to its exploitation for profit. However, soon the need to entrust books to certain institutions (in particular mosques and madrasas) as perpetual donations from private benefactors pushed the law to extend the waqf system to books as well, in different ways: by writing on the book the name of the donor and his intention to donate it to a certain institution; by writing on the book the names of the witnesses to the transaction from private to donated property; or by compiling an inventory of books, if the donation consisted of several books, at a religious court. If the library itself (including the building) was founded by waqf donations, provisions for maintaining a librarian and other personnel were usually stated in the foundation deed, together with the list of endowed furniture, books, and other materials for the library."<sup id="cite_ref-822" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-822">[822]</a></sup>

</p><p><b>♠ Description of the Normative Ideology ♣  ♥</b> "The Seljuqs were, for much of history, remarkably successful in propagating the view of themselves as Sunni heroes: generous supporters of Sunni religious scholarship, staunch champions of the Abbasid caliphs, and indefatigable defenders of Islam against heresy, heretics and Infidels. Their success in project- ing this image is reflected in the medieval historiography; the Tārikh-i guzida, for instance, after enumerating the flaws of every Muslim dynasty from the Umayyads through the Khwarazmshahs, asseverates: 'But the Seljuqs were free of these defects: they were Sunni, and of pure religion and good beliefs . . .'" <sup id="cite_ref-896" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-896">[896]</a></sup> "During the late 5th/11th and 6th/12th centuries - a period often called the Sunni revival - a mainstream Sunni camp was emerging in the Islamic Near East. In their effort to end the religious ferment of the late classical period, Muslim scholars (the 'ulama') and others combined to delimit a commonly accepted form of Islam, eliminate various sources of contention within the Islamic community, and set up the tone in the public sphere based on the Sunna and the Shari'a. [...] As a major scene in the crystallisation of the madhhabs and the development of the madrasa in its ‘mature’ form, Seljuq Baghdad figured prominently in the Sunnisation process." <sup id="cite_ref-897" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-897">[897]</a></sup>

<dd> <b>♠ Ideological thought equates men and women ♣ [present; absent] ♥</b> “Both supporters and critics of Islam turn to the Qur'an, sunna, and Islamic law to justify their claims about Islam's stance towards women. For more than a millennium, differing interpretive traditions have employed these sources to address and settle disagreements over issues.//As with Judaism and Christianity, gender is an inherent aspect of God's plan for humanity from the first humans. However, unlike her Judeo-Christian counterpart, the Qur'anic Eve (unnamed in the Qur'an, but identified as Hawwa' in later sources) is not responsible for tempting Adam into eating the forbidden fruit, which results in their expulsion; they are equally responsible. Furthermore, Islam does not have a doctrine of original sin; Adam and Eve's punishment does not extend to future generations, nor is Eve's role explicitly linked to future women—though medieval scholars, such as al-Tabari, have argued that Eve was solely culpable and that her role reveals women's deficiencies (Stowasser, 1994).//The Qur'an explicitly states that men and women have equal religious responsibility before God and that male and female believers will be rewarded equally (33:35, 40:8). However, in other realms they have differentiated roles and rights. In some cases women have lesser positions than men. For example, two women's testimonies are equivalent to that of a single man (2:282), men have authority over their wives and may discipline them in the case of disobedience (nushuz, 4:34), women typically inherit less than male relatives (4:7-20), and polygamy is permitted under certain circumstances (4:3). However, the Qur'an provides some protections explicitly for women. For example, a bride directly receives the dower (mahr, 4:4), husbands are required to provide maintenance (nafaqa) for their wives (2:233), and husbands should treat their wives kindly (4:19).//Contemporary feminist scholars, particularly Fatima Mernissi (1991), have been critical of the treatment of women in the hadith literature, especially when stripped of its historical context. Mernissi argues that much of the hadith literature stands in contrast to the equality of the Qur'an and the experience of Muhammad's wives, and therefore the authenticity and chains of transmission of certain ahadith, such as the hijab and injunctions against women's political leadership, must be re-examined. Leila Ahmed (1992) undertakes such an explanation, contextualizing the relation between religion and gender in space and across time.//The interpretation and application of the Qur'an and sunna in legal matters is dependent upon a variety of factors, including the legal school, particulars of a given case, and the socio-historical context. While there is a measure of consensus between the four major Sunni schools of jurisprudence, they vary on particulars ranging from a wife's potential recourses if her husband is unable to provide her maintenance to what constitutes equitable treatment in a polygamous marriage. An important distinction between the Sunni schools of jurisprudence and Ithna 'Ashari (Twelver) Shiism is the former's explicit rejection of temporary marriage (mut'ah). In analyzing whether women are disadvantaged in comparison to men in Islamic law, Judith Tucker (2008) concludes that women's status varies substantially between issues. While women have less freedom than men to independently initiate marriage or divorce, Islamic law largely guarantees the property rights of both married and unmarried women and imposes safeguards in the case of divorce.//A key issue in Islamic exegesis is how much of Qur'anic and hadith material relates specifically to Muhammad's wives (Mothers of the Believers, Ummahat al-Mu'minun) and how much can be generalized as normative practice for all Muslim women. For example, the Qur'an indicates the special status of Muhammad's wives (33:32), and they were under certain restrictions such as not remarrying after Muhammad's death (33:52), stipulations that were not obviously applicable to other Muslim women. Another issue revolves around veiling, concerning the exact manner in which women should dress and whether veiling was a requirement of all Muslim women or merely Muhammad's wives. [...]Ahmed (1991) argues that the rise of the Abbasid dynasty, influenced by Persian and Byzantine practices, represented a decisive turning point for gender equality in public life.

Six months later it was followed by the Mosque of the Prophet in the center of Medina. Mosques, as well as real estate that provides revenues for mosque maintenance and expenses, are in the category of religious waqf.//Philanthropic waqf aims at supporting the poor segments of society and the public interest of the community by funding such institutions as hospitals, orphanages, nursing homes, libraries, scientific research, education, public services, and care of animals and the environment.

</p><p><b>♠ Human sacrifice ♣ 0 ♥</b> "“Our” present religions, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, sometimes called Abrahamic religions, have the theme of human sacrifice right at their inception, with the founding father, Abraham. We are accustomed to the story, which remains a text of “terror and trembling,” as Kierkegaard put it. Abraham is commanded by god to “sacrifice” his only son Isaac, and he is willing to do so (Gen. 22). The Hebrew term for this sacrifice is colah, “make to rise upwards,” as fire and smoke rise to heaven;10 the action is to cut the throat with a knife and to burn the corpse on wood—the knife and wood expressly mentioned in the text. The human victim must be fettered in order to receive the deadly cut. Abraham does obey his god’s command, without even an attempt at protest. The text enjoys the paradox: “the son that you love”; “and the two walked together” (Gen. 22.1-19: 2; 8). In Muslim tradition, the place where Abraham “bound” his son is the rock on the temple hill of Jerusalem, which, since Khalif Omar, is covered by the “temple dome” with its golden cupola. Of course, an angel stops Abraham’s action at the last moment, pointing to an animal for sacrifice. The text says God was “testing” (nissah) Abraham, and his submissive obedience is highly rewarded. The text also states that god accepted the ram “instead of” (tachath) Isaac. One way to discard the terror of the story is to introduce a perspective of historical progress: God was replacing human sacrifice by animal sacrifice. This could be termed an advance in civilization. The Islamic interpretation comes close to this interpretation, as it makes this a founding myth for el eid." <sup id="cite_ref-930" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-930">[930]</a></sup>

For most purposes, this involves the payment each year of two and a half per cent of one's capital or accumulated wealth and assets, excluding such items as primary residence, car and professional tools. Only certain people are qualified to receive obligatory charity. There are, of course, other forms of charity over and above the obligatory zakat, which can be donated to such recipients as seem appropriate.//Islam stands for brotherhood and social justice and it asserts that the poor and the needy have rights to the wealth of the rich. Payment of almsgiving represents the duty to care for the community's social welfare. It is a great sin not to share one's wealth with the needy and to let them suffer from hunger and disease. Zakat is a duty enjoined by God and undertaken by Muslims in the interest of society as a whole. However, it is also of humanitarian and socio-political value as well as being motivated by spiritual and moral concerns. It is an effective instrument for cultivating the spirit of social responsibility on the part of the contributor and the feeling of security and belonging on the part of the recipient. The Qur'an says 'Those who spend their wealth by night and day, in private and public shall be rewarded by their Lord. No fear shall come upon them, neither shall they grieve' (2:274)." <sup id="cite_ref-966" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-966">[966]</a></sup> "Charity does not consist merely of offering help to the needy; rather it includes anything one does which is of good to others.

The historical and legal model was the leadership of the prophet Muhammad. From the Muslim emigration (Hidjra) from Mecca to Medina in 622 - the date which would soon afterwards be fixed as the beginning of the Islamic calendar - onwards he combined the highest secular- judicial and spiritual- religious authority in his person. Later his successor/ representative ( khalifa , 'caliph') would assume this position. Constitutional law usually describes this as the function of an imam, not referring in this instance to the prayer leader in the mosque but to the head of the entire Muslim community. It states that obedience is due to him; not only as a matter of reason but also because law (shar') decrees it. This is often supported by sura 4:59 [4:62]: 'O believers, obey God, and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you (uli l-amr)!' It remains unclear who the last-named are. Classical commentaries name secular rulers (umara' , sultan) as well as religious ahl al-qur'an wa-l-'ilm) or legal scholars (fuqaha').

The Islamic territory (dar al-Islam , House of Islam), within which sharia norms were applied, was in opposition to the rest of the world, regarded as fundamentally hostile and lawless, the House of War (dar al-harb). Classical doctrine did not allow lasting peace treaties but only temporary armistices in cases where the Muslim forces were inferior. For the rest, the commitment to expand the faith (jihad) - which the scholars undoubtedly saw as a primarily military enterprise - in the sense of increasing Muslim territory remained the religious duty of a sufficient number of believers (fard kifaya). It was not possible to enact a restriction of jihad, giving it a defensive intention applying only to those countries under non-Muslim rule which were in conflict with Islamic rule. Classical doctrine did not refer to those Quranic verses which express only a defensive attitude against attack, but considered these to have been abrogated by the 'sword verses' in sura 9:29ff. (regarding abrogation cf. 2.1 above). It is probably no coincidence that this doctrine was formulated during the time of military expansion under the Umayyads and the early Abbasids."<sup id="cite_ref-975" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-975">[975]</a></sup></dd>
