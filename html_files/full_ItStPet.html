<b> ♠ Religious levels ♣ 5 ♥ </b> levels.
</p><p>At time of Concordat of Worms (1122 CE). "Now the clergy were organized in a hierarchical line under the direction of the pope, who could trump the power of local custom, tradition, and even episcopal power. Below the pope stood the bishop. Responsible for maintaining clerical discipline and for overseeing the property of the church, he was answerable only to the pope. Only he could perform all the sacraments; he alone performed the sacrament of confirmation and by the sacrament of ordination passed on his power to others. Theoretically, canon law held that he would be elected by the clergy and people of his diocese. In practice, he was elected only by the canon priests attached to the cathedral. Considered high clergy, the canons aided the bishop in furthering his agenda, administering the diocese and performing rituals at the cathedral church. At their head was the dean, the highest officer in the diocese. A diocesian chancellor supervised the cathedral school and issued licenses allowing clerics to teach and preach in the diocese. A treasurer oversaw finances, while a precentor managed the choir and organized the cathedral's musical program. Each diocese was divided into administrative districts, over which presided the archdeacons. Practically, these were powerful men; they were the bishop's legates, charged with enforcing discipline among the lower clergy, and therefore they were often quite unpopular. ... The parish priests were answerable to them."<sup id="cite_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-76">[76]</a></sup>

</p><p>What happened to castella troops?
</p>
<dl><dd> Just prior to this period Emperor Maurice "resorted to the policy of applying the defence system of the frontier zones [castella settlements] to the whole of Italy, threatened as it was by the Lombards. ... The setting up of these catella led to an agrarian revolution in Italy. ... To establish castella and military settlers meant dividing up these large estates. The method adopted was expropriation without compensation, but the soldiers stationed in the castellum were granted land in the form of an emphyteunsis, that is, hereditary lease. The actual ownership of the land remained with the proprietors and the soldiers had to pay them a fixed annual rent in return. This relationship with the landowners meant that the garrison of the castellum did not form an independent community, for the castellum was established on private property. ... The development of this relationship between the soldiers and the landed proprietors, based on leasehold, was of extreme importance for the West. Under Germanic influence the nature of the emphyteusis began to change and what had been a Roman legal concept now turned into a relationship of vassalage. The relation between soldier and landed proprietor, which from the Roman point of view was regarded as a private contract, began to be interpreted as a relation between lord and vassal. ... the two largest landlords in imperial Italy, the Pope and the archbishop of Ravenna, now became territorial rulers. In the case of the papacy this situtation was given legal validity by the Franks, so that the Pope was at least de jure ruler of the land of which he had formerly been proprietor." <sup id="cite_ref-148" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-148">[148]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ pilgrimage ♥</b> Pilgrimage was the largest-scale collective ritual during this period, although mass pilgrimage to Rome would become more frequent later in the Middle Ages. Pilgrims to Rome would visit the city's shrines, basilicas, and the catacombs of the Roman-era Christians. Graffitti evidence indicates that Anglo-Saxons were visiting Rome's ritual sites as early as 700.<sup id="cite_ref-172" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-172">[172]</a></sup> "Pilgrimages to the eternal city were never unpopular in the Middle Ages, although pilgrims were particularly numerous in certain periods. These pious journeys were in vogue between the eighth and mid-ninth centuries, when the route was relatively safe because of Frankish control of roads. [...] "Rome's greatest attractions were its extensive array of churches and the relics of saints they contained (see also Basilica of St John Lateran). The persecutions and martyrdoms of Christians that occurred in or were associated with Rome ensured its success as a goal for later Christian believers, who prized martyrdom (see alsoMartyrs) and wished to venerate the relics of martyrs for the faith. The relics of saints Peter and Paul were the primary aims of most pilgrims. These two figures became associated in the popular mind, and shared the same feast day (29 June). For this reason, a trip to Rome became known from the fifth century as a visit ad limina apostolorum ("to the thresholds of the Apostles"). Starting in the eighth century, Rome became known as a center for penitential pilgrimage, through which serious sins like homicide could be expiated. Some pilgrims petitioned directly to the pope to have their confessions heard and their sins forgiven. [...] "Pilgrims who went to Rome came from every corner of Western and Eastern Europe, and ranged from rulers (see also Royal Pilgrims) to paupers, encompassing laity, clergy, and the religious. They journeyed on the ancient roads that traversed the Italian peninsula; the well-traveled Via Francigena was a confluence of such paths. Trips to Rome presented particular challenges. A pilgrim approaching from the north would find the Alps impassable in the winter; and the city was infamous for malaria in the summer. The churches of Rome were spread out and some located in virtually deserted areas. Women pilgrims were barred from certain shrines starting in the fifteenth century, and possibly earlier. "[...]. "The problems posed by large crowds of pilgrims thronging to see important relics in Rome led to the construction of annular crypts in some churches, starting with St Peter. These permitted a large number of pilgrims to file by in an orderly fashion. Pilgrims could lower into the tombs cloths, which would touch the relics and retain the aura of the saint's holiness. The crowds of pilgrims also led to the creation of galleries for the overflow of pilgrims. "[...] "Medieval travelers, no less than modern ones, employed written guidebooks to orient them to the many churches in the eternal city. These range widely from simple lists of churches to visit to more extensive descriptions of the items churches contained and information on other sites in the city. Notable among these are the sixth-century Cymiteria totius urbis Romanae; the seventh-century guides Notitia ecclesiarum urbis Romae, De locis sanctis martyrum, and papyri from the cathedral treasury of Monza; the eighth-century Einsiedeln itinerary; the twelfth-century Mirabilia urbis Romae, which was wildly popular and frequently translated and augmented; the Itinerarium Malmesburiense, which was incorporated in the twelfth-century Gesta regum Anglorum of William of Malmesbury; and John Capgrave's The Solace of Pilgrims, written ca. 1451. "The popes had major roles in promoting pilgrimage to the city. They led frequent and dramatic liturgies (see also Liturgy and Pilgrimage) at different churches, which regularly attracted pilgrims. The pontiffs established xenodochia, institutions designed to host them and care for their needs. The popes were the primary benefactors of the churches of Rome, granting them gifts and seeing to their maintenance. "Foreign colonies of various northern European groups that would admit pilgrims of their nationality known as scolae existed near St Peter between the eighth and twelfth century. By the thirteenth century, a greater number of private establishments had grown up for pilgrims. "Pilgrimages had a considerable economic impact on the city of Rome, between alms and fees for food and lodging. While Romans did not normally sell relics, they peddled oil that had been near tombs, and from the twelfth century on, tokens with Peter and Paul and later the Veronica, imitations of the Veronica, and wax discs with the Lamb of God. "While in Rome, pilgrims learned much about the Roman culture and cult, and brought Roman books, souvenirs, liturgies, architecture, iconography, the worship of certain saints, and reverence for the pope back to their homelands." <sup id="cite_ref-173" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-173">[173]</a></sup></dd>

"Nowhere is this popular religious enthusiasm amongst pilgrims better illustrated than in an account written by Suger, abbot of St Denis (d.1151), describing the crowds of pilgrims who were accustomed to gather at the abbey on feast days 'to seek the intercession of the saints' and 'to worship and kiss the holy relics, the Nail and the Crown'. The numbers of pilgrims were so great that not all were able to gain access to the church, whilst those inside were so tightly packed that they were unable to move. Suger described the agony of many women, who were caught in the crush and were so distressed that they cried out in pain as though in labour, whilst more were trampled underfoot. Such was the density of the crowd that often discomfort or impatience seems to have led to anger and rioting, forcing the monks displaying the relics to escape with them through the windows of the church." <sup id="cite_ref-186" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-186">[186]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ baptism ♥</b> Baptism was the fundamental rite of initiation into Christianity going back to Augustine's time, but changed substantially during the early medieval period. The theology behind the ritual changed considerably; during this period there was not the emphasis that would later be placed on the need for children to be baptized to avoid damnation or consignment to Limbo.<sup id="cite_ref-212" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-212">[212]</a></sup> As Thompson phrased it, during the Middle Ages, "Christians were made, not born." He is speaking of the thirteenth century, but the point extends back to the period under discussion.<sup id="cite_ref-213" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-213">[213]</a></sup> Baptismal churches (<i>pievi</i>) were not yet in place during this period, so baptisms presumably happened at the closest <i>Duomo</i>, the mother-church of major settlements (such as the church of San Vitale in Ravenna). The ritual made natural-born children into Christians. So central to the cult was baptism that, in extreme situations, lay people could baptize children, especially if the child was in immediate danger of death. Baptism forgave sin, original or that done by the person in question.<sup id="cite_ref-214" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-214">[214]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ weekly ♥</b> RA’s inference. baptisms during this period were public events held either in the Duomo, the cathedral of sizeable towns (such as Orvieto or Perugia, in the Papal State) or in parish churches (such as the parish churches of the city of Rome).<sup id="cite_ref-215" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-215">[215]</a></sup> The fundamental duty of the parish priest, besides saying mass, was baptism of newborns in his parish, the <i>pieve,</i> and the centers for local religious life and administration were the <i>pievi.</i> Pirillo is speaking of Florentine Tuscany, but by the late twelfth century, nearly all of Christendom, and certainly all of the Papal State, was organized into parishes.<sup id="cite_ref-216" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-216">[216]</a></sup> I should note, however, that the parish system was still in its infancy during this period, and the parish system seems to have been a late development in Italy compared to Germany and France.<sup id="cite_ref-217" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-217">[217]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ once in a lifetime ♥</b> For the ritual of baptism, "participants" denotes godparents, who were supposed to lift the child from the baptismal font, and were tasked with instructing the child in the basics of Christianity, in particular teaching them the fundamental prayers of the <i>Credo</i> and <i>Pater Noster.</i><sup id="cite_ref-218" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-218">[218]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ mass ♥</b> The Mass was the fundamental ritual of Christianity; indeed, as Arnold as argued, "...in whatever form, the mass can be seen as a key ritual in the production of medieval community...."<sup id="cite_ref-256" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-256">[256]</a></sup> There were many varieties of masses, varying in frequency and nature depending on the community involved. Monasteries and convents held several masses a day, in particular masses for the dead.<sup id="cite_ref-257" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-257">[257]</a></sup> Parish priests were supposed to say one mass daily, but it is unclear whether this was common, especially during this period, which predates the general establishment of parish churches in localities. High mass was rare, most likely restricted to high holidays such as Christmas; the laity were only expected to attend mass on Sundays, and even this was not asserted as a fundamental part of orthodox Christianity until a  later period.<sup id="cite_ref-258" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-258">[258]</a></sup> A rough description of a typical mass is as follows. The priest read out a psalm on the nature of original sin, followed by hymns on Sundays. Then the priest read from the Gospel, and prepared the bread and wine for the Eucharist (at this point, the laity would give any offerings they had for the collection box). This description is from (Arnold)<sup id="cite_ref-259" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-259">[259]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-260" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-260">[260]</a></sup> The priest then passed the Pax, an object with the crucifix on it, around and the laity kissed it.<sup id="cite_ref-261" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-261">[261]</a></sup> This seems to have taken the place of Communion on days when the laity did not participate in it; mass then ended. Monastic masses and special liturgical masses would have been slightly different, but these were the main elements. NOTE: Most Christians-in fact, probably the vast majority, during this period-did not attend mass on anything approaching a regular basis, perhaps at all.<sup id="cite_ref-262" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-262">[262]</a></sup> Urban people, in particular those in Rome, probably attended church more regularly than, say, those in the remote Appenines, but this is no more than a reasonable hypothesis for this period. I would also like to note the serious paucity of sources, and thus of secondary scholarship, on the early medieval mass in Italy: we simply do not know very much about lived religion in early medieval Europe, and especially in Italy.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ daily ♥</b> Parish priests were in theory required to say mass daily, but it is almost impossible to know how stringently this was obeyed.<sup id="cite_ref-263" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-263">[263]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ daily ♥</b> Swanson, writing of the period after 1215, has noted that "How it [the Mass] fits into a liturgical round is not easily considered, for masses were celebrated with almost mind-boggling regularity and in incaluclable quantities...."<sup id="cite_ref-264" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-264">[264]</a></sup> This was true also of the tenth through the twelfth centuries; while monasteries offered liturgical masses for the dead daily, and as the tenth century went on, this became one of their main functions, especially those reformed by the Cluniacs. For a description of liturgical masses for the dead. <sup id="cite_ref-265" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-265">[265]</a></sup> "Participant" thus reflects, here, monks praying for the dead while not officiating the Mass itself.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ weekly ♥</b> Defining "audience" as the laity not taking communion (regulations on which only appeared after 1215), the laity were required to attend mass once a week on Sundays.<sup id="cite_ref-266" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-266">[266]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b>♠ Typical size of participating group ♣ [80-120] ♥</b> This is a very rough estimate; getting at the typical size of a participating group would require a drastic limiting of the pool of said group (i.e., are we talking about Rome? Ravenna? Or a tiny parish such as, borrowing from Tuscany, the tiny parish of San Gavino degli Adimari, which contained even in 1347 maybe 100 people?). See (Klapisch-Zuber &amp; Herlihy) for a good discussion of the difficulties involved in determining the size of medieval settlements; their source is the Florentine Catasto of 1427, easily the most detailed demographic record that survives for medieval Europe.<sup id="cite_ref-268" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-268">[268]</a></sup> The number of 100 is based on an average-sized medieval settlement with, perhaps, 20 or 30 households/hearths (<i>fuochi</i>). It is even more hypothetical because if there were 100 people in a given settlement, one can reasonably guess that not all of these 100 people attended Mass regularly.</dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ medieval duel ♥</b> Two rituals, here, have equal claim to the title of "most dysphoric collective ritual" of Merovingian France: trial by combat and the duel of chivalry. Because, from a Seshat perspective, they are extremely similar to one another in terms of variables, both shall be coded. At a future date, it might be good to choose one over the other, but this shouldn't make a significant difference. "Trial by combat as a judicial method of settling differences between men began in Europe in the Dark Ages. It is thought that Gundobald, King of Burgundy, was the first ruling prince to introduce it, in about 501 AD. Edward Gibbon explained the trial by combat thus: 'Both in civil and in criminal proceedings, the plaintiff, or accuser, the defendant, or even the witness, were exposed to mortal challenge from the antagonist who was destitute of legal proofs; and it was incumbent on them either to desert their cause or publicly to maintain their honour in the lists of battle.' "According to Gibbon, Gundobald justified the introduction of the trial by combat with the question: 'Is it not true that the event of national wars and private combats is directed by the judgement of God: and that his providence awards victory to the juster cause?' The belief that trial by combat will reveal a just settlement between the contending parties by the operation of God's will underpins the medieval faith in the practice. Force of arms provide an answer, unclouded by false witnesses or fabricated evidence. Gibbons continues, caustically: 'By such prevailing arguments, the absurd and cruel practice of judicial duels, which had been peculiar to some tribes of Germany, was propagated and established in all the monarchies of Europe, from Sicily to the Baltic.' "Gundobald's law allowed for a duel if the accused persisted in denying the offence under oath and the accuser insisted on proof by force of arms. This remained the essence of trial by combat wherever in Europe it formed part of the judicial process. "[...] Established, as we have seen, in Burgundy, trial by combat soon spread to the rest of France, taking root in the Frankish kingdom and elsewhere. "[...]"The judicial combat, whether in France, Italy or England, was, in essence, the same. It was a public event, sanctioned by the King, openly contested in front of officials, spectators and the monarch on a ground and under conditions that conferred no advantage to either side. The result of the contest was agreed by the parties to be binding. As such it could scarcely more different from the private, illegal and secret encounter that was the modern duel. [...] "As is the case with trial by combat and medieval jousting, the duel of chivalry has obvious claims to be regarded as a precursor of the modern duel. In particular, it existed for the settling of questions touching upon the honour of a knight or a noble. In this respect it is the direct antecedent of the modern duel. However, as with trial by combat, it is distinguished from the modern duel by the fact that it was fight conducted in public with the authority and blessing of the monarch. "As trial by combat developed, so the custom of the parties' employing a champion emerged. A champion was a hired man who fought the trial on his principal's behalf. Although it enabled the principal to avoid the tiresome and dangerous obligation to fight his opponent in the lists, it did not absolve him from the consequences of the result. As one historian puts it, 'As for the principals in a capital fight by proxy, they were kept out of sight of the duel, with a rope round their necks, and the one who was beaten by proxy was immediately hanged in person.'" <sup id="cite_ref-357" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-357">[357]</a></sup></dd>

<p><b>♠ Private property (land) ♣ present ♥</b> Private property existed, but was rare. “That the Roman Church was the largest landholder in Italy, and that is holdings in every district of the Republic far exceeded the possessions of local laymen, is beyond dispute. That the possession of land in the early Middle Ages translated directly into power and influence is also beyond dispute.” <sup id="cite_ref-378" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-378">[378]</a></sup> “In legal terms…ecclesiastical patrimonies and publicly or privately held lands were quite distinct, but in practice certain developments had effected a blurring of the distinctions between them.” <sup id="cite_ref-379" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-379">[379]</a></sup> “It was most desirable to hold land in outright ownership, as this gave the individual powers of totally free alienation; but for most of the Middle Ages such powers were rare, being confined more or less or kings or those associated with kings. Other individuals could and did own land, but they seem mostly to have been invested with powers or property by extended kin group in a loose sort of communal ownership. This pattern was particularly common among the Lombards and was tenacious thereafter in Italy.” <sup id="cite_ref-380" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-380">[380]</a></sup> “The possessor of this property right- the most considerable tenure to which most free males could aspire- was usually expressed as auctor, a term that often seems to have meant ‘alienator’ rather than ‘owner,’ as it confirmed some ability to dispose of land rather than the exclusive right to do so.” <sup id="cite_ref-381" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-381">[381]</a></sup> Land: “‘control’ and ‘ownership’ took many forms- individual, communal, institutional, kin-based feudal- and all these levels could operate around one land parcel at one moment.”  <sup id="cite_ref-382" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-382">[382]</a></sup>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Usufruct ♣ present ♥</b> “The Church had long been in the habit of leasing out its lands.

<dd><b>♠ Exclusivity ♣ inferred present ♥</b>However, Most men were not 'owners' of land and did not have exclusive rights to it. Kleinhenz believes there was a more communal approach to land ownership.

Sometimes a lineage would even hold property, such as a defensive tower, in common.” <sup id="cite_ref-388" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-388">[388]</a></sup>Note: Were Church lands exclusive?</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Partibility ♣ inferred present ♥</b> Because the domuscultae were distinctive in that they were unable to be leased or parceled, we can infer that regular land could be. “The domuscultae were distinctive in several respects. First, Church authorities repeatedly emphasized that they could never be alienated, not even by lease. Second, they marked efforts by popes, at least in some instances, to bring new land under cultivation and to use on that land peasants who were working directly for the Church. Third, the domuscultae had the result of taking certain lands out of emphyteutic circulation. The Church as moving from a bureaucratic system to “Grundherrschaft,” or landed lordship, on at least some of its property.” <sup id="cite_ref-389" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-389">[389]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Lease ♣ present ♥</b>  “The Church had long been in the habit of leasing out its lands.

Why exactly the Church had leased out so much of its land is unclear.” <sup id="cite_ref-391" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-391">[391]</a></sup>
<dl><dd><b>♠ Lease Rights ♣ absent ♥</b> Contracts were used when military aristocracy leased land from the Church. “An additional blurring of the distinction between private and ecclesiastical property resulted from the possession, usually be means of long-term emphyteusis contracts, of substantial tracts of patrimonial land by the military aristocracy. Why exactly the Church had leased out so much of its land is unclear.” <sup id="cite_ref-392" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-392">[392]</a></sup>. "In the case of renting (location) Roman law did not provide a ius in re, a ‘real’ right covering the arrangement, defendable against all with an action in rem relevant to the agreement. The renting of property was viewed rather, in terms of an obligatory relationship and thus defensible only against the grantor (actio in personam). But because stable arrangements of this kind had been normal since the early middle ages, the jurists constructed the locatio ad longum tempus, or long-term lease as a real provision, quite separate from that governing ownership of property. This resulted in the establishment of the dominum utile (from the Roman acito utilis) at some time between the end of the twelfth and beginning of the thirteenth century. It was agreed that were possible a rei vindication utilis (staking a claim to the property in the same way as that granted to the true owner) should apply to a rented dominum." <sup id="cite_ref-393" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-393">[393]</a></sup></dd></dl></dd>

<dd><b>♠ Use of property ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> No mention in sources. Did the Church proscribe use of property for tenants/peasants?</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Property market ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> A property market may have been present in the later Middle Ages, but there is no evidence for one in early medieval Italy. “There are many instances of property being bought and sold by laymen alone. Some historians argued that there was a market in land at given times in given places, especially in the vicinity of the northern cities such as Milan and Pavia during the later Middle Ages. It might be the case that in some places existed a real market in land- land being bought and sold as a commodity- a process which was disrupting traditional tenurial patterns.” <sup id="cite_ref-395" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-395">[395]</a></sup></dd></dl>

"[I]l pater, oltre ad essere capo indiscusso della casa, era infatti dominus assoluto del patrimonio familiare, che si componeva di diversi cespiti, tra i quali la dote, ossia il vero perno della struttura patrimoniale della famiglia. La dote che la donna recava con sé al momento del matrimonio, e con la quale si contribuiva al sostegno degli onera matrimonii, vale a dire il sostentamento giornaliero della stessa famiglia, sarebbe dovuta essere “congrua”, e tale parametro di valutazione veniva calcolato ricorrendo a due coefficienti, quali la qualitas personarum e la quantitas patrimonii, ovvero, la posizione sociale della famiglia d’origine e della famiglia di destinazione e la consistenza del patrimonio paterno. [...] Ma al contrario, nella realtà, spesso la dote rappresentava una misera porzione del patrimonio di famiglia, il più delle volte caratterizzata da una presunta “inofficiosità”, oppure solamente promessa e mai consegnata, dal momento che per difendere il più possibile l’integrità del patrimonio paterno [...] si cercava di eludere l’obbligo di dotare le figlie, o, in alterativa, di contenerne al massimo il quantitativo; spesso finiva per diventare non solo un’anticipazione delle ragioni ereditarie della sposa, ma per costituire tout court la liquidazione di ogni sua pretesa ereditaria. [...] Le norme statutarie nascevano dall’esigenza di comprimere e limitare, per quanto possibile, i diritti di proprietà della donna allo scopo di riservare i patrimoni ai maschi della famiglia ai quali era affidato il mantenimento dell’onore e del decoro della famiglia stessa."<sup id="cite_ref-412" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-412">[412]</a></sup> "[T]he <i>pater</i> [father], in addition to being the undisputed head of the house, was in fact absolute <i>dominus</i> [master] of the family patrimony, which consisted of various assets, including the dowry, that is, the true pivot of the family's patrimonial structure. The dowry a woman brought with her at the time of her marriage, and which was her contribution to the <i>onera matrimonii</i> [marriage burdens], that is to say the daily needs of the family itself, should have been "congruous" [...]. However, in reality, often the dowry represented a minuscule portion of the family patrimony, more often than not characterized by an alleged "inofficiousness", or only promised and never delivered, since to defend the integrity of the family paternal patrimony as much as possible [...] an attempt was made to evade the obligation to endow the daughters, or, alternatively, to limit the quantity as much as possible; often [the dowry] ended up becoming not only an anticipation of the bride's hereditary claims, but the complete liquidation of all hereditary claims. [...]  These statutory norms arose from the wish to compress and limit, as far as possible, the property rights of women in order to reserve the assets to the males of the family who were entrusted with the maintenance of the honor and decorum of the family itself."</dd></dl>

They allow the Jewish recipients to sell from their property to whomever they wish and have permission to buy foreign slaves and sell them in our empire. These were not permits for the slave trade, as has mostly been taken for granted.28 Rather, the leave given to buy and sell slaves caters to a recognized need of Jewish owners to replenish or sell off their body of household slaves as circumstances demand. At the same time, taking into consideration the long-standing ecclesiastical opposition to Jews owning Christian slaves, this license is limited to pagan ones." 186</dd></dl>

<p><b>♠ Proportion of population enslaved ♣ 0-10% ♥</b> Inferred continuity with succeeding period. "In contrast to the export trade, the number of slaves who remained in Italy is easier to estimate. Slaves did not constitute a significant proportion of any urban population in Italy, with the possible exception of Palermo. Henri Bresc estimates that no more than 12% of Sicily’s principle city belonged in the servile category, but, given how small his sample is, it is reasonable to question whether it was really that high. Even in Genoa, whose slave population must have been comparable to Palermo’s, the number of slaves there is thought to have fluctuated between 2 and 5%. The estimates vary between 2–3000 at any time in the 100 years between 1360 and 1460. Slavery in Siena had nearly died out by 1400. While Florence held about 1000 slaves at the end of the fourteenth century, the number had fallen to less than 400 by 1427, with very few households possessing more than one slave. Boni and Delort counted only 200 slaves in Pisa between 1410 and 1434."<sup id="cite_ref-429" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-429">[429]</a></sup> The following quotes and notes were gathered during an initial research phase, but even at the time they were not considered sufficient to confidently quote this variable. They are preserved in the interest of transparency.
</p><p>"Beginning as early as the eighth century, Christian Europe began to tighten restrictions on the enslavement of its own members. Over the course of the ninth century, Carolingian and Venetian rulers made a series of attempts to limit the trade in Christian slaves and captives, drawing up treaties and decrees that sought to stem the flow of Christian slaves from Europe to Islamic territories in 840, 876 and 880. This evidence suggests that slave trading temporarily continued and that there was a persistent push to control it."<sup id="cite_ref-430" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-430">[430]</a></sup>
</p><p>In 960 a Venetian placitum banned the trading of slaves between eastern and central Europe on the Adriatic Sea. This time, with the increased projection of Byzantine naval power in the Mediterranean after 965, the teeth of enforcement soon accompanied the ruling. The strategic conquest of Crete enabled the Byzantine Empire to block slave traffic between the Balkans and the Arab world. Balkan enslavement was still a brisk trade, as the Byzantine Empire produced sufficient demand to consume the non-Christian slaves taken from these lands."<sup id="cite_ref-431" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-431">[431]</a></sup>
</p><p>"As Jeffrey Fynn-Paul argues, the Byzantine empire and its Latin neighbors had declared their own subjects ineligible for slavery; they also sought to prevent the shipment of slaves from European territory to the Islamic world using papal and state decrees."<sup id="cite_ref-432" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-432">[432]</a></sup>

</p><p><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of monogamy ♣ present ♥</b> “The heart of the sacramental argument against real polygamy was that it betrayed the model of marriage between Christ and his church as an exclusive and enduring dyadic union. [...] [Polygamy] was a violation not only of the natural form of marriage, but even more of the supernatural norm which it embodied. For a Christian to pretend to add a second spouse while the rst was still living (with him or her) and to call that new union a marriage was a deliberate insult to Christ’s example and instruction. For a Christian believer or of cial to extend the de nition of marriage to include a second or third concurrent marriage was a deliberate insult to the sacramental symbolism of Christian marriage. It was tantamount to downing a beer and a sandwich and calling that the eucharist, or diving into a pond several times and calling that baptism writ large. This simply could not be. It was not only a “legal impossibility,” as Raymond of Penyafort had put it, echoing Roman law,130 but a grave spiritual offense, too. Medieval writers labeled such misuses of the concept and institution of marriage by Christians as “heresy,” “blasphemy,” and “desecration” - an insult to God and his sacraments. The Council of Trent later called it “heresy” deserving of the church’s “anathema.” “ <sup id="cite_ref-467" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-467">[467]</a></sup>

<p><b>Human sacrifice</b> (HS) is defined as deliberate and ritualized killing of an individual to please or placate supernatural beings. Note that HS is also coded under Rituals; here, however, we address general features of HS not tied to any particular ritual. HS is distinct from capital punishment, even for offenses against religion (e.g., burning of heretics). There are several distinct categories of HS below.

<dd><b>♠ respect for authority ♣ present ♥</b> “Medieval society was hierarchical, not merely in social reality but as a matter of principle. Its hierarchical character was understood in cosmological terms. It was taken for granted that the universe was designed in such a way that some of God’s creatures were intended to be at the topand some below them. Human beings were a ‘higher’ form of being than cattle. Cattle were ‘higher’ than the grass they ate. The grass was ‘higher’ than the earth it grew in. So thoroughgoing was the sense that this was how the universe worked that the nine orders of angels identified by the fifth-century Greek authors Pseudo-Dionysus began to be lined up alongside their human ‘counterparts’ on the understanding that each person’s place in heaven would be related to that of the equivalent angel. So the seraphim and cherubim, the contemplatives among the angels, would be accompanied for eternity by members of the contemplative orders, their human equivalents. In modern terms, this was like suggesting that post-men and motorcycle messengers would spend eternity in the company of ordinary angels, while diplomats and emissaries could expect to find themselves among archangels.//Within human society itself no premium was put upon equality. Until late in the Middle Ages, few appear to have seen anything wrong with the idea that there should be rulers and ruled, for hierarchical arrangements of parts within wholes were a normal way of making an organism ‘work’. A body needs a head but it also needs feet (I Corinthians 12.20). In fragmentary survivals of the teaching which was given in the cathedral school at Laon at the end of the eleventh and the beginning of the twelfth centuries, there is a discussion of the passage in Ephesians 6.5 where servants are told to obey their masters. ‘It is no sin to have a servant or to be a servant.’ It was argued at Laon that there are two reasons why ‘servitude is given by God.’ It may be a punishment for the sins of those who are slaves or servants. Or it may have a purpose of proving or testing them, so that, humbled, they may be better people.” <sup id="cite_ref-510" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-510">[510]</a></sup></dd>

Since marriage was a sacrament, the church claimed exclusive jurisdiction over it, appropriating and expanding the laws of nature (Natural Law) and Scripture as well as some of the rules in the early church constitutions and Christianized Roman law. Comprehensive new laws, called canon laws, were promulgated by the papacy and the church councils and enforced by church courts throughout Western Christendom.//”Consistent with the naturalist perspective on marriage, the church’s canon law punished contraception, abortion, and child abuse as violations of the created functions of propagation and child rearing. It also proscribed unnatural sexual acts, such as sodomy and bestiality. Consistent with the contractual perspective, canon law ensured free consnsual unions by dissolving marriages contracted by mistake or under duress, fraud, or coercion. It also granted husband and wife equal rights to enforce conjugal debts that had been voluntarily assumed and emphasized the importance of mutual love among the couple, their children, and their parents.//”Consistent with the sacramental perspective canon law protcted the sanctity and sanctifying purpose of marriage by declaring valid marital bonds to be indissoluble and by annulling invalid unions between Christians and non-Christians or between parties related by various legal, spiritual, blood, or family ties. It supported celibacy by annulling unconsummated vows of marriage if one party made a vow of chastity and by prohibiting clerics on monastics from marriage and concubinage.//”Earlier Christianized Roman and Germanic laws governing the relationships between husband and wife, and parent and child, were liberally appropriated by the canonists and now enforced in the church courts as well as in the confessional (Confession of Sins). Traditional rules and customs of arranged marriages, patriarchal restrictions on the marital estate, male-dominated inheritance laws and primogeniture, protection of the status of the paterfamilias, and restrictions on the wife’s capacity to sue or be sued, to enter into contracts, to give or receive property of her own—all remained firmly in place in canon law.” <sup id="cite_ref-513" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-513">[513]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ bravery ♣ absent ♥</b> “On the individual level, Augustine counseled nonresistance, hence, nonviolence; he worried that inordinate desires even to preserve one’s own life could arouse sinful dispositions in the individual, which could arouse sinful dispositions in the individual, which could lead further to evil deeds. augustine knew well the horrors of war and the lusts that war itself incites. Yet he also understood the reality of evil in the ‘earthly city’ and the role of the state to confront such evil and render protection (including, in his day, protection of the church). Augustine spoke eloquently of the rueful and necessary duty of statesmen to wage just wars against forces that threatened life and resorted to violence. For augustine, war is always tragic, undertaken out of sorrowful recognition of the injustice that necessitates it and the horrors and cruelty that often attend it (‘’De civ. Dei’’ 19.7).//”What was prohibited for the private individual was permitted for the soldier, who acted in a public capacity; Augustine presumed that a legitimate political authority stood a better chance of restraining inordinate, willful desires, in part by channeling them toward a collectively just civic cause. Augustine contended that God uses political authority in general to achieve minimal levels of order, justice, and peace in the earthly realm. That war could serve as an acceptable means of achieving a peaceful or tranquil order (‘’tranquilitatis ordinis’’) attests to the always limited and imperfect measure of peace and justice one finds on earth; perfect peace and true justice, however, await in the Heavenly City.//”Throughout the Middle Ages, as a further occasions arose for the use of force, theologians, canon lawyers, and political thinkers returned to Augustine, in some cases to deepen, in others to expand, Christian tenets of just war.” <sup id="cite_ref-514" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-514">[514]</a></sup></dd>
