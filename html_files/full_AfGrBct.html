</p><p><b>♠ Religion Genus ♣ Graeco-Bactrian Religions ♥</b> "[T]he descendants of Alexander's settlers, who maintained, to some extent, Greek language and customs in the East, considered themselves to be Greek, and were described as such by their neighbours[...]. The Greekness of Greco-Bactrian and Indo-Greek religion is, however, more difficult to defend. The religious practices of people who asserted, in public discourse, and especially political imagery, a connection with Greeks and Greece were diverse. Greek gods were depicted on coins and temple images, but whether in the use of Near Eastern temple designs or in the dedication of Buddhist relics, Greek cults were only part of the religious constellation of the region. [...] As well as the cults of Greek gods, other religions flourished in the Greco-Bactrian and Indo-Greek kingdoms. In Bactria, the river Oxus was worshipped, and the archaeological evidence is also suggestive of the existence of other local and Near Eastern cults, both within the precincts of shrines such as the Ai Khanoum temples and the Temple of the Oxus, and in independent locations. In India, we find evidence of the importance of Buddhism and the cults of Indian gods both to the region's inhabitants, Greek and non-Greek, and in political display.//"There was considerable flexibility in iconography and religious practice in the Hellenistic Far East: sites might serve as foci of multiple religious rites, perhaps with different ethnic 'slants', and be patronized by more than one ethnic group, or by individuals with a more complex personal ethnic identity. The use of multiple names for the same temple or divine image need not necessarily have operated at the level of officially orchestrated or approved syncretism. But if this did occur, as I suspect it did, it may have allowed diverse ethnic communities to use the same site without the necessity of 'appropriating' the deity and its worship for any particular ethnic affiliation. This is not to impute any degree of 'split personality' to the identity and iconography of the divinity. Greeks may have looked at the 'Dioskouroi' at Dil'berdzhin and seen one thing, and local Bactrians may have looked at them and seen another (how would a Greek and a Bactrian have referred to them in conversation with one another?). On the other hand, it is possible that people who looked at such an image did so with a conscious awareness that it was more all-encompassing, something that could have the attributes of one god without denying its identity as the other."<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>

<dl><dd> Ai Khanoum was a substantial and sophisticated city: there was a "sprawling" palace complex, theatre, temple, gymnasium, arsenal, storehouses, cemetery, a wall, fortifications and multiple areas for habitation.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup>  The people imported olive oil and visited "a Greek theatre like that of Delphi and larger than the one at Babylon."<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup> The city held "an elite residential district with 50 or more mansions"<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup> and among the segregated Greek/non-Greek population could be found "every occupation and trade one would find in a prosperous town in Greece itself."<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd> The theatre had a seating capacity of 6,000; although this might not "represent the size of the population living in the city."<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> The gymnasium was remarkable for being "the largest in the Greek world."<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd> The population at Ai Khanoum may be much larger than the theatre's 6,000 capacity. The region was surrounded by irrigated lands had a military base and diverse cultural life. The 6,000 may provide a lower limit for an estimate. The loose correlation between the seating-capacity of any settlement's largest theatre and its peak population size might assist an improved estimate. The largest Greek cities had theatres with seating-capacity of up to 17,000. If Ai Khanoum's theatre was one third of the size, then its population might be that much less than the population of the largest Greek city (100k?).</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> For an upper limit for the population at Ai Khanoum we could look at Samarkand in 300 BCE which may have had 100,000. <sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup> (No estimate for 200 BCE, however Samarkand still in existence at this time).  Although Samarkand may not have had this population level in 200 BCE 100,000 might be considered to be near the upper limit of what could be expected for Ai Khanoum, which is in the same region, 100 years later. The seating-capacity of the theatre at Ai Khanoum, however, would suggest a population much lower than this.</dd></dl>

Ai Khanum is one of the only cities to have been discovered. The shape of the  town was triangular, extending for two km in a north-south direction, one and a half km from east-west. It is located along the left bank of the Amu Darya at its confluence with the Kokcha River. The city was protected by large towers, a moat and an acropolis, as well as a large palace complex. Accurate estimates of its population are impossible because of the amount of looting on the site. <sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup>

<p>Seleucus and his successors had maintained the policy of Alexander in appointing a satrap to oversee a province. Below this level, the hyparchy, roughly translated as prefecture. Below the level of Satrap the local elites who supported of the ruler were ranked as varying level of 'friends' based on favor or eunoia. Loyalty was enhanced further by the granting of vast land holding, villages, slaves and other wealth. Below this level was the topoi. This hierarchical group was overseen by officials called dioikites or oikonomos.<sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup>

During the siege of Heraklia in 803, however, stone balls wrapped in linen and covered with burning naphtha were hurled by mangonels against the ramparts. The fire would cling to the stones and cause them to burst. From that time onwards, the caliphate employed corps of naphtha-throwers and the Muslim fleets were provided with it as well. In order to protect themselves, people covered flammable materials with newly flayed animal skins and those who handled the naphtha wore clothes saturated with talc. Naphtha-filled glass grenades appeared first in 934, unless in that year the weapons were actually incendiary javelins, but the use of fire grenades was firmly established a few years later. ... The latest historian of Greek fire, Maurice Mercier, admits that during the thirteenth century, people began to use grenades filled with mealed gunpowder, called 'Syrian jugs', which had a most explosive force.<i> <sup id="cite_ref-121" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-121">[121]</a></sup></i></dd>

One such norm involved the overlords allocating them at their discretion among their martial elite or to individual men in their subdivision units as performance rewards and incentives (e.g., Hom.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Yasna ♥</b> After the region was conquered by Alexander the Great, "The <i>magi</i> continued to preserve the [Zoroastrian] religion. There was no higher collective authority, as under the Achaemenid government. We have therefore to imagine regional differences in the practice of the religion. the <i>magi</i> were accordingly responsible for the way in which the religion developed: they had a monopoly on religious tradition. This had far-reaching consequences, for the joyful and affirmative faith which we recognize in Zarathustra's own hymns was altered and made more prescriptive and rigorous. It now became a question of exacting observation of very strict rules, and there were extreme penalties for any violation. [...] It is reasonable for us to conclude that in the course of Seleucid times the <i>magi</i> established an extensive web of temples of fire, even if they have not been found, thereby creating firm centers for the practice of religion; and this must have been important at a time when the prevailing powers were quite unconcerned with the preservation of Iranian religion. The observance of temples of fire had become as far spread as Asia Minor, as we learn, for example, in Strabo (4.1.3a): 'In Cappadocia (for there the seat of the magi, who are also called firekindlers, is large) ... they ... have fire temples, noteworthy enclosures; and in the midst of these there is an altar, on which there is a large quantity of ashes, and where the magi keep the fire ever burning. And there, entering daily, they make incantations for about an hour, holding before the fire their bundles of rods and wearing round their heads high turbans of felt (that is, the tiara) which reach down over their cheeks far enough to cover their lips.'" <sup id="cite_ref-245" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-245">[245]</a></sup> The ritual described by Strabo is almost certainly the Yasna, which is the central ritual of Zoroastrianism <sup id="cite_ref-246" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-246">[246]</a></sup>. Schwartz writes that it was "the act of worship par excellence, in which, in addition to the other elements of religious service, the beverage haoma, in Achaemenian times probably still a hallucinogen, was prepared in a mortar, strained and offered. A long liturgy, including recitation of the Gathas, was structured around this act" <sup id="cite_ref-247" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-247">[247]</a></sup>. Though Schwarz does not mention animal sacrifice specifically in connection with the Yasna ritual, he does list it in a preceding paragraph among "[t]he ancient canon of elements of cultic worship", and may therefore be considered to be implied "the other elements of religious service" in the above quote, also because the general consensus is that animal sacrifice was en everyday part of Zoroastrian ritual, since the days of Zarathustra himself <sup id="cite_ref-248" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-248">[248]</a></sup>.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Yasna ♥</b> After the region was conquered by Alexander the Great, "The <i>magi</i> continued to preserve the [Zoroastrian] religion. There was no higher collective authority, as under the Achaemenid government. We have therefore to imagine regional differences in the practice of the religion. the <i>magi</i> were accordingly responsible for the way in which the religion developed: they had a monopoly on religious tradition. This had far-reaching consequences, for the joyful and affirmative faith which we recognize in Zarathustra's own hymns was altered and made more prescriptive and rigorous. It now became a question of exacting observation of very strict rules, and there were extreme penalties for any violation. [...] It is reasonable for us to conclude that in the course of Seleucid times the <i>magi</i> established an extensive web of temples of fire, even if they have not been found, thereby creating firm centers for the practice of religion; and this must have been important at a time when the prevailing powers were quite unconcerned with the preservation of Iranian religion. The observance of temples of fire had become as far spread as Asia Minor, as we learn, for example, in Strabo (4.1.3a): 'In Cappadocia (for there the seat of the magi, who are also called firekindlers, is large) ... they ... have fire temples, noteworthy enclosures; and in the midst of these there is an altar, on which there is a large quantity of ashes, and where the magi keep the fire ever burning. And there, entering daily, they make incantations for about an hour, holding before the fire their bundles of rods and wearing round their heads high turbans of felt (that is, the tiara) which reach down over their cheeks far enough to cover their lips.'" <sup id="cite_ref-316" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-316">[316]</a></sup> The ritual described by Strabo is almost certainly the Yasna, which is the central ritual of Zoroastrianism <sup id="cite_ref-317" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-317">[317]</a></sup>. Schwartz writes that it was "the act of worship par excellence, in which, in addition to the other elements of religious service, the beverage haoma, in Achaemenian times probably still a hallucinogen, was prepared in a mortar, strained and offered. A long liturgy, including recitation of the Gathas, was structured around this act" <sup id="cite_ref-318" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-318">[318]</a></sup>. Though Schwarz does not mention animal sacrifice specifically in connection with the Yasna ritual, he does list it in a preceding paragraph among "[t]he ancient canon of elements of cultic worship", and may therefore be considered to be implied "the other elements of religious service" in the above quote, also because the general consensus is that animal sacrifice was en everyday part of Zoroastrian ritual, since the days of Zarathustra himself <sup id="cite_ref-319" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-319">[319]</a></sup>.

Those who saw it were sorry for him and tried to beg him off, and when the herald proclaimed that he had broken the law by wearing such clothing at the games, they all cried out in one voice (μιᾷ φωνῇ), as if by pre-arrangement, to excuse him for being in that dress, because, they said, he had no other'." <sup id="cite_ref-433" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-433">[433]</a></sup> "The organizers of civic festivals seem to have been strongly aware that keeping good order was crucial to the success of the festival, and also that it was not always easy to achieve.

We saw above that these were exactly the qualities in which the ephebes and neoi were trained in the context of the gymnasion. And a text from Oinoanda in Asia Minor even shows that the organizers appointed special functionaries to maintain discipline.

[...] Papyrus documents from Egypt provide abundant evidence in the field of private law, but the assumption must not be made that Hellenistic law was uniform, not that Egyptian practices apply to other areas. [...] Greek women, when they acted within the traditional conventions of Greek law, continued to need a guardian; Egyptian women did not. A guardian was required when a Greek woman made a public declaration or incurred a contractual obligation concerning persons or property. Examples of these contracts are countless. Documents show women as purchasers, sellers, lessors, lessees, borrowers, lenders; women were as liable as men for the various taxes that attached to these commercial activities. Women also had the right to receive and make legacies, acting with their guardians, and they usually named their husbands and children as heirs." <sup id="cite_ref-452" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-452">[452]</a></sup> </dd>

But if a male slave or a female slave does any of these things to a freeman or a freewoman, they shall receive not less than [a hundred] stripes, or else the master of the offender, if he is defeated in the suit, shall forfeit to the injured party twice the amount of the penalty which is prescribed for a freeman. Injuries done in drunkenness. Whoever commits an injury to the person in drunkenness or by night or in a temple or in the market-place shall forfeit twice the amount of the prescribed penalty. For a slave striking a freeman. If a male slave or a female slave strikes a freeman or a freewoman, they shall receive not less than a hundred stripes, or else the master, if he acknowledges the fact, shall pay on behalf of his slave twice the amount of the penalty which is prescribed for a freeman. But if he disputes it, the plaintiff shall indict him, claiming [for a blow] a hundred drachmas, and if the master is condemned, he shall forfeit three times that amount without assessment; and for a greater number of blows, the plaintiff shall himself assess the injury when he brings the suit, and whatever assess- ment [is fixed] by the court, the master shall forfeit three times that amount." <sup id="cite_ref-453" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-453">[453]</a></sup> "This difference between free and slave is paralleled in many Greek states by a difference in the law of punishments, that the slave might pay for minor misdeeds with corporal punishment, but the free man was exempt from this indignity." <sup id="cite_ref-454" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-454">[454]</a></sup></dd>

Derived from the experience of ancient Greece, which was multisided by definition, it is characterized as for its substance by a high level of unity; as for its sources, it appears essentially as a customary law, which has its basis not in the legislation of a city or a sovereign, but in notary practice. Because it is not the law of a limited group, as were the nomoi of the classical Greek cities or of the ethne ̄ it is within the reach of all who can fit the definition of a “Hellene,” through adherence to Greek culture and an origin foreign to the conquered country; in this respect, the case of the Jews of Egypt is particularly significant. After the Hellenistic monarchies were reduced to the state of Roman provinces, Hellenistic law survived under the Principate in the practice of the provinces of the East." <sup id="cite_ref-455" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-455">[455]</a></sup>  This implies that Greek law is within the reach of Hellenes while other types of law apply to other ethnicities.</dd></dl>

</p><p><b>Description of the Normative Ideology</b>
</p><p>"[T]he descendants of Alexander's settlers, who maintained, to some extent, Greek language and customs in the East, considered themselves to be Greek, and were described as such by their neighbours[...]. The Greekness of Greco-Bactrian and Indo-Greek religion is, however, more difficult to defend. The religious practices of people who asserted, in public discourse, and especially political imagery, a connection with Greeks and Greece were diverse. Greek gods were depicted on coins and temple images, but whether in the use of Near Eastern temple designs or in the dedication of Buddhist relics, Greek cults were only part of the religious constellation of the region.
</p><p>"[...]
</p><p>"As well as the cults of Greek gods, other religions flourished in the Greco-Bactrian and Indo-Greek kingdoms. In Bactria, the river Oxus was worshipped, and the archaeological evidence is also suggestive of the existence of other local and Near Eastern cults, both within the precincts of shrines such as the Ai Khanoum temples and the Temple of the Oxus, and in independent locations. In India, we find evidence of the importance of Buddhism and the cults of Indian gods both to the region's inhabitants, Greek and non-Greek, and in political display.
</p><p>"There was considerable flexibility in iconography and religious practice in the Hellenistic Far East: sites might serve as foci of multiple religious rites, perhaps with different ethnic 'slants', and be patronized by more than one ethnic group, or by individuals with a more complex personal ethnic identity. The use of multiple names for the same temple or divine image need not necessarily have operated at the level of officially orchestrated or approved syncretism. But if this did occur, as I suspect it did, it may have allowed diverse ethnic communities to use the same site without the necessity of 'appropriating' the deity and its worship for any particular ethnic affiliation. This is not to impute any degree of 'split personality' to the identity and iconography of the divinity. Greeks may have looked at the 'Dioskouroi' at Dil'berdzhin and seen one thing, and local Bactrians may have looked at them and seen another (how would a Greek and a Bactrian have referred to them in conversation with one another?). On the other hand, it is possible that people who looked at such an image did so with a conscious awareness that it was more all-encompassing, something that could have the attributes of one god without denying its identity as the other."<sup id="cite_ref-481" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-481">[481]</a></sup>

For the sake of the non-Greek subjects, Apollo and his twin sister Artemis were equated with the various local Sun and Moon gods worshipped in the multi-polytheistic empire.

"The faith of Seleucus I was of a somewhat conservative nature, and Antiochus I likened his father to Zeus by bestowing on him the title Nicator, thereby establishing a precedent for the official deification of kings after their death. It is possible that the example of Ptolemy II Philadelphus had some influence in the case of Antiochus II whose title Theos cannot have been just an empty word; and although this kind of deification was at first only a local phenomenon (in Miletus), his coins none the less depict Hercules on the rock, Apollo on the omphalos and the horned horse's head - now heraldically stylized. By contrast, Seleucus II Callinicus made virtually no attempt to spread his own cult but was active in encouraging the cult of Apollo and Athene; moreover he combined the cult of the dead queen Stratonice Thea with that ofher protectress Aphrodite. He did not have his own title put on his coins. Neither did Seleucus III Soter and Antiochus III the Great, who stamped the image of Apollo or an elephant on the reverse of their coins - the elephant here having nothing to do with Indian theories of monarchy.2 Even more striking is the absence of any charismatic or mythical references in the consolidation of the dynastic cult under Antiochus III. Only one decree is compiled on the assumption that the kings but not the queens had cults in their lifetime, that from Antioch in Persis3 which lists with their usual titles all the kings from Seleucus I to Antiochus III (together with his eldest son)." <sup id="cite_ref-488" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-488">[488]</a></sup> "On the basis of these facts we must give a decidedly negative answer to the question of whether the Seleucid kings adopted charismatic conceptions of monarchy from their subjects for reasons that relate to religion as a political force or even whether they believed themselves to be personally legitimized by the xvarnah through which Achaemenian kings had exercised world dominion on behalf of Ahura Mazda. Of the statements which can be made about the ancient Iranian or Aryan kings, not a single one applies to the Seleucids.

</p><p><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of monogamy ♣ present ♥</b> “Greek culture as a whole was monogamous in the sense that a man was expected to have only one wife at a time (the wife being the bearer of his legitimate heirs). However, exceptions were permitted among powerful men for dynastic reasons, especially during the Hellenistic period (Alexander is a good example, and also the Ptolemies). And throughout Greek history, even ordinary men could have a concubine (pallakis), visit prostitutes, conduct affairs with boys, etc. There was no presumption of male sexual fidelity as a part of the marital state. That was strictly for wives. It was considered in bad taste to keep a concubine in the same house as one’s wife, but that was just about the only restriction. In general, the philosophers said that sexual desire was something men must suppress in order to achieve the good life; they thought that friendship was the most important value and it should always take precedence over sex. [...] The bottom line is that monogamy was the cultural expectation (supported by religion in the sense that even Zeus and Poseidon and Hades only had one wife each). The philosophers did not make much headway in changing this, and where they did, it was more in favor of abstinence (either with or without marriage) than of polygamy.” <sup id="cite_ref-504" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-504">[504]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Ideology reinforces prosociality ♣ present ♥</b> “The philosophers taught various versions of the Golden Rule, whereas traditional Greek morality said it was best to help one’s friends and harm one’s enemies. The only philosopher I can think of who specifically advocates “helping people” over “living luxuriously” is the Stoic Musonius Rufus from the first century CE, but he may have been an innovator in that respect. In general the Greeks had no religious or philosophical teachings to compare with Jewish and Christian teachings about almsgiving, gleaning, or caring for “widows and orphans.” Greek cities sometimes gave stipends to orphans if their fathers had died in battle defending the city.  The most important traditional religious teaching on this subject was that the gods required people to treat “strangers and suppliants” well. That is, you should assist strangers who come to your door in need (and definitely not harm them). You can see this when Odysseus disguised as a beggar receives hospitality (Homer was a basic school text in the Hellenistic period) or in the Hellenistic myth of Baucis and Philemon, a very poor elderly couple who received two strangers and gave them hospitality. The strangers turned out to be Zeus and Hermes, who rewarded the couple. The belief that the gods “tested” humans by coming down to earth was common Hellenistic Asia Minor, where Paul and Barnabas were mistaken for Zeus and Hermes in disguise (Acts 14). Hellenistic philanthropy was closely tied to piety because the benefactions were usually things like sponsoring a festival or enhancing a sanctuary. Sponsoring a festival meant entertainment and free food distribution, but the main goal was not necessarily to help the poor - it was more to enhance the public good. I think it is very likely that the teachings of philosophers encouraged these sorts of activities, but of course the donors also benefited from increased prestige.” <sup id="cite_ref-505" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-505">[505]</a></sup>

Both Stoics and Epicureans made much of the idea that ‘true slavery’ is not external but an internal matter: whether one is a slave to one’s desires and emotions. Thus every slave can be ‘free’ and every master can be “enslaved” depending on their character.

Pausanias comments that the Greeks in Polygnotos' time thought that failing to respect parents and the gods were the worst crimes, and that is why Polygnotos has illustrated these cases. Polygnotos' painting, while exceptional in size and scope, is not exceptional in its subject matter: numerous vase paintings show scenes of underworld reward or punishment, and a Demosthenic speech mentions paintings depicting the afterlife torments of the impious as a familiar trope for his audience ([Dem.] 25.53)."<sup id="cite_ref-541" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-541">[541]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of purity ♣ present ♥</b> "Hesiod is generally quick to remark that the gods are pleased when the rites are performed correctly, and are displeased when proper ritual purity is not obtained. [...] We can also observe different grades of divine anger: libating with unwashed hands renders the ritual null and void, and the gods refuse to communicate with the worshipper. The failure to achieve the required state of purity results in the failure of the ritual. A graver and more serious offence is committed when someone crosses the river without prayer and the ritual washing—then the gods are not only irate, but also keen to punish. This makes sense: the rivers are divinities, and by entering them humans establish a particularly close contact with the divine. It is one of the basic premises of Greek religion that gods abhor pollution, which is why ritual cleansing is a necessary prerequisite for every ritual action. This would imply that entering a river requires a particularly stringent adherence to ritual purity, while avoiding this purification inspires a particularly harsh punishment—a punishment for jeopardizing the god’s own purity. The intensity of the contact with the divinity corresponds directly to the intensity of the purity required for the worshipper and to the severity of the divine punishment if this requirement is violated."<sup id="cite_ref-543" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-543">[543]</a></sup></dd>

Tantalos' transgression of the taboo against cannibalism also endangered human society, for it threatened the breakdown of civilization and a reversion to savagery, of which cannibalism was perceived to be an important characteristic."<sup id="cite_ref-546" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-546">[546]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>♠ care/harm ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> “The philosophers taught various versions of the Golden Rule, whereas traditional Greek morality said it was best to help one’s friends and harm one’s enemies. The only philosopher I can think of who specifically advocates “helping people” over “living luxuriously” is the Stoic Musonius Rufus from the first century CE, but he may have been an innovator in that respect. In general the Greeks had no religious or philosophical teachings to compare with Jewish and Christian teachings about almsgiving, gleaning, or caring for “widows and orphans.” Greek cities sometimes gave stipends to orphans if their fathers had died in battle defending the city.  The most important traditional religious teaching on this subject was that the gods required people to treat “strangers and suppliants” well. That is, you should assist strangers who come to your door in need (and definitely not harm them). You can see this when Odysseus disguised as a beggar receives hospitality (Homer was a basic school text in the Hellenistic period) or in the Hellenistic myth of Baucis and Philemon, a very poor elderly couple who received two strangers and gave them hospitality. The strangers turned out to be Zeus and Hermes, who rewarded the couple. The belief that the gods “tested” humans by coming down to earth was common Hellenistic Asia Minor, where Paul and Barnabas were mistaken for Zeus and Hermes in disguise (Acts 14). Hellenistic philanthropy was closely tied to piety because the benefactions were usually things like sponsoring a festival or enhancing a sanctuary. Sponsoring a festival meant entertainment and free food distribution, but the main goal was not necessarily to help the poor - it was more to enhance the public good. I think it is very likely that the teachings of philosophers encouraged these sorts of activities, but of course the donors also benefited from increased prestige.” <sup id="cite_ref-547" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-547">[547]</a></sup> Overall, though, this does not properly constitute enforcement.</dd>

<dd><b>♠ respect for authority ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> “It depends on what kind of authority. The rule of law was the most widely respected principle, starting from the time of the early Greek law codes in the Archaic period, when the culture moved from “self-help” family vigilantism and rival strongmen to a system in which men were expected to rely on the state to punish crime and decide civil disputes. Then it was a case of how widely power would be distributed among the citizens—in a kingship, an oligarchy or a democracy. The tyrannos or tyrant early on got a bad reputation precisely because he put himself above the law. During the Hellenistic period, the big problem was how to distinguish between legitimate rulers and tyrants, who were to be despised. Generals were constantly freeing states from the “tyrannies” imposed by their previous rulers and being hailed as saviors. There is much discussion in the literature of how Hellenistic cities reconciled the contradiction between the “freedom” they so highly valued and their obedience to a king. The kings permitted favored cities to self-govern (within certain limits), and this is what they considered “freedom,” quite different from the true autonomy of a Classical polis.” <sup id="cite_ref-549" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-549">[549]</a></sup> Overall, though, this does not properly constitute enforcement.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ purity ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> “As I have suggested at the beginning of this paper, the idea that a ritually cleaned body cannot free a person from guilt and cannot be a sufficient requirement for a harmonious relationship between mortals and immortals can be understood as an implicit criticism of rituals. We have already seen that Euripides, one of the most sensitive and innovative intellectuals of the Classical period, criticized both the undifferentiated application of the ritual of supplication and the lack of a distinction between a pure body and pure thoughts. This suggests that the development of the idea of the purity of the mind and its priority over the purity of the body was part of a more general process of fundamental changes in the perception of rituals in Classical and Hellenistic Greece. This process leads from the traditional view that ritual actions are effective when correctly performed to the idea that a ritual’s efficacy depends (also) on the moral and other justifications of the individual who performs it. We may observe this process from the late fifth to the third centuries BCE in measures for the exclusion of criminals from asylum, in the development of a new type of curses, in moral requirements for initiation into mystery cults, and more generally in a tendency towards a priority of the word and the thought over the ritual action.” <sup id="cite_ref-550" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-550">[550]</a></sup> Overall, though, this does not properly constitute enforcement.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ kinship ♣ inferred present ♥</b> “Piety required respect for one’s parents, especially in regard to making the annual offerings once they were dead. To mistreat a parent or neglect a parental tomb was a sign of moral depravity. Greek city-states legislated that children owed their parents food, lodging and burial (this goes back to Solon, the first lawgiver at Athens); those who failed in this duty could have their citizenship rights revoked. The worst crimes imaginable were incest with a parent and killing one’s own parent. Killing one’s own child did not carry the same weight of horror, although any kin-murder was considered more serious than murder of non-kin. The expectations for ritual purification after killing made these types of distinctions, and they could be regarded as a form of “regulation.” The Greeks recognized both written and unwritten laws. In general, the need to obey and respect parents was much, much stronger than any parental obligation to a child. Greek fathers throughout antiquity had the right to “expose” offspring they rejected at birth, which meant abandoning the infant either in the wild or in a place known to be used for that purpose, where it might or might not be picked up by slave traders. This did not count as murder, although once the infant was acknowledged by the father and accepted into the household, that would be a different matter. The Kyrene religious law code of the 4th century BCE says that “a man is bound as far as his brother’s children,” meaning that religious obligation (such as paying a fine levied for religious offense on a nephew) extended that far, and only on the paternal side.” <sup id="cite_ref-551" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-551">[551]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ bravery ♣ inferred present ♥</b> “Yes, this was definitely a “promoted value.” The Greeks called it either andreia (lit. “manliness”) or arete(“excellence”). A boy’s first school text was the Iliad, and he had to memorize long passages and write them out (or suffer beatings). As you know, this text is much concerned with the display of manly prowess in combat, which was the ultimate test of andreia. Evidence of cowardice (such as wounds taken in the back, or throwing away a shield in order to run) could ruin a man’s reputation in life or death. Plutarch wrote a book “On the Arete of Women,” in which he describes women who behaved in unexpectedly brave ways (usually by showing physical courage, fighting invaders, or counseling their men against cowardice). Some citations from the Hellenistic author Polybius: 5.111: King Attalus brought Gauls over from Europe as mercenaries because of their reputation for andreia. 6.46: [Citing unnamed sources] ‘For [they say that there are] two things on which the safety of a commonwealth depends,—andreia in the face of the enemy and concord at home.’ 27.8 [Deliberations by the Macedonian general Perseus after a victory]: ‘after this taste of Macedonian andreia, the Romans will be much more careful in the future not to impose an unjust or harsh burden upon the Macedonians.’” <sup id="cite_ref-552" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-552">[552]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ respect for property ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> “I recommend the chapter “Greek law in the Hellenistic period” in M. Gagarin ed. The Cambridge Companion to Greek Law (2005). There is also a chapter on family and property law. In general, there was great respect for property and a great concern for handing down property from one generation to another through the institution of marriage. First cousin, half-sibling and uncle-niece marriages were permitted or even required for heiresses, in order to keep property within the paternal family. The Romans noticed this Greek habit of endogamy and disapproved of it. Daniel Ogden’s bookGreek Bastardy may also be of help here. Zeus Herkeios was one of the gods who protected the household and its stores from robbers; there were many gods of this kind.” <sup id="cite_ref-553" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-553">[553]</a></sup> Overall, though, this does not properly constitute enforcement of <i>morality</i>.</dd></dl>

Its seating capacity of about 5,000 is somewhat greater than that of the only other Hellenistic theatre so far excavated in Hellenized Asia at Babylon, and slightly smaller than the famous theatre at Epidaurus in Greece. The presence of royal boxes set half-way up the tiers, a feature unknown in Greek theatres, indicates a society in which differences in social status were more clearly marked and where the democratic ideal so cherished, even by Greek cities under royal rule, was already seriously weakened. There can be no doubt, however, that the repertoire of Greek plays was performed there. Indirect but indisputable evidence of this is provided by one of the carved spouts of the Oxus fountain, which represents the traditional comic mask of the slave cook.49 It is, therefore, quite probable that the colonists of Ay Khanum, like their Mediterranean cousins, were familiar with the Greek new comedy, and in particular with the plays of the most famous Greek comic writer, Menander. A passage in Plutarch (De Alexandri fortuna aut virtute, 328 D.), referring to the fact that in the parts of Asia conquered by Alexander, the children of Persia, Susa and Gedrosia were learning to recite the tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides, confirms, in spite of rhetorical exaggeration, the spread to Asia of that typically Greek literary genre and social phenomenon: the theatre." <sup id="cite_ref-569" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-569">[569]</a></sup></dd>
