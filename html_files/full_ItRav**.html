<dl><dd>We begin our Exarchate of Ravenna polity in 568 CE, the date of the last praetorian prefect in Italy, although the first 'exarch' (essentially a governor with political and military authority) known by name dates to the last decades of the 6th century.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> This year saw Lombard and Germanic tribes invade northern Italy, expelling the Byzantine influence in the area which the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I (r. 527-565 CE) had established only about a decade earlier. The Exarchate of Ravenna together with most of central Italy and parts of the south were the only parts of the former Ostrogothic Kingdom to remain under Byzantine authority after this time. Shortly afterwards, perhaps around 575 CE or slightly later, the first exarch of Ravenna was created under the aegis of the Byzantine emperor.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> The Exarchate period ended when the last exarch, Eutychius, was killed during the Lombard conquest of the territory in 751 CE. However, recognition of the nominal Byzantine authority in the region persisted until 781 CE, when the years of the emperor's reign were no longer used for dating papal documents or on the coins minted in Rome.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p><i>Population and political organization</i>
</p>
<dl><dd>The Exarchate of Ravenna was essentially a special province of the East Roman Empire and the exarch owed nominal allegiance to the emperor in Constantinople. The Roman Senate was last known operating in 580 CE<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> and many of the senators moved to Constantinople 'to maintain access to court appointments'.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> In Italy, Ravenna was the undisputed home and capital for the army and civil administration.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The exarch was a ruler who combined civil and military powers,<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> commanding over 50,000 square kilometres of land in Italy after a period of protracted warfare had destroyed the Roman-friendly Ostrogothic governmental system.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> His duties included leading the army in Italy, publishing and enforcing laws and canons of church councils, and appointing most subordinate officials.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> Exarchs were appointed by the East Roman Emperor from among the personnel of his palace administration in Constantinople 'and rarely had served in any capacity in Italy before being named exarch'.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> The criteria for choosing exarchs is not entirely clear, nor is it certain how long they might have expected their official tenure to last.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> What is clear is that the exarch retained a great deal of authority and autonomy in the region.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Under the exarch, dukes of provinces ruled from cities (e.g. Rome, Naples, Rimini, Venice) and tribunes governed in towns. Like the exarch himself, the role of dukes and tribunes combined both military and civic duties. However, these men, 'along with the lower-level officers and troops, administrators, clerks, and tax collectors were drawn primarily from the local population, including educated laymen, although on occasion an official might be sent from Constantinople'.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> Ravenna was governed both directly by the exarchal administration<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> and, until the mid-7th century, a city council (<i>curia</i>) responsible for tax collection and certifying and storing legal documents.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> Decentralization from 600 to 750 CE weakened the authority of the exarch,<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> and as government collapsed, the dukes in the provinces gained power.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup> The 7th century CE saw the development of an 'increasingly closed and hereditary land and officeholding aristocracy'.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Another important rival of the exarch's authority was the archbishop of Ravenna. The exarch worked with the archbishop of Ravenna 'in legal cases, foreign affairs, papal relations, and other similar sorts of situations',<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup> but sometimes they clashed on 'doctrinal matters'.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> The Church also financed public works projects, such as building churches and public baths.<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Italy experienced a slight population expansion during this period, and had perhaps over one million inhabitants.<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup></dd></dl>

A city (civitas), along with its surrounding rural perimeter, the foundation of imperial organization, also formed the basic unit of ecclesiastical structure. Virtually every Roman city, many of them quite small, had its own bishop. He exercised his authority over a "diocese" that ordinarily coincided with the boundaries of the civitas. These dioceses were then grouped into provinces, over which a metropolitan, the bishop of a province's principal city, held sway. Eventually, provinces themselves were organized into large "patriarchates," each lead by one of the five preeminent bishops of the church: those in Rome, Constantinople (called "New Rome," second in prestige to the Old), Antioch, Alexandria, and Jerusalem."<sup id="cite_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<dl><dd> "Evidence from the second century suggests that a wide variety of models for local clergy existed throughout the Roman Empire. Yet the one to prevail was a three-tiered, hierarchical. In this model, the bishop served as leader of the local community and was assisted by presbyters or priests (elders) and deacons. Again, this model was established in the Antioch of Ignatius, as he underscores emphatically the necessity of gathering for learning, ritual, and teaching around a single bishop. By the end of the century this three-tiered form of ministry had spread to most early Catholic communities throughout the empire, and it would soon become the sole authoritative manner of organizing local ecclesial communities." <sup id="cite_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-57">[57]</a></sup></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p><b> ♠ Standing armies ♣ present ♥ </b>  Just prior to this period Emperor Maurice "resorted to the policy of applying the defence system of the frontier zones [castella settlements] to the whole of Italy, threatened as it was by the Lombards. ... The setting up of these catella led to an agrarian revolution in Italy. ... To establish castella and military settlers meant dividing up these large estates. The method adopted was expropriation without compensation, but the soldiers stationed in the castellum were granted land in the form of an emphyteunsis, that is, hereditary lease. The actual ownership of the land remained with the proprietors and the soldiers had to pay them a fixed annual rent in return. This relationship with the landowners meant that the garrison of the castellum did not form an independent community, for the castellum was established on private property. ... The development of this relationship between the soldiers and the landed proprietors, based on leasehold, was of extreme importance for the West. Under Germanic influence the nature of the emphyteusis began to change and what had been a Roman legal concept now turned into a relationship of vassalage. The relation between soldier and landed proprietor, which from the Roman point of view was regarded as a private contract, began to be interpreted as a relation between lord and vassal. ... the two largest landlords in imperial Italy, the Pope and the archbishop of Ravenna, now became territorial rulers. In the case of the papacy this situtation was given legal validity by the Franks, so that the Pope was at least de jure ruler of the land of which he had formerly been proprietor." <sup id="cite_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-94">[94]</a></sup>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ baptism ♥</b> Baptism was the fundamental rite of initiation into Christianity going back to Augustine's time, but changed substantially during the early medieval period. The theology behind the ritual changed considerably; during this period there was not the emphasis that would later be placed on the need for children to be baptized to avoid damnation or consignment to Limbo.<sup id="cite_ref-123" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-123">[123]</a></sup> As Thompson phrased it, during the Middle Ages, "Christians were made, not born." He is speaking of the thirteenth century, but the point extends back to the period under discussion.<sup id="cite_ref-124" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-124">[124]</a></sup> Baptismal churches (<i>pievi</i>) were not yet in place during this period, so baptisms presumably happened at the closest <i>Duomo</i>, the mother-church of major settlements (such as the church of San Vitale in Ravenna). The ritual made natural-born children into Christians. So central to the cult was baptism that, in extreme situations, lay people could baptize children, especially if the child was in immediate danger of death. Baptism forgave sin, original or that done by the person in question.<sup id="cite_ref-125" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-125">[125]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ weekly ♥</b> RA’s inference. baptisms during this period were public events held either in the Duomo, the cathedral of sizeable towns (such as Orvieto or Perugia, in the Papal State) or in parish churches (such as the parish churches of the city of Rome).<sup id="cite_ref-126" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-126">[126]</a></sup> The fundamental duty of the parish priest, besides saying mass, was baptism of newborns in his parish, the <i>pieve,</i> and the centers for local religious life and administration were the <i>pievi.</i> Pirillo is speaking of Florentine Tuscany, but by the late twelfth century, nearly all of Christendom, and certainly all of the Papal State, was organized into parishes.<sup id="cite_ref-127" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-127">[127]</a></sup> I should note, however, that the parish system was still in its infancy during this period, and the parish system seems to have been a late development in Italy compared to Germany and France.<sup id="cite_ref-128" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-128">[128]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ once in a lifetime ♥</b> For the ritual of baptism, "participants" denotes godparents, who were supposed to lift the child from the baptismal font, and were tasked with instructing the child in the basics of Christianity, in particular teaching them the fundamental prayers of the <i>Credo</i> and <i>Pater Noster.</i><sup id="cite_ref-129" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-129">[129]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ yearly ♥</b> RA's inference. Frequency would have depended on population size, the size of kinship and communal networks that the child's parents were a part of, and other factors. I've coded it as yearly since in some Italian cities during this period, it was popular to baptize as many children as possible during the Easter season, which would have resulted in large crowds.<sup id="cite_ref-130" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-130">[130]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Duration ♣ 1  ♥</b> 1 hour. RA's inference. based on the fact that baptism usually occurred in connection with other religious rituals such as mass or the Easter vigil.<sup id="cite_ref-131" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-131">[131]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Typical size of participating group ♣ [80-120] ♥</b> RA's inference, based on the typical size of one of the <i>pievi</i> discussed above.<sup id="cite_ref-132" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-132">[132]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Inclusiveness (ritual specialist) ♣ substantial minority ♥</b> The priesthood was restricted to men.<sup id="cite_ref-133" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-133">[133]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b>♠ Inclusiveness (audience) ♣ whole polity ♥</b> Baptism in late antiquity was a private or semi-private ritual for adults of the Christian community, but by this period it had become a public affair, with whole kin groups probably involved; Thompson has demonstrated that during this period, there was a construction boom of baptistries.<sup id="cite_ref-135" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-135">[135]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ mass ♥</b> The Mass was the fundamental ritual of Christianity; indeed, as Arnold as argued, "...in whatever form, the mass can be seen as a key ritual in the production of medieval community...."<sup id="cite_ref-167" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-167">[167]</a></sup> There were many varieties of masses, varying in frequency and nature depending on the community involved. Monasteries and convents held several masses a day, in particular masses for the dead.<sup id="cite_ref-168" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-168">[168]</a></sup> Parish priests were supposed to say one mass daily, but it is unclear whether this was common, especially during this period, which predates the general establishment of parish churches in localities. High mass was rare, most likely restricted to high holidays such as Christmas; the laity were only expected to attend mass on Sundays, and even this was not asserted as a fundamental part of orthodox Christianity until a  later period.<sup id="cite_ref-169" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-169">[169]</a></sup> A rough description of a typical mass is as follows. The priest read out a psalm on the nature of original sin, followed by hymns on Sundays. Then the priest read from the Gospel, and prepared the bread and wine for the Eucharist (at this point, the laity would give any offerings they had for the collection box). This description is from (Arnold)<sup id="cite_ref-170" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-170">[170]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-171" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-171">[171]</a></sup> The priest then passed the Pax, an object with the crucifix on it, around and the laity kissed it.<sup id="cite_ref-172" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-172">[172]</a></sup> This seems to have taken the place of Communion on days when the laity did not participate in it; mass then ended. Monastic masses and special liturgical masses would have been slightly different, but these were the main elements. NOTE: Most Christians-in fact, probably the vast majority, during this period-did not attend mass on anything approaching a regular basis, perhaps at all.<sup id="cite_ref-173" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-173">[173]</a></sup> Urban people, in particular those in Rome, probably attended church more regularly than, say, those in the remote Appenines, but this is no more than a reasonable hypothesis for this period. I would also like to note the serious paucity of sources, and thus of secondary scholarship, on the early medieval mass in Italy: we simply do not know very much about lived religion in early medieval Europe, and especially in Italy.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ daily ♥</b> Parish priests were in theory required to say mass daily, but it is almost impossible to know how stringently this was obeyed.<sup id="cite_ref-174" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-174">[174]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ daily ♥</b> Swanson, writing of the period after 1215, has noted that "How it [the Mass] fits into a liturgical round is not easily considered, for masses were celebrated with almost mind-boggling regularity and in incaluclable quantities...."<sup id="cite_ref-175" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-175">[175]</a></sup> This was true also of the tenth through the twelfth centuries; while monasteries offered liturgical masses for the dead daily, and as the tenth century went on, this became one of their main functions, especially those reformed by the Cluniacs. For a description of liturgical masses for the dead. <sup id="cite_ref-176" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-176">[176]</a></sup> "Participant" thus reflects, here, monks praying for the dead while not officiating the Mass itself.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ weekly ♥</b> Defining "audience" as the laity not taking communion (regulations on which only appeared after 1215), the laity were required to attend mass once a week on Sundays.<sup id="cite_ref-177" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-177">[177]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Duration ♣ 2 ♥</b> hours. This is an estimate for a regular Mass.<sup id="cite_ref-178" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-178">[178]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Typical size of participating group ♣ [80-120] ♥</b> This is a very rough estimate; getting at the typical size of a participating group would require a drastic limiting of the pool of said group (i.e., are we talking about Rome? Ravenna? Or a tiny parish such as, borrowing from Tuscany, the tiny parish of San Gavino degli Adimari, which contained even in 1347 maybe 100 people?). See (Klapisch-Zuber &amp; Herlihy) for a good discussion of the difficulties involved in determining the size of medieval settlements; their source is the Florentine Catasto of 1427, easily the most detailed demographic record that survives for medieval Europe.<sup id="cite_ref-179" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-179">[179]</a></sup> The number of 100 is based on an average-sized medieval settlement with, perhaps, 20 or 30 households/hearths (<i>fuochi</i>). It is even more hypothetical because if there were 100 people in a given settlement, one can reasonably guess that not all of these 100 people attended Mass regularly.</dd>

"A heretic, the nonneighbor, became so by not participating in worship, by avoiding the Catholic clergy, and, after Lateran IV, by refusing Easter Communion <sup id="cite_ref-196" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-196">[196]</a></sup></dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Orthopraxy checks ♣ present ♥</b> The liturgy itself, encompassing Mass and other rites of the Catholic Church, was a kind of orthopraxy check.

The new Germanic nobles showed no sympathy whatever for the Bacaudae, understandably, and were on occasion used by the Roman landowners who were now their social partners to put them down. It was only the last Ostrogothic leader Totila, confronted with victorious Byzantine armies, who resorted in extremis to emancipation of slaves in Italy - itself a testimony of their importance - to rally popuar support in a final, desperate throw before his destruction.

</p><p><b>♠ Religious reinforcement of monogamy ♣ present ♥</b> “As mentioned earlier, the central, basic norm of  the Church's attitude toward marriage during the first millennium of Christianity is the idea that the mystical union of God and Israel, of Christ and the Church, is reflected only in a marriage that is perfectly monogamous. The idea is already explicit in St. Paul: widowers are allowed to remarry but are not encouraged to do so (1 Cor. 7:39-40). Early Christian writers show a remarkable consensus in supporting that view: the consensus includes Ter- tullian, Athenagoras, the Shepherd of Hermas, Clement, and Origen. In the fourth century St. John Chrysostom composed a treatise addressed ‘’To a Young Widow’’, encouraging her to remain in her widowhood rather than succumb to human weakness and remarry. // Chrysostom's early contemporary, St. Basil of Caesarea, is the author of numerous letters, a number of which were accepted in the Byzantine Church as normative canonical texts and sanc- tioned as such by the Council in Trullo (692). He writes: "The rule establishes one year of excom- munication for those who marry a second time. Other authorities even require two years. Those who marry a third time are often excommunicated for three or four years. And such a union is not called marriage, but polygamy, or rather punishable fornication ... (noevd(av xExokaoptvriv)." This negative attitude toward second or third marriages is maintained in the ninth century by St. Theodore of Stoudios; recognizing that civil law authorized such unions, he forbids their blessing in church.'5 The canons attributed to Patriarch Nicephorus (806-815)16 also forbid the "crowning" of any marriage except the first.17 This principle, which forbade ecclesiastical sanction in cases of consecutive bigamy and trigamy, must have been challenged first in the case of emperors. In the ninth century Theodore of Stoudios deplores the evil example of Emperor Constantine V Copronymos, who was married three times.” <sup id="cite_ref-559" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-559">[559]</a></sup>

Biblically based concepts of marital consent and impediments to marriage, and of annulment and divorce for cause, were increasingly prescribed. Traditional Roman and Germanic practices of polygamy, concubinage, incest, homosexuality, contraception, abortion, and infanticide were increasingly proscribed (Birth Control). The Christian construction of the patriarchal household was firmly entrenched in new laws of property and inheritance, and in new legal obligations of mutual care and nurture among parents, children, and siblings. Christian clergy and monastics were prohibited from participation in sex, marriage, and family life; virginity, chastity, and celibacy were celebrated as a high moral ideal for the Christian. This general pattern, with ample local variations, persisted throughout the Germanic era of the 5th to the 11th century.”  <sup id="cite_ref-606" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-606">[606]</a></sup></dd>

Yet he also understood the reality of evil in the ‘earthly city’ and the role of the state to confront such evil and render protection (including, in his day, protection of the church). Augustine spoke eloquently of the rueful and necessary duty of statesmen to wage just wars against forces that threatened life and resorted to violence. For augustine, war is always tragic, undertaken out of sorrowful recognition of the injustice that necessitates it and the horrors and cruelty that often attend it (‘’De civ. Dei’’ 19.7).//”What was prohibited for the private individual was permitted for the soldier, who acted in a public capacity; Augustine presumed that a legitimate political authority stood a better chance of restraining inordinate, willful desires, in part by channeling them toward a collectively just civic cause. Augustine contended that God uses political authority in general to achieve minimal levels of order, justice, and peace in the earthly realm. That war could serve as an acceptable means of achieving a peaceful or tranquil order (‘’tranquilitatis ordinis’’) attests to the always limited and imperfect measure of peace and justice one finds on earth; perfect peace and true justice, however, await in the Heavenly City.//”Throughout the Middle Ages, as a further occasions arose for the use of force, theologians, canon lawyers, and political thinkers returned to Augustine, in some cases to deepen, in others to expand, Christian tenets of just war.” <sup id="cite_ref-607" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-607">[607]</a></sup></dd>

<p><b>♠ Moralistic punishment by human religious agents ♣ present ♥</b> Judging from Meens <sup id="cite_ref-609" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-609">[609]</a></sup>, it seems that there was significant continuity in penitential practices in Italy between the fourth and the tenth century. "The disciplinary aspect of penance comes more to the fore in the period after the edict of Milan (312), by which Christianity was tolerated as a religion within the Roman empire. This made it possible for Christian bishops to convene in councils and to issue their decisions. Penance is often found as a prerequisite for returning to the Christian congregation after having committed a serious fault. The council of Ancyra for example, which convened in 314, ruled that men having had sexual relations with animals should live as supplicants for fifteen years, after which they were allowed to take part in prayer in church; after another five years they were allowed to take part in ‘simple communion’ and if they persevered they were finally allowed to participate again in communion with offerings. This canon illustrates a process by which sinners were only gradually readmitted as full members of the Christian community. During a period of fifteen years they were apparently not entitled to attend Mass, and only five years later were they readmitted to the Eucharist, but evidently still with reservations since their offerings were not accepted until after a certain lapse of time. These rules, as issued by bodies invested with ecclesiastical authority, implied a certain form of control and discipline to make certain that they were carried out in a proper way. Councils acted as legislative bodies to issue general rulings on disciplinary matters and to determine the period of penance for a specific offence. Somebody however had to oversee the process of assigning such disciplinary measures, to keep an eye on the proper behaviour of the excommunicated person and on the process by which he was to be readmitted into the community. The actual assignment of a period of exclusion, according to the rulings issued by councils from the fifth and sixth centuries, was in principle the task of the local bishop. [...] The church historian Sozomenos described the ritual of penance as he had seen it in Rome, and from his description it is clear that in Rome as in Hippo penitents were assigned a special place in the church. At the end of Mass the penitents threw themselves on the floor and the bishop joined them with tears in his eyes. He then stood up and the penitents followed suit. It seems that Sozomenos is describing the act of entrance into a penitential state here, for he goes on to explain that the penitents were obliged to fulfil penitential exercises such as fasting for as long as the bishop had decided, and then were acquitted of their sin and allowed to take part fully in the liturgical practices of the community again." <sup id="cite_ref-610" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-610">[610]</a></sup>

<p><b>Extent of punishment (can be more than one):</b>
</p>
<dl><dd> <b>♠ punishment of rulers ♣ present ♥</b> "The best-known case of a person of high social standing doing penance is the act by which the Roman Emperor Theodosius in 390 gained absolution for the massacre among the citizens of Thessalonica, which had taken place on his orders. A great number of citizens of Thessalonica had been killed by Gothic troops as a reprisal for the murder of their general Butherich. Although the penance assigned to the emperor has often been depicted as a show of force on the part of the Christian bishop, it is now conceived as a carefully balanced act between bishop and emperor to redeem Theodosius of the sin and of the political blame he had contracted. In Ambrose’s view Theodosius, as a baptized Christian, could not partake of the Eucharist with blood on his hands. Ambrose did his utmost to arrange for a public penance of the emperor, thereby strengthening the political position of his imperial friend. [...] As Ambrose had expressed it in a sermon delivered during another contest with an emperor, the emperor was a member of the Church and not someone who was above it (<i>intra ecclesiam, non supra ecclesiam</i>). As a member of the Church, a baptized emperor such as Theodosius - which at that time was still something of a novelty - should live according to the strict rules of the Christian faith. The guilt that he had incurred because of the massacre was well known to all Christians and put the bishop in a difficult position. Ambrose could not ignore the emperor’s sin, but could he deal with this sinner as he would have done with others? Probably not, although it has been observed that we lack specific knowledge about the ordinary ways of dealing with sinners in Milan in this period. Ambrose could point to biblical precedents of kings doing penance, most of all, of course, the case of David doing penance for his adultery with Bathsheba and his responsibility for the killing of her husband Uriah. Ambrose’s arguments might have helped to convince Theodosius that penance could also bring honour, but probably Ambrose also showed him the way out of a precarious political situation, as Neil McLynn has argued. In November the emperor declared that he was willing to undergo public penance. In the address delivered by Ambrose on the death of the penitent emperor five years later, the bishop reminded his audience how the emperor laid down all the imperial insignia, bewailed his sin in public in the basilica and implored absolution with tears and laments. He stressed that the emperor was not ashamed to do what the citizens were ashamed of: to do penance in public." <sup id="cite_ref-615" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-615">[615]</a></sup></dd>
<dd> <b>♠ punishment of elites ♣ present ♥</b> "From Jerome’s letter to Oceanus we learn that the Roman matrona Fabiola entered the order of penitents (<i>ordo paenitentium</i>) to atone for her bigamous behaviour. Again we can observe that in Rome penitents were assigned a specific place in church. The entry of an honourable lady into the order of penitents seems to have aroused great public interest in the city of Rome. Interestingly, Jerome adds that this episode happened ‘ante diem paschae’, thereby probably stressing the import of Fabiola’s act, choosing to retire from the Christian fold as a penitent right before the most important Christian festival. Jerome presents Fabiola’s case as an example of how a Christian even of the highest social standing should not refrain from abasing themself in front of the community. As we have already seen in Hippo, penitents who thus abased themselves could paradoxically gain in prestige." <sup id="cite_ref-616" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-616">[616]</a></sup></dd>
