<p>The Basin or Valley of Mexico is a highlands plateau in central Mexico roughly corresponding to modern-day Mexico City. Here, we are interested in the phase of its prehistory known as the Middle Postclassic (c. 1200-1426 CE). By this time, Tula no longer held sway over the region, and had been replaced by several city-states (altepetl). Documents written much later record the dynastic histories and conflicts between these city-states; toward the very end of this period, they came to form growing confederations, paving the way for the Aztec empire.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> Major centres such as Azcapotzalco, Texcoco, or Cholula likely had between 20,000 and 30,000 inhabitants.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> Each altepetl was ruled by a king (tlatoani) and a council of nobles.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

</p><p>For the purposes of this project we define an institution as a system of social norms that governs the behavior of individuals in certain contexts, with social norms understood simply as socially transmitted rules of behavior. Institutions are also understood as being generally persistent across generations, changing only slowly over time although sometimes changing suddenly through some shock or radical social change. A classic example of an institution is marriage, which governs the behavior of the spouses in the context of their family and household. Particular norms within this institution describe the expected division of labor, rights and obligations of the partners, their children, and in-laws, etc. Because norms are socially transmitted rules, they are an example of a cultural element (by our definition, culture is any kind of socially transmitted information). There are other definitions of norms and institutions, but the one given here was chosen for its compatibility with the theoretical framework of cultural evolution (and this definition is not incompatible with alternative ones, e.g. institutions as alternative equilibria). It is often useful to distinguish formal from informal institutions. In the following, we will ask whether an institution is legally prescribed (part of a constitution or formal law code) or something that is an unwritten rule that, nevertheless, reflects the way things are done, and are expected to be done.
</p><p>We define 'elite' as the top social, political, economic, and/or religious members of society. In the codes below, when we say to code as 'equal to top nobility', we are referring to the society's elite groups and families. 'Higher than top nobility', then, refers to the ruling family, and 'lower than top nobility' refers to all people at a lower status than the elite groups and families.

<p>While the codes above reflect a legal or explicit right of some group to constrain the executive power, below code for non-formal limits. These include social or cultural norms which limit the action that can be seen as legitimately undertaken by the executive, for instance an unwritten restriction against an executive making changes to or decisions on religious matters. It is possible to code for all four combinations of absent/present along the formal/informal institution. So there could be the legal right to criticize a chief executive but it’s never used. Or, there may not be a law that specifies how the ruler is criticized, but there is an established practice of doing so. Where coding ‘present’ provide explanation and examples. Note that you should only code non-violent actions (so a rebellion that overthrows the head of state is not an instance of informal ‘impeachment’)

<p>In this section we are interested in whether religious or supernatural agents impose limits on executive power. These codes refer to both formal, legal restrictions as well as informal constraints including social or cultural norms which limit the action that can be seen as legitimately undertaken by the executive, for instance an unwritten restriction against an executive making changes to or decisions on religious matters. Explain in descriptive section whether the constraint was formal or informal. ‘Religious agents’ here refers to religious groups, their leaders, or even religiously motivated individuals who are not leaders (e.g., Buddhist monks, street preachers)

<dd> <b>♠ Constraint on executive by religious institutions ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. This refers to religious practices or norms that work to constrain the activity of the executive. This differs from the above code in that this code refers to restrictions imposed without the need for religious ‘agents’ specifically to act. For example, witchcraft accusations or the threat of such accusations could serve to limit the activity of political actors and act as a normative-behavior reinforcement. Explain in paragraph what the institution is and which groups of people are constrained by it.</dd>

Unlike the previous position (subordination), which can be theoretical, here we are looking for actual instances when leaders were motivated to do prosocial acts by religious considerations</dd></dl>

Enter the total number of transitions here and list each one in the paragraph. Note Dynastic transitions where applicable</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Number of contested transitions ♣ ♥</b> How many transitions were contested (out of the total entered above), regardless of which party won the contest (i.e. incumbent or contesting agent). 1. We do not count as a contested transition any challenge that begins after 365 days have elapsed of the new reign. Caveat: care must be taken to record cases just after the cut off. We want to know when the conflict started. The reign end date of the previous ruler only tells us when the contest ended. Though a major event (e.g. a battle) can occur one and a half years after the new king's coronation the infighting/contest that lead up to it often begins earlier, such as immediately after the accession, or sometime within the first year. That infighting can be ignored by any historian who wants to simplify the text to mention only the battle. 2. Multiple separate contests within the transition timeframe should be counted as ONE contested transition. (Do not take time searching for the details of multiple separate contests but if all the detail is present in the same text opportunistically record it in the description field). 3. A transition can be contested before the new ruler is officially crowned.</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Number of successful overturns ♣ ♥</b> How many contested transitions of power resulted in an overturn of the ruler. This includes breaks in the normal line of succession (i.e. a dynastic succession was broken, a different party or ethnic group took power, or a rebellion resulted in a change to the rules or procedures regarding powers transitions) or when a relative overturns the ruler unexpectedly within the expected line of succession. Note: There will often be 'succession crises' when there is no 'normal line of succession' so that there will be a 'contested transition' with no possibility of a successful overturn: i.e. 1. The dynasty ends with no heir (typical cause of a succession crisis); 2. The previous ruler has died and divided the kingdom between his sons (who then decide to fight for it all); 3. There is no formal succession procedure and every succession is a fight (e.g. Mamluk Sultanate). These cases should not qualify as a successful overturn as nobody is being overturned.</dd></dl>

</p><p>These codes refer to the type of control that rulers or the executive branch of government exerts over its state-level administrators.
</p>
<dl><dd><b>♠ Direct ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. Direct means that the executive maintains tight control over the appointment, removal, assessment, and duties of state-level officials</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Indirect ♣ ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. Indirect means that the executive influences the activities of administrators (i.e. by ability to remove administrator from office, or by promoting certain religious or ethical norms that influence administrative behavior), but has not explicit legal authority to determine their actions. E.g. senatorial governors in the Roman Empire assigned to govern a province by the Emperor, but with little oversight once in place</dd>

<p>We are interested here in any systems of thought and behavior that can influence people's actions, which we term a <i>Normative Ideology</i>.  Normative ideologies are thought-systems concerned with the correct behavior of people, governments/leaders, and other groups (and particularly the relationships between these groups).
</p><p>Mainly, this will be a religious or ritual system. As usual, when we mention Religious or Ritual System our focus  is on the 'official cult', defined the same way as in the Rituals section:
With the official cult we refer to the set of collective religious practices that are most closely associated with legitimation of the power structure (including elites, if any). However, Normative Ideologies are not restricted to religious/ritual systems. They include other thought systems, such as philosophy or anything that prescribes a particular pattern of behaviour. An example is  classical Greek philosophy, such as the works of Plato and Aristotle, who were concerned with correct or moral behaviour and whose thoughts influenced the actual practice of several societies (the empire of Alexander the Great, notably).

</p><p><b>♠ alternate Names of Official Cult ♣ ♥ </b>
</p><p><b>♠ Name of other significant religious or ideological systems ♣ ♥ </b> Here, we are looking for religious or ideological systems (e.g. moralizing philosophical schools) that were practiced by a large number of inhabitants in a polity (more than 10% as a rough guide) apart from the official cult. Examples include Classical Athens, where the official polis cult was a traditional pan-hellenic from of polytheistic worship, though many citizens followed philosophical ideals such as Socratic philosophy.

<p><b>Human sacrifice</b> (HS) is defined as deliberate and ritualized killing of an individual to please or placate supernatural beings. Common examples of supernatural beings are gods and ancestors, including a recently deceased one. In other words, sacrificing humans to follow a high-status individual in the afterlife is a legitimate example of HS. HS is distinct from capital punishment, however, even for offenses against religion (e.g., burning of heretics, punishment of vestals for transgressions). Such practices should be coded as <b>Capital Punishment for Religious Offenses</b>. Execution of 'witches' even if regularly occurring at funerals of a high-status individual is not HS. We can reflect such practices under <b>Capital Punishment for Witchcraft</b>. See Law, Robin. 1985. Human Sacrifice in Pre-Colonial West Africa. African Affairs 84 (334):53-87 for further discussion. There are several distinct categories of HS listed below. First code any special kinds of HS that are present in the (quasi)polity. Then code the general code  based on the codes for special kinds of HS. Note that HS is also coded under Rituals; here, however, we address general features of HS not tied to any particular ritual.
</p><p><b>♠ Human sacrifice ♣ ♥</b> 0-5/Unknown    To code this HS scale first code special kinds listed below. Then use the explanation below to assign a numerical code. Indicate uncertainty and disagreement in the usual way.5: HS of high-status or relative is present (or both) 4: HS of low-status, but not high status/relative 3: HS of out-group only 2: HS is condemned by an influential figure 1: HS is not practiced 0: Official cult forbids HS (the official cult is defined in the Rituals section)
</p>

<dd><b>♠ human sacrifice of a relative ♣ ♥</b> e.g. sacrificing the first-born son</dd>
<dd><b>♠ human sacrifice of other ♣ ♥</b> Leave uncoded, unless HS ritual doesn't fit any of the above categories, or the victims' status is unknown. Explain possible causes or targeted group.</dd>

<p><b>Supernatural Enforcement of Morality</b>
For this section, include any type of supernatural punishment or reward either in this lifetime (e.g., curses, good fortune) or in the afterlife (e.g., hell, reincarnation). This includes generalized impersonal punishment/reward (e.g., karma, mana) as well as punishment by specific supernatural beings. Include specific details of the nature and extent of punishment/reward in the description. Code “compound” moral actions (e.g., filial piety = kin + respect) in multiple categories as necessary. Morality categories are based on Moral Foundations Theory (Haidt &amp; Graham, 2007) and Morality-As-Cooperation theory (Curry, 2016). In general, we are contrasting enforcement of “moral”/”prosocial” behaviours directed between humans with that of “amoral”/“procedural” behaviours directed by humans towards supernatural beings (e.g., prayers, rituals, sacrifices, taboos).
