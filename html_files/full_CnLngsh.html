C. Chang as the Lungshan or Lungshanoid horizon (Chang 1977: 144-184, 1986: 238), is often indicated as the beginning of Chinese civilization, complex political organization, and, possibly, writing. Due to the incipient emergence of copper and bronze technology, and its chronological position between the end of the Neolithic and the beginning of the Bronze Age in the Xia-Shang, it has also been suggested that Longshan be termed Chalcolithic (Yan Wenming 1986). The existence of a sophisticated technology for the production of jade artifacts and the comparative wealth of jade finds dating to this period and slightly earlier have prompted some scholars to suggest that the term "Jade Age," a term first found in the text Yuejueshu "Waijuan Ji Baojian" (juan II, vol. 2) (1966: 3), may also be appropriate. 1 The concepts of stone, bronze, and iron ages were devised within the tradition of Western prehistory, and as they are problematic even within that framework, they should not be uncritically applied to other parts of the world." <sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>

However, Taosi was not abandoned altogether, and evidence, including radiocarbon dates, suggests that it remained occupied until around 1700 BC (Zhongguo 2003, pp. 566, 838)."  <sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

The relatively regular spacing of these sites, at a distance of some 30-50 km from one another (Guojia 2006, 2007; Liu 2004), suggests that they were central nodes of small-scale polities each covering some 1,500-2,000 km2.

Nor should such a statement imply that there was a population replacement between the two traditions.

<dd><b> ♠ Supracultural entity ♣ ♥ </b> Chang (1999) suggests the entity of China, but other expert input is needed. "When the chronologies of the various cultural types and systems are carefully traced, it becomes apparent that by approximately 4000 B.C. some of the adjacent regional cultures had come into contact as an inevitable result of expansion and that a number of ceramic styles began to assume a sphere-wide instead of merely a region-wide distribution. For example, among pottery vessel types, the ding and the dou are found in every region, often in large numbers, suggesting the wide distribution of a style of cooking formerly prevailing only in the Dawenkou and Daxi cultures. The perforated slate rectangular and semilunar knives represent another horizon marker, as do some pottery and jade art motifs that, as pointed out earlier, may reflect deeper substratal commonalities than recent contact. With the definition of "interaction spheres," for the first time we can discuss the issue of the name "China." I suggest that from this point on, as the regions with which we are concerned came to be joined together in archaeological terms and exhibit increasing similarities, the interaction sphere may be referred to as "Chinese."

<p>"It is argued that Taosi controlled a three- (Liu and Chen 2012, p. 221) or four-tier (He 2013) settlement hierarchy in the area between the Fen River and the Kuai River. A recent study counted 54 Taosi-period sites in this region; at least 3 of them, not including Taosi itself, are more than 100 ha in size, 23 are between 10 and 99 ha, and the rest are smaller (He 2013). Regardless of the exact number of hierarchical tiers (which in any case may be impossible to determine based on current data), the range in size, the more-or-less even distribution of the largest sites, and the association between labor investment and the largest site (Taosi) do suggest the development of a regional settlement hierarchy and the ability of the center(s) to recruit labor and accumulate resources." <sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup>
</p><p>"At the same time, there was an increase in the size of settlements. All the Longshan settlements in the Zhengzhou-Luoyang region can be classified into four different size groups: (1) from 40-100ha, (2) 15-40ha, (3) 5-15 ha, and (4) smaller than 5 ha. So far there are only 10 sites in the large size class, just 1 percent of the known sites, including two sites of the Wangwan Type north of the Songshan mountains: Cuoli in the Luoyang city area (50ha) and Miaodian in Jiyuan city (80ha); and two sites of the Meishan Type south of the Songshan mountains: Xinzhai (over 100ha) and Wadian in Yuxian county (40ha). Although the quantity of small sites also had increased in comparison to the late Yangshao period, the sizes of the other, smaller sites had not increased (Zhao Chunqing 1999). The six other large sites are: Taipu 太仆 in Shanxian county (70ha), Boluoyao 菠萝窑 in Mengjin county (40ha), Xi- wangcun 西王村 in Luoning county (45ha), Laofandian 老樊店 in Songxian county (50 ha), Dasima 大司马 in Wuzhi county (100 ha), and Yangxiang 杨香 in Qinyang county (75ha)." <sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup>
</p><p>"Settlement System. Scholars have focused on understanding individual sites rather than regions. Settlement hierarchies have been proposed for more than one region, primarily on the basis of large-scale reconnaissances. However, as noted above, a few systematic, regional surveys have begun. Relatively large settlements surrounded by walls Of rammed earth are present in several regions and are thought to represent political centers (such as Wangchenggang, Pingliangtai, Haojiatai, Mengzhuang, all in Henan; Dinggong, Bianxianwang, Jingyanggang in Shandong; Shijiahe in Hubei). For several areas, surveys and reconnaissances suggest three levels in the settlement hierarchies.

A survey by the geologist Li Rongquan 李荣权 showed that the small southern gully Xiaonan Gou 小南沟, the large southern gully Danan Gou 大南沟, and southern gully Nan Gou 南沟 were all roads used during the city’s occupation. Due to flooding during subsequent eras, they became gullies (Li Rongquan, pers. comm., Sept. 2003). Therefore, it appears the early-period city road system ran from southeast to northwest in a linear design. The road stretched from the southern royal cemetery, northwest into the city, and ran between the palace area and lower elite residential area. From the northern and southern portions of the palace area it converged with a large road at Xiaonan Gou, after which it crossed through the residential area for commoners to the hypothesized ritual area (Zhongguo et al. 2005b).

In the observatory the radius from the observation point to the arc formed by the observation columns and gaps on average is 12.3m. Thus, the distance between the observation point and the observation columns and gaps is about ten paces. This is probably not a coincidence, but rather a way to use the columns and gaps for establishing the directions of sunrise and sunset.

A complex society could not exist without a sophisticated calendar that is primarily founded on the cognition of the four seasons. At the Taosi observatory the observation point, the observation gaps and the Ta’ershan mountains in the distance would have formed a sort of large measuring apparatus we can call a ground “reference point calendar.” The seasons can be determined by watching the sunrise above the Ta’ershan mountains on the midline of one of 11 observation gaps. We understood this after making our own observations at the Taosi observatory from December 21, 2003 to December 23, 2005. Beginning from the winter solstice at observation gap 2 the sun is being gradually followed to the summer solstice at observation gap 12 and back again to the winter solstice at observation gap 2, completing the annual solar cycle and dividing it into 20 segments. Therefore the Taosi people recognized and could observe the changing of the seasons (He 2007). [...] As mentioned earlier, in 2002 a rod of lacquered wood was discovered in the middle-period royal grave IIM22. After we restored it, we saw that the complete length is 187.5cm. It is lacquered in alternating black and green segments that are separated by pink stripes. My research shows that this rod of lacquered wood is part of a device for the measuring of shadows, like a sundial (He 2009c). According to our calculations, different colored markings were used to determine the onset of the seasons, such as the summer solstice. We have calculated the shadow lengths associ- ated with these points, and we are comparing them to figures mentioned in early historical records from later periods." <sup id="cite_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-62">[62]</a></sup></dd>

<p>Evidence for warfare but no evidence for specific wars:
"Archaeological evidence also shows that during the Longshan period the process of settlement diversification, which was in full swing, was coupled by an increase in organized violence, at least in the middle-lower Yellow River Valley and the coastal zone, the areas of highest interaction and competition among some Longshan-era cultures: Shandong Longshan, Hougang II/Wangwan III, and Liangzhu (see Fig. 2). The archaeological record shows that conflict became an issue: besides the fortified settlements discussed above, the number of weapons increased, and there is evidence of massive killing and the burning of villages. At Jiangou (Handan, Hebei) wells were discovered that were filled with dismembered skeletons of young and adult men, as well as children, with some of these skulls bearing evidence of scalping (Anonymous 1959: 531-532). At Xiaofangou (Mengjin), a half skeleton was discovered, apparently a sign of violent death or mutilation (Chang 1986:270-737; He Deliang 1993).
Further archaeological research is needed to determine if warfare was endemic beyond this area, in the middle and upper Yangzi River Valley and in Inner Mongolia, as is possible given the presence of walled settlements. As Steven LeBlanc (1997: 236) has pointed out, much evidence for warfare is subtle (such as settlement patterns), and direct evidence of actual fighting and destruction is hard to identify. Competition was not limited to inter-settlement interaction: habitation diversification within the sites and related burial data, particularly at the cemeteries of Xi Zhufeng in Linqu County, Shandong (Anonymous 1990b: 587- 594; Shandong Sheng Wenwu Kaogu Yanjiusuo 1989), and Taosi in Xiangfen County, Shanxi (Anonymous 1983a: 30-42), indicate that both social stratification and gender distinctions were also being institutionalized." <sup id="cite_ref-177" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-177">[177]</a></sup>

<p>A collective ritual is a ritual in which two or more people participate. With the official cult we refer to the set of collective ritual practices that are most closely associated with legitimation of the power structure (including elites, if any).

</p><p>Political retribution (most dysphoric? but probably not disphoric to the participants):
</p>
<dl><dd>"A late-period ditch called IHG8 in the palace district contained a great deal of refuse and human bone. I believe these remains are due to rituals for “political retribution,” a characteristic of state societies. This was the practice of a new political power to smash, destroy, curse, and make profane the ideological core of the previous power that it had vanquished. It represented the complete subjugation and annihilation of the old power, ensuring that it would never rise again. Common actions with the goal of political retribution are razing city walls, digging up burial mounds of ancestors, and destroying palaces and temples. The middle-period wall at Taosi had been utterly leveled before a new late-period wall was constructed. The large and medium-sized burials in the middle-period royal cemetery had all been destroyed and the corpses exhumed. The palace of the middle period had been razed to the ground, and it is clear that the key building IFJT3 was destroyed. The ditch we call IHG8 was dug in this area and filled with female corpses with cattle horns stuck in their private parts, with scattered human bones, with refuse and garbage, and with broken pieces of the toppled palace building. The former dignified palace district that used to be taboo for common people was ritually destroyed.</dd>
<dd>During the late period, moreover, the middle-period observatory was razed to the ground, and the corpse of a person who met a violent death was interred at its core (Zhongguo et al. 2004a). This was probably done to profane the sacred area that must have served as an altar to heaven. A pit (IIH24) with a diameter of 6.35 m and a depth of 1.2m had been dug into the third layer of the structure and filled with water (Zhongguo et al. 2007). I believe this was an attempt to ritually destroy the powers of the observatory linked to the sun and sky." <sup id="cite_ref-180" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-180">[180]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>Exclusiveness of rituals:
"The middle-period small enclosure in quadrant II contains almost no remains from daily life, so it probably was not a palace area. It should be considered a ritual zone monopolized by the Taosi royalty because the small enclosure’s wall forms a protective ring around this special, sacred area. Commoners did not have the right to use the ritual observatory facilities here, which was the intention of building a wall around the special ritual area. As is stated in the Shangshu Yaodian 尚书·尧典, “recording time at Yao’s observatory was entrusted to the official astronomers of names Xi 羲 and He 和.”2 Issuing the calendar would have been the duty of the king. Associated ritual activities also would have taken place at the observatory. It is likely the king held ceremonies there by himself or entrusted officials to perform rituals on his behalf. This was not a public ritual building freely accessible to commoners." <sup id="cite_ref-181" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-181">[181]</a></sup>
</p><p>Human sacrifice:

<dl><dd> "Wangchenggang (Fig. 7), the smallest Longshan walled settlement, measuring 0.8-1.0 ha, is characterized by the presence of several hangtu platforms (Anony- mous 1983c: 8-20; Dengfeng Wangchenggang Yu Yangcheng 1992). Below some of the platforms are pits filled with skeletons from human sacrifices. The largest sacrificial pit contains the remains of seven people, including young men, women, and children. A metal fragment and pottery with graphs were also recovered from this site. Radiocarbon dates place Wangchenggang period II remains at about cal 2400 ±100 B.C. (Zhongguo Shehui Kexueyuan 1980)." <sup id="cite_ref-182" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-182">[182]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>"Hougang is an urban site of irregular oval shape covering an area of 10 ha situated about 1.5 km northwest of the Shang capital site of Yinxu at Anyang Xiaotun. Only sections of hangtu walls were discovered there. Hougang is notable for its custom of sacrificing children and entombing them in foundations, postholes, and walls. Based on the pottery typology and stratigraphic sequence (Anonymous 1985&nbsp;: 33, 81-82), the site of Hougang has been assigned to three Longshan oc- cupation intervals, which, following 14C dating, have been placed at approximately 2700-2500 B.C. (early Longshan), 2500-2300 B.C. (middle Longshan), and 2300-2100 B.C. (late Longshan). <sup id="cite_ref-183" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-183">[183]</a></sup>
</p>
<dl><dd>"The walls indicate social differentiation in Longshan society for more than one reason. The resources needed for building a large walled settlement were far more than those used in ordinary settlements, thus requiring a very powerful central authority to organize the necessary labor. In addition, there is evidence at some sites for sacrifice of humans in rituals associated with the construction of wall foundations. For instance, in the western walled portion of Wangchenggang, 13 sacrificial pits filled with at least 17 human skeletons were found. The original number would have been more than this because of selective excavation." <sup id="cite_ref-184" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-184">[184]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>In Dinggong (Shandong): "Within the walls are houses, kilns, tombs, and ash- pits, as well as evidence of violent deaths (human remains were found in disused storage pits) and human sacrifices of both adults and children at the foundation of large buildings (He Deliang 1993: 2)." <sup id="cite_ref-185" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-185">[185]</a></sup>
</p><p>Standardized rituals throughout the Longshan-influenced region?
</p>
<dl><dd>"The presence of several altar sites, and a whole array of ritual jade and pottery objects of comparable shapes over a good part of the Chinese territory, appear to indicate that by the Longshan era the standardization of ritual and religious practices and the formation of iconographic formulae was already well in place (Wu Hung 1990). This would include the finds of recognizable ritual objects, such as hi discs and cong tubes, beyond the Liangzhu nuclear culture to an area that ranges north-south from Inner Mongolia to Guangdong, and east-west from Shandong to Gansu (Huang 1992:78-80,</dd></dl>
<p>figs. 9-10), and the existence of an established set of ritual vessel types (li pitchers, dou cups, ding tripods, etc.), which were to have a paramount religious importance throughout the early dynastic period." <sup id="cite_ref-186" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-186">[186]</a></sup>
</p><p>"Religious Beliefs. As in previous periods, there was great effort expended on mortuary ritual by kin groups of both high and low status, indicating pervasive beliefs about an afterlife and the importance of ancestors.
</p><p>Religious Practitioners. Artifactual and textual data (from later periods) suggest to some scholars that shamans were important religious specialists during the late Neolithic period.
</p><p>Ceremonies. It is likely, as in earlier periods, that funerals were important public rituals. Unusual artifacts, including alligator-sklin drums and chime-stones, at sites such as Taosi in Shanxi suggest the importance of music in rituals." <sup id="cite_ref-187" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-187">[187]</a></sup>
</p><p>"It also is clear that divination was widespread. Burned, but not incised, oracle bones, mostly the scapula from pig, ox, sheep, and deer, were recovered from two sites north of the Songshan mountains, the large site of Miaodian, and the smaller site of Xiaopangou. They also were found at two major sites in the south: the large site of Wadian and the walled site of Haojiatai. One ox scapula found at Xiaopangou had more than 30 heating marks, presumably made for divination.
Finally, earlier and simpler forms of rituals known in the later historical period seem to have begun during the Wangwan III period. A good example is the pottery lie gu 列觚, a ranked set of gu 觚 goblets excavated at the large site of Wadian. This was a set of goblets of decreasing sizes similar to the lie ding 列鼎 sets of tripods found in later Shang and Zhou dynasty contexts." <sup id="cite_ref-188" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-188">[188]</a></sup>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ large-scale feast ♥</b> "What may have been the function of ritual feasting at Kangjia? To answer this question we need to turn to ethnographic analogy. The feasting activities of the Akha people in Northern Thailand have been documented by Clarke (2001), as summarized below, showing some parallels to the Kangjia situation. "The Akha have a transegalitarian society (i.e. between egalitarian and chiefdom). The people practice agriculture, relying on a fluctuating, somewhat unpredictable, but labor-intensive resource base. This economic condition underlies the collaborative nature of the social structure. In Akha society differences in wealth and power exist between individuals and family groups, but socio-economic inequity, competition, and aggrandizing behavior emerges primarily between the lineages and clans as a whole, rather than between individuals. Feasting, which is integral to the dynamics of clan/lineage relations in this society, indicates the need for a structured and dependable life-crisis support network (Clarke 2001: 144-149). "Akha life is replete with feasting. Their many types of feasts include ancestor offering, newborn naming, harvest, and life-cycle crisis. The scale of feasts also varies markedly, ranging from a few people and the ritualized consumption of food to enormous gatherings involving up to 1,000 participants, who may consume several water buffalos, pigs, and chickens over a period of weeks. The functions of feastings are primarily to provide solidarity and promote the prestige of social groups at various social levels from family to village. It is notable that the most elaborate feasts are often associated with weddings, building new houses, and funerals. These are the types of feasts intended to be grandiose and promotional (Clarke 2001: 151-153). "The Neolithic Kangjia community in several respects is similar to the Akha. Kangjia people relied on millet agriculture and animal husbandry, which were perhaps fluctuating resources during the post-climatic optimum period. This is suggested by the high infant mortality rate in the Kangjia pig population. The Kangjia social organization may be similar to that of the Akha, as the Kangjia settlement shows differentiation among house groups (a unique feature in T26 is paintings on several house floors) but without marked social stratification. The decline of domestic animals means that a large portion of protein in the human diet had to come from hunted animals, which required skill and teamwork to obtain them. In such ecological conditions, creating and maintaining alliance and cooperation between social groups, especially kinship related ones, would have been essential for the community’s survival. "[...] "Kangjia was apparently situated in an environment with abundant natural resources, which could have provided a basis for surplus production used by self-interested aggrandizers to gain prestige and power through conducting ritual feasting. "Feasting would have functioned as a social mechanism that created and maintained a life-crisis support group; it could also be an avenue for people to negotiate for power within their greater support group and a medium of competition for status between social groups. The ability to provide wild animals for feasting is an important condition for the families to gain political and religious prestige. Since it is usually the elite households that host and frequent large-scale feasting, the house group in T26 may have been the residence of the elite in the community, at least for a period of time." <sup id="cite_ref-189" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-189">[189]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ large-scale feast ♥</b> "What may have been the function of ritual feasting at Kangjia? To answer this question we need to turn to ethnographic analogy. The feasting activities of the Akha people in Northern Thailand have been documented by Clarke (2001), as summarized below, showing some parallels to the Kangjia situation. "The Akha have a transegalitarian society (i.e. between egalitarian and chiefdom). The people practice agriculture, relying on a fluctuating, somewhat unpredictable, but labor-intensive resource base. This economic condition underlies the collabora- tive nature of the social structure. In Akha society differences in wealth and power exist between individuals and family groups, but socio-economic inequity, compe- tition, and aggrandizing behavior emerges primarily between the lineages and clans as a whole, rather than between individuals. Feasting, which is integral to the dy- namics of clan/lineage relations in this society, indicates the need for a structured and dependable life-crisis support network (Clarke 2001: 144-149). "Akha life is replete with feasting. Their many types of feasts include ancestor offering, newborn naming, harvest, and life-cycle crisis. The scale of feasts also varies markedly, ranging from a few people and the ritualized consumption of food to enormous gatherings involving up to 1,000 participants, who may consume several water buffalos, pigs, and chickens over a period of weeks. The functions of feastings are primarily to provide solidarity and promote the prestige of social groups at various social levels from family to village. It is notable that the most elaborate feasts are often associated with weddings, building new houses, and funerals. These are the types of feasts intended to be grandiose and promotional (Clarke 2001: 151-153). "The Neolithic Kangjia community in several respects is similar to the Akha. Kangjia people relied on millet agriculture and animal husbandry, which were perhaps fluctuating resources during the post-climatic optimum period. This is suggested by the high infant mortality rate in the Kangjia pig population. The Kangjia social organization may be similar to that of the Akha, as the Kangjia settlement shows differentiation among house groups (a unique feature in T26 is paintings on several house floors) but without marked social stratification. The decline of domestic animals means that a large portion of protein in the human diet had to come from hunted animals, which required skill and teamwork to obtain them. In such ecological conditions, creating and maintaining alliance and cooperation be- tween social groups, especially kinship related ones, would have been essential for the community’s survival. "[...] "Kangjia was apparently situated in an environment with abundant natural resources, which could have provided a basis for surplus production used by self-interested aggrandizers to gain prestige and power through conducting ritual feasting. "Feasting would have functioned as a social mechanism that created and maintained a life-crisis support group; it could also be an avenue for people to negotiate for power within their greater support group and a medium of competition for status between social groups. The ability to provide wild animals for feasting is an important condition for the families to gain political and religious prestige. Since it is usually the elite households that host and frequent large-scale feasting, the house group in T26 may have been the residence of the elite in the community, at least for a period of time." <sup id="cite_ref-244" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-244">[244]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ ritual hunting ♥</b> Hunting appears to have been an important ritual in prehistoric China, at least starting in the late Longshan <sup id="cite_ref-255" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-255">[255]</a></sup>. "Meat is always the principal food in feasts. Since meat is not a daily component of the diet in agricultural communities, the offering of an expensive animal for sacrifice is reason enough to gain prestige (cf. Clarke 2001: 160). Therefore, skilled hunters would have greater opportunities to promote their social status in a community. This may have been the situation applying to the household in T26 [at the late Longshan site of Kangjia], which yielded evidence for specialized hunting (H79). In addition, hunting animals may carry symbolic meanings other than merely obtaining protein. Hunting in many complex societies is a strongly ritualized activity and success in hunting frequently is taken as evidence of supernatural approval and support (Helms 1992a). Therefore, successful hunting would ideologically reinforce the prestige of individuals and social groups. "This symbolic aspect of hunting may be observed in the late Shang dynasty, in which hunting was one of the significant ritual activities of the royal court. The animals, used as ritual sacrifice, played a role to link the kings with supernatural power (Fiskesjö 2001; Keightley 2000: 107-113). It is notable that the Shang kings’ favorite game include buffalo and deer (Lefeuvre 1990-1991; Yang Zhongjian and Liu 1949). More interestingly, Shang kings even traveled to the lower Wei River valley to hunt. As recorded by Sima Qian in 'Yin benji' in Shiji, King Wuyi was killed by lightning during a hunt in an area between the Wei and Yellow rivers. Hunting associated with economic, political and symbolic power may have had a long tradition back to the Neolithic period in this region, and the consumption of wild animals in ritual feasting was a tangible medium materializing the intangible symbolic power." <sup id="cite_ref-256" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-256">[256]</a></sup> "Hunts that involved killing dangerous animals (as opposed to more docile animals such as domesticates, less aggressive herbivores, or smaller animals) and that also involved displays of people’s courage, prowess, and strength may have been both euphoric and dysphoric, involving such aspects as pride (in displaying prowess), exhilaration (surely a dramatic chase would be exhilarating), but also fear/terror depending on circumstances, such as the hunter being chased by the game or other scenes of danger." <sup id="cite_ref-257" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-257">[257]</a></sup></dd>

Within the residential area, which is protected by a 4m deep moat to the southwest, 15 round, semi-subterranean houses were excavated. Elaborate ones may be as big as 3sqm to 12sqm in area, with hearths, steps (at the entrance) and floors covered by pulverized stone or sand.
