<dl><dd>The Mature Harappan culture, also known as the Indus Civilization, emerged around 2500 BCE and, from its core in the Indus and Saraswati Valleys, expanded to the Kachi plain and the Makran coast in the west, to Gujarat in the south, and to the foothills of the Himalayas and the northern borders of the Ganga-Yamuna Doab in the north and east. This civilization was characterized by the establishment of several large cities, most notably Mohenjo-daro, the largest of these centres and the one best positioned to control trade and communications throughout the region. Rather than being united by a single shared ideology, it appears that the Indus people had a wide range of beliefs and/or religions.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> Around 1900 or 1800 BCE, the Indus Civilization began to decline, possibly due to environmental factors.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p><i>Population and political organization</i>

<p><b> ♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣ [3-4] ♥ </b> levels. "The Harappan settlement pattern may offer some clues to the organization of society. The settlements fall basically into three categories. First there are a very few enormous settlements, the cities. These were at least 60 hectares in extent (Dholavira, which may actually be as much as 100 hectares) and could be as large as 250 hectares (Mohenjo-daro)."//"At the opposite end of the spectrum were rural settlements: farming villages, pastoralist and hunter-gatherer camps, and fishing villages. These could range in size from less than a hectare to 7 or 8 hectares...In addition, there were villages whose inhabitants were specialists, such as the shellfishers and shellworkers of Nageshwar. These settlements had none of the complexity of towns but were probably not self-sufficient in subsistence products like villages. They may have been occupied only seasonally by people who spent the rest of the year in primary production.//"The third category, towns, is an amorphous catch-all, including a great diversity of different types of settlement. They were usually quite small, around 1 to 5 hectares, and, though some were larger, few exceeded 16 hectares. This figure does not include the suburbs that may have existed outside many towns; traces of suburban settlement have been reported outside a few and are suspected at others, but none has been properly investigated." <sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>

Those without a well of their own, however, were served by the public water supply, and the great wear around the rims of wells in houses suggests that they too were used by more than the immediate household. Grooves in the well curb show that water was drawn using containers, such as pots or wood buckets, attached to ropes. The huge number of wells at Mohenjo-daro indicates that the city was too far from the river for convenience; Jansen (1987) suggests that pits dug to extract clay for construction filled with rainwater and may been used as an additional water source for the city."<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup></dd>

The impression of the early excavators at Mohenjo-daro, reinforced by excavations at Kalibangan, was that settlements were laid out in a checkerboardlike grid pattern. Although more recent investigations have shown this to be untrue, the layout was nevertheless governed by precise criteria. The main streets ran north-south, diverging from this orientation by no more than 2 degrees. [...] The planned layout, foreshadowed in the Early Harappan period at a few sites such as Harappa, Kalibangan, and Nausharo, was strictly maintained throughout the Mature Harappan period, with wide clear streets. The Late Harappan period, however, saw the abandonment of planning and the encroachment of buildings into the streets."<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup></dd>

"The power of the Harappan state to mobilize huge workforces is apparent in the construction of the massive platforms on which many of the towns and cities were built. Those at Mohenjo-daro are the most impressive feat: Jansen calculated that the platform underlying the citadel there would have required 300,000-400,000 man-days’ labor to build. Equally impressive were the walls that surrounded many of the urban settlements, freestanding or as revetment for the platforms: These were in some cases more than 15 meters thick and could be as high as 9 meters, and they were furnished with elaborate gateways.//"The sinking of wells was also a substantial undertaking: Mohenjo-daro is thought to have had around seven hundred, created during the foundation phase of the city’s construction. Digging the reservoirs at Dholavira was also a vast project: At least sixteen in number, they together covered about 17 [this number was omitted in typographical error but online reprint of passage confirms it as 17<sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup>] hectares and were excavated down to bedrock or in some areas cut down into it. Soil taken from them was built up into massive bunds (dykes), up to 7 meters wide and faced with masonry, running between the reservoirs. A number of dams were created on the two seasonal streams, running past the settlement to divert water into the reservoirs. In addition to the labor of their original construction, regular work was required to maintain the reservoirs and remove any accumulated silt. While not on the same scale, the Great Bath at Mohenjo-daro and the dock at Lothal were also considerable feats of hydraulic engineering.//"The Harappans did not build monumental temples or tombs but these platforms, walls, and basins were similarly vast projects requiring the bringing together, feeding, and management of huge numbers of workers. While the work at Dholavira and Lothal may have been undertaken during the slack period of the agricultural year by the inhabitants of the city and its hinterland over the course of a number of years, the construction of the platforms and walls for the foundation of towns and cities were undertakings that had to be completed before the first houses could be built, and work could take place only during the winter months when the plains were clear of floods. Small huts found by the Aachen team when investigating the Mohenjo-daro citadel platform were probably occupied by the workforce."<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<dd><b> ♠ Geometrical ♣ inferred present ♥ </b> "[T]he origin of mathematics, and geometry in particular, in the Indian subcontinent may actually date back to the third millennium BCE and the Indus Valley civilization, rather than beginning with the Sulbasutras of the first millennium BCE as is conventionally thought. Although the well-planned cities, standardized system of measurements and evidence of long-range trade contacts with Mesopotamia and Central Asia attest to the high technological sophistication of this civilization, the unavailability of written records has up to now prevented us from acquiring a detailed understanding of the level of mathematical knowledge attained by the Indus people. By focusing on the geometry of design motifs observed commonly in the artifacts excavated from various sites belonging to this culture, we have shown that they suggest a deep understanding of the properties of circular shapes. In particular, designs which exhibit space-filling tiling with complicated shapes imply that the Indus culture may have been adept at accurately estimating the area of shapes enclosed by circular arcs. This speaks of a fairly sophisticated knowledge of geometry that may have persisted in the local population long after the decline of the urban centers associated with the civilization and it may well have influenced in some part the mathematical thinking of the later Vedic culture of the first millennium BCE." <sup id="cite_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup></dd>

Further suggestive evidence of tame elephants comes from representations on seals of elephants apparently wearing a cloth over their back, and a clay model of elephant’s head with painted designs on its forehead: Elephants are similarly decorated with paint on festive days in modern South Asia."<sup id="cite_ref-118" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-118">[118]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd>The high degree of uniformity characterising the Indus Civilisation has led some to take evidence for one region and apply it to others; and has also led to arguments for political and religious doctrines of uniformity and/or nihilism.  However, more recent debate has highlighted regional differences that have qualified such assumptions.  Nausharo, although located in Baluchistan, seems to be allied strongly to the Sindhi region and thus it is safe to discuss it together with finds from Mohenjo-daro.</dd>
<dd>The nature of Indus religion has been elusive; and though much has been written on it the fact that John Marshall's description is still the standard work and he put great weight on mother goddess figurines and phallic symbols<sup id="cite_ref-225" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-225">[225]</a></sup>.  The main themes seem to be worship of the natural world, particularly the bull, and the use of water in ritual, including bathing.<sup id="cite_ref-226" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-226">[226]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>One of the main problems is that the script, virtually only found on the seals, has never been translated, despite numerous claims to the contrary<sup id="cite_ref-227" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-227">[227]</a></sup>Credible evidence and a review of past efforts is in <sup id="cite_ref-228" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-228">[228]</a></sup>.</dd>
<dd>The evidence falls mainly into a number of groups.  The first consists of depictions of what could be gods in pictorial art, mainly seals.  The most common seal type is the bull (which may have only one horn) standing over what appears to be a brazier.  This makes up over half of all seals found.  Other scenes include figures associated with a pipal tree (ficus religiosa), which is sacred in Indian religions (including Buddhism) even today<sup id="cite_ref-229" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-229">[229]</a></sup> and whose leaves are a popular design on Harappan pottery.  Given the importance of the sacred tree in later history it is probably safe to assign a similar importance in this period.  Animals such as the tiger and the deer are also popular; and one seal appears to show animal figures on standards in a procession<sup id="cite_ref-230" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-230">[230]</a></sup>. The most famous seal image is that of the Proto-Shiva, a figure in yogic posture who is wearing a bull headdress or is half-man half-bull.  He possibly has three faces; and his other features are an erect phallus and multiple armlets.  He has been interpreted as a shaman, but also as a forerunner of the Hindu god Shiva in the latter's role of Lord of the Beasts (Pashupati); for the seal also includes the tiger and other jungle creatures who surround him.  Although a popular interpretation, it has been fairly rejected by a number of scholars<sup id="cite_ref-231" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-231">[231]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-232" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-232">[232]</a></sup>.</dd>
<dd>He could also be a priest, for a seal showing a collective ritual shows him bowing before a horned deity in a pipal tree, with other figures processing below them<sup id="cite_ref-233" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-233">[233]</a></sup>. This and the procession are the two major images of ritual.</dd>
<dd>The second type of evidence consists of figurines.  These are found more in the south of the Indus (the Greater Indus Valley) than in other regions, where animal figurines are dominant<sup id="cite_ref-234" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-234">[234]</a></sup>. The vast majority of human images are female with elaborate headdresses and jewellery.  They have been interpreted as mother goddesses and fertility figures or as votive figurines; however, it is the men who are naked and with prominent genitals rather than the women<sup id="cite_ref-235" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-235">[235]</a></sup>.  They are found in domestic contexts suggesting household worship<sup id="cite_ref-236" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-236">[236]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-237" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-237">[237]</a></sup>.</dd>
<dd>There are very few sculptures. A "dancing girl" of bronze may or may not be involved in ritual.  The "priest-king", interpreted as a theocratic figure, wears a robe decorated with trefoils, which may have some religious significance; but there is no justification for his title<sup id="cite_ref-238" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-238">[238]</a></sup>. None of the other pieces is found in a context that makes it clear they are divine images.</dd>
<dd>Most importantly, there are several great baths, the largest of which is at Mohenjo-daro.  This points to rituals involving bathing<sup id="cite_ref-239" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-239">[239]</a></sup>; and the placement of the Great Bath on the Citadel at Mohenjo-daro, with restricted access, points to some restriction in participation. At this point, however, even evidence for a specialist priesthood is not forthcoming.  An urban civilisation, with high levels of economic organisation, there is not as much evidence for hierarchy as in other ancient civilisations; and although there is evidence of some<sup id="cite_ref-240" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-240">[240]</a></sup> it is unclear how that impacted on ritual organisation.</dd></dl>

This is perhaps the most appealing suggestion to emerge from this study of the Indus system of beliefs because it is so harmonious with the artifactual and architectural evidence. The terra-cotta fogurines, lingas, <i>baetyls</i>, and yonis could all be very nicely accounted for in this view of Indus veliefs. The same is true for the fire altars at Kalibangan and perhaps Lothal, although at Kalibangan there is a suggestion of some civic level of use as well. If fire was used as a part of Indus ritual, and there is no reason to say that it was or was not, many of the hearths that have been found in Indus settlements might have been used for such daily worship. The Indus practice might even have involved using the household cooking hearth as the ritual hearth in some very sensitive expression of household renewal linked to the preparation of food, sustenance, and continued well-being. This speculation has gone well beyond the ability of the evidence to support it, but the key point is that the ordinary domestic hearth should not be ruled out as a possible center for daily worship."<sup id="cite_ref-308" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-308">[308]</a></sup></dd>

However, there is relatively abundant evidence for purification rituals, and the sense of cleanliness and well-being that likely accompanied such rituals may well have been euphoric.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ animal fights and hunts ♥</b> NOTE: None of the sources suggest that ritual animal fights and hunts were a significant activity, or were indeed at all performed, during the Mature Harappan. However, the following quote does show that anthropomorphic figures confronting large, dangerous animals, as well as wearing items made from large, dangerous animals was a key theme in Harappan iconography. Because in so many other contexts similar iconography has been interpreted as reflecting the performance of ritual animal fights (e.g. at Catal-hoyuk, in Pre-Dynastic Egypt, in early Crete), it seems reasonable to infer, here, that these may also have been performed in Harappan sites. "Bulls and water buffalo played a major role in Harappan iconography. Massive bulls were a popular subject for figurines and were also shown on seals; the presence of cattle bones in the pit associated with a fire altar at Kalibangan and in another at Rakhigarhi indicates that cattle were chosen as sacrificial victims. Headdresses made from the horns of a buffalo or less commonly of a bull were worn by figures that seem to represent deities in mythological scenes on seals and in other contexts. Buffalo horns, often with pendant stars or associated with pipal leaves or flowers, also appeared on pottery from the Early Harappan period onward. A jar from Padri in Gujarat is decorated with a buffalo horn motif and with a large figure in a ragged skirt wearing an enormous pair of buffalo horns. Buffaloes frequently appear in scenes on seals or tablets, often in combat with humans. In some, a figure wrestles one or two animals; in others, a man stands with one foot on the animal’s bowed head and pierces its body with a spear. "Scenes of combat between man and beast also feature tigers. In some, a male or female figure strangles two tigers; in others, a tiger is attacked by an individual with a bull’s head. Some terra-cotta figurines depict tigers or other felines, and tiger stripes are shown on some of the figures identified as deities. In some scenes a stick figure sits in a neem tree, watched by a prowling tiger looking back over its shoulder. The figure balances on the tree branch with its legs in a similar posture to that of the stone sculptures, squatting on the heels with one knee raised; it is slender, wears neither clothes nor jewelry, and is apparently genderless. It seems that bovids and tigers, magnificent and powerful creatures, played a major and balancing role in the iconography of the Indus civilization, both individually and in combination. Both appear in later Indian religion, as vehicles for deities, as manifestations of gods in their more terrible forms, and as their opponents: for example, the goddess Durga riding a tiger and slaying the buffalo demon, Mahishasura. While the buffalo and bull, as well as the unicorn, are depicted as unmistakably male, tigers are not and may perhaps have been female, another significant duality."<sup id="cite_ref-373" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-373">[373]</a></sup></dd>

</p><p>For the purposes of this project we define an institution as a system of social norms that governs the behavior of individuals in certain contexts, with social norms understood simply as socially transmitted rules of behavior. Institutions are also understood as being generally persistent across generations, changing only slowly over time although sometimes changing suddenly through some shock or radical social change. A classic example of an institution is marriage, which governs the behavior of the spouses in the context of their family and household. Particular norms within this institution describe the expected division of labor, rights and obligations of the partners, their children, and in-laws, etc. Because norms are socially transmitted rules, they are an example of a cultural element (by our definition, culture is any kind of socially transmitted information). There are other definitions of norms and institutions, but the one given here was chosen for its compatibility with the theoretical framework of cultural evolution (and this definition is not incompatible with alternative ones, e.g. institutions as alternative equilibria). It is often useful to distinguish formal from informal institutions. In the following, we will ask whether an institution is legally prescribed (part of a constitution or formal law code) or something that is an unwritten rule that, nevertheless, reflects the way things are done, and are expected to be done.
</p><p>We define 'elite' as the top social, political, economic, and/or religious members of society. In the codes below, when we say to code as 'equal to top nobility', we are referring to the society's elite groups and families. 'Higher than top nobility', then, refers to the ruling family, and 'lower than top nobility' refers to all people at a lower status than the elite groups and families.

<p>While the codes above reflect a legal or explicit right of some group to constrain the executive power, below code for non-formal limits. These include social or cultural norms which limit the action that can be seen as legitimately undertaken by the executive, for instance an unwritten restriction against an executive making changes to or decisions on religious matters. It is possible to code for all four combinations of absent/present along the formal/informal institution. So there could be the legal right to criticize a chief executive but it’s never used. Or, there may not be a law that specifies how the ruler is criticized, but there is an established practice of doing so. Where coding ‘present’ provide explanation and examples. Note that you should only code non-violent actions (so a rebellion that overthrows the head of state is not an instance of informal ‘impeachment’)

<p><b>♠ RA ♣ Enrico Cioni ♥</b>
</p><p><b>♠ Expert ♣ Alessandro Ceccarelli ♥</b>
</p><p><b>Description of the Normative Ideology</b>
</p><p>"Two contrasting features characterize the Harappan civilization: very marked standardization of many aspects of life and very marked heterogeneity in others, some as fundamental as religious practices. It seems that the people of the Indus civilization, from different backgrounds, often with different beliefs, all subscribed to the overarching ideology of the Harappan state, which must have had a religious component reflected in the cardinal orientation of the settlements and the strong emphasis on water and purification. This was also apparent in the social and economic spheres, where the shared ideology was displayed in aspects of personal appearance, such as ornaments of beads and shell, and in the standardized forms taken by most artifacts, throughout the Harappan realms." <sup id="cite_ref-414" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-414">[414]</a></sup>
</p><p>Possehl infers that the following four were key aspects of Indus ideology:
</p><p>"1. The Indus peoples were nihilists who sought to bring a new sociocultural order to the Great Indus region.
</p><p>"2. Urbanization and city life were a part of this new ideology.
</p><p>"3. The physical and symbolic aspects of water formed a part of the Indus ideology. M. Jansen calls it <i>wasserluxus</i>, a term I have integrated into my position on Indus ideology.
</p><p>"4. The Indus ideology promoted technological prowess and innovation.
</p><p>"[...]
</p><p>"The immense differences between the Indus Civilization, as compared to the Early Harappan, can be seen as a replacement of the older Early symbolic system with a new order and way of life. The Indus peoples turned their backs on their own past and replaced it with this, a new order and way of life. Archaeologists see this new order, or ideology, expressed as new signs and symbols such as new artifact styles, architecture, town planning, innovations in technology, and the like.
</p><p>"The changes in settlement location that take place with the Mature Harappan can also be interpreted as an attempt to break with the past: stop living where the old traditions linger, build a new settlement where the new ideology will prosper. This is expressed in the archaeological record as abandoned Early Harappan sites and Indus sites founded on virgin soil. For example, Mohenjo-daro is thought to be a 'founder's city,' a place planned and built on virgin soil. Not all of the large Indus settlements were like this. Harappa, for example, has a very impprtant Early Harappan occupation and a transitional occupation into the Mature Harappan. But there is a proclivity for Indus sites to be founded on virgin soil: 755 out of 1,058 sites, or 71 percent. Of the 523 Early Harappan sites we know of 324 (62 percent) were abandoned prior to the Mature Harappan. This finding documents the observation that the Indus peoples tended to build new settlements, on fresh soil, abandoning their past in the form of the places that were home to their ancestors. The rate for the founding of Indus new settlements is significantly greater than that for the other stages of the Indus Age.
</p><p>"I think of this kind of behavior as 'nihilistic,' a concept with many connotations. The one used here is as an ideology that espouses great, even revolutionary, change, in a sociocultural system whose past has come to be seen as vacuous, baseless, even corrupt, or perhaps just wrong. Nihilists are those whose attempt to deny their heritage and replace it with a new order, or ideology. This resonates with my strong sense that the Indus Civilization brings with it a sense of originality, something new and fresh.
</p><p>"{...]
</p><p>"The sociocultural complexity of the Indus Civilization is distinctive in two important ways: the absence of temples or other monumental buildings serving the religious institution and the absence of monumental residences for kings and elites of this sort. The Indus ideology did not admit such sociocultural expressions. Just as this ideology inhibited such expressions. Just as this ideology inhibited such expressions, they were promoted in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. [...] I sense in the Indus peoples a marked distrust in government, per se, especially strong, centralized government.
</p><p>"In the absence of a strong, centralized religion and religious monuments, the Indus ideology emerges as of prime importance. The ideology lacks firm substance in terms of monumental buildings (gigantic pyramids, ziggurats, temples, etc.) and therefore may have ben more in the mind of the Indus peoples than a physical reality that they gazed upon in awe and fear. Like being a 'good Marxist' was valued in the formed Soviet Union, being a 'good Harappan' may have been what was valued by the peoples of the Indus Civilization. The ideology, like religion in the archaic state, thus emerges as the central force in Indus social control and allegiance." <sup id="cite_ref-415" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-415">[415]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of equality ♣ inferred present ♥</b> Burial data suggests an overall egalitarian ideology. Moreover, there is no hard evidence for social hierarchies of any kind, though some people could afford higher-quality goods than others. However, some sources speculate that Harappan civilisation was characterised by a caste-like social divisions, based perhaps on ritual purity: "The caste system, fundamental to the structure of Indian society in later times, has its basis in the concept of ritual purity. Contact with many elements of organic life introduces ritual pollution, and bathing can remove this in many cases. As different activities convey different degrees of pollution, a hierarchy is created by the activities that individual groups can perform and by other related practices: For instance, vegetarianism is more pure than meat eating, and various types of meat, such as game, are less polluting than others. While the caste system is the product of millennia of evolution, its origins may well lie in the religious beliefs of the Harappans.//Kenoyer (1989, 188) singles out a number of features relating to a hierarchy based on ritual purity that would be visible in the material record: segregation of living areas; private water sources, drainage, and waste disposal; and distinct types of vessels for preparing, cooking, and serving food. He points to the existence of separate sectors in the Harappan settlements, such as the walled citadel (though he notes the absence of such divisions in some small sites such as Allahdino) and the emphasis on privacy in the home, exemplified by the arrangement of the entrance to prevent the direct viewing of or access to the interior courtyard; to this one can add the restrictions on access within areas of the settlements and even within some structures. There were private wells and well developed systems of drainage and waste disposal in many Harappan settlements.//While in other societies, the quality and material of artifacts may provide an indication of the wealth of different groups and their ability to command access to restricted resources, it is possible that hierarchy among the Harappans may have been organized along different lines. If ritual purity were the key factor in determining status, as it may well have been, those higher up the status scale would be identifiable by their possession of artifacts and materials thought to be more pure. In traditional South Asia, materials such as metal that can be purified after use are more pure than those that cannot, such as unglazed terra-cotta. Different styles of particular objects may also be associated with people in different ritual status groups, usable among themselves but liable to be polluted if used by individuals of lower ritual status: For example, at Mohenjo-daro Dales and Kenoyer (1986) identified five different varieties of cooking vessel that might have been used by different status groups." <sup id="cite_ref-434" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-434">[434]</a></sup>

Contact with many elements of organic life introduces ritual pollution, and bathing can remove this in many cases.

He points to the existence of separate sectors in the Harappan settlements, such as the walled citadel (though he notes the absence of such divisions in some small sites such as Allahdino) and the emphasis on privacy in the home, exemplified by the arrangement of the entrance to prevent the direct viewing of or access to the interior courtyard; to this one can add the restrictions on access within areas of the settlements and even within some structures.

<dd> <b>♠ Ideological thought equates all ethnicities ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> The following quote suggests that Harappan society was constituted by several different ethnic groups. It might be reasonable to infer from this that ethnic difference was tolerated by official ideology, but, overall, too little is known about Harappan ideology to code this variable with much confidence. "The marked heterogeneity of some aspects of Harappan life, including such fundamental matters as religion, probably owes much to the diversity of cultural backgrounds from which its people sprang. In the centuries before the emergence of the civilization, these included indigenous hunter-gatherers and fishers, farmers and pastoralists of local stock, and others whose ancestors came from the Indo-Iranian borderlands, as well as those who still had their homes in the latter region. Differences in artifacts suggest that there were a number of distinct cultures within each of these broad economic and ethnic groupings. The universal adoption of the overarching Harappan ideology, most clearly shown by the widespread move during the Transition period to settlements constructed according to new principles, masks much of this heterogeneous background, but features of the regional groups that emerged after the collapse of Harappan urban culture in the early second millennium suggest that perceptions of ethnic and cultural identity were not entirely sub- merged by the shared experience of being Harappan during the Mature Indus period." <sup id="cite_ref-440" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-440">[440]</a></sup> It is worth noting that, as of early 2017, no DNA or isotopic tests have been carried out to determine the ethnic origins of the human remains found at Harappan sites.</dd>

<dd> <b>♠ Ideological thought distinguishes rulers and commoners ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> "A prominent feature of most civilizations is evidence of the ruling elite: palatial residences, rich burials, unique luxury products, and propaganda such as monumental inscriptions and portrait statuary or reliefs. Strikingly, these are all absent from the Indus civilization." <sup id="cite_ref-442" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-442">[442]</a></sup> Possehl speculates that, instead of a king, "Indus peoples were ruled by a series of 'coucils' or gatherings of leaders, rather than a king. Age and gender probably counted for much in the determination of leadership, as did adherence to and practice of the Indus ideology. There may have been civic councils for individual settlements, regional councils for the Domans or the political unit above the civic, and possibly a supreme 'Indus Council.' I sense in the Indus peoples a marked distrust in government, per se, especially strong, centralized government." <sup id="cite_ref-443" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-443">[443]</a></sup> For her part, McIntosh speculates that Harappan society was ruled by a theocracy of priests: "In some ways, however, the dichotomy between temporal and religious authority is a false distinction. In all ancient civilizations, whatever the form of government, the rulers governed through divine sanction. The gods were always the ultimate authority in society, and the rulers the channel through which their will was done. In this sense every society was a theocracy. [...] To my mind, the model of a society in which power was vested in the priesthood fits the Harappan evidence.//The elusive trappings of power, the emphasis on the use of water for purification, and the suggestion of segregation rather than glorification all accord better with a spiritual than with a temporal elite and head of state. The absence of overt evidence of the use of force as a sanction for unacceptable behavior suggests that the intangible threat of divine punishment was the main sanction that kept potential wrongdoers in line and ensured conformity with the requirements of the social order. Communities are generally very effective in administering and policing such a system themselves, without the need of intervention by the state." <sup id="cite_ref-444" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-444">[444]</a></sup> It is possible, but not certain, that either Possehl's councils or McIntosh's priests were seen as superior to other members of Indus society, perhaps because of a king of proto-caste system: "The caste system, fundamental to the structure of Indian society in later times, has its basis in the concept of ritual purity.

This includes generalized impersonal punishment/reward (e.g., karma, mana) as well as punishment by specific supernatural beings. Include specific details of the nature and extent of punishment/reward in the description. Code “compound” moral actions (e.g., filial piety = kin + respect) in multiple categories as necessary.

<dd> <b>♠ Endemic malnutrition ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> "The physical examination of individuals from the excavated Harappan cemeteries indicates that the Harappans in general were well nourished and en- joyed good health, suggesting that social differences were not marked by dif- ferential access to adequate food and care. Admittedly these burials are only a sample of the population and not necessarily a representative one.//Around seventy skeletons from the R-37 cemetery at Harappa were examined: They were found to have been generally well fed and healthy, although three showed signs of arrested growth, due to childhood malnutrition or ill- ness. Many individuals had, however, suffered from dental caries and other dental disease, due to a diet high in soft foods such as processed cereals. Women’s teeth were worse than men’s, suggesting that men had access to a more balanced diet: This may reflect cultural differences in the treatment of the sexes. Significantly, the occasional signs of childhood malnutrition were also found in female rather than male skeletons.
