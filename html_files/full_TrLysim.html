<p>The Thracian kingdom under Lysimachus constituted only a short period in the history of the area. The Odrysian Kingdom was present in Thrace before it was conquered by Philip II, then ruled by Alexander the Great until his death in 323 BCE. Lysimachus, one of Alexander’s Successors, took over governorship of the area and eventually declared himself king in 306 BCE. Lysimachus ruled with an expansionist policy, and extended the kingdom to its furthest reaches by around 300 BCE.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> His reign was however, very short lived. He was defeated at the Battle of Corupedium by Seleucus (ruler of the Seleucid Empire) in 281 BCE and his territories became part of the Seleucid Empire.
</p><p>The evidence of Lysimachus’ reign is very limited and, “There is almost no direct information as to Lysimachus’ administration, nor do we know the site of his headquarters before Lysimacheia’s walls rose in 309 BCE.” <sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> There is however a certain amount of continuity with the Odrysian Kingdom before the Macedonain conquest which may provide some proxy information on Thrace under Lysimachus. In addition, there is some evidence that Thracian rulers continued to rule under or with Lysimachus, although the exact nature of their relationship is not clear. The earlier reigns of Philip II and Alexander, and the subsequent reign of Seleucus, have not been coded on this page as those polities have separate pages. It was only under Lysimachus that the area was ruled relatively independently, and only during this time that the boundaries were extended to include the Konya Plain.

“The state of Lysimachos was a typical Hellenistic “personal monarchy” (generally: Burnstein 1980; 1986; Lund 1992: 107-183; Делев 2004: 170-171; 329-353). It was ruled by a Macedonian ruler and aristocracy with the participation of some locals such as Bytis and Paris, citizens of Lysimacheia, supposed to be of Thracian or Thracian-Phrygian origin. The royal domains and the subjected poleis were governed by strategoi or epistat appointed by the King.” <sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>
</p><p>“In Asia Minor, the Hellespont and Thrace, from the 280s BC, at least, the <i>strategos’</i> authority extended to the Greek cities lying within the satrapy; his intervention might take various forms and is often beneficent in effect.” <sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> Lysimachus’ <i>strategos</i> of the Ionians: “Until recently, only one incumbent of the post was known to us, the Milesian Hippostratus, philos of the king and recipient in 289-8 BC of conspicuous honours awarded by the cities of the Ionian koinon. Now, another strategos, Hippodamus, also from Miletus, has stepped out of the shadows, courtesy of a recently published inscription from Chios.” <sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>

<p>Bablylon, 323 BCE. “In 323 BC, at Babylon, Lysimachus had received the newly created satrapy of Thrace; how he felt about this assignment must remain unknown.” <sup id="cite_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-90">[90]</a></sup>
</p><p>Wars of the Sucessors, 322-321 BCE, “Brief glimpses of Lysimachus during these conflicts do show him taking sides, though his co-ooperation is largely restricted to grants of access to his strategically important territory, apparently stopping short of military support on a large scale. The outcome of events suggests that on both occasions his choice was sound, contributing to his enhanced prestige and security.”<sup id="cite_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-91">[91]</a></sup>
</p><p>War against Antiogonus, vs. Allies, 315-311 BCE. (Lund, p58-60) “Lysimachus’ success in the recent war had won him formal recognition as ruler of Thrace, but the allies’ action from 315 BC to 311 BC had not put sufficient pressure on Antigonus to compel his surrender of the Asian satrapies demanded in 315 BC.” <sup id="cite_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-92">[92]</a></sup>
</p><p>Revolt, 313 BCE, Seuthes, Lysimachus - possibly a marginal victory by Lysimarchus, resulting in the continuation of the agreement with Seuthes as before (Lund, p28). “Lysimachus reacted swiftly; the speed of his advance, perhaps a lagcy of campaigns with Alexander, seems to have caught the cities unaware… Nothing suggests that he had to face a united army from the poleis. Odessus was besieged, then Istria.” <sup id="cite_ref-93" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-93">[93]</a></sup> Lysimachus however failed to capture Callatis, possibly because of financial aid to the city from Antigonus. <sup id="cite_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-94">[94]</a></sup>
</p><p>Campaign of 302 BCE against Antigonus, Cassander of Macedon with Lysimachus of Thrace. <sup id="cite_ref-95" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-95">[95]</a></sup> “An offensive into Asia Minor appealed to the self-interest of both kings; its success would give Cassander a much-needed breathing speace in Greece and remove from Macedon the pressure posed by the revived Leage of Corinth. In return, Cassander, was prepared to grant to Lysimachus the troops whose lack may have deterred him from such an offensive before. For the king of Thrace, the march to Asia in 302 BC carried with it a chance to win the territory there which he had claimed in 315 BC and been denied in 311 BC.”<sup id="cite_ref-96" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-96">[96]</a></sup>
</p><p>Battle of Ipsus, 301 BCE. Antigonus vs. Lysimachus and Seleucus
</p><p>War with Dromichaetes, 294-292 BCE. “In the event, the army which finally faced Dromichaetes was clearly at its last gasp. Lysimachus sustained crushing losses: his personal surrender is variously ascribed to nobility or thirst!”<sup id="cite_ref-97" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-97">[97]</a></sup>
</p><p>Battle at Corupedium, 281 BCE, Lysimahcus against Seleucus. Lysimachus was killed and Seleucus took over the Thracian territories.<sup id="cite_ref-98" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-98">[98]</a></sup>
</p><p><br>
This section lists all wars in which the polity engaged during the period described by the 'duration' variable. Each war in the list is linked to a data sheet devoted to coding the war characteristics.
</p><p>The war name format: <i>Name of war, Date war began, Belligerent A, Belligerent B</i>
</p><p>Example: <b>Russo-Japanese War, 1905, Russian Empire, Japan</b>
</p><p>Note: sieges should start with "Siege of" to show it is not a battle. Except for rare exceptions, no battle should be listed as "Battle of" write the name only as this helps alphabetical indexing of battles. The battle format applies to land and sea battles. When the literature refers to a "raid" this should be coded on the siege template if it concerns a city/urban area. If the raid is on a temporary army encampment, it should be coded as a battle.
</p><p>The war template is given in the next section of this Code Book.

<p><b>♠ War name ♣  ♥</b> If the war does not have a name in the literature, choose a simple name which names the belligerents such as "Roman-Parthian." Style suggestion: do not include the word "war" in the war name. The First Punic war would be coded as "First Punic."
</p><p><b>♠ Alternative names for war ♣  ♥</b> Sometimes the war is known by more than one name. If the name may sound obscure to non-specialists use this field for a simple alternative: an alternative to the "First Punic" war would be "Roman-Carthage".
</p><p><b>♠ War date ♣  ♥</b> Date from earliest to last conflict in this war.
</p><p><b>♠ War belligerents ♣  ♥</b> List all belligerents involved in any battles/sieges of this war.
</p><p><b>♠ Meta-conflict ♣  ♥</b> Present/absent. Is this war part of a group of conflicts that span a much larger timeframe between the belligerents? For example, the "First", "Second" and "Third Punic" wars are conflicts within the Roman-Carthage meta-conflict. These wars are coded as separate wars, rather than grouped together and coded as a single "Roman-Carthage" war.

<p><b>♠ Inter-polity ♣  ♥</b> absent/present. This variable tells us whether this was an external (interstate) war (code Present), or internal (civil) war (code Absent).
</p><p>The next four variables are relevant only if the war was internal (however, some external wars have an internal component, so it is possible to code Inter-polity = Present and Popular uprising = Present). Because civil wars often involve several dimensions, code 'Present' as many of the following variables as apply.
</p><p><b>♠ Intra-elite ♣  ♥</b> absent/present. Between different elite factions.
</p><p><b>♠ Popular uprising ♣  ♥</b> absent/present. Rebellion involving primarily commoners; taking place in the central regions of the polity (unlike a separatist rebellion).
</p><p><b>♠ Military revolt ♣  ♥</b> absent/present. Insurrection lead by a military leader involving components of armed forces.
</p><p><b>♠ Separatist rebellion ♣  ♥</b> absent/present. Rebellion in a region aiming to secede from the center.

<p><b>♠ Same ethnic group ♣  ♥</b> Present/Absent. Both sides come from the same ethnic group and speak the same dialect of the common language. Most civil wars will fall into this category, unless there is a significant cultural distance between the two parties.
</p><p><b>♠ Different dialects  ♣  ♥</b> Present/Absent. Opponent groups perceive each other as having distinct ethnic identities demarcated by a significant dialectal difference, but still speaking a mutually comprehensible language but within the same linguistic group.
</p><p><b>♠ Different languages  ♣  ♥</b> Present/Absent. The opponent groups speak mutually unintelligible languages, but similarities between languages are apparent to them. Examples include English and Dutch, or Italian and Spanish, but not English and Italian (although both are Indo-European languages, the kinship between them is not apparent to a nonspecialist).
</p><p><b>♠ Different language families  ♣  ♥</b> Present/Absent. The opponent groups speak mutually unintelligible languages that have no similarities apparent to them. Examples include English and Chinese, or Italian and Hindu(although in the second example both are Indo-European languages, the kinship between them is not apparent to a nonspecialist).
</p><p><b>♠ Different religious sects ♣  ♥</b> Present/Absent. This refers to different religious denominations with the same wordl religion. E.g., Catholics vs. Protestants, or Shiites vs. Sunnis.
</p><p><b>♠ Different world religions ♣  ♥</b> Present/Absent. E.g., Christianity vs. Islam, or Islam vs. Hinduism.
</p><p><b>♠ World religion against tribal religion ♣  ♥</b> Present/Absent. E.g., Christian European settlers vs. Native American Indians.
</p><p><b>♠ Urbanism-Literacy frontier ♣  ♥</b> Present/Absent. 'Civilization' refers to cultures with developed urbanism and literacy (indicated by written records), and 'barbarism' (in the non-pejorative sense) is a culture without developed urbanism and literacy.
</p><p><b>♠ Steppe frontier ♣  ♥</b> Present/Absent. Settled agriculturalists vs. nomadic pastoralists

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Yasna ♥</b> After the region was conquered by Alexander the Great, "The <i>magi</i> continued to preserve the [Zoroastrian] religion. There was no higher collective authority, as under the Achaemenid government. We have therefore to imagine regional differences in the practice of the religion. the <i>magi</i> were accordingly responsible for the way in which the religion developed: they had a monopoly on religious tradition. This had far-reaching consequences, for the joyful and affirmative faith which we recognize in Zarathustra's own hymns was altered and made more prescriptive and rigorous. It now became a question of exacting observation of very strict rules, and there were extreme penalties for any violation. [...] It is reasonable for us to conclude that in the course of Seleucid times [and, probably, under the rule of Lysimachus--RA's inference] the <i>magi</i> established an extensive web of temples of fire, even if they have not been found, thereby creating firm centers for the practice of religion; and this must have been important at a time when the prevailing powers were quite unconcerned with the preservation of Iranian religion. The observance of temples of fire had become as far spread as Asia Minor, as we learn, for example, in Strabo (4.1.3a): 'In Cappadocia (for there the seat of the magi, who are also called firekindlers, is large) ... they ... have fire temples, noteworthy enclosures; and in the midst of these there is an altar, on which there is a large quantity of ashes, and where the magi keep the fire ever burning.

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Sanction of executive by government ♣ inferred present ♥</b> However, this only applies to one city trying to prevent tyrannism. "Our knowledge of tyranny at Ilium rests on a strongly worded law prescribing severe penalties for anyone attempting to support or uphold an oligarchic or tyrannical regime. Grammatically, the text is curious; its main body, with conditional clauses, suggests a preventive measure against future or potential dangers; the final section, marked by imperatives, looks like legislation drafted in the light of experience. Consequently its meaning is disputed; some see the law inspired by Ilian determination to avoid the unhappy experience of tyranny suffered by neighbouring states; others see the ‘vague’ section as a blueprint drafted by exiled democrats and published on their return to power.46 On stylistic grounds the text has been dated to the early third century BC; Dittenberger noted the lettering’s similarity to that of the Aristodicides dossier, issued under Antiochus I. Though loss of the first lines precludes a certain dating, Bruckner’s date of 281 BC has received general credence. For him, the decree follows the expulsion of a tyrant supported by Lysimachus. Nothing in the text links the tyranny to Lysimachus, but the belief that he was persona non grata at Ilium has lent the theory some weight. Three pieces of evidence are cited in support of Lysimachus’ ‘unpopularity’; cult honours for Seleucus at Ilium c. 281 BC; Sigeum’s shortlived bid to break away from the synoecism with Ilium, which Lysimachus had engineered; Ilian destruction of the city walls built by Lysimachus by the time of the Galatian invasion of 278 BC.47" <sup id="cite_ref-245" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-245">[245]</a></sup></dd>

<dd> <b>♠ Motivation by belief in supernatural agent ♣ present ♥</b> Lysimachus did prosocial acts both for diplomatic reasons and to honour the gods, presenting himself as a dedicated ruler.  "Unwillingness to compete directly with Cassander may have stopped Lysimachus from any comparable intervention in Athenian affairs, but his diplomatic initiative was swiftly followed by generous benefactions. The gifts he sent, perhaps on Philippides’ advice, were designed to remind the Athenians of the disasters which the last years of Demetrius’ patronage had brought. A gift of 10,000 medimnoi of corn, distributed to all citizens, presented a marked contrast to the poor harvests of 302 BC, when hailstones which destroyed the crops were attributed to divine displeasure at the hubris of Demetrius and his Athenian followers. Still more pointedly, a new mast and sail for the peplos ship for the Panathenaia of 298 BC, reminded the Athenians of the festival of 302 BC when the figures of the gods embroidered on the sacred peplos had included Antigonus and Demetrius; ominously, the mast had broken during the procession.21" <sup id="cite_ref-250" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-250">[250]</a></sup> "The significance of benefaction, however, goes beyond short-term profit. By acting to relieve distress caused by famine, earthquake or enemy devastation, by honouring the gods to ensure divine favour for themselves and their people, the Successors mirrored the action of those who had successfully ruled before them. In this way they reinforced the idea of themselves as the latest in a long line of kings who stood for prosperity and order. Thus tangible proofs of the king’s eunoia and eusebeia were proffered not only to cities and shrines directly under the king’s control but to both Greek and non-Greek recipients throughout the Hellenistic world. Euergetism often goes hand in hand with the acquisition of new territory. Though in crude terms this might be seen simply as a bribe, it also reflects the new ruler’s concern to show himself truly royal, aware of his kingly obligations. Both Cassander’s rebuilding of Thebes shortly after his takeover of Macedon in 316 BC and Lysimachus’ benefactions at Ilium seem to fall into this category." <sup id="cite_ref-251" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-251">[251]</a></sup></dd></dl>

</p><p><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of monogamy ♣ present ♥</b> “Greek culture as a whole was monogamous in the sense that a man was expected to have only one wife at a time (the wife being the bearer of his legitimate heirs). However, exceptions were permitted among powerful men for dynastic reasons, especially during the Hellenistic period (Alexander is a good example, and also the Ptolemies). And throughout Greek history, even ordinary men could have a concubine (pallakis), visit prostitutes, conduct affairs with boys, etc. There was no presumption of male sexual fidelity as a part of the marital state. That was strictly for wives. It was considered in bad taste to keep a concubine in the same house as one’s wife, but that was just about the only restriction. In general, the philosophers said that sexual desire was something men must suppress in order to achieve the good life; they thought that friendship was the most important value and it should always take precedence over sex. [...] The bottom line is that monogamy was the cultural expectation (supported by religion in the sense that even Zeus and Poseidon and Hades only had one wife each). The philosophers did not make much headway in changing this, and where they did, it was more in favor of abstinence (either with or without marriage) than of polygamy.” <sup id="cite_ref-323" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-323">[323]</a></sup>

<b>♠ Ideology reinforces prosociality ♣ present ♥</b> “The philosophers taught various versions of the Golden Rule, whereas traditional Greek morality said it was best to help one’s friends and harm one’s enemies. The only philosopher I can think of who specifically advocates “helping people” over “living luxuriously” is the Stoic Musonius Rufus from the first century CE, but he may have been an innovator in that respect. In general the Greeks had no religious or philosophical teachings to compare with Jewish and Christian teachings about almsgiving, gleaning, or caring for “widows and orphans.” Greek cities sometimes gave stipends to orphans if their fathers had died in battle defending the city.  The most important traditional religious teaching on this subject was that the gods required people to treat “strangers and suppliants” well. That is, you should assist strangers who come to your door in need (and definitely not harm them). You can see this when Odysseus disguised as a beggar receives hospitality (Homer was a basic school text in the Hellenistic period) or in the Hellenistic myth of Baucis and Philemon, a very poor elderly couple who received two strangers and gave them hospitality. The strangers turned out to be Zeus and Hermes, who rewarded the couple. The belief that the gods “tested” humans by coming down to earth was common Hellenistic Asia Minor, where Paul and Barnabas were mistaken for Zeus and Hermes in disguise (Acts 14). Hellenistic philanthropy was closely tied to piety because the benefactions were usually things like sponsoring a festival or enhancing a sanctuary. Sponsoring a festival meant entertainment and free food distribution, but the main goal was not necessarily to help the poor—it was more to enhance the public good. I think it is very likely that the teachings of philosophers encouraged these sorts of activities, but of course the donors also benefited from increased prestige.” <sup id="cite_ref-324" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-324">[324]</a></sup>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Ideology forbids slavery for co-ethnics ♣ absent ♥</b> “I am not aware of any explicit condemnation of slavery as an institution by any ancient philosopher, nor any movement, large or small, to abolish slavery. Zenon, the founder of Stoicism, owned slaves according to his biography (by Diogenes Laertius). Two anecdotes about Zenon: "They say that he was once scourging a slave whom he had detected in theft; and when he said to him, 'It was fated that I should steal&nbsp;;' he rejoined, ‘Yes, and that you should be beaten.’ …’On one occasion, when he saw a slave belonging to one of his friends severely bruised, he said to his friend, “I see the footsteps of your anger.”’ The principal Stoic teaching about slavery (notable in Seneca and Musonius Rufus, but surely drawing on earlier teachers) was that masters should not mistreat slaves and should remember that a slave is not an inferior person, only one with a worse fortune. Both Stoics and Epicureans made much of the idea that ‘true slavery’ is not external but an internal matter: whether one is a slave to one’s desires and emotions. Thus every slave can be ‘free’ and every master can be “enslaved” depending on their character. Even Epictetus, who was a slave himself, did not advocate the abolishment of slavery (nor of course did the Christians). It seems to have been unthinkable to them, given how embedded it was in the social and economic structure of their society. Traditional Greco-Roman religion had nothing doctrinal to say about slavery as a social institution, so far as I can tell; in practice it was accepted and not regarded as problematic. It is true that sanctuaries sometimes owned slaves, just as they owned land or other forms of property. During the Hellenistic period, religious devotion to certain deities was conceptualized as a form of willing slavery; this is known in Ptolemaic Egypt, for example. People would ‘enslave’ themselves for a period to gods like Sarapis.” <sup id="cite_ref-329" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-329">[329]</a></sup></dd>

Even Epictetus, who was a slave himself, did not advocate the abolishment of slavery (nor of course did the Christians). It seems to have been unthinkable to them, given how embedded it was in the social and economic structure of their society. Traditional Greco-Roman religion had nothing doctrinal to say about slavery as a social institution, so far as I can tell; in practice it was accepted and not regarded as problematic. It is true that sanctuaries sometimes owned slaves, just as they owned land or other forms of property. During the Hellenistic period, religious devotion to certain deities was conceptualized as a form of willing slavery; this is known in Ptolemaic Egypt, for example.

<dd><b>♠ Ideology forbids slavery universally ♣ absent ♥</b> “I am not aware of any explicit condemnation of slavery as an institution by any ancient philosopher, nor any movement, large or small, to abolish slavery. Zenon, the founder of Stoicism, owned slaves according to his biography (by Diogenes Laertius). Two anecdotes about Zenon: "They say that he was once scourging a slave whom he had detected in theft; and when he said to him, 'It was fated that I should steal&nbsp;;' he rejoined, ‘Yes, and that you should be beaten.’ …’On one occasion, when he saw a slave belonging to one of his friends severely bruised, he said to his friend, “I see the footsteps of your anger.”’ The principal Stoic teaching about slavery (notable in Seneca and Musonius Rufus, but surely drawing on earlier teachers) was that masters should not mistreat slaves and should remember that a slave is not an inferior person, only one with a worse fortune. Both Stoics and Epicureans made much of the idea that ‘true slavery’ is not external but an internal matter: whether one is a slave to one’s desires and emotions.

<dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of purity ♣ present ♥</b> "Hesiod is generally quick to remark that the gods are pleased when the rites are performed correctly, and are displeased when proper ritual purity is not obtained. [...] We can also observe different grades of divine anger: libating with unwashed hands renders the ritual null and void, and the gods refuse to communicate with the worshipper. The failure to achieve the required state of purity results in the failure of the ritual. A graver and more serious offence is committed when someone crosses the river without prayer and the ritual washing—then the gods are not only irate, but also keen to punish. This makes sense: the rivers are divinities, and by entering them humans establish a particularly close contact with the divine. It is one of the basic premises of Greek religion that gods abhor pollution, which is why ritual cleansing is a necessary prerequisite for every ritual action. This would imply that entering a river requires a particularly stringent adherence to ritual purity, while avoiding this purification inspires a particularly harsh punishment—a punishment for jeopardizing the god’s own purity. The intensity of the contact with the divinity corresponds directly to the intensity of the purity required for the worshipper and to the severity of the divine punishment if this requirement is violated."<sup id="cite_ref-360" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-360">[360]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ care/harm ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> “The philosophers taught various versions of the Golden Rule, whereas traditional Greek morality said it was best to help one’s friends and harm one’s enemies. The only philosopher I can think of who specifically advocates “helping people” over “living luxuriously” is the Stoic Musonius Rufus from the first century CE, but he may have been an innovator in that respect. In general the Greeks had no religious or philosophical teachings to compare with Jewish and Christian teachings about almsgiving, gleaning, or caring for “widows and orphans.” Greek cities sometimes gave stipends to orphans if their fathers had died in battle defending the city.  The most important traditional religious teaching on this subject was that the gods required people to treat “strangers and suppliants” well. That is, you should assist strangers who come to your door in need (and definitely not harm them). You can see this when Odysseus disguised as a beggar receives hospitality (Homer was a basic school text in the Hellenistic period) or in the Hellenistic myth of Baucis and Philemon, a very poor elderly couple who received two strangers and gave them hospitality. The strangers turned out to be Zeus and Hermes, who rewarded the couple. The belief that the gods “tested” humans by coming down to earth was common Hellenistic Asia Minor, where Paul and Barnabas were mistaken for Zeus and Hermes in disguise (Acts 14). Hellenistic philanthropy was closely tied to piety because the benefactions were usually things like sponsoring a festival or enhancing a sanctuary. Sponsoring a festival meant entertainment and free food distribution, but the main goal was not necessarily to help the poor - it was more to enhance the public good. I think it is very likely that the teachings of philosophers encouraged these sorts of activities, but of course the donors also benefited from increased prestige.” <sup id="cite_ref-364" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-364">[364]</a></sup> Overall, though, this does not properly constitute enforcement.</dd>

<dd><b>♠ respect for authority ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> “It depends on what kind of authority. The rule of law was the most widely respected principle, starting from the time of the early Greek law codes in the Archaic period, when the culture moved from “self-help” family vigilantism and rival strongmen to a system in which men were expected to rely on the state to punish crime and decide civil disputes. Then it was a case of how widely power would be distributed among the citizens—in a kingship, an oligarchy or a democracy. The tyrannos or tyrant early on got a bad reputation precisely because he put himself above the law. During the Hellenistic period, the big problem was how to distinguish between legitimate rulers and tyrants, who were to be despised. Generals were constantly freeing states from the “tyrannies” imposed by their previous rulers and being hailed as saviors. There is much discussion in the literature of how Hellenistic cities reconciled the contradiction between the “freedom” they so highly valued and their obedience to a king. The kings permitted favored cities to self-govern (within certain limits), and this is what they considered “freedom,” quite different from the true autonomy of a Classical polis.” <sup id="cite_ref-366" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-366">[366]</a></sup> Overall, though, this does not properly constitute enforcement.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ purity ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> “As I have suggested at the beginning of this paper, the idea that a ritually cleaned body cannot free a person from guilt and cannot be a sufficient requirement for a harmonious relationship between mortals and immortals can be understood as an implicit criticism of rituals. We have already seen that Euripides, one of the most sensitive and innovative intellectuals of the Classical period, criticized both the undifferentiated application of the ritual of supplication and the lack of a distinction between a pure body and pure thoughts. This suggests that the development of the idea of the purity of the mind and its priority over the purity of the body was part of a more general process of fundamental changes in the perception of rituals in Classical and Hellenistic Greece. This process leads from the traditional view that ritual actions are effective when correctly performed to the idea that a ritual’s efficacy depends (also) on the moral and other justifications of the individual who performs it. We may observe this process from the late fifth to the third centuries BCE in measures for the exclusion of criminals from asylum, in the development of a new type of curses, in moral requirements for initiation into mystery cults, and more generally in a tendency towards a priority of the word and the thought over the ritual action.” <strong class="error mw-ext-cite-error">Cite error: Closing <code>&lt;/ref&gt;</code> missing for <code>&lt;ref&gt;</code> tag</strong> "These gold coins, called chrysoi and mentioned in other inscriptions,49 were not local but were staters issued on the Attic weight standard by Philip, Alexander, or Lysimachos." <sup id="cite_ref-367" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-367">[367]</a></sup></dd>

<p><b>♠ Degree of taxation ♣ ♥</b> Some entities are tax-exempt: "Certainly the campaign of 302 BC suggests Lysimachus was aware of the need to woo the cities. Imitating the policy implemented so successfully by his own brother on Alexander’s behalf in 334 BC and used by Antigonus to win Caria two decades later, he offered continued ‘freedom’ to cities like Lampsacus and Parium which defected to him. Those which resisted, like Sigeum, Erythrae and Clazomenae were punished. Sigeum was garrisoned; Erythrae probably lost its tax-exempt status.36 At Ephesus, however, fears regarding military security seemingly vied with the desire to conciliate so wealthy and powerful a city. Despite its resistance, Ephesus was left ‘free’; Lysimachus’ general Prepelaus acknowledged the Artemis temple’s tax-exempt status and freedom from military billeting; possibly the city was also given greater control over the sanctuary revenues. As a vital naval base for Demetrius, however, Ephesus could not be left ungarrisoned and its fleet was destroyed.37" <sup id="cite_ref-372" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-372">[372]</a></sup>
