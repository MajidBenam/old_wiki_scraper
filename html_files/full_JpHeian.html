<dl><dd>The Heian period (794-1185 CE) began when the Emperor Kammu (r. 781-806 CE) moved the capital from Nara to Heian (Kyoto) in 794 CE. The imperial court maintained centralized control over the main islands of Japan and was the centre of a vast, highly bureaucratic administration system.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> The period's peak can be considered to run from 794 to 930 CE, a phase of prosperity and cultural and artistic florescence.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> However, the imperial court's isolation from the realities of government, elaborate internal power dynamics and court intrigues eventually weakened the central government and contributed to the rise of the provincial warrior class.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> The period ends with the establishment of the Kamakura Shogunate.</dd></dl>
<p><i>Population and political organization</i>
</p>
<dl><dd>Beginning in the proceeding Nara period, the imperial court had based its bureaucratic system on that of the 'statutory' (<i>ritsuryō</i>) regime of the Chinese T'ang court. The Nara style of administration continued to be implemented by the Heian emperors until the 850s CE. While the government still maintained 'the conception and rhetoric of Confucian government', its functions were carried out by other means, with increased competition for offices, and, due to the dominance of the Fujiwara family, an increasingly narrow focus on factional concerns.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> Although knowledge of Chinese culture had been considered the mark of a cultured individual for much of the Heian period, by its end a distinctly Japanese cultural identity had started to emerge.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Over the course of the Heian period, the imperial family and nobility became increasingly divorced from the realities of government, preoccupying themselves with 'dilettantish pastimes' and matters of protocol above matters of state. While this led to a florescence of the arts and the refinement of etiquette, it also indirectly allowed the provincial warrior class to increase their power because the day-to-day tasks of governance in the provinces were left to them.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> Another factor in the rise and consolidation of power by the warrior class at the expense of the nobility was the changing patterns of land ownership. By the late 10th century CE, with the end of public land allotment, private land ownership had proliferated, much of which was exempt from taxation, significantly affecting the revenue of the government. The nobles' presence at court meant that vast private land holdings were controlled by estate managers on behalf of absentee landlords - further weakening the centralized government and contributing to the emergence of feudalism in Japan.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> The personal power of the emperors also waned throughout the period, with the rising prominence of imperial regents, consolidating the power of the Fujiwara family, and the early abdication of emperors in attempts to form a 'cloister government' to counter the Fujiwara regents' control of young puppet rulers.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The institution of a standing army of professional warriors contributed to the rise of a class of militarized landed gentry in the provinces. This in turn laid the foundation for the rise of the shogunate, the military government which would dominate Japan until the 1800s, leaving the emperor as little more than a figurehead.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<b> ♠ Administrative levels ♣ 5 ♥ </b>
</p>
<dl><dd>'Chinese was the basis of government, both ideal and practical. A bureaucratic system carefully modeled after that of the T'ang and referred to by historians as the "statutory" (ritsuryo) regime had reached its apogee in the eighth century. By the beginning of the Heian era, the system had already begun to evolve in new directions; by the beginning of the tenth century, although the conception and rhetoric of Confucian government remained, as did its forms and usages, many of its functions were being carried out by other means. Aristocrats and their clients competed for office, empty or not, within its bureaucracy. Chinese provided the medium for the memorials, decrees, codes, administrative regulations, ordinances, commands, communications, and certificates by which the government functioned. <sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup>&nbsp;:'At first, strong emperors used the established bureaucratic machinery to administer the country. This was a continuation of Nara-style administration and lasted until about 850. Subsequently there was a period of two centuries during which the Fujiwara family dominated the court and governed through puppet emperors. This meant that administration paid at least as much attention to narrow Fujiwara family concerns as to broad national interests. <sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup></dd>
<dd> 'Down through the administrative structure - from the heads of offices around the emperor to those in charge of local offices in distant regions - ran a hierarchy of office titles and ranks. Heads of the highest offices held the title of director (kami) who had assistants (suke), secretaries (jo), and clerks (sakan). (These four office titles were written with different characters but pronounced in the same way when held by officials serving in different ministries and agencies.) According to the Yoro adminstrative code of 718, the number of officials in the two councils and eight ministries totaled 331. If lower-ranking officials are added, the total was 6,487. Ranks provided a more precise indication of status than titles did, for officeholders with the same title had different ranks yielding different stipends and perquisites. The Taiho code set aside four imperial ranks (hon) for princes and near relatives of the emperor and thirty court ranks (kurai) for persons lower in the aristocratic order. The son or grandson of a nobleman holding the highest imperial rank was automatically awarded a junior fifth rank lower grade court rank when he reached the age of twenty-one. Special treatment for anyone with a fifth rank or above - apart from the rights that their sons had to a high rank when they turned twenty-one, irrespective of ability - is revealed by the generous stipends and retainers they received'<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> 'The structure of the imperial court was a complex affair. The following chart depicts the basic outline, but each division and ministry contained a hierarchy of officials. Some divisions also included subdivisions. Despite the formality of this structure, the operation and functionality of any particular ministry fluctuated depending on the particular time period. There were also aristocratic families who came to dominate a particular court function through the use of heredity.' <sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>5.Emperor </b>
<dl><dd> 'At the apex of the structure was the emperor, whose will was expressed in decrees (mikotonori) and edicts (semmyo). Important decisions, such as those pertaining to appointments and promotions of high-ranking officials, were recommended at meetings of the Council of State but were carried out only with imperial approval. The two codes placed no limitations on imperial authority, thus giving the emperor, legally at least, despotic control. <sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup></dd></dl></dd>

The vast, untamed territory that they inhabited was divided into two very large provinces: Mutsu (present Fukushima, Miyagi, Iwate, and Aomori Prefectures) on the east, and Dewa (present Yamagata and part of Akita Prefectures) on the west. The Ezo continued a dogged resistance for centuries, harassing the encroaching settlers and launching raids by mounted archers on the government's palisades and administrative bases. The innumerable expeditions of conscript troops sent against the Ezo in the eighth century had few successes until the government recruited skilled horsemen from the Kanto area and adopted some of the combat tactics of the enemy. In 801, with the large expeditionary force led by Sakanoue no Tamuramaro (758-811), the Barbarian-subduing Generalissimo (seii taishoguri), conquest was almost complete.

</p><p><b>Description of the Ritual System</b>
</p>
<dl><dd>‘Japanese religious traditions consist of both indigenous and borrowed religions. Shinto, the “way of the kami (gods),” is the term used to describe Japan’s indigenous tradition, although Shinto as an organized tradition with common doctrines and practices probably dates back no further than the medieval period.’ <sup id="cite_ref-198" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-198">[198]</a></sup> ‘The foreign traditions of Buddhism and Christianity impacted Japan during the medieval and early modern periods. Buddhism was introduced to Japan in the sixth century from the Asian mainland and quickly became the religion of the aristocrats and the imperial family, thus assuming political significance. It was not until Japan’s medieval period that Buddhism became broadly diffused throughout Japanese society.’ <sup id="cite_ref-199" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-199">[199]</a></sup> ‘Although individual Japanese religions can be discussed, it is important to bear in mind that in many periods of Japanese history—including the medieval and early modern—distinctions between traditions were not very sharply drawn. This was true both in terms of a person’s worship and in terms of Japanese culture more generally.’ <sup id="cite_ref-200" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-200">[200]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>‘Religious rituals, though directed to numerous different ends, were often intended for life cycle events such as birth, marriage, and death. Religion was often intimately connected to the everyday, rather than directed beyond daily life. Festivals, too, celebrated various key events in the life of a community. Festivals were held in celebration of the harvest, the New Year, and to honor the spirits of the dead. Both rituals and festivals were methods of personal purification, showing appreciation for the fertility of the land, making offerings to honor the gods, Buddhas, and ancestors, requesting help in troubled times, and seeking the welfare of the community.’ <sup id="cite_ref-201" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-201">[201]</a></sup></dd>
<dd> ‘Annual observances celebrated at the imperial court beginning in the Heian period (794-1185[CE]) differed radically from those held in farm villages. Whereas court ceremonies derived in large part from Chinese customs, village rituals tended to be indigenous and related to rice agriculture.’ <sup id="cite_ref-202" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-202">[202]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>'One of the more significant developments of the one hundred and fifty years before the beginning of the Heian period was the creation of capital cities designed on a Chinese model. That development was significant for two major reasons. First, it suggests that the state was conceived of in a radically different way than it had been in the past; second, it brings to light a new type of relationship between the center and the periphery, and between the imperial lineage and its surrounding houses and clans. In the realm of ritual and liturgical organization this meant, consequently, that centralized ritual practices would play a strategic role in the formulation of imperial legitimacy.'<sup id="cite_ref-203" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-203">[203]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>'Ritual and liturgical practices of the Heian period are marked by the creation or enlargement of shrines (jinja) and temples (tera) supported by the government, by the codification of rituals performed therein, by the emergence of new schools of Buddhism, by the appearance of a preeminence of practice over theory, and by the association of kami with buddhas and bodhisattvas worshiped in adjacent Buddhist temples. These associations resulted in the emergence of specific cults of great importance, the analysis of which yields an adequate understanding of varied but distinctly related dimensions of Heian cultic life.<sup id="cite_ref-204" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-204">[204]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>'A salient feature of the world of shrines during the Heian period was the reformulation and codification of ritual practices under the aegis of the government and the dominant sacerdotal lineages.This reformulation appears in the Procedures of the Jogan Era {Jogan gishiki) promulgated in 869-71, and in the Procedures of the Engi Era {Engi shiki), completed in 927 but promulgated in 967, which unified the preceding procedures. These documents indicate that the "worship of the kami of Heaven and Earth" was redefined during the Heian period according to specific notions held by the government. Indeed, although little information is available on ritual conduct before the Heian period, it is probable, and in some cases evident, that most of the rituals classified and determined in great detail in those Procedures were substantially different in the Nara period.'<sup id="cite_ref-205" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-205">[205]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>'Even a cursory reading of the Engi shiki impresses upon the reader the fundamental features of ritual in shrines during the Heian period: the performance of codified behavior on the part of a strictly defined social body within the confines of particular spatial arrangements at strictly defined times of the year, month, and day, and focusing on a specific relationship to a divine entity, expressed by purification and by various offerings among which the offering and sharing of food took precedence.<sup id="cite_ref-206" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-206">[206]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p><b>Shinto</b>
</p>
<dl><dd>‘Unlike many religions, Shinto has no founder and does not view any single text as its sole scripture. Shinto is closely associated with the Japanese sense of cultural identity. Shinto emphasizes practice over thought or formal doctrine. There is not a formal Shinto theology or rigidly codified set of moral rules. Shinto is intimately connected with the agricultural cycle and a sense of the sacredness of the natural world. The worship of kami and other ritual practices express these concerns... Ritual practice is central to Shinto traditions and includes such activities as purification, food offerings, dance, and festivals honoring the gods. While kami may be worshipped at shrines under the supervision of Shinto priests (kannushi), they can also be worshipped individually at a shrine or in the home. Further, Shinto associations (ko) provide yet another avenue for interaction with the kami.’ <sup id="cite_ref-207" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-207">[207]</a></sup> ‘On the one hand, Shinto describes an organized set of doctrines and practices related to the state. This perspective on Shinto is strongly tied to the mythology and founding stories of the imperial family, especially as expressed in the Kojiki (Record of ancient matters, compiled in 712). Shinto was important to the legitimating narratives by which the imperial family justified its right to rule. This aspect of Shinto was conspicuous for the rituals performed expressing the intimate connection between emperor and kami.’<sup id="cite_ref-208" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-208">[208]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>'there is a question concerning the definition of phenomena to which the tradition itself gave the name Shinto. When the term appears during the medieval period, it refers to specific ritual and doctrinal systems related to particular shrine-temple multiplexes, never to an overarching, nationally accepted body of doctrine and ritual. "Shinto" as a system of belief totally independent from Buddhism did not exist before the Edo period, and even then the term denoted a system heavily impacted by Neo-Confucianism, Taoism, and yinyang notions and practices. In the Heian period the realm of shrines exhibited indigenous and imported creeds, practices, and institutions; these were rarely at odds with the world of temples.' <sup id="cite_ref-209" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-209">[209]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p><b> Buddhism</b>
</p>
<dl><dd>'Buddhism originated in India and spread to China about four centuries after the time of the historical Buddha Sakyamuni (ca. fifth to fourth century, B.C.). It was transmitted to Japan from China via the Korean peninsula around the middle of the sixth century. The cultural gulf that existed at that time between Japan on the one hand and China and Korea on the other was considerable. Japan's ruling class accepted Buddhism as the embodiment of an advanced and superior civilization, and in order to gain control over the concepts and technology that Buddhism brought to Japan, the elite provided a succession of large temples where Buddhism could put down roots.'<sup id="cite_ref-210" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-210">[210]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Aoi Matsuri ♥</b> "In the life of Heian, no ritual or ceremony was more representative of the capital and its society than the regular Kamo Festival, which took place every year in the fourth month. The festival was both ritual and ceremony, functioning on the one hand to guard the city and its people, and on the other to affirm and display the bonds that held the community together. It was also, as almost all rituals and ceremonies were in part, an entertainment, providing one of the great spectacles of the city's year...The explicit purpose of the Kamo Festival was to pay homage to the Kamo deities and to secure their protection of the court and the capital. Originally worshiped as deities of the ancient Kamo clan, the gods were enshrined in two locations in the northern part of the Kyoto basin: at the Lower Shrine near the confluence of the Kamo and Takano rivers and at the Upper Shrine a couple of miles farther north on the east bank of the Kamo. There were two central figures in the festival: the Kamo Vestal and the Imperial Messenger. The Vestal was a near-princess chosen by divination at the beginning of each reign, or whenever the post fell vacant. Her role is not altogether clear, although it is  obvious that it was modeled on that of the Ise Vestal, who was considered the Chief Priestess of the Ise Shrines and lived there. The Kamo Vestal, who was first appointed in the reign of Emperor Saga, lived at a special palace called Murasakinoin on the northwest outskirts of the capital. Her role seems to have been simply to maintain ritual purity and to represent the emperor at the festival. The Imperial Messenger was a Fifth-Rank courtier holding the office of Middle or Lesser Captain of the Imperial Guards, and thus usually a man destined for high office. He read an imperial rescript at the shrines and presented the emperor's offerings, which was the chief object of the festival. The Vestal and the Messenger were accompanied by ten dancers and twelve musicians, who were also courtiers from the Imperial Guards. Their duty was to perform an ensemble of music, dance, and song called "Eastern Music" (Azumaasobi) at the shrines." <sup id="cite_ref-211" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-211">[211]</a></sup> NOTE: Aoi Matsuri is an alternative name for this festival. The following is most likely also relevant: "The structure and meaning of the [typical Shinto] festival follows a basic tripartite sequence, namely the invocation of the kami , the offerings to the kami , and the final communion with the kami at the shrine (jinja). At the invocation of the kami , the priests in full ceremonial dress purify themselves (shūbatsu) in order to take part in the rituals. The inner building (honden) of the shrine complex is opened up and the go-shintai (symbol of the kami) is viewed by the priests. Priests are also expected to practice abstinence (saikai) before major festivals. With the participating leading laymen in robes of state, the priests form a procession that moves down the sando (the approach road to the shrine) to meet the kami at the appointed place. It is here that the duly purified laypeople become responsible for transporting the kami around the shrine precincts and throughout the community, in an omikoshi , for example. "Offerings to the kami (shinsen) come next, normally comprising rice; salt; water; rice wine (sake); rice cakes (omochi); fish, usually tai (seabream); seaweed (konbu); vegetables; grain; and fruit. Speeches are made, after which the ritual part of the festival is closed. Classic forms of entertainment have long been associated with shrine festivals, particularly kagura, a dance performed by shrine maidens (miko). Bugaku is another genre of classical Japanese dance with special music. The entire cycle of Noh drama has its roots in Shinto myths, rituals, and festivals. Kami are portrayed in the introductions to the various epics."Finally, there is communion with the kami (naorai). Casks of sake are broken open and drunk from a wooden masu (a square cup made of Japanese cypress). The combination of the aroma of the wood and the taste of the sake is probably one fragrance uniquely associated with Shinto and Japan. This aspect of the festival is especially important in Japan: social drinking as a religious act to commune with the kami in addition to the ritual use of sake. This happens after any major festival and often becomes a major party with the organizers, the high priest, and other priests present for as long as worshippers remain. In past eras, a liberal view was taken of sexual activities during such periods of celebration." <sup id="cite_ref-212" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-212">[212]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ matsuri ♥</b> NOTE: Though normally Seshat policy is to code a specific ritual rather than a "type" of ritual, it does not seem that a particular one of the traditional Japanese festivals was more widespread than the others. Of course, following consultation with experts, it may turn out that one matsuri was indeed significantly more euphoric than the others--but, even then, the data gathered below should still be useful. "Ceremonies in monasteries and shrines generally attracted enormous crowds. It was an opportunity for setting up market and, for the folk of the surrounding countryside, to come and amuse themselves. [...] A motley and picturesque crowd gathered within the temple precincts on feast days: blind <i>biwa</i> players, troubadours, showmen with monkeys and trained animals, puppeteers, magicians, jugglers, mountebanks, acrobats, singers and dancers, wandering monks explaining the meaning of holy images or preaching, the faithful playing in loud voices and striking gongs hanging on their breasts. [...] After every ceremony there were usually performances of <i>dengaku</i> and many kinds of dances, religious otherwise, staged by monks, by <i>chigo</i> or by men from neighbouring villages, competitions of 'linked' verse or <i>renga</i>, a variety of entertainments in the course of which artists in white and red costumes, both men and women, delighted the crowds in a myriad ways. [...] Sometimes the crowd was so dense that, to better enjoy the sights, people perched themselves on walls, roofs and branches of trees." <sup id="cite_ref-264" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-264">[264]</a></sup> For a better sense of the more properly ritual phase of these occasions, the following is a description of a generic matsuri. Even though this quote refers to the way the ritual is performed in modern-day Japan, another source, Nelson <sup id="cite_ref-265" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-265">[265]</a></sup>, that "[t]he rituals that can be observed today at any major shrine are, according to many priests, fairly continuous with those of the Heian period, which is thought of as an idealized or ‘golden’ age of Shinto." "Festivals follow a basic sequence of events to which local communities add particular activities (described subsequently) and a touch of local color depending upon the occasion. No matter the festival and no matter the place, the fundamental sequence of events follows a tripartite structure: the invocation of the kami, the offerings to the kami, and the final communion with the kami. "Invocation of the Kami. This part consists of inviting the kami in proper fashion to visit and meet the people. The shrine is specially cleaned and the priests undergo purification before commencing any activities. "Shubatsu. The priests in full ceremonial dress purify themselves in order to take part in the rituals. The inner building (honden) of the shrine complex is opened up and the goshintai viewed by the priests. This is performed after purification and is a ritual conducted entirely by the priests themselves, with no lay witnesses present. [...] Thereafter, the people taking part in the festival are purified so that the kami may be ceremonially invoked and invited to come to the shrine. "Opening of the Gate. Along with the participating leading laymen in robes of state, the priests form a procession that moves down the sando, the approach road to the shrine, to meet the kami at the appointed place. Here the duly appointed laypersons become responsible for transporting the kami into the shrine and throughout the community. The kami may be borne in a mikoshi. The meeting is effected; and the kami usually accompanies the procession to the shrine building, where the most sacred place is opened. The community follows the procession to the shrine, each group having assembled in its locality bearing the kami to the shrine. When everyone is assembled within the shrine grounds, the next stage of the festival can commence. "Offerings to the Kami. The kami is welcomed to the community and by the community, and then offerings are made. The offerings and order of events are as follows: "Shinsen. The offerings usually placed on the altar are rice, salt, water, rice wine (sake), rice cakes (omochi), fish (usually tai sea bream), seaweed (konbu), vegetables, grain, and fruit. [...] "Aisatsu (Greetings). The chief priest (Guji) delivers an address of welcome. "Gifts are presented to the kami from the parishioners. These usually include flowers, money in special envelopes, food in rice bags, and sake in special drums called taru. These are usually on display in the public building of the shrine. "Entertainment: Music and Dance, and Martial Arts. Classic forms of entertainment have long been associated with shrine festivals. [...] "Removal of the Shinsen. The offerings are removed from the altar and taken away for various uses. [...] "Closing of the gate. The main events involving the priests conclude with the closing of the gate and the consequent closing of the inner sanctum. The priests have finished their work, and there remains only the sacramental act of drinking sake with the kami to bring everything to an end. "Communion with the Kami (Neorai). Casks of sake are broken open and drunk from a wooden masu, a square cup made of Japanese cypress. [...] This aspect of the festival is peculiar also to Japan--social drinking as a religious act to commune with the kami in addition to the ritual use of sake. This happens after any major festival and often turns into a party with the organizers, the High Priest, and other priests present. The naorai is held not only after festivals but after misogi or other shrine rituals and activities. It is typical of the Shinto approach to life and the kami, one of celebration in a festive mood. Communion with the kami also enriches the communion of the people among themselves. "Chinkon (Calming of the Soul). This is a form of silent meditation within the shrine precincts at the close of major rituals (sometimes including festivals) when people reflect upon the significance of what they have been doing. They try to both conserve and draw from the experience they have had while performing the rituals. Chinkon takes place after the misogi rituals but before the naorai. Although it is a Shinto concept, it was popularized by Buddhism during the Heian period [...]" <sup id="cite_ref-266" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-266">[266]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ seasonally ♥</b> According to Picken, all modern-day shrines host a matsuri on the following occasions: Oshogatsu (New Year), Setsubun-sai (a Spring festival inspired by Chinese traditions), Haru Matsuri (Spring Festival), Natsu Matsuri (Summer Festival), and Aki Matsuri (Autumn Festival). It seems reasonable to infer that matsuris marked the seasons in medieval times as well, especially as "[t]he rituals that can be observed today at any major shrine are, according to many priests, fairly continuous with those of the Heian period, which is thought of as an idealized or ‘golden’ age of Shinto." <sup id="cite_ref-267" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-267">[267]</a></sup> In addition to these festivals, it seems also likely that each shrine had its own local celebrations.</dd>

Purification: Whether it consists of simply rinsing the hands and mouth with water or with waving a wand of white paper streamers in the air over the heads of priests, trays of offerings, or that gleaming new car brought to the shrine for blessing, the first step is the preparation essential for making the environment and the individuals within it ready to petition, receive, and entertain the Kami’s presence. "2. Presentations: As one kneels upon the tatami within the Hall of Worship, one sees a high table laden with various kinds of fruit, vegetables, seaweed, and rice cakes, which surround the core offerings of uncooked rice grains, salt, water, and two bottles of sake. Whether the observance is merely for the benefit of one person or aspires to the good of the entire nation, the core offerings to the Kami are part of every shrine ritual. Sometimes simple, sometimes including over one hundred styles of food at the Grand Shrine of Ise, it is safe to say that a ritual without food offerings is unthinkable in Shinto practice. "3. Petitions: Scholars have debated whether the food offerings or the formal prayers are more important, but ask any chief priest and he will immediately answer that the norito, or ‘words spoken to the Kami,’ are the main part of any ritual. Beautiful, correct words, intoned with reverence and awe, bring about good influences. This is one of the oldest attitudes of Japanese religious practices (or of any ritualized system of practices, including Catholic and Hindu), deriving from an ancient belief in kotodama, a spiritual power residing in words. [...] "4. Participation: After the long droning chant of the prayer, the miko commence a slow circular movement before the main altar, which marks the beginning of the last phase of the ritual. Upon completion of this sacred entertainment, the opportunity for participation is often extended to everyone in attendance when leafy sprigs from the sacred sakaki tree (native only to Japan) are distributed. Each person follows the example of the head priest in slowly coming forward, bowing, amd then placing the little branch on a small table as a means of linking the individual to the divine. After the actual service is over and the priests have filed out of the hall, the partaking of a small sip of rice wine, called o-miki, further invests the worshipper with the blessings of the Kami." <sup id="cite_ref-309" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-309">[309]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Aoi Matsuri ♥</b> "In the life of Heian, no ritual or ceremony was more representative of the capital and its society than the regular Kamo Festival, which took place every year in the fourth month. The festival was both ritual and ceremony, functioning on the one hand to guard the city and its people, and on the other to affirm and display the bonds that held the community together. It was also, as almost all rituals and ceremonies were in part, an entertainment, providing one of the great spectacles of the city's year...The explicit purpose of the Kamo Festival was to pay homage to the Kamo deities and to secure their protection of the court and the capital. Originally worshiped as deities of the ancient Kamo clan, the gods were enshrined in two locations in the northern part of the Kyoto basin: at the Lower Shrine near the confluence of the Kamo and Takano rivers and at the Upper Shrine a couple of miles farther north on the east bank of the Kamo. There were two central figures in the festival: the Kamo Vestal and the Imperial Messenger. The Vestal was a near-princess chosen by divination at the beginning of each reign, or whenever the post fell vacant. Her role is not altogether clear, although it is  obvious that it was modeled on that of the Ise Vestal, who was considered the Chief Priestess of the Ise Shrines and lived there. The Kamo Vestal, who was first appointed in the reign of Emperor Saga, lived at a special palace called Murasakinoin on the northwest outskirts of the capital. Her role seems to have been simply to maintain ritual purity and to represent the emperor at the festival. The Imperial Messenger was a Fifth-Rank courtier holding the office of Middle or Lesser Captain of the Imperial Guards, and thus usually a man destined for high office. He read an imperial rescript at the shrines and presented the emperor's offerings, which was the chief object of the festival. The Vestal and the Messenger were accompanied by ten dancers and twelve musicians, who were also courtiers from the Imperial Guards. Their duty was to perform an ensemble of music, dance, and song called "Eastern Music" (Azumaasobi) at the shrines." <sup id="cite_ref-344" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-344">[344]</a></sup> NOTE: Aoi Matsuri is an alternative name for this festival. The following is most likely also relevant: "The structure and meaning of the [typical Shinto] festival follows a basic tripartite sequence, namely the invocation of the kami , the offerings to the kami , and the final communion with the kami at the shrine (jinja). At the invocation of the kami , the priests in full ceremonial dress purify themselves (shūbatsu) in order to take part in the rituals. The inner building (honden) of the shrine complex is opened up and the go-shintai (symbol of the kami) is viewed by the priests. Priests are also expected to practice abstinence (saikai) before major festivals. With the participating leading laymen in robes of state, the priests form a procession that moves down the sando (the approach road to the shrine) to meet the kami at the appointed place. It is here that the duly purified laypeople become responsible for transporting the kami around the shrine precincts and throughout the community, in an omikoshi , for example. "Offerings to the kami (shinsen) come next, normally comprising rice; salt; water; rice wine (sake); rice cakes (omochi); fish, usually tai (seabream); seaweed (konbu); vegetables; grain; and fruit. Speeches are made, after which the ritual part of the festival is closed. Classic forms of entertainment have long been associated with shrine festivals, particularly kagura, a dance performed by shrine maidens (miko). Bugaku is another genre of classical Japanese dance with special music. The entire cycle of Noh drama has its roots in Shinto myths, rituals, and festivals. Kami are portrayed in the introductions to the various epics."Finally, there is communion with the kami (naorai). Casks of sake are broken open and drunk from a wooden masu (a square cup made of Japanese cypress). The combination of the aroma of the wood and the taste of the sake is probably one fragrance uniquely associated with Shinto and Japan. This aspect of the festival is especially important in Japan: social drinking as a religious act to commune with the kami in addition to the ritual use of sake. This happens after any major festival and often becomes a major party with the organizers, the high priest, and other priests present for as long as worshippers remain. In past eras, a liberal view was taken of sexual activities during such periods of celebration." <sup id="cite_ref-345" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-345">[345]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ koshin mahi ♥</b> “Yet another example of Taoist practices which developed in Esoteric Buddhism is the Koshin belief, also related to longevity, which involved spending a sleepless night every sixty days on the day of the Monkey in order to prevent demonic inhabitants of the body from leaving it to report to the heavenly bureaucracy on one’s evil deeds.” <sup id="cite_ref-397" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-397">[397]</a></sup> "A religious belief has been connected with the, Koshin days in the calendar already in Han dynasty China by the folk Taoism and was imported to Japan by the ommyoji, or fortune-tellers, first and then by esoteric Buddhism. This belief has it that man's body is inhabited by the Three Worms (san shih) who are responsible for aging and loss of vitality. Ways and means to counteract their activity have been devised by the Taoists whose main concern always was to prolong life and gain immortality. One of the worms is living in the head and causing blindness, deafness, baldness, loss of teeth, stuffy nose and bad breath. The second worm inhabits the breast causing there heart palpitation, asthme, and melancholia. The third worm dwells in the loins and causes intestinal cramps, drying of the bones, fading of the skin, rheumatism in the legs, aching of the wrists, weakening of the mind and will. These vindictive enemies of man's mental and physical health and life are always out to destroy the body in which they feel imprisoned, and waiting for the death of their host. On Koshin days, of which there are six every year, the three guests of the human body ascend to Heaven and report there all misdeeds of their man for which the heavenly director of human destiny shortens the respective man's life, by 300 days for greater guilts, by three for minor ones. The worms however can only escape to Heaven while the person is sleeping, and to avoid sleeping was therefore the only safeguard against harm done by the fearful report to Heaven.//"With the influx of Chinese ideas also the Koshin belief reached Japan some time in the Nara period (710-780), if not earlier, and we find it fully developed in the ninth century. The related reports say that in the court and in aristocratic circles the Koshin machi, or Koshin vigil, was celebrated in the form of a banquet with all kinds of amusements in line with the refined taste of Heian aristocracy. Later when other mighty clans had come to power, they too enjoyed the Koshin celebrations, but it seems that they did it primarily for the sake of entertainment, less out of a belief in the fateful consequences of an omission of them." <sup id="cite_ref-398" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-398">[398]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd>‘Japanese religious traditions consist of both indigenous and borrowed religions. Shinto, the “way of the kami (gods),” is the term used to describe Japan’s indigenous tradition, although Shinto as an organized tradition with common doctrines and practices probably dates back no further than the medieval period.’ <sup id="cite_ref-580" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-580">[580]</a></sup> ‘The foreign traditions of Buddhism and Christianity impacted Japan during the medieval and early modern periods. Buddhism was introduced to Japan in the sixth century from the Asian mainland and quickly became the religion of the aristocrats and the imperial family, thus assuming political significance. It was not until Japan’s medieval period that Buddhism became broadly diffused throughout Japanese society.’ <sup id="cite_ref-581" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-581">[581]</a></sup> ‘Although individual Japanese religions can be discussed, it is important to bear in mind that in many periods of Japanese history—including the medieval and early modern—distinctions between traditions were not very sharply drawn.

Consequently, Buddhism’s ethical system emerged resting squarely on a body of preestablished forms of family practice, and supported by a fairly codified sociolegal system that had already taken form under the aegis of the Brahmanical tradition, sometime before the sixth-century bce. Thus, as a relatively late arriver, Buddhism accepted, tacitly, many of the given forms of social praxis in India. And, even when Buddhism sought to redefine religious goals and family values, these efforts were manifested vis-a-vis patterns that had already been in place for centuries. In short, whatever the exact historical reasons, one will look in vain for Buddhist spokespersons seeking to redo marriage law in India or in other Asian countries.” <sup id="cite_ref-610" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-610">[610]</a></sup>

Perhaps this was because of its close connection with Japanese Buddhism, which had enough metaphysics and ethics to serve both.” <sup id="cite_ref-611" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-611">[611]</a></sup>  According to Buddhism: “The twofold benefit of living a morally good life is linked to a twofold motivation: ‘Protecting oneself, one protects others; protecting others, one protects oneself ’ - just as each acrobat in a balancing act protects his partner by concentrating on himself, and protects himself by concentrating on his partner (see SN 47:19). If we take care of our own spiritual development, we render a service to others; and if we develop love towards others, we thereby also help ourselves. Accordingly, it is explicitly stated, someone who pursues the path of salvation only for his or her own benefit is to be censured, while the one who follows the path for one’s own benefit and for the benefit of others is to be commended (see AN 7:64).” <sup id="cite_ref-612" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-612">[612]</a></sup> “Three segments of the Noble Eightfold Path (3 - 5) are traditionally subsumed under the principle of morality (sila): ‘right speech’ (3), ‘right action’ (4) and ‘right livelihood’ (5). [...] ‘Right action’ is explained as abstaining from harming and killing sentient beings - including animals (!), and further as abstaining from ‘taking what is not given’ and from sexual misconduct, which means avoiding sexual relations with women who are still under the protection of their families, or with those who are married, betrothed, or celibate for religious reasons. From monks and nuns complete sexual abstention is demanded. ‘Right livelihood’ means abstaining from those sources of income which involve harming other beings: trading in weapons for instance, or trading in living beings, meat, intoxicants or poison; also included is the avoidance of fraud and avarice.” <sup id="cite_ref-613" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-613">[613]</a></sup>

This point is captured in one of the central Buddhist virtues: dana, which is ‘giving’ or ‘generosity’. ‘Giving’ creates a win-win situation.

This aspect of the festival is especially important in Japan: social drinking as a religious act to commune with the kami in addition to the ritual use of sake.

<dl><dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement against harm ♣ present ♥</b> In the syncretic Shinto-Buddhist ideology that prevailed for many centuries in Japan, moral values mostly came from Buddhism: “Shinto was retained in the Japanese belief structure, even though it never developed the metaphysical worldview or system of ethics that characterize world religions. Perhaps this was because of its close connection with Japanese Buddhism, which had enough metaphysics and ethics to serve both.” <sup id="cite_ref-654" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-654">[654]</a></sup>  According to Buddhism: “The heart of Buddhist spiritual life, whether lay or monastic, is puṇya (Pali puñña ). This term is usually translated as ‘merit’ and refers to certain significant kinds of action that are regarded as auspicious and potent deeds. Essentially, merit is good ‘karma’ ( karman/kamma)&nbsp;: wholesome ( kuśla/kusala ) deeds which plant seeds that bear fortunate and pleasant fruits, whether in this life or lives to come, and thereby create conditions for further meritorious action in the future. These are the kinds of action that conduce to the development of the qualities of the eightfold path. Moreover it is making merit that binds the lay and monastic communities together. The traditional ‘bases of merit’ are generosity (dāna), ethical conduct ( śīla/sīla ), and meditation ( bhāvanā ). [...]The practice of good conduct takes the form of commitment to the five precepts usually recited in conjunction with the three refuges: (1) to refrain from harming living creatures, (2) to refrain from taking what is not given, (3) to refrain from sexual misconduct, (4) to refrain from false speech, (5) to refrain from intoxicants that cause heedlessness (see pp. 170- 2). In addition the lay disciple may on special occasions (traditionally the full moon ‘observance’ days) or for longer periods take the eight precepts, replacing the third precept (refraining from sexual misconduct) with complete sexual abstinence and adding (6) refraining from eating after midday, (7) refraining from attending entertainments and using perfumes, etc., and (8) refraining from using luxurious beds.”<sup id="cite_ref-655" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-655">[655]</a></sup> “The nature of bad action is usually illustrated by reference to a list of the ten courses of unwholesome action ( karma/kamma-patha ) which consist of three bodily courses of action (taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct), four vocal courses of action (lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech, frivolous speech), and three mental courses of action (covetousness, ill-will, wrong view). [...] Essentially the psychological states that motivate the ten unwholesome courses of action— strong greed, hatred, and delusion —lead to rebirth in the unhappy destinies or ‘descents’: in a hell realm, as a hungry ghost, an animal, or a jealous god. In fact rather a precise correlation exists here: dominated by greed one becomes a hungry ghost, a class of beings ever discontent and anguished because of being unable to satisfy their greed; dominated by hatred one enters one of the hell realms where one suffers terrible pain; dominated by ignorance one becomes an animal ruled by the instincts of food and reproduction.” <sup id="cite_ref-656" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-656">[656]</a></sup></dd>

Perhaps this was because of its close connection with Japanese Buddhism, which had enough metaphysics and ethics to serve both.” <sup id="cite_ref-657" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-657">[657]</a></sup>  According to Buddhism: “In the cosmology set out above, karma functions as the elevator that takes people from one floor of the building to another. Good deeds result in an upward movement and bad deeds in a downward one. Karma is not a system of rewards and punishments meted out by God but a kind of natural law akin to the law of gravity. [...] Buddhists speak of good karma as ‘merit’ (puñña, Sanskrit: puṇya), and much effort is expended in acquiring it. Some picture it as a kind of spiritual capital—like money in a bank account—whereby credit is built up as the deposit on a heavenly rebirth. One of the best ways for a layman to earn merit is by supporting the order of monks. This can be done by placing food in the bowls of monks as they pass on their daily alms round, by providing robes for the monks, by listening to sermons and attending religious services, and by donating funds for the upkeep of monasteries and temples.” <sup id="cite_ref-658" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-658">[658]</a></sup>  “The nature of bad action is usually illustrated by reference to a list of the ten courses of unwholesome action ( karma/kamma-patha ) which consist of three bodily courses of action (taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct), four vocal courses of action (lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech, frivolous speech), and three mental courses of action (covetousness, ill-will, wrong view).

In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsāric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f ). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21).” <sup id="cite_ref-671" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-671">[671]</a></sup> “[...] Buddhism maintained a fairly flexible posture vis-a-vis competing religions and never sought to require laity to identify themselves exclusively as Buddhist or to rely singularly on the Buddhist clergy for all their spiritual needs.” <sup id="cite_ref-672" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-672">[672]</a></sup></dd>

Some picture it as a kind of spiritual capital—like money in a bank account—whereby credit is built up as the deposit on a heavenly rebirth. One of the best ways for a layman to earn merit is by supporting the order of monks. This can be done by placing food in the bowls of monks as they pass on their daily alms round, by providing robes for the monks, by listening to sermons and attending religious services, and by donating funds for the upkeep of monasteries and temples.” <sup id="cite_ref-674" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-674">[674]</a></sup></dd>

The purpose of purification is to remove tsumi (impurity) and kegare (impurity caused by various human conditions) and restore human nature to its primal and pure state. Thus the idea that human nature can in some sense return to its divine origins lies behind all other related concepts. [...] Human beings are born able to live in harmony with the divine and with nature, but because of the various forms of impurity that overtake life, purification becomes necessary. Hence the importance of purification to effect restoration.// The goal to be achieved by the performance of misogi shuho , purification using water, is the cultivation of reisei , the Shinto ideal of spirituality. As the spirit is purified again and again, it can rise to the level of the divine as its spiritual sensitivity is heightened.

He might also attempt to deter the enemy with a display of the strength of his own army. Should all peaceful means fail however he is justified in declaring war, but should do so with the sole motive of protecting his own people and should do his utmost to spare the lives of the hostile soldiers (see Zimmermann, 2000). The notion of Buddhism’s ‘state-protecting’ function was carried so far that Buddhists not only supported and encouraged wars of national defence but even became actively involved in them.

<dl><dd> <b>♠ punishment of rulers ♣ absent ♥</b> In Shinto, moral transgressions were corrected through purification rituals, not punishment - and they were not, properly speaking, “moral” transgressions. “Shinto stresses ritual purity rather than ethics and morality, and Shinto rituals are designed to counteract ritual pollution. The word tsumi indicates an offense or pollution that must be neutralized by ritual cleansing. [...] Tsumi included offenses for which a person was responsible as well as calamities over which he or she had no control. Certain acts resulting in bodily harm to others were lumped together with epidemics and natural calamities as forms of tsumi that were referred to as ‘troublesome things’ (magagoto). In general the ancient Japanese equated physical purity and brightness with righteousness and virtue; conversely, physical defilement and darkness were seen as evil and injustice. Ablutions were used as magic rites to eliminate tsumi. The common element that links all tsumi is their danger to the cosmic and social order. The primitive Japanese believed that society and the cosmos were interrelated and that disturbing one could disturb the other. As violations of the normal order of things, tsumi were to be feared because it was thought that they would invite calamity. Improper sexual relations, for instance, might lead to poor harvests. Thus rules for conduct were not based on principles considered inherently moral, and the danger caused by improper actions or unfortunate events might be removed completely by conducting the appropriate magical rites.” <sup id="cite_ref-706" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-706">[706]</a></sup> As for Buddhists, they expected rulers to be in charge of punishment, not religious agents. “The Sutra of the Golden Light lists several arguments as to why a king who rules in accordance with the Dharma must punish evil-doers and reward the good: In doing so, he demonstrates the basic principle of karma: good deeds lead to good results and bad deeds to bad ones. In this way the king establishes his subjects in good conduct. Moreover, if a king would overlook evil acts and leave the evil-doers unpunished, lawless conduct would become rife and the use of violence increase. By refraining from punishment, a king would thus support the evil-doers and become directly responsible for the growth of violence in his country. Ultimately, then, non-violence is not really an option, for non-violent rule would in fact lead to even more violence. Nevertheless the king’s motives in employing force must be selfless and lawful, his judgements impartial and the punishment measured to the crime (see Emmerick, 1970, pp. 57- 73).” <sup id="cite_ref-707" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-707">[707]</a></sup></dd>
