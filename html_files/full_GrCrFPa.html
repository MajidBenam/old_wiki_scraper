<p>With the fall or weakening of the great Eastern Mediterranean powers--the Hittites, the Assyrians, Egypt--there is evidence for a correspondingly "troubled" phase in Crete's prehistory. Most notably, the population moved from the coast to the hinterland, suggesting the coasts were no longer safe. Minoan culture continued to exist in some form, but contacts with the rest of the world were greatly reduced<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>

<p><b> ♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣ 1 ♥ </b> The settlement patterns appears to be more dispersed than before and their is no evidence for a site hierarchy<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> By the end of Late Minoan IIIB most settlements had suffered destruction or abandonment. During the next period, 1200-1000 BCE, settlement patterns changed and followed marked regional tranjectories. <sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup>  In the area of west and central Crete many sites experienced growth and retrieval (e.g. Chania, Knossos, Phaistos, and Kastelli Pediada). The growth of these sites has encouraged some scholars to assert the arrival of newcomers. The process of nucleation around certain lowland settlements surrounded by arable lands and costal sites provided with harbors is in contrast to the limited regional occupation. This pattern highlight the significant changes in economic, social and ideological aspects of local societies. The foundation of new inland sites (Sybrita and Gortyna) and the diffusion of defensible sites, although less numerous that these in east Crete, suggest complex settlement patterns able to deal with diversified environmental resources. In the area of east Crete the consequence of the LM IIIB crisis were more disruptive.  Many plain and costal sites were abandoned and new settlements were founded on strategic locations at night altitudes. The population growth and the increased in size of the upland settlements lead to a stable occupation and even to the emergence of some major sites (e.g. Kavousi-Vronda and Karphi).

<p>A collective ritual is a ritual in which two or more people participate. With the official cult we refer to the set of collective ritual practices that are most closely associated with legitimation of the power structure (including elites, if any).
</p><p><b>♠ RA ♣ Kostis Christakis; Enrico Cioni ♥</b> KC responsible for original coding. EC replaced rituals selected by KC with rituals suggested by Eleni Hatzaki and Colin MacDonald at the conference in Knossos in May 2016.
</p><p><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b>
</p><p>During this period  "there seems to be an increasing emphasis on built shrines, whether within  a settlement or isolated, and on open-air sanctuaries accessible from settlements, as at Ayia Triada; their dating is of the rather imprecise, col lack of sufficiently distinctive pottery, but many seems to be LM IIIB. The shrines have much in common with the older 'branch sanctuaries', thought there is no clear evidence that animal sacrifice was  associate with them; but there is evidence for sacrifice, and for the dedication of animal figurines, at ope-air sites, both old and new, and other types of dedication in bronze and clay were offered particularly at the Piazzale die Sacelli site at Ayai Triada. The ritual inters most commonly found associated with the built shrines, the 'goddess with upraised arms'  figures and 'snake tubes' can be derived from older sources, although the figurine sequence is patchy ad the apparent prototypes of the 'snake tubs' are virtually unique to Kato Syme and nearby Pyrgos. Yet both figures and tubs are commonly embellished with 'horns of consecration', birds and snakes, demonstrating the continuity vitality of these sacred symbols, and double axes survived, if less prominently.  Cave cults have been argued to become prominent in this period, in than many of those claimed to be colt sites have produced LM III material only. But this material has never been published in detail and interpretations relating to ordinary or 'refuge' occupation have sometimes been advanced." ... " 'Goddess with upraised arms' figures do not seem to have been found in caves, but are otherwise one of the most characteristic ritual types of LM III Crete. They often occur in groups, which are basically similar thought differing in details, and there is room for doubt whether they represent the same or different personalities. The discovery of at least seventeen in one LM IIIC deposit from Kavousi, along with many 'snake tube' fragments, suggest that perhaps they diid represent only one goddess, whose image, along with an associated 'snake tube' which apparently supported an offering vessel, was replaced from time to time; alternatively, several may have been simultaneously, as at Gazi, perhaps by different communities who used the  same site. They could still be interpreted as representing essentially local figures, the ancestors of the largely localized deities of the later Crete like Britomartis, Diktynna and Eileithyia, though conceived in the same idiom. This type did not spread to other pats of the Aegean, whereas the large wheel made animal figurine, which seems to appear first in Crete, certainly did. This capacity to develop new types of ritual item, seen in other types of figurine, including groups and centaur-like figures, testifies to the continuing vitality of the Minoan religious tradition, although no class was mass-produced like the Mycenaean figurines. The survival of traditional symbols like the double axe and 'horns of consecration' also emphasizes the strong link to the past. This amalgam of features continued into the Dark Age, when several of the ancient cult places continued or were revived, but by this time of the Minoan tradition is being recognizably  overlaid by new elements, although Cretan religion retained strong local features that may have preserved Minoan elements throughout antiquity." <sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ drinking rituals ♥</b> Despite the wealth of excavated data, it is very difficult to say which ritual <i>exactly</i> was the largest collective ritual of the official cult. However, there is evidence that ritualised drinking remained an important activity, albeit one that became more exclusive, restricted to the elites: "By the same token, the political centralization which was indicated at the end of the Bronze Age by the distribution of administrative technologies (Bennet 1990), may have meant a decline in factional competition and therefore a decline in the need for frequent public feasting and therefore wine drinking. Wine drinking now becomes a more restricted ceremonial practice, associated more with an aristocratic life style and exclusivity (cf.

Alcohol functions differently to opium, suppressing inhibition and facilitating commensality rather than individual reverie (Jay 2010, 81). It could also be used as a “carrier” to which other substances may be added, and may have been used in this way as a substitute for opium, itself perhaps the singular province of a select category of cult practitioner (Hoffman and Ruck 2004, 115)." <sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ opiate consumption rituals ♥</b> "From the second half of the 14th century BCE onwards, a typical Minoan religious symbol of fertility was the bear-breasted figurine of the goddess with the raised arms. The goddess of poppies, one of the best known of these figurines, presents the surest and most ancient evidence concerning the poppy, the extraction of opium, and the use of both not only in Crete but in the whole of the Greek world (Figure 3). This 78-cm height terracotta figurine bears on its head three movable hairpins shaped as beautiful, well-slit poppy capsules, called “mekones,” the poppies of Papaver Somniferum [6]. The goddess was found in 1937 in Crete in the secret room of a rural cult house from the Late Minoan III period (1300 - 1250 BCE) [7]. The poppy capsules that adorn the head- dress of the goddess have five to six vertical notches (Figure 3, top), which suggest that Cretans knew the method of extracting opium, by incising the unripe seed capsules of the poppy plant to gather the sap, at least since 1250 BCE [5,8]. Their methods of harvesting opium were not much different from the methods used today of circular carving [3,5]. Especially impressive are the folds in the cheeks giving a smiling effect and the lifelessness of the parting of the lips, giving her the appearance of being in a state of torpor induced by opium [5]. For this reason the archaeologist who discovered her proposed that she should be called “the goddess of ecstasy” [7]. Several scholars have argued that opium was probably used in the cult ceremonies of the goddess with upraised arms either for its healing abilities or for the purpose of inducing a state of ecstasy [3,5]. It is noteworthy that a tubular vase discovered at the same site and belonging to the equipment of the goddess is proposed that it was used for preparing inhalations of opium [7]. The finding of the remnants of a heap of coals on the ground of the room, where the goddess was found, provides further evidence that the opium was taken by the inhalation of vapours probably for psychotropic purposes [7]." <sup id="cite_ref-107" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-107">[107]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b>♠ euphoria-inducing drugs (other than alcohol) ♣ present ♥</b> "From the second half of the 14th century BCE onwards, a typical Minoan religious symbol of fertility was the bear-breasted figurine of the goddess with the raised arms. The goddess of poppies, one of the best known of these figurines, presents the surest and most ancient evidence concerning the poppy, the extraction of opium, and the use of both not only in Crete but in the whole of the Greek world (Figure 3). This 78-cm height terracotta figurine bears on its head three movable hairpins shaped as beautiful, well-slit poppy capsules, called “mekones,” the poppies of Papaver Somniferum [6]. The goddess was found in 1937 in Crete in the secret room of a rural cult house from the Late Minoan III period (1300 - 1250 BCE) [7]. The poppy capsules that adorn the head- dress of the goddess have five to six vertical notches (Figure 3, top), which suggest that Cretans knew the method of extracting opium, by incising the unripe seed capsules of the poppy plant to gather the sap, at least since 1250 BCE [5,8]. Their methods of harvesting opium were not much different from the methods used today of circular carving [3,5]. Especially impressive are the folds in the cheeks giving a smiling effect and the lifelessness of the parting of the lips, giving her the appearance of being in a state of torpor induced by opium [5]. For this reason the archaeologist who discovered her proposed that she should be called “the goddess of ecstasy” [7]. Several scholars have argued that opium was probably used in the cult ceremonies of the goddess with upraised arms either for its healing abilities or for the purpose of inducing a state of ecstasy [3,5]. It is noteworthy that a tubular vase discovered at the same site and belonging to the equipment of the goddess is proposed that it was used for preparing inhalations of opium [7]. The finding of the remnants of a heap of coals on the ground of the room, where the goddess was found, provides further evidence that the opium was taken by the inhalation of vapours probably for psychotropic purposes [7]." <sup id="cite_ref-113" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-113">[113]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ lion hunting ♥</b> Hunting emerges as an important ritual activity during the Postpalatial Period <sup id="cite_ref-125" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-125">[125]</a></sup>. In particular, there is some evidence suggesting that the hunting and/or subjugation of lions, and the use of seals depicting these activities, was a key way in which elites advertised their power and prestige. It is worth noting that lions were not present in prehistoric Crete, or, at least, they were not native to the island: instead, it seems likely that, starting from the Neopalatial Period onwards, aristocrats either imported lions from foreign lands or hunted the animals while travelling to the foreign lands themselves. "Depictions of lions in the Final Palace period tend to be seen as more conventional, with more formal poses and designs. Younger (1985: 51-2) suggests that the later lion depictions were hardly based on observation. One argument against this is provided by a sealing from Knossos which, as Rhyne (1970: 186) observed, shows a ‘hair star’ on the shoulder of the lion (Plate 6b): although this could be an observation imported from the Near East, nevertheless it points to a continuing interest in the details of lion morphology (Arkell 1948; Bate 1950; Kantor 1947). The ‘Master of Animals’ depictions are typical of the Final Palace period, most often featuring lions either side of a central figure. Bloedow has argued that, rather than seeing such arrangements as symbolic, they can be interpreted as depicting lion subjugation: ‘Clearly, this is not a fate which lions would have chosen for themselves, and so depicts in supremely dramatic fashion the sheer violence by which they had been brought into subjection’ (Bloedow 1996: 1163-4). Like hunting scenes, these seals can be seen as providing information about the practices involving lions; these later depictions make explicit the practice of subduing a dangerous animal, and so can be seen, like other depictions of lions, as indexes of a dangerous activity. [...] Even if lions were brought to Crete, however, depictions continue to show them as dangerous predators, attacking other animals. The mane is the key to lion depictions throughout Minoan seal engraving, and one can see these depictions as increasingly providing information about the animal whose mane it was. Often the information was incorrect, in comparison with modern zoological knowledge about lions, but this is not always a useful standard against which to judge these depictions. To dismiss these differences simply as poor artisanship is to overlook the fact that they can be seen as useful indicators of what the seal engraver and seal owner knew about lions. Later seals displayed the affordances of the lion as a dangerous animal to be hunted. The seal itself afforded the user of the seal a way to demonstrate knowledge of an unfamiliar animal and associate themselves with the animal practice of lion hunting. Yet these seal depictions reveal varying levels of familiarity with lions." <sup id="cite_ref-126" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-126">[126]</a></sup></dd>

In particular, there is some evidence suggesting that the hunting and/or subjugation of lions, and the use of seals depicting these activities, was a key way in which elites advertised their power and prestige. It is worth noting that lions were not present in prehistoric Crete, or, at least, they were not native to the island: instead, it seems likely that, starting from the Neopalatial Period onwards, aristocrats either imported lions from foreign lands or hunted the animals while travelling to the foreign lands themselves. "Depictions of lions in the Final Palace period tend to be seen as more conventional, with more formal poses and designs. Younger (1985: 51-2) suggests that the later lion depictions were hardly based on observation. One argument against this is provided by a sealing from Knossos which, as Rhyne (1970: 186) observed, shows a ‘hair star’ on the shoulder of the lion (Plate 6b): although this could be an observation imported from the Near East, nevertheless it points to a continuing interest in the details of lion morphology (Arkell 1948; Bate 1950; Kantor 1947). The ‘Master of Animals’ depictions are typical of the Final Palace period, most often featuring lions either side of a central figure. Bloedow has argued that, rather than seeing such arrangements as symbolic, they can be interpreted as depicting lion subjugation: ‘Clearly, this is not a fate which lions would have chosen for themselves, and so depicts in supremely dramatic fashion the sheer violence by which they had been brought into subjection’ (Bloedow 1996: 1163-4). Like hunting scenes, these seals can be seen as providing information about the practices involving lions; these later depictions make explicit the practice of subduing a dangerous animal, and so can be seen, like other depictions of lions, as indexes of a dangerous activity. [...] Even if lions were brought to Crete, however, depictions continue to show them as dangerous predators, attacking other animals. The mane is the key to lion depictions throughout Minoan seal engraving, and one can see these depictions as increasingly providing information about the animal whose mane it was. Often the information was incorrect, in comparison with modern zoological knowledge about lions, but this is not always a useful standard against which to judge these depictions. To dismiss these differences simply as poor artisanship is to overlook the fact that they can be seen as useful indicators of what the seal engraver and seal owner knew about lions. Later seals displayed the affordances of the lion as a dangerous animal to be hunted. The seal itself afforded the user of the seal a way to demonstrate knowledge of an unfamiliar animal and associate themselves with the animal practice of lion hunting. Yet these seal depictions reveal varying levels of familiarity with lions." <sup id="cite_ref-152" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-152">[152]</a></sup></dd>
