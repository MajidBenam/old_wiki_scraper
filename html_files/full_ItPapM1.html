<p>The polity period begins with the imperial sack of Rome (1527). This devastating sack at the hands of largely Protestant mercenaries-theoretically in the service of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V-marks an absolute nadir of papal fortunes for the early modern period. The sack provoked the papacy to reform itself, take the Protestant revolt seriously, and initiate the Counter-Reformation (aka the Catholic Reformation).<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> The age of the Council of Trent (1543-1563) dramatically altered the Catholic Church, enhancing the papacy's power within the Church and enhancing its ability to police the laity, with institutions such as the Roman Inquisition being established in 1542 by Paul III.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> The index of banned books was established, tighter clerical control over canonization imposed, and in general the Catholic Church ratcheted down on orthodoxy in the face of the Protestant threat.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>
</p><p>The sack of Rome was compounded by malaria epidemics and food shortages, to drastically reduce the population of Rome to perhaps 10,000 in 1527-28.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> Despite this, the city soon recovered and boomed in the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as the capital of a more or less stable Papal State, under Spanish protection. By the turn of the century, Rome's population may have been around 100,000.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> Marino has characterized the early modern city's economy as parasitic, consuming and not producing wealth<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>; Goldthwaite, similarly, describes late medieval and early modern Rome thus: "Rome, however, was a city that consumed but did not produce; in contrast to Avignon, it was not a regional export market of any importance."<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>  A major part of this consumption was cultural: "Rome...exploded [in the sixteenth century] into an enormous market for luxury goods...."<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> Despite the sack, the most important papal building project of the early modern period, St. Peter's Basilica, was completed in 1626. Spanish financial and military support was crucial to the survival of the Papal State; a famous letter of Charles V, written to his son Philip II between 1545 and 1558, declared that "'the states of the church are in the center of Italy, but [they are] surrounded by ours in such a way that one can say that they form one kingdom.'"<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> <i>De facto</i> Spanish hegemony over the Papal State would not be seriously challenged between the mid-16th century and the pontificate of Urban VIII (1623-44).<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup>
</p><p>By the sixteenth century, the papacy was firmly in control of the Papal State, and the polity was at peace after the end of the Great Italian Wars (1559). The Spanish alliance remained a cornerstone of papal policy into the early 18th century.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> The papacy ruled Rome and the State through a sophisticated bureaucracy based on patronage, cronyism, and the purchase of offices.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> The feudal barons and nobles were subject to clerical officials appointed by the Papacy.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> Although this bureaucracy was usually able to meet the basic requirements of government-collecting taxes, administering justice, and protecting subjects-this does not mean that the Papal State was free of violence, famine, and so forth. Banditry remained a major problem during the period and would straight through to the late nineteenth century.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup>
</p><p>After the end of the Wars, military action involving the papacy shifted to the Mediterranean. The Ottomans had begun raiding papal possessions on the Adriatic littoral from the mid-15th century, following the fall of Constantinople. These raids were not preludes to conquest, but were a serious disruption to trade and daily life in <i>le Marche</i>; in 1518, Selim I's forces had torched Porto Recanati, the port for Loreto, site of a major shrine to the Virgin. This imminent threat, compounded with the papacy's traditional role as organizer and propagandist of the crusade, resulted in deep papal involvement in the struggle against the Ottomans. Initially, these efforts were not successful. The major Turkish victory at Prevesa (1538) opened the Central Mediterranean to Turkish raiding and piracy; the Ottomans' alliance with the French even allowed the Turkish fleet to winter in Toulon.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> This ability of the Turks to winter in the western Mediterranean exposed the coast of Lazio to Turkish piracy; for example, Andrea Doria, leading a mixed papal-Genoese fleet, was defeated by Turks and North Africans off Terracina in 1552.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup>
</p><p>Confronted with this Turkish menace, the papacy was crucial in organizing Christian campaigns against the Turks in North Africa and Greece, and in funding coastal defences for Lazio and the Kingdoms of Sicily &amp; Naples. Pius V (1566-1572) was of particular importance in this effort, laying the groundwork for a papal fleet.<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> Pius granted major sources of ecclesiastical revenue to the Spanish Philip II, and was instrumental in organizing the councils and diplomatic wrangling that led to the creation of the Holy League in 1570, in particular convincing the Spanish to come to the aid of the Ventians.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup> The Holy League consisted of the Papacy, Spain, and Venice; by the final agreement, each party agreed to contributions for 3 years, for an annual expedition consisting of 200 galleys, 100 roundships, 50,000 infantry and 4,500 light infantry.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup> The Christian fleet met and decisively defeated a comparable Turkish squadron at Lepanto, off the Greek Ionian littoral, on 7 October 1571. It was the greatest battle in the Mediterranean in the 16th century, and it marked a substantive end to Turkish raiding on the papal lands and, more importantly, led to the division of the Mediterranean into a Turkish east and a Christian west. The papacy's international prestige rose to new heights with the victory, as well, but declined during the seventeenth century due to the grasping annexation of the duchy of Urbino and Urban VIII's foolish war of Castro in the early 1640s.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup>
</p><p>Italy enjoyed several decades of peace following the peace of Cateau-Cambresis of 1559 between France and Spain. Yet economically and demographically, the 1590s and the first half of the seventeenth century were a period of general crisis in Italy. The "decline of Italy" is a venerable aspect of early modern historiography, but depends on a particular view of what counts in assessing quality of life: see Black, (2001, 32), for an approving echo of Braudel's comments to the contrary<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> Papal revenues were aided by the popes' ability to draw on Spanish ecclesiastical revenues.<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup> Demographically, the first half of the seventeenth century was a succession of plagues and famines in many parts of the peninsula.<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup> A particularly virulent plague cycle hit Rome in 1656,<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup> dropping its population from 120,000 to 100,000.<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup>

However, this could be rebound after the depopulation that followed the sack of Rome 1527 CE, and may not represent a demographic trend as such. Even so, it was an impressive recovery despite the famines and plagues. We could use the figure again for this period as a rough guess.

Coastal fortresses became increasingly common along the Adriatic coast to defend the Papal State from Turkish raids, after 1530 or so.<sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup></dd>

<p><b> ♠ Standing armies ♣ present ♥ </b> The Spanish maintained garrisons at various points in the Papal State, to aid papal forces against the Turks and the French.
</p><p><b> ♠ Uniformity of equipment ♣ present ♥ </b> I have not been able to find evidence of papal foundries or systematized production of uniforms, but the Spanish auxiliaries of the Papacy had standardized equipment. Braudel's discussion of foundries and arms factories indicates that equipment was standardized to a certain extent, but produced outside of the Papal States-especially artillery and firearms.<sup id="cite_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-68">[68]</a></sup> One can assume, thus, that papal armies would have operated with a certain degree of equipment uniformity within individual units (i.e. artillery units, pike formations, etc.).
</p><p><b> ♠ Army size ♣ 54,000 ♥ </b> This is the total number of the proposed papal army for a war against Venice in 1606. Although never fielded, it reflects the average size of a land army by this period.<sup id="cite_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-69">[69]</a></sup> Similarly, the terms of the treaty founding the Holy League (i.e., the Papacy, the Spanish Empire, and the Republic of Venice) stipulated that the League would launch an annual Mediterranean fleet to seek out and fight the Turks. This was to consist of 200 galleys and 100 roundships, with 50,000 infantry and 4,500 light horse.<sup id="cite_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-70">[70]</a></sup> It is unclear if this full quota was ever met, however.
</p><p><b> ♠ Largest fielded army ♣ 30,000 ♥ </b> This was the size of the Holy League's fleet and army at the naval battle of Lepanto (1571); the code should be bracketed to reflect that this was a composite force consisting of papal troops but also including troops and ships furnished by Spain, Venice, and various Italian city-states (Genoa, Florence, etc.). The fleet consisted of 208 warships (mostly galleys rowed by slaves, but also some roundships fighting as floating artillery batteries. The total size of the papal contribution was only twelve ships, three thousand soldiers, and 20 cavalry.<sup id="cite_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup>
</p><p>I have not found precise figures on the various types of troops employed, but the deciding factors were the professional Spanish infantry (<i>tercios</i>) fighting as marines, the Venetian artillery ships, and the arquebusiers (musketeers). Total Christian casualties were: 10 galleys sunk, 8,000 men killed, and 21, 000 wounded.<sup id="cite_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-72">[72]</a></sup>
NB!: I coded this as the "largest fielded army" because this force actually fought, as opposed to the 54,000 in the "army size" code.
</p><p><b> ♠ Maximum logistical lag ♣ ♥ </b>
</p><p><b> ♠ Sources of recruits ♣ mercenaries ♥ </b> By this point the papacy was usually employing a mixture of mercenaries and levies from the population of the Papal States, backed up by Spanish auxiliaries or garrisons. This should probably be bracketed since armies also recruited entire regiments from voluntary levies, and the Spanish recruited individuals for their professional corps, the famous <i>tercios.</i><sup id="cite_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-73">[73]</a></sup> A more precise sense of the mixed militia-mercenary forces the papacy produced comes from 1557. In the face of a Spanish invasion from Naples, the papacy could muster only 7,000 infantry and 600 horse; many of these had only mustered to collect pay.<sup id="cite_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-74">[74]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Procurement of equipment and animals ♣ by soldiers ♥ </b> This needs a bracket; I gave it this code because of the fuzziness of the evidence.<sup id="cite_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-75">[75]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ RA ♣ Joe Figliulo-Rosswurm ♥</b>
</p><p><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b>
</p><p><b>Description of Ritual System:</b>
</p><p><i>Largest Scale collective ritual, official cult:</i> Pilgrimage remained popular during this period in the Catholic parts of Europe; pilgrimage sites besides Rome itself included, in the Papal State, the Holy House of Loreto and Santa Maria degli Angeli in Assisi.<sup id="cite_ref-101" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-101">[101]</a></sup> Pilgrimage could meld with other rituals such as confraternity meetings. One of our best descriptions of a pilgrimage to Rome comes from a Perugian confraternity, the <i>Compagnia della Morte</i>, which made the Jubilee to Rome in 1600.<sup id="cite_ref-102" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-102">[102]</a></sup> Confraternity members walked from Perugia to Rome and back, with singing, entertainment and feasting; at Rome, they visited the basilicas, and attended Mass at St. Peter's.<sup id="cite_ref-103" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-103">[103]</a></sup>
</p><p><br>
<i>Most widespread collective ritual, official cult:</i> Baptism was the fundamental rite in initiating children into the Christian community.
</p><p><br>
<i>Most frequent collective ritual, official cult:</i> The Mass remained the basic collective ritual of Catholicism, with increasing emphasis in the post-Tridentine period on the Eucharist, with parishioners encouraged to take the Eucharist more than once a year in addition to more frequent confession.<sup id="cite_ref-104" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-104">[104]</a></sup>
</p><p><br>
<i>Most euphoric collective ritual, official cult:</i> Lay confraternities consisted of people organized for a shared religious life, usually based on a rule.<sup id="cite_ref-105" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-105">[105]</a></sup> They were extremely common in this period-Rome around 1601 may have had 112 confraternities alone.<sup id="cite_ref-106" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-106">[106]</a></sup> They carried out a variety of philanthropic and devotional activities, from distributing food to the poor to flagellant processions pilgrimages. Confraternities could serve to enforce social cohesion, and make peace between rival urban factions. Mixed confraternities, in which nobles associated with commoners or artisans, especially exemplify this. Confraternities could serve to strengthen group solidarity, but they could also divide communities: as at Bologna in the late sixteenth century, where the three confraternities of Buon Gesu, Santa Maria della Vita, and S. Maria della Morte maintained their rivalry.<sup id="cite_ref-107" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-107">[107]</a></sup>
</p><p><br>
<i>Most dysphoric collective ritual:</i> Otherwise known as the Holy Office. The Inquisition was responsible for systematically repressing dissent, policing information, and prosecuting heretics, witches, and Jews. It is worth noting, however, that Italy largely escaped the witch craze sweeping trans-alpine Europe, and inquisitorial tribunals have been described as legalistic and relatively lenient.<sup id="cite_ref-108" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-108">[108]</a></sup>

"Nowhere is this popular religious enthusiasm amongst pilgrims better illustrated than in an account written by Suger, abbot of St Denis (d.1151), describing the crowds of pilgrims who were accustomed to gather at the abbey on feast days 'to seek the intercession of the saints' and 'to worship and kiss the holy relics, the Nail and the Crown'. The numbers of pilgrims were so great that not all were able to gain access to the church, whilst those inside were so tightly packed that they were unable to move. Suger described the agony of many women, who were caught in the crush and were so distressed that they cried out in pain as though in labour, whilst more were trampled underfoot. Such was the density of the crowd that often discomfort or impatience seems to have led to anger and rioting, forcing the monks displaying the relics to escape with them through the windows of the church." <sup id="cite_ref-122" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-122">[122]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ mass ♥</b> Mass was the major quotidian ritual of Christendom. The central ritual within the broader ritual of the Mass was the sacrament of the Eucharist. By the canons of Lateran IV, all the laity were required to receive the Eucharist, and thus attend Mass, at least once a year, on Easter.<sup id="cite_ref-189" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-189">[189]</a></sup> Parish priests were supposed to say Mass daily, but the attendance of the laity, as the canon just discussed would indicate, was not required.<sup id="cite_ref-190" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-190">[190]</a></sup> Because of the increasing importance attached to it on the part of the central ecclesiastical authorities during this period, we have more information on it than for the previous polity period. The sacrament of the Eucharist became central to the Mass after Lateran IV upheld the principle of transubstantiation, the principle that when the officiating priest elevated the wine and host, they became the body and blood of Christ.<sup id="cite_ref-191" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-191">[191]</a></sup> This does not mean that the principle was widely accepted; indeed, its centrality is shown by the variety of dissenting opinions recorded all over Christendom regarding transubstantiation.<sup id="cite_ref-192" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-192">[192]</a></sup> Furthermore, so-called "dry masses" were also held, in which the Eucharist wasn't consecrated; these seem to have usually been part of funeral or wedding masses.<sup id="cite_ref-193" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-193">[193]</a></sup> During this emphasis greater emphasis was laid on Christ's presence in the host, as part of the wider fixation on Christ's body, and the festival of Corpus Christi/Corpus Domini.<sup id="cite_ref-194" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-194">[194]</a></sup> An important aspect to the increased sacramental importance of the Mass during this period is its functionalization. Masses for the dead became a major aspect of late medieval religiosity, with endowments for masses for the dead becoming an important part of testamentary culture. Swanson has argued that, in general, evidence for lay peoples' awareness of what was happening at Mass "suggests an emphasis on the 'magical' and the meditative."<sup id="cite_ref-195" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-195">[195]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ daily ♥</b> Parish priests were in theory required to say mass daily, but it is almost impossible to know how stringently this was obeyed.<sup id="cite_ref-196" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-196">[196]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ daily ♥</b> Swanson, writing of the period after 1215, has noted that "How it [the Mass] fits into a liturgical round is not easily considered, for masses were celebrated with almost mind-boggling regularity and in incaluclable quantities...."<sup id="cite_ref-197" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-197">[197]</a></sup> This was true also of the tenth through the twelfth centuries; while monasteries offered liturgical masses for the dead daily, and as the tenth century went on, this became one of their main functions, especially those reformed by the Cluniacs. For a description of liturgical masses for the dead. <sup id="cite_ref-198" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-198">[198]</a></sup> "Participant" thus reflects, here, monks praying for the dead while not officiating the Mass itself.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Frequency for the audience ♣ weekly ♥</b> Defining "audience" as the laity not taking communion (regulations on which only appeared after 1215), the laity were required to attend mass once a week on Sundays.<sup id="cite_ref-199" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-199">[199]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Duration ♣ 2 ♥</b> hours. This is an estimate for a regular Mass, involving the elevation of the Eucharist. For receiving the Eucharist as the fundamental part of the mass See: (Swanson 1995)<sup id="cite_ref-200" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-200">[200]</a></sup> Similar estimate found for Merovingian France: "The celebration took approximately two hours as far as one can assess." <sup id="cite_ref-201" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-201">[201]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Typical size of participating group ♣ [80-120] ♥</b> This is a very rough estimate; getting at the typical size of a participating group would require a drastic limiting of the pool of said group (i.e., are we talking about Rome? Ravenna? Or a tiny parish such as, borrowing from Tuscany, the tiny parish of San Gavino degli Adimari, which contained even in 1347 maybe 100 people?). See (Klapisch-Zuber &amp; Herlihy) for a good discussion of the difficulties involved in determining the size of medieval settlements; their source is the Florentine Catasto of 1427, easily the most detailed demographic record that survives for medieval Europe.<sup id="cite_ref-202" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-202">[202]</a></sup> The number of 100 is based on an average-sized medieval settlement with, perhaps, 20 or 30 households/hearths (<i>fuochi</i>). It is even more hypothetical because if there were 100 people in a given settlement, one can reasonably guess that not all of these 100 people attended Mass regularly.</dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ duel ♥</b> "The modern duel lasted from the mid-sixteenth into the twentieth century. [...] "Duelling enjoyed a widespread efflorescence, leaving its mark in the cultures of many different countries. [...] The duel had several immutable characteristics, which, despite variations from age to age and country to country, continued to define the institution. These characteristics were essentially the same in, for example, Henrician France, Georgian England, colonial India, republican America and Wilhelmine Germany. The most important of these were the challenge, the presence of seconds and the etiquette of the fight itself." <sup id="cite_ref-247" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-247">[247]</a></sup> "The challenge was the first absolute requirement of the duel. Without a challenge to a duel, there could be no duel; any subsequent fight would be merely an assault or a brawl. So it was in practice, too. The challenge set in motion the formal protocols of the duelling codes. In fact, there was usually a stage before the sending of a formal challenge: this often took the form of a note, asking for an explanation of the complained-of behaviour or remarks. Such a note, it was hoped, could result in an immediate apology and an amicable settlement of the affair." <sup id="cite_ref-248" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-248">[248]</a></sup> "Politics, gambling and sex were three of the more obvious sparks that, superficially, prompted duels to flare up; after all, most duels were caused by accusing someone of dishonesty." <sup id="cite_ref-249" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-249">[249]</a></sup> "By the time the modern duel had grown into its maturity, seconds had mutated from active participants into an amalgam of umpire, cornerman and mediator. Once an argument had blown up, it was normal, if a duel was in the offing, to invite one's adversary to name a second, to whom a letter a letter could be sent, and to appoint one's own second. From this point onwards, the conduct of the duel was in the hands of the seconds; in a properly conducted affair, the principals remained in the background until they met on the duelling ground." <sup id="cite_ref-250" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-250">[250]</a></sup> "The most important duties of the second before the duel took place were, in the case of a pistol duel, measuring the ground--that is, pacing out the agreed distance between the duellists--and loading the guns. In the case of a sword duel, it was vital to ensure that the swords were of equal length and type. In both cases it was the responsibility of the seconds to see that neither man had a disadvantage on account of the ground--for example, that one duellist was not facing the low sun or did not have loose ground underfoot." <sup id="cite_ref-251" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-251">[251]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b>♠ vigil/sleep deprivation ♣ absent ♥</b> The following quote contains an excerpt from a nineteenth-century British source, but it is relevant. "The duelling protagonists of novels were plagued by unwelcome thoughts, beset by fear and worry on the eve of their encounters; one doubts that it was much different for real duellists. Certainly, the authors of the manuals for would-be duellists were anxious to offer advice about the best way in which to pass the anxious hours before the morning rendezvous in the forest. The author of <i>The Art of Duelling</i> offers his advice about 'the night before' in a chapter headed 'Precautions to be Observed'. The duellist must treat the matter 'jocosely' and 'declare war against nervous apprehension'. He suggests an obvious solution: 'That his mind may not dwell upon the affair, he ought to invite a few friends to dinner, and laugh away the evening over a bottle of port; or, if fond of cards play a rubber whist.'</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>"But the duellist and his friends should beware of overdoing it in their anxiety to take their minds off the morning's business. The author, no doubt aware of the anguish that duellists could suffer in the long watches of the night, continued: 'Should he feel inclined to sleep when he retires to rest, and troubled images disturb his imagination, let him take some amusing book - one of Sir Walter's novels, if a lover of the romantic; or, Byron's <i>Childe Harols</i>, if he delights in the sublime, and read until he drops asleep...'" <sup id="cite_ref-259" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-259">[259]</a></sup>

He saw an opportunity to exploit the Borghese's recent efforts to give their residence a more dignified setting by clearing space before it. The year before they had taken advantage of a Roman law that allowed compulsory purchase of adjoining properties by larger neighbors for purposes of beautification; they had bought and destroyed a warren of small buildings to create the neatly geometric Piazza Borghese. They made known their possession of the space in no uncertain terms: chains kept the public out, and no windows or doors could be opened onto the piazza. The Medici ruler found this vista so alluring that he at once designed an addition to his palace that would overlook the new square. But the Borghese, freshly arrived at the apex of wealth and social prominence by their acquisition of the papacy five years before, had no intention of permitting an established princely dynasty to enjoy the fruits of their labor.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Lease Rights ♣ present ♥</b> “Ownership of property (dominium) was another area where new ideas emerged. The glossators elaborated the theory of plurality of dominia, whereas according to Roman law there could only be one such property. In the case of renting (location) Roman law did not privde a ius in re, a ‘real’ right covering the arrangement, defendable against all with an action in rem relavant to the agreement. The renting of property was viewed rather, in terms of an obligatory relationship and thus defensible only against the grantor (actio in personam). But because stable arrangements of this kind had been normal since the early middle ages, the jurists constructed the locatio ad longum tempus, or long-term lease as a real provision, quite separate from that governing ownership of property. This resulted in the establishment of the dominum utile (from the Roman acito utilis) at some time between the end of the twelfth and beginning of the thirteenth century. It was agreed that were possible a rei vindication utilis (staking a claim to the property in the same way as that granted to the true owner) should apply to a rented dominum. In this way, an individual leasing property assumed a position that was closer to that of a proprietor, in the sense of being the formal holder of the land, as had already been established for vassals…and for grantees of location ad longum tempus.” <sup id="cite_ref-289" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-289">[289]</a></sup></dd></dl></dd>

</p><p><b>Inheritance System</b>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>♠ partible inheritance ♣ inferred present ♥</b> Present in Turin. Primogeniture had become the dominant tradition in Rome. “In 1648, an edict was introduced which consented to, and encouraged, primogeniture, but only in highly general times. The edict in fact does not seem to have altered the practice very fundamentally. It was only in 1680 that a need was felt for an edict which laid down the rules for defining primogeniture more precisely. In the closing decades of the seventeenth century, primogeniture was well on the way to becoming established…It is true that many families never opted for primogeniture- which not only created a hierarchy between the various children, but also made part of the family property inalienable. However, there is no doubt that from the late seventeenth century onwards, the tendency came to be to concentrate inheritance in the hands of one (male) heir- whether or not this was formalized as primogeniture. The rules on primogeniture did not explicitly exclude a woman from becoming the principle heir. In legislative terms, it was only in the eighteenth century- within the Royal Constitutions of 1723 and 1729- that women came to be actually barred from becoming heirs to the family property.” <sup id="cite_ref-294" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-294">[294]</a></sup> “Middle Ages in Rome had their parallels to the family later envisioned by Ippolita [Ludovisi], with several members of a generation sharing in the inheritance of the family property, rather than it mostly being allocated to a single son. In those earlier times, more siblings had been allowed to marry.

Each constituted an authoritative literate discourse, and together they spoke about women and gender in a remarkably coherent chorus.

<dd> <b>♠ Ideological thought distinguishes men and women ♣ present ♥</b> “Every era has its own beliefs about what constitutes “women,” “men,” and their proper interrelationship; in the Middle Ages these assumptions accorded rather more authority to religion and less, for example, to science. Thinking on gender was rooted in the three religions of the time, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam; in scientific teachings; and in political traditions. Each constituted an authoritative literate discourse, and together they spoke about women and gender in a remarkably coherent chorus. Women were understood as less than men, female attributes as less good than male ones, and gender relations as properly characterized by womanly submission and manly governance. Theology had pride of place in these discussions not only because so much medieval learning was produced in religious contexts but also because religious inquiry then included almost all knowledge.” <sup id="cite_ref-354" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-354">[354]</a></sup></dd>

</p><p><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of monogamy ♣ present ♥</b> “The heart of the sacramental argument against real polygamy was that it betrayed the model of marriage between Christ and his church as an exclusive and enduring dyadic union. [...] [Polygamy] was a violation not only of the natural form of marriage, but even more of the supernatural norm which it embodied. For a Christian to pretend to add a second spouse while the rst was still living (with him or her) and to call that new union a marriage was a deliberate insult to Christ’s example and instruction. For a Christian believer or of cial to extend the de nition of marriage to include a second or third concurrent marriage was a deliberate insult to the sacramental symbolism of Christian marriage. It was tantamount to downing a beer and a sandwich and calling that the eucharist, or diving into a pond several times and calling that baptism writ large. This simply could not be. It was not only a “legal impossibility,” as Raymond of Penyafort had put it, echoing Roman law,130 but a grave spiritual offense, too. Medieval writers labeled such misuses of the concept and institution of marriage by Christians as “heresy,” “blasphemy,” and “desecration” - an insult to God and his sacraments. The Council of Trent later called it “heresy” deserving of the church’s “anathema.” “ <sup id="cite_ref-360" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-360">[360]</a></sup>

<dd><b>♠ respect for authority ♣ present ♥</b> “Medieval society was hierarchical, not merely in social reality but as a matter of principle. Its hierarchical character was understood in cosmological terms. It was taken for granted that the universe was designed in such a way that some of God’s creatures were intended to be at the topand some below them. Human beings were a ‘higher’ form of being than cattle. Cattle were ‘higher’ than the grass they ate. The grass was ‘higher’ than the earth it grew in. So thoroughgoing was the sense that this was how the universe worked that the nine orders of angels identified by the fifth-century Greek authors Pseudo-Dionysus began to be lined up alongside their human ‘counterparts’ on the understanding that each person’s place in heaven would be related to that of the equivalent angel. So the seraphim and cherubim, the contemplatives among the angels, would be accompanied for eternity by members of the contemplative orders, their human equivalents. In modern terms, this was like suggesting that post-men and motorcycle messengers would spend eternity in the company of ordinary angels, while diplomats and emissaries could expect to find themselves among archangels.//Within human society itself no premium was put upon equality. Until late in the Middle Ages, few appear to have seen anything wrong with the idea that there should be rulers and ruled, for hierarchical arrangements of parts within wholes were a normal way of making an organism ‘work’. A body needs a head but it also needs feet (I Corinthians 12.20). In fragmentary survivals of the teaching which was given in the cathedral school at Laon at the end of the eleventh and the beginning of the twelfth centuries, there is a discussion of the passage in Ephesians 6.5 where servants are told to obey their masters. ‘It is no sin to have a servant or to be a servant.’ It was argued at Laon that there are two reasons why ‘servitude is given by God.’ It may be a punishment for the sins of those who are slaves or servants. Or it may have a purpose of proving or testing them, so that, humbled, they may be better people.” <sup id="cite_ref-402" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-402">[402]</a></sup></dd>

Since marriage was a sacrament, the church claimed exclusive jurisdiction over it, appropriating and expanding the laws of nature (Natural Law) and Scripture as well as some of the rules in the early church constitutions and Christianized Roman law. Comprehensive new laws, called canon laws, were promulgated by the papacy and the church councils and enforced by church courts throughout Western Christendom.//”Consistent with the naturalist perspective on marriage, the church’s canon law punished contraception, abortion, and child abuse as violations of the created functions of propagation and child rearing. It also proscribed unnatural sexual acts, such as sodomy and bestiality. Consistent with the contractual perspective, canon law ensured free consnsual unions by dissolving marriages contracted by mistake or under duress, fraud, or coercion. It also granted husband and wife equal rights to enforce conjugal debts that had been voluntarily assumed and emphasized the importance of mutual love among the couple, their children, and their parents.//”Consistent with the sacramental perspective canon law protcted the sanctity and sanctifying purpose of marriage by declaring valid marital bonds to be indissoluble and by annulling invalid unions between Christians and non-Christians or between parties related by various legal, spiritual, blood, or family ties. It supported celibacy by annulling unconsummated vows of marriage if one party made a vow of chastity and by prohibiting clerics on monastics from marriage and concubinage.//”Earlier Christianized Roman and Germanic laws governing the relationships between husband and wife, and parent and child, were liberally appropriated by the canonists and now enforced in the church courts as well as in the confessional (Confession of Sins). Traditional rules and customs of arranged marriages, patriarchal restrictions on the marital estate, male-dominated inheritance laws and primogeniture, protection of the status of the paterfamilias, and restrictions on the wife’s capacity to sue or be sued, to enter into contracts, to give or receive property of her own—all remained firmly in place in canon law.” <sup id="cite_ref-405" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-405">[405]</a></sup></dd>

Yet he also understood the reality of evil in the ‘earthly city’ and the role of the state to confront such evil and render protection (including, in his day, protection of the church). Augustine spoke eloquently of the rueful and necessary duty of statesmen to wage just wars against forces that threatened life and resorted to violence. For augustine, war is always tragic, undertaken out of sorrowful recognition of the injustice that necessitates it and the horrors and cruelty that often attend it (‘’De civ. Dei’’ 19.7).//”What was prohibited for the private individual was permitted for the soldier, who acted in a public capacity; Augustine presumed that a legitimate political authority stood a better chance of restraining inordinate, willful desires, in part by channeling them toward a collectively just civic cause. Augustine contended that God uses political authority in general to achieve minimal levels of order, justice, and peace in the earthly realm. That war could serve as an acceptable means of achieving a peaceful or tranquil order (‘’tranquilitatis ordinis’’) attests to the always limited and imperfect measure of peace and justice one finds on earth; perfect peace and true justice, however, await in the Heavenly City.//”Throughout the Middle Ages, as a further occasions arose for the use of force, theologians, canon lawyers, and political thinkers returned to Augustine, in some cases to deepen, in others to expand, Christian tenets of just war.” <sup id="cite_ref-406" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-406">[406]</a></sup></dd>
