</p><p>"The Neo-Hittite period can be divided into two main phases, as suggested by Mazzoni ([1995] 189). The first phase covers the period from the 12th century to the mid 9th century B.C. This period is characterised by the rise of kingdoms each centred on a town. Some of these towns were new foundations, but some were refoundations of earlier urban centres now embellished with monumental iconography. The second period covers the ca. 150 years from the mid 9th century to the Assyrian conquest in the late 8th century B.C.

The primary region of the Syro-Hittite kingdoms was however in Syria.

</p><p>New Kingdom of Hatti coded 2 million for up to 45,000 km2, which is 44.4 per km2. Neo-Hittite state of 700 km2 * 44.4 density per km2 would provide an estimate of about 30,000. However, the Neo-Hittite states were no doubt based around the larger urban areas so this could be a bottom line figure. Considering that there would need to be 100 such states in the region of Turkey to reach the 3 million population figure (for Turkey - see McEvedy and Jones estimate) this "bottom line" figure may be too low. 3 million split among, say, 15 states in Turkey as a whole would give us 200,000 per polity.

<p><span style="color:blue">Thomas Cressy: Added more information about the above Arzawa conflict: 'An abortive Hittite campaign against the Arzawan leader Anzapaḫḫadu served to emphasize that the Arzawans remained a formidable military opponent. When Anzapaḫḫadu refused a demand from Šuppiluliuma to return refugees from Hittite authority, Šuppiluliuma dispatched to the region an army led by his commander Ḫimuili to enforce his demand. The Hittite army was ambushed and destroyed, and Šuppiluliuma was obliged to take the field at the head of another expeditionary force to complete the mission (from the “Deeds of Šuppiluliuma,” trans. Harry A. Hoffner Jr. in Hallo and Younger 2003:vol. 1, 188). After his accession to the Hittite throne, he installed one of his ablest military commanders, Ḫannutti, as governor of the Lower Land, clearly intending this region to serve as a base for further military operations against Arzawan territories (Bryce 2005:151).' <sup id="cite_ref-145" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-145">[145]</a></sup></span>

After his victories in Arzawan territory, Muršili may have decided to end all further threats posed to his kingdom by Arzawa Minor by evacuating its population and allocating its territory to neighboring states. He claims to have deported 65,000 (or 66,000) of its inhabitants to the Hittite homeland.<sup id="cite_ref-146" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-146">[146]</a></sup>'</span>

<p><span style="color:blue">Thomas Cressy: Added more information about the above conflict: Miletus is called Milawata, or Millawanda. The Hittite king Muršili II reports that in his third regnal year, ca. 1318 b.c.e., he dispatched a Hittite army to destroy Milawata for joining an alliance with a king of Aḫḫiyawa (Goetze 1933:36-37). The implication is that Milawata was considered a Hittite subject territory at that time and had broken its allegiance to Ḫatti. In the same year, the Arzawan king Uḫḫaziti was forced to flee Hittite authority, as we have noted, taking refuge on one of the offshore islands that were under the control of the Aḫḫiyawan king (see Beal, chapter 26 in this volume). <sup id="cite_ref-148" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-148">[148]</a></sup></span>

<p>Code the variables below for the most widespread collective ritual of the official cult. Widespread refers to the degree of coverage a ritual has in a polity and therefore to the proportion of the overall population that participates in or observes a ritual. Keep in mind that it is possible that the ritual with the highest coverage is not necessarily a mass ritual performed at one location, but can be a ritual that is performed all over the polity and of which the aggregate of the audiences represent the largest degree of coverage.

<p><b>♠ RA ♣ Agathe Dupeyron ♥</b>
</p><p><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b>
</p><p><b>♠ Editor ♣ ♥</b>
</p><p>Based on the following quotes, a certain degree of continuity has been assumed from the New Kingdom Hatti in terms of how kings could have modelled their power after their predecessors.  However, these inferences are speculative and need to be double-checked by experts. On the other hand, inferring continuity in the fields of central and local administration, or legal rights, would be far-fetched considering the lack of information and the difference in scale between the New Kingdom Hatti polity and the much smaller and disparate Neo-Hittite kingdoms.
</p><p>"It is now time for us to begin our investigations of the Neo-Hittite kingdoms. ‘Neo-Hittite’ is a modern term, coined by scholars to refer to a group of states located in northern Syria and south-eastern Anatolia that arose, developed, and were finally absorbed into the Assyrian empire during the first four centuries of the Iron Age (mid 12th to late 8th century). The states so called displayed one or more of the following characteristics: [...] A number of inscriptions found at various sites within them are written in the Luwian hieroglyphic script and language. Luwian had (probably) become the predominant language of Anatolia in the last centuries of the Hittite empire. Its use by Late Bronze Age Hittite kings on their public monuments and seals provides an apparent link with later Iron Age kingdoms. The rulers of the kingdoms in question sometimes bore Luwian names, and sometimes the names, in Luwianized or Assyrianized form, of Late Bronze Age Hittite kings. There is material evidence of cultural links between these kingdoms and the Late Bronze Age Hittite kingdom, notably in their iconography and architecture." <sup id="cite_ref-151" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-151">[151]</a></sup>

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from military ♣ ♥</b> New Kingdom Hatti kings also controlled military power. "There can be no doubt that in the management of the affairs of the Land of Hatti the Hittite king’s role was very much a hands-on one. He was chief priest of his people, the gods’ deputy on earth, and each year he was the principal celebrant in a demanding round of religious festivals, which often took him on pilgrimages to the main religious centres of his kingdom. He was commander-in-chief of the Hittite armies, and regularly led his troops on campaigns far from the homeland." <sup id="cite_ref-152" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-152">[152]</a></sup> There is a lack of information regarding political and administrative organisation in Neo-Hittite polities, and inferring continuity might be problematic.</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from legislative ♣ ♥</b> New Kingdom Hatti kings also took part in legislation. "Hattusili’s interest in preserving a memory of the past and in recording current events for posterity suggests that he was an intelligent and complex ruler. He also formulated the Hittite law code and established the pankus “assembly,” an ad hoc judicial body composed of members of the state bureaucracy whose role was to witness and enforce agreements and royal proclamations and to try criminal offenders of particularly high status." <sup id="cite_ref-153" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-153">[153]</a></sup> There is a lack of information regarding political and administrative organisation in Neo-Hittite polities, and inferring continuity might be problematic.</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from judiciary ♣ ♥</b> New Kingdom Hatti kings were also the heads of the judicial system. "He deputized for the Sun God as the supreme earthly judge of his people, and personally sat in judgement on disputes between vassal rulers, on cases which could only be tried by the king’s court, and on appeals against judgements made by a lower court. Encapsulated in these duties is the classic threefold functions of kingship in the Near East, as well as in Homeric society, which combines the king’s religious, military, and judicial roles. " <sup id="cite_ref-154" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-154">[154]</a></sup> There is a lack of information regarding political and administrative organisation in Neo-Hittite polities, and inferring continuity might be problematic.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Right to petition executive ♣ ♥</b> This right was present in New Kingdom Hatti, but there is not enough information on the Neo-Hittites to infer continuity. "Our knowledge of Hittite law and its application is based on a range of sources.

"It was a charge of witchcraft that led to the downfall of Arma- Tarhunda, governor of the strategically important Upper Land during the reign of King Muwatalli (II). As we have noted, Arma- Tarhunda was related to the royal family, and had the misfortune to be the arch-rival of the king’s brother Hattusili, later to occupy the throne as Hattusili III. Prior to this Muwatalli had made his brother governor of the Upper Land in place of Arma-Tarhunda, much to the latter’s fury. It was Hattusili who had brought the charge of witchcraft, to counter an indictment which Arma-Tarhunda had brought against him:‘Furthermore he and his wife and his son began to bewitch me. He also filled Samuha, the city of the deity, with witch- craft.’65 One cannot help suspecting that Arma-Tarhunda’s charge (whatever it may have been) was not unjustified, and Hattusili's a trumped-up one; it was certainly well within the capability of the wily and ruthlessly ambitious young prince to resort to such measures to rid himself of an inconvenient rival. In any case Muwatalli found against the defendant, and handed him over to Hattusili for punishment, thus ensuring the removal of one of the chief obstacles in his brother’s career path. Yet Hattusili’s treatment of Arma-Tarhunda was surprisingly mild: he let him go free and returned to him half his confiscated property; subsequently he attempted a reconciliation with his family. All this, he claims, he did out of pity, for Arma- Tarhunda was now an old man. More likely he was acting out of remorse—for a charge unjustly laid.The mere allegation of witchcraft may well have generated concerns and emotions which were almost sufficient in themselves to secure a conviction. To judge from the Proclamation of King Telipinu, even a knowledge of the black arts rendered one liable to prosecution. And persons who knew of but failed to denounce those suspected of having such knowledge were themselves liable to punishment: ‘In Hattusa hereafter sorcery must be exorcized. Whoever in the (royal) family knows about sorcery, you must seize him and bring him to the gate of the palace. Whoever does not bring him here—it will come about that things will go badly for this man and his house.’66" <sup id="cite_ref-165" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-165">[165]</a></sup>?</dd>

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Customary mechanism ♣ inferred present ♥</b> In Hatti:  "We must assume that the king’s choice of successor, within the parameters laid down by Telipinu,17 had the benefit of divine guidance, or that he at least ensured, through divination or other means, that his choice was acceptable to his divine masters. Some scholars believe that the king may originally have been elected by the nobility. But even if this were so, the principle of hereditary succession had been firmly established by the time of Hattusili I, the king with whom our earliest written records are associated. By implication, this principle also had divine endorsement, since the gods’ appointee was invariably a member of his predecessor’s immediate family." <sup id="cite_ref-178" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-178">[178]</a></sup> There is no information on whether Neo-Hittite kings followed the New Kingdom Hatti principle of hereditary succession, but it seems likely considering that many of the Neo-Hittite kingdoms harked back to this former polity. "It is now time for us to begin our investigations of the Neo-Hittite kingdoms. ‘Neo-Hittite’ is a modern term, coined by scholars to refer to a group of states located in northern Syria and south-eastern Anatolia that arose, developed, and were finally absorbed into the Assyrian empire during the first four centuries of the Iron Age (mid 12th to late 8th century). The states so called displayed one or more of the following characteristics: [...] A number of inscriptions found at various sites within them are written in the Luwian hieroglyphic script and language. Luwian had (probably) become the predominant language of Anatolia in the last centuries of the Hittite empire. Its use by Late Bronze Age Hittite kings on their public monuments and seals provides an apparent link with later Iron Age kingdoms. The rulers of the kingdoms in question sometimes bore Luwian names, and sometimes the names, in Luwianized or Assyrianized form, of Late Bronze Age Hittite kings. There is material evidence of cultural links between these kingdoms and the Late Bronze Age Hittite kingdom, notably in their iconography and architecture." <sup id="cite_ref-179" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-179">[179]</a></sup></dd>

<dd> <b>♠ Elite Concubinage ♣ ♥</b> Concubinage was present in the New Kingdom Hatti, considering that Neo-Hittite kings seeked to imitate their forebears it might have been present in Neo-Hittite kingdoms as well. "This is where the institution of concubinage comes into its own. No doubt the king was expected to devote a good deal of his ‘home’ periods to distributing his royal seed as frequently as possible amongst his officially recognized bedmates of child-bearing age. This in order to ensure a continuing supply of royal offspring, for marriage alliances with foreign or vassal rulers, or (in the case of males) for representing the king on diplomatic missions, holding important military commands, or occupying important posts in the palace bureaucracy. A harem of secondary wives and concubines was probably not so much a perk of the job of being king as a requirement of it.33" <sup id="cite_ref-187" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-187">[187]</a></sup> "It is now time for us to begin our investigations of the Neo-Hittite kingdoms. ‘Neo-Hittite’ is a modern term, coined by scholars to refer to a group of states located in northern Syria and south-eastern Anatolia that arose, developed, and were finally absorbed into the Assyrian empire during the first four centuries of the Iron Age (mid 12th to late 8th century).

A liturgy might be recited and incense burned. The animal was brought in, sometimes with great fanfare. only top-quality items could be given to the deity. The substitution of a scrawny animal for a healthy one left the offerant vulnerable to divine retribution. The procession could include singers and musicians as well as other participants in the ritual, such as the cook. The moment of slaughter, for which a special knife was used, was one of jubilation. The animal was then butchered and the deity given the roasted heart and liver. The cook used the remainder of the animal to make a stew to be shared by the participants. The food was set out, libations poured, and the feasting began. At this point the king might “drink the god,” that is, toast him, a practice unique to the Hittites. Ceremonies of this kind correspond most closely to what are termed “fellowship” offerings (selamim) in the Hebrew Bible, the primary purpose of which was the communal meal with the deity.” <sup id="cite_ref-254" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-254">[254]</a></sup></dd>

This relationship is expressed officially in the imagery of the shepherd protecting his flock: 'May the land of Hatti graze abundantly (?) in the hand of the labarna (i.e., the king) and tawananna (i.e., the queen), and may it expand!' In reality, however, outside of his family and principal advisors, the king probably had almost no contact with the people he ruled, living instead an isolated existence designed in part to preserve his life and in part to protect him from pollution. As priest of the gods, the king’s purity was a matter of considerable concern, and the lives of those whose carelessness jeopardized his higher state were forfeit.
