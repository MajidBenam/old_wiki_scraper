</p><p>Neo-Elamite II (743-647 BCE). The Elamite historical record is very limited, but Neo-Babylonian and Assyrian documents record the presence of Elamite armies in the battles against Assyria dating from around 820 BCE. <sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>
</p><p>640 BCE is generally considered the end of the Neo-Elamite kingdom. Traditional academic belief is that in this year Susa was sacked by the Assyrian army. Ashurbanipal's texts describe fierce looting of the city. Susa was destroyed and the Neo- Elamite Kingdom ended. <sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> However, more evidence is appearing to suggest that the Elamite Kingdom may have continued after the attacks of 640 BCE. For example, a few names of what are thought to be post 640 BCE Elamite kings are known.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> Also, archaeological evidence of material culture does not show any discontinuity over this period . <sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> <i> 3. what is the archaeological evidence? be specific if specifics are available so what the code is based on is obvious. however - specifics aren't always available so if they're not available write what you can.  </i>

<dl><dd> Evidence of continuity: the Assyrian sack of Susa 'has dominated the traditional interpretative model for the end of Elamite civilization. However, the material, textual, and artistic assemblages at Susa, together with the reliefs from Izeh/Malamir (KF [Kul-e Farah] I, c.650-550 BC), Naqsh-e Rustam (c.674-626 BC), and the elite material from Arjan (c.600-570 BC) and Ram Hormuz (c.585-539 BC) provide evidence of the survival of Elamite political power, culture, and traditions after the Assyrian raids on western Elam.'<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ unitary state; confederated state ♥ </b> unitary state: 820-693 BCE; confederated state: 693-640 BCE  In 693 BCE, the new king Kudur Nahhunte relocated his residence from Susa to Madaktu, likely a marginal stronghold, and later Hidalu.

The Arjān tomb contained a U-shaped bronze coffin of a type known in Mesopotamia (e.g., at Ur) and Iran (e.g., at Zīvīa).

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ feast of Aiapir ♥</b> "Of the four Elamite open-air sanctuaries that were founded in the Middle Elamite period and that were enlarged and still functioning in the Neo-Elamite period, Kul-e Farah is the largest and the one with the most extensive and elaborate visual imagery. The sanctuary is situated in a gorge in the eastern part of the valley of Izeh (Malamir). Most conspicuous are its six reliefs (KF I-VI), depicting various cultic acts and stages in a grand sacrificial feast, carved on the rock faces of the gorge and on three boulders. All are near the entrance to the gorge. One of the reliefs is accompanied by a long Neo-Elamite inscription (EKI 75) and ten short captions (EKI 75A-K). The subjects of the reliefs may be summarized as follows: "KF I (northern face): ruler with two court officials, one carrying (the ruler’s?) bow, quiver, and sword; musicians with harps and drum (?); officiants with a humped bovid and sacrificed rams at an altar; inscription and captions identifying the figures. "KF II (boulder): ruler in praying attitude; attendants and officiants sacrificing a humped bovid and six other animals. "KF III (boulder): ruler lifted on a platform (depicted twice); a host of participants in superimposed registers on both sides marching in procession toward the sacrifice; harp players; sacrificial animals (18 smaller animals, 3 humped bovids). "KF IV (southern face): banquet with seated ruler before table accompanied by attendants and court dignitaries (one carrying bow, quiver, and sword); six harp players and their conductor; numerous participants in registers (on panels left, below, and right of the central relief ) oriented toward the king and lifting their right hands to their mouths (paying homage to the king or eating?); six officiants (?) on the extreme left near the fire-altar or fire bowls (cf. below). "KF V (southern face): ruler in praying attitude followed by his retinue; thymiaterion; officiant slaughtering humped bovid; six more sacrificed animals. "KF VI (boulder): ruler in praying attitude, lifted on a platform, and followed by a short procession of his retinue (one dignitary carrying a quiver); another surface prepared but not used for an additional relief."[...] "There is no agreement among scholars on the date of Kul-e Farah. Some have dated all reliefs to various stages of the Neo-Elamite period, while in more recent studies most are dated to the Middle Elamite period. [...]"[...] "As in the case of sip, the feast of Aiapir may well have been celebrated annually, during the autumn season. This suspicion rests on the assumption that the region of eastern Khuzestan and western Fars is most suitable for agro-pastoralism and on the observation that tribes adapted to that way of life made up, until recently, most of the population in these parts. Within the grand system of migration routes and seasonal pastures in what is commonly known as the Bakhtiari Mountains, the Izeh valley functions as garmsir land and is used as winter residence by the Car Lang. The pastoralists descend to the area in September/October from their summer pastures in the eastern mountains (in the direction of Esfahan) and stay until April/May. Because the autumn rutting season falls in October and lambs from the summer season are born in Novem- ber (cf. Barth 1961: 7), autumn is the best time to reduce the herds by slaughtering or selling the surplus of yearling animals as well as infertile ewes. This has the additional advantage of lowering the need for fodder during the winter season. In the days of Hanni and his predecessors, conditions are likely to have been similar, even though there may have been a more important sedentary segment resident in the valley. It may therefore be expected that the feast of Kul-e Farah took place in autumn.[...] "The central role of the ruler is a prominent feature of both sip and the feast of Aiapir. The fact that the ruler of Aiapir is depicted on all six reliefs in Kul-e Farah and that sacrifices are always performed right in front of him indicate his role as the celebration’s protagonist.[...] "The centrality of the king also found visual expression during the sacrificial feast. At Aiapir, we find the ruler enthroned and surrounded by a multitude of banquet guests who have all turned their faces to him and pay him homage with their gestures (KF I). The king also leads the procession toward the sanctuary (KF III, VI). To accentuate his position even more, the ruler is raised on a platform and carried to the place where the sacrifice takes place. [...] "Not only the position of the ruler but that of every participant found explicit expression at the sacrificial feast. Visible hierarchy was a key element. As De Waele (1972: 2-3; 1989: 34) notes, the Kul-e Farah reliefs are a panorama of an intricate social pyramid in which status is expressed by size, arrangement, closeness to the king, representation in frontal view or in profile, garments, hair-cut, and beard. [...]"[...]"Like sip, the feast at Aiapir may have been a forum at which the king could pay off “debts” by awarding seats of honor to his servants in the local government. That Hanni chose to mention his principal ministers by name in the inscriptions on KF I and that these officials are positioned close to the ruler similarly imply recognition for services rendered. As for the base level of ordinary Aiapirans and workers in the Persepolis economy, the banquets meant access to rare meat rations for larger groups (§6.3.3): a true feast! "The unity of the ruler and his god would of course have been stressed to the maximum during sacrificial feasts such as sip and the one celebrated at Aiapir. It is certainly no coincidence that most of the gods associated with sip or earlier sup are closely connected to the ruler or the dynasty, including Insusinak, Sasum, and Auramazda (§7.1.6). No doubt, Hanni will have adopted a similar attitude vis-à-vis Tirutur. Yet, in the end, neither the king nor the god is the principle participant in the sacrificial feast. That which is celebrated is the community that convenes and reconstitutes itself. Group identity, social hierarchy, and bonds of loyalty are reconfirmed in the sacrifice and the ensuing banquet. This is of special importance in a situation whereby ruler and subjects are separated from each other during large parts of the year. Sedentary and pastoralist Aiapirans, the latter returning from their summer abode, were reunited amid the reliefs of Kul-e Farah, those sublime expressions of their common identity. [...] Traditional hymns played an important role in Persian religious experience (references in Briant 2002: 245, 330), as did music, and, probably, song in Kul-e Farah. Such a musical setting may have served to connect the present to the past and to lift the momentary experience of the feast to a timeless level. At Aiapir, this connection with the past is made tangible in such a way that visiting the site is still a haunting experience. Not only the king and priests, but all members of the community found themselves mirrored on the surrounding reliefs when they entered the gorge for the annual feast. The engraving on the stone of the very ceremony that they were about to perform visualized their bond with a communal past and a communal future by putting the whole gathering sub specie aeternitatis." <sup id="cite_ref-202" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-202">[202]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ offerings to the gods ♥</b> Offerings to the gods was the most widespread and frequent ritual practised in Elam <sup id="cite_ref-231" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-231">[231]</a></sup>.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ offering to the gods ♥</b> "The Akkadian inscription known as Stone Stela 1 from Middle Elamite Haft Tepe (HT 463) [EC: a 14th-century site], is a long prescriptive list of provisions for offerings. The text includes a series of provisions for regular (monthly) sacrifices of sheep, flour and beer referred to as terru šetru, as well as provisions for several feasts and other occasional offerings (including those before the saparru-wagon of king Tepti-ahar). The amounts for the regular offerings are allocated per two months and divided over six persons, the massarû É.DÙ.A, "Guardians of the (funerary) House,' who 'give' (offer) the sacrificial goods, presumably from a grant founded for this purpose (so Reiner 1973a: 93-4). The institution of regular sacrifices, the possible provision of capital by the crown (in the form of a land grant or serjeanty), and the appointment of six named individuals as executives, altogether translates into a regular income for the 'guardians' taken from the foodstuffs allocated for the sacrifices. As such, Stone Stela 1 provides a parallel for the regular monthly and daily offerings and their human beneficiaries in Persepolis. What comes to mind is lan, but perhaps even more the offerings characterised by the terms šumar and bašur. These offerings involve, like Haft Tepe offerings, <i>groups</i> of executives and relatively high amounts of foodstuffs--the 'guardians' in Stone Stela 1 were probably not the only persons living off the livestock, flour and beer." <sup id="cite_ref-283" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-283">[283]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ feast of Aiapir ♥</b> "Of the four Elamite open-air sanctuaries that were founded in the Middle Elamite period and that were enlarged and still functioning in the Neo-Elamite period, Kul-e Farah is the largest and the one with the most extensive and elaborate visual imagery. The sanctuary is situated in a gorge in the eastern part of the valley of Izeh (Malamir). Most conspicuous are its six reliefs (KF I-VI), depicting various cultic acts and stages in a grand sacrificial feast, carved on the rock faces of the gorge and on three boulders. All are near the entrance to the gorge. One of the reliefs is accompanied by a long Neo-Elamite inscription (EKI 75) and ten short captions (EKI 75A-K). The subjects of the reliefs may be summarized as follows: "KF I (northern face): ruler with two court officials, one carrying (the ruler’s?) bow, quiver, and sword; musicians with harps and drum (?); officiants with a humped bovid and sacrificed rams at an altar; inscription and captions identifying the figures. "KF II (boulder): ruler in praying attitude; attendants and officiants sacrificing a humped bovid and six other animals. "KF III (boulder): ruler lifted on a platform (depicted twice); a host of participants in superimposed registers on both sides marching in procession toward the sacrifice; harp players; sacrificial animals (18 smaller animals, 3 humped bovids). "KF IV (southern face): banquet with seated ruler before table accompanied by attendants and court dignitaries (one carrying bow, quiver, and sword); six harp players and their conductor; numerous participants in registers (on panels left, below, and right of the central relief ) oriented toward the king and lifting their right hands to their mouths (paying homage to the king or eating?); six officiants (?) on the extreme left near the fire-altar or fire bowls (cf. below). "KF V (southern face): ruler in praying attitude followed by his retinue; thymiaterion; officiant slaughtering humped bovid; six more sacrificed animals. "KF VI (boulder): ruler in praying attitude, lifted on a platform, and followed by a short procession of his retinue (one dignitary carrying a quiver); another surface prepared but not used for an additional relief."[...] "There is no agreement among scholars on the date of Kul-e Farah. Some have dated all reliefs to various stages of the Neo-Elamite period, while in more recent studies most are dated to the Middle Elamite period. [...]"[...] "As in the case of sip, the feast of Aiapir may well have been celebrated annually, during the autumn season. This suspicion rests on the assumption that the region of eastern Khuzestan and western Fars is most suitable for agro-pastoralism and on the observation that tribes adapted to that way of life made up, until recently, most of the population in these parts. Within the grand system of migration routes and seasonal pastures in what is commonly known as the Bakhtiari Mountains, the Izeh valley functions as garmsir land and is used as winter residence by the Car Lang. The pastoralists descend to the area in September/October from their summer pastures in the eastern mountains (in the direction of Esfahan) and stay until April/May. Because the autumn rutting season falls in October and lambs from the summer season are born in Novem- ber (cf. Barth 1961: 7), autumn is the best time to reduce the herds by slaughtering or selling the surplus of yearling animals as well as infertile ewes. This has the additional advantage of lowering the need for fodder during the winter season. In the days of Hanni and his predecessors, conditions are likely to have been similar, even though there may have been a more important sedentary segment resident in the valley. It may therefore be expected that the feast of Kul-e Farah took place in autumn.[...] "The central role of the ruler is a prominent feature of both sip and the feast of Aiapir. The fact that the ruler of Aiapir is depicted on all six reliefs in Kul-e Farah and that sacrifices are always performed right in front of him indicate his role as the celebration’s protagonist.[...] "The centrality of the king also found visual expression during the sacrificial feast. At Aiapir, we find the ruler enthroned and surrounded by a multitude of banquet guests who have all turned their faces to him and pay him homage with their gestures (KF I). The king also leads the procession toward the sanctuary (KF III, VI). To accentuate his position even more, the ruler is raised on a platform and carried to the place where the sacrifice takes place. [...] "Not only the position of the ruler but that of every participant found explicit expression at the sacrificial feast. Visible hierarchy was a key element. As De Waele (1972: 2-3; 1989: 34) notes, the Kul-e Farah reliefs are a panorama of an intricate social pyramid in which status is expressed by size, arrangement, closeness to the king, representation in frontal view or in profile, garments, hair-cut, and beard. [...]"[...]"Like sip, the feast at Aiapir may have been a forum at which the king could pay off “debts” by awarding seats of honor to his servants in the local government. That Hanni chose to mention his principal ministers by name in the inscriptions on KF I and that these officials are positioned close to the ruler similarly imply recognition for services rendered. As for the base level of ordinary Aiapirans and workers in the Persepolis economy, the banquets meant access to rare meat rations for larger groups (§6.3.3): a true feast! "The unity of the ruler and his god would of course have been stressed to the maximum during sacrificial feasts such as sip and the one celebrated at Aiapir. It is certainly no coincidence that most of the gods associated with sip or earlier sup are closely connected to the ruler or the dynasty, including Insusinak, Sasum, and Auramazda (§7.1.6). No doubt, Hanni will have adopted a similar attitude vis-à-vis Tirutur. Yet, in the end, neither the king nor the god is the principle participant in the sacrificial feast. That which is celebrated is the community that convenes and reconstitutes itself. Group identity, social hierarchy, and bonds of loyalty are reconfirmed in the sacrifice and the ensuing banquet. This is of special importance in a situation whereby ruler and subjects are separated from each other during large parts of the year. Sedentary and pastoralist Aiapirans, the latter returning from their summer abode, were reunited amid the reliefs of Kul-e Farah, those sublime expressions of their common identity. [...] Traditional hymns played an important role in Persian religious experience (references in Briant 2002: 245, 330), as did music, and, probably, song in Kul-e Farah. Such a musical setting may have served to connect the present to the past and to lift the momentary experience of the feast to a timeless level. At Aiapir, this connection with the past is made tangible in such a way that visiting the site is still a haunting experience. Not only the king and priests, but all members of the community found themselves mirrored on the surrounding reliefs when they entered the gorge for the annual feast. The engraving on the stone of the very ceremony that they were about to perform visualized their bond with a communal past and a communal future by putting the whole gathering sub specie aeternitatis." <sup id="cite_ref-329" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-329">[329]</a></sup></dd>

The governor, the chief of police, the high priest, the temple guards and the temple priest shall seal [the portals] on them.

<dd> <b>♠ Constraint on executive by government ♣ inferred present ♥</b> Henkelman refers to a government body called the 'Elders of Elam', for which we have evidence from the Middle and Neo-Elamite periods. During Ashurbanipal's campaigns against Elam from 653 to 645 BCE, the elders 'stepped in to avert further Assyrian aggression. At first sight this seems a sign of serious political disintegration: apparently the Elamite king did not have the authority to solve the Nabû-bēl-šumāti matter [this Chaldean rebel had taken refuge in Elam and the Neo-Assyrian Empire was demanding his extradition], and in response to this an ad hoc body of "elders" emerged. While it cannot be denied that the severe Assyrian pressure led to the emergence of several competing factions at this time in Elam, it is also true that it was the Elamite king who eventually solved the matter by sending Nabû-bēl-šumāti's corpse to Assyria. More important, the Elders of Elam were not a novel body and thus indicative of a dissolution of traditional monarchical rule. The elders were in fact part of the traditional make-up of the Elamite state as shown by a Middle Elamite inscription of Šilhak-Inšušinak I that mentions the "Elders of Elam" ... as first part of a triad that clearly describes the kingdom's elite ... This or a similar body apparently still existed at the time of the Assyrian raids, acted as a representative organ, and was recognised as such by Assurbanipal in BM 132980'.<sup id="cite_ref-374" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-374">[374]</a></sup> This discussion tells us that the Elders of Elam constituted a long-standing government institution that exercised considerable power and could act independently of the king. Discussing the early Neo-Elamite II period, Carter and Stolper also say that 'Some suggestion of the diffusion of political power appears in other Elamite texts of the time, exceptional for their portrayal of nonroyal figures'.<sup id="cite_ref-375" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-375">[375]</a></sup> The image we receive from Elamite and Mesopotamian sources is not one of unconstrained executive power exercised by the monarch alone.</dd>

<p><b>♠ Number of regional administrative units ♣ unknown ♥</b> At present, it seems that we don't have enough information to specify how many regional administrative units there were in this period. Although the Susa Acropole texts from the succeeding Neo-Elamite III period reveal something of the workings of the redistribution system, Henkelman's discussion of them is quite vague when it comes to geography. He says the texts give the impression of 'a Susa-based monarchy that minimally controlled a network of towns in larger parts of Khūzestan and, apparently, some regions to the east, and that had bonds with (tribal) groups living in the same regions and beyond'.<sup id="cite_ref-451" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-451">[451]</a></sup> 'The range of contacts fostered by the Neo-Elamite kings seems to have extended westwards to the Aramaeans in the borderland between Elam and Babylonia and even beyond, to Babylonia proper'.<sup id="cite_ref-452" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-452">[452]</a></sup> There are also cases of 'direct political control' over some Aramaean groups; 'On the whole, however, we see a range of different relationships, typical of the relations between semi-autonomous (pastoralist) tribal entities and a sovereign state'.<sup id="cite_ref-453" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-453">[453]</a></sup>

</p><p><b>♠ Description of the Normative Ideology ♣  ♥</b> “The elamizing trend continued until the fall of Elam. After his victory at Susa Assurbanipal carried off the statues of nineteen deities, which he listed by name; all had apparently Susan Elamite names. Despite the misleading spellings, the names of several deities are recognizable, including those with the most prestige: Insusinak, Simut, Lagamal, Pinigir, Hutran, and Kirmasir (Aynard, pp. 54-55). “In the Neo-Elamite period, although the principal divinities in the pantheon (Insusinak, Napirisa, Lagamal, Pinigir, Nahhunte, etc.) continued to be honored, lesser known or previously unknown gods came to the fore, among them Masti and Tepti at Malamir, sasum at Kesat, and sati and Lali (among many others) at Susa. The most popular god was Hu(m)ban, who had been mentioned second in the list of gods in the treaty of Naram-Sin. In this period his name appeared as an element in half the royal names and in many other names as well (Scheil, 1907). He did not, however, have a temple at Susa. All these gods were thus essentially Elamite; even the Mesopotamian name of the goddess DIL.BAT, to whom silhak-Insusinak dedicated a temple, could actually have been an epithet for the goddess Masti. [...] The essential role of the gods was to give life, to preserve it as long as possible, and finally to take it back, accompanying the dead to the other world. These different aspects of the divine prerogative can be illustrated by many examples. For example, several cylinder seals found at Coga Zanbil are inscribed “It is for the god (to give) life; it is for the king to save it” (Reiner, 1970b, p. 134). Humban-numena declared that “from the bosom of his mother Napirisa and Insusinak created his name” (Steve, 1987, no. 3). Throughout Elamite history royal dedications show that the kings built temples to protect their own lives and sometimes those of the entire royal family. The simplest formula in such texts is “I, so-and-so, have built such-and-such a sanctuary and, for my life, I have offered it to such-and-such a god.” But more specific requests were addressed to different divinities for a long and favorable and happy reign, for long life, and for a prosperous lineage (Grillot, 1982). “Nevertheless, death seems to have been the principal preoccupation of the Elamites. Most religious buildings were connected with the cult of the dead, and the principal gods were closely associated with the passage of the dead into the next world. [...] Although many gods were associated with the cult of the dead, three played a particularly important role: Insusinak, the weigher of souls, and his two assistants, Isnikarab and Lagamal. A few small funerary tablets (Bottero, pp. 393-401), though very badly preserved, give some idea of the passage into the other world: The dead person, preceded by Isnikarab or Lagamal or both presents himself in the hastu (in the Akkadian texts suttu, a synonym for hastu) before Insusinak, who decides his fate. This scene seems to be illustrated on a number of cylinder seals, where it is commonly identified as a “presentation scene,” even though it is more probably a depiction of the last judgment (Vallat, 1989). [...] Another prerogative of the gods was to confer and protect kingship. Puzur-Insusinak spoke of “the year when Insusinak looked at him (and) gave to him the four regions” (Scheil, 1908, p. 9). It was also Insusinak who conferred kingship upon Humban-numena and the latter’s son Untas-Napirisa (König, nos. 4, no. 13), but it was Manzat who conferred it on Igi-halki (Steve, 1987, no. 2). “In the Elamite pantheon goddesses played a more important role than elsewhere. The enumeration of forty deities in the treaty of Naram-Sin begins with Pinigir, goddess of love and procreation, who was worshiped throughout Elamite history and had an astam, or temple of fertility; she was very frequently represented in art (Spycket, 1992). In addition, various local divinities were goddesses: Kiririsa at Liyan, Upurkupak at Coga Pahn (KS-102) and Gotwand, Masti at Malamir, Manzat at Deh-e Now (q.v.). “The Elamite pantheon was formed from the combination of the pantheons of the principal geopolitical entities that constituted Elam; it is not therefore astonishing that different gods played the same role or possessed the same attributes. Several gods and goddesses had the epithet “great god,” which it is probably correct to understand as “the supreme god”: Insusinak, Napirisa, Humban, Nahhunte, Kiririsa, Manzat, and so on. In addition, several deities were protectors of the gods (Masti, Napir), of kings (Insusinak, Kiririsa, Napir), or of Elam (Silir-katru). Kiririsa and Masti were “mothers of the gods.” Several deities were particularly linked to death by the epithet lahakra (of death): Insusinak, Kiririsa, Upurkupak, and perhaps Ruhuratir and Tepti.” <sup id="cite_ref-522" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-522">[522]</a></sup> In addition to this, according to Henkelman, there was very strong continuity between Elam and Achaemenid Persia, including in terms of ideology: “the Elamite state, both before and after the Assyrian wars, must have been a real Fundgrube for the emergent Persian society and culture in terms of literacy, art, craftsmanship, bureaucracy, royal ideology, military organization, trade networks, administrative mechanisms, and political structure. Persia may indeed be seen as “the heir of Elam” (not of “Media”), to quote Mario Liverani’s provocative comment on the matter (2003: 10; cf. Henkelman 2008a: 4; forthcoming a; forthcoming b).” <sup id="cite_ref-523" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-523">[523]</a></sup> Therefore, some aspects of Elamite ideology may be inferred on the basis of what is known about (Achaemenid) Persian ideology. Elements of Achaemenid ideology that clearly derive from Zoroastrianism have been excluded.

When they learned that Nine Ways was the name of the place, they buried alive that number of boys and maidens, children of the local people.

<p><b>Supernatural Enforcement of Morality</b>
</p>
<dl><dd>For this section, include any type of supernatural punishment or reward either in this lifetime (e.g., curses, good fortune) or in the afterlife (e.g., hell, reincarnation). This includes generalized impersonal punishment/reward (e.g., karma, mana) as well as punishment by specific supernatural beings. Include specific details of the nature and extent of punishment/reward in the description. Code “compound” moral actions (e.g., filial piety = kin + respect) in multiple categories as necessary. Morality categories are based on Moral Foundations Theory (Haidt &amp; Graham, 2007) and Morality-As-Cooperation theory (Curry, 2016).</dd>

<dd><b>♠ other supernatural enforcement of piety♣ inferred present ♥</b> It is possible that there was some continuity between Elamite and pre-Zoroastrian Iranian beliefs, according to which "Those who had acquired merit in the sight of the gods, mainly by keeping prescribed observances and by sacrificing, had more chance to reach Paradise. They succeeded in crossing the Cinvato Peretu , whereas the evil people who had neglected their duties towards the gods fell from it into the shadowy netherworld." <sup id="cite_ref-570" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-570">[570]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b>♠ in-group loyalty ♣ inferred present ♥</b> There is evidence that an important feast was celebrated annually at the open-air sanctuary of Kul-e Farah, the “feast of Aiapir”. The ruler played a central role at this feast, which “may have been a forum at which the king could pay off ‘debts’ by awarding seats of honor to his servants in the local government”. Commoners also participated. Ultimately, “[t]hat which is celebrated is the community that convenes and reconstitutes itself. Group identity, social hierarchy, and bonds of loyalty are reconfirmed in the sacrifice and the ensuing banquet.” <sup id="cite_ref-571" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-571">[571]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ respect for authority ♣ inferred present ♥</b> There is evidence that an important feast was celebrated annually at the open-air sanctuary of Kul-e Farah, the “feast of Aiapir”, at which the king, the aristocracy, and commoners all participated. Though this feast probably celebrated the community as a whole, iconographic evidence suggests that a certain emphasis was also placed on hierarchy: “Visible hierarchy was a key element. As De Waele (1972: 2-3; 1989: 34) notes, the Kul-e Farah reliefs are a panorama of an intricate social pyramid in which status is expressed by size, arrangement, closeness to the king, representation in frontal view or in profile, garments, hair-cut, and beard.” <sup id="cite_ref-572" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-572">[572]</a></sup></dd>

<p><b>♠ Famine relief ♣ [absent; present]: 743-674 BCE; present: 668-664 BCE; [present; absent]: 663-647 BCE ♥</b> I have coded present during the time when the reigns of Urtaki (or Urtak, r. 674-64 BCE) of Elam and Ashurbanipal of Assyria overlap. Urtaki 'at first maintained good relations with the Assyrian king Assurbanipal (668-27), who helped him by sending wheat during a famine'.<sup id="cite_ref-573" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-573">[573]</a></sup> 'Furthermore, Elamite refugees were allowed to settle in Assyria until such time as the harvest improved in Elam ... Assurbanipal was explicit in justifying his gesture of aid as a by-product of Urtak's treaty with his father Esarhaddon. But in 664 BC Urtak attacked Babylonia', causing Ashurbanipal to mount a counter-attack and ending the alliance.<sup id="cite_ref-574" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-574">[574]</a></sup>
</p>
<dl><dd> <b>♠ provision of famine relief ♣ state ♥</b> In this case, I have coded 'state' because the wheat sent by the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal to Elam was mediated through the Elamite king Urtaki.</dd></dl>
<p><b>♠ Food storage ♣ inferred present ♥</b> King Urtaki must have had storehouses where he could store the grain he received from Ashurbanipal for distribution to the population, who were suffering from famine.<sup id="cite_ref-575" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-575">[575]</a></sup> Also, administrative texts from the succeeding period provide more direct evidence: 'The title of the leading official mentioned in the Acropole texts [from Neo-Elamite III-period Susa], Kuddakaka, was <i>araš-hutlak</i>, a designation that may literary [<i>sic</i>] mean "representative of the (royal) stores"'.<sup id="cite_ref-576" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-576">[576]</a></sup> As in the later Achaemenid administrative system, grain was kept in these royal storehouses for distribution to various workers.<sup id="cite_ref-577" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-577">[577]</a></sup>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>♠ provision of food storage ♣ state ♥</b> In this case, I have coded 'state' because the wheat sent by the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal to Elam was mediated through the Elamite king Urtaki. We have references to royal storehouses from Neo-Elamite III-period administrative texts.<sup id="cite_ref-578" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-578">[578]</a></sup> There may have been temple storehouses too, but I have found no mention of these in the sources.</dd></dl>
<p><b>♠ Alimentary supplementation ♣ inferred present ♥</b> Henkelman views points out that <i>šip</i>, a sacrificial feast for which we have detailed records from the Achaemenid period but which was in all likelihood carried out in Neo-Elamite times as well,<sup id="cite_ref-579" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-579">[579]</a></sup> served as an occasion for distributing meat to workers: 'Apart from its social and ideological functions, <i>šip</i> also had an economic side to it ... namely, the distribution of meat rations to laborers'.<sup id="cite_ref-580" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-580">[580]</a></sup> This must have been a valuable supplement to the average worker's diet. '[Theo Sundermeier] rightly stresses the important dietary aspect of sacrificial meals: "in archaic societies meat is not an everyday food, but a feast!" (Sundermeier 2002: 6)'.<sup id="cite_ref-581" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-581">[581]</a></sup>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>♠ provision of alimentary supplementation ♣ state ♥</b> In Achaemenid <i>šip</i> celebrations, sacrificial offerings (which in practice became extra rations for workers) were distributed from the royal storehouses by state administrators.<sup id="cite_ref-582" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-582">[582]</a></sup> Henkelman's discussion shows that he believes a similar arrangement existed under the Neo-Elamite kings: 'In this context it must be stressed that, unlike the (Indo-)Iranian background of the Persians, the Middle and the Neo-Elamite state provided all the conditions necessary for a feast like <i>šip</i>: a centralized government, a clear royal ideology expressed by means of various media including public religion, a certain degree of prosperity, an intricate social hierarchy, a complex bureaucracy, and state-run institutions with considerable numbers of personnel and dependent laborers'.<sup id="cite_ref-583" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-583">[583]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p><b>♠ Drinking water ♣ ♥</b> Ashurbanipal's account of the Assyrian sack of Susa in 647 or 646 BCE boasts: 'Their wells of drinking water I dried them up'.<sup id="cite_ref-584" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-584">[584]</a></sup> However, it is not clear whether these were public goods or private facilities.

<p><b>♠ Funding for festivals ♣ inferred present ♥</b> As evidence of continuity between earlier Neo-Elamite times and the Neo-Elamite III period, Henkelman notes that the kings 'still organised grand sacrificial feasts, in which a host of cultic dignitaries and court officials participated'.<sup id="cite_ref-585" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-585">[585]</a></sup> The implication is that grand feasts, presumably funded as well as organised by the central power, were held in this earlier period too.

<dd> <b>♠ Universities, “proto-universities”, or other higher education ♣ [present; absent] ♥</b> Stolper demonstrates that Mesopotamian-style scribal schools existed at Susa during the Middle Elamite period, 1400-1100 BCE: 'The texts in Akkadian show distinctive spellings, the mark of a consistent local scribal tradition ... These documents are the traces of a continuing knowledge and use of Mesopotamian languages, and of a continuing practice of scholarship, modeled on Mesopotamian originals but in a style particular to the region, in which at least occasional efforts were made to transpose Mesopotamian scholarly work into Elamite'.<sup id="cite_ref-590" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-590">[590]</a></sup> He is less clear about whether this tradition persisted past 1100 BCE and into the Neo-Elamite period, so I have coded [present; absent] here.</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Libraries ♣ [present; absent] ♥</b> Potts infers the presence of libraries - perhaps a 'temple library' at Susa - in the Middle Elamite period,<sup id="cite_ref-591" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-591">[591]</a></sup> but I have not yet found evidence that these survived into the Neo-Elamite period.</dd>

Urtaki 'at first maintained good relations with the Assyrian king Assurbanipal (668-27), who helped him by sending wheat during a famine'.<sup id="cite_ref-593" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-593">[593]</a></sup> 'Furthermore, Elamite refugees were allowed to settle in Assyria until such time as the harvest improved in Elam ...

<p><b>♠ Tribute ♣ {absent; present} ♥</b> One of the rock reliefs (KF I) at the site of Kul-e Farah depicts a figure identified in Elamite cuneiform as 'Hanni, son of Tahhi, <i>kutur</i> ("prince" or "chief") of Ayapir and vassal of the Elamite king Šutur-Nahhunte, son of Indada' (in Álvarez-Mon's words).<sup id="cite_ref-597" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-597">[597]</a></sup> The vassal relationship implies that this Hanni would have sent some form of tribute to Šutur-Nahhunte. In addition to this, Álvarez-Mon has interpreted one of the scenes on the Arjan bowl, found in a Neo-Elamite tomb in 1982, as representing a 'tribute procession'.<sup id="cite_ref-598" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-598">[598]</a></sup> I have coded for scholarly disagreement here because various figures have been proposed for the dates of both KF I and the Arjan bowl.
