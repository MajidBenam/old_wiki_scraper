<p>Crete is a large island in the Eastern Mediterranean. Here we consider the phase of its history best known as the Neopalatial Era. This period followed a series of conflagrations at the end of the Old Palace era (1700 BCE), which affected almost all Cretan sites. Little agreement exists about the causes of these destructions. Although it has been generally argued that these were possibly caused by earthquake, the senario of  war conflicts among major political centers of the period cannot  be excluded. <sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> The Neopalatial era ended, in 1450,  in a similar way to the previous phase: the central complexes (except for the one at Knossos), many important buildings and whole settlements were violently damaged by fire and abandoned, and the Cretan presence in the Aegean and the Near East came to an end. The causes of these destructions have also been a topic of vivid debate: a massive natural disaster (earthquake), war, internal disruption or system collapse have all been suggested as possible explanations <sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>, though perhaps human rather than natural causes are more likely<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>.

<p><b> ♠ Settlement hierarchy ♣ [1-6] ♥ </b> levels. Excavated testimonies supplemented with information from systematic survey projects provide a sound starting point for the reconstruction of settlement hierarchies during the New Palace period. <sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup> According to the most widely accepted narrative Crete was divided into regional polities controlled by political fractions residing in monumental complexes, generally known as "palaces", built at the center of large urban centers. These large towns -their extend is 25 ha or more-  were the "capitals" of the regional quasi-polities dominating the political landscape of Crete. Small towns, their size varies from 10 to 4 ha, were scattered in the hinterland. They were provided with substantial central buildings which in their architectural layout emulate these of the capital towns. Villages, hamlets and farmhouses were in the periphery of these towns and even in remote and marginal areas.
</p><p><b> ♠ Administrative levels ♣ 5 ♥ </b> levels. [1-5] 1: village heads; 2: town heads; 3: district heads; 4: regional governors; 5: central government.  As for many other facets of Neopalatial societies, evidence for administration is limited and consists mostly of clay archival documents.  <sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup>  We may assume that villages and town were controlled by local leaders whose in their turn were under the administration of high ranking government officials. It seems likely that the control was local and related to small territorial units. Texts deal mostly with agricultural staples (cereal crops, olive oil and olives, wine, figs and some other unidentified goods) and occasionally with dependent work-force, livestock, craft products,  wool, and pottery. <sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup> The cornerstone of political economies was the exploitation of agricultural wealth. Staples were kept in central stores and were used for the needs of a limited number of individuals <sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup> They sustained elite and dependent craftsmen and laborers, financed state enterprises, and were consumed in large-scale ceremonial events in order to project political and social power and reaffirm social status. Archival data shows that goods were collected thought taxation. Whether they were produced in land owned by the central administration  or land that was privately owned cannot be determined. <sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup> The preserved documents only record the transactions in which the central administration was directly interested, and thus do not provide a complex picture of all economy and administrative aspects of a given sociopolitical setting. The juxtaposition of archaeological material excavated in sites where archival documents were found with goods recorded in the tables shows that  Linear A tablets cover only part of the administrative concerns <sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup> Important craft goods and raw material (ingots, tusk of ivory, steatite ext.) used for the production of precious artifacts whose possession and display were critical to the state's ability to clay legitimacy and stored in the  stores of the central administration <sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup> were not mentioned in tablets. According to Schoep "the absence of any reference to such goods in the tablets is surprising and cannot be explained in terms of lack of interest on the part of administration in the production and/or aqcuisition of craft goods, since this is contradicted by the archaeological evidence. The possibility that documents other than tablets were concerned with craft goods must be seriously considered." <sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup> The variety of sealed documents (single-holes nodules, two-hole hanging nodules, roundels, noduli and flat-based nodules) used for sealing perishables documents highlight the importance of documents written in perishable materials in the Neopalatial administration. Officials surveyed the countryside and brought back information to the central administration. Clay tablets "were dealing with one kind of obligations, which mainly concerned agricultural commodities, while sealed documents related to other kind of transactions, involving a different, perhaps wider geographical scale and commodities and/or matters of a different administrative status. At the end of the administration cycle the information from the tablets was copied onto documents in perishable materials, to which single-hole hanging nodules may have been attached." <sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Religious levels ♣ suspected unknown ♥ </b> levels. Male and female figures depicted in various iconographic media were often identified as priests and priestesses.<sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup> The frequency of such depictions during the New Palace period has been interpreted as " a need for a more pronounced identity arose as a result of the greater consolidation of the ruling class." <sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup> The sacerdotal figures were dressed with sumptuary adorned robes and dresses, have special hairstyles and hold insignia of their authority (curved axes, double-axes, stone maces, and ritual objects).

All evidence points to a division between priest and priestess: priest were associated with hunting and perhaps in the daily administration  while priestess  to pouring of libations, processions, bringing offerings and performing dances. The most important ritual performed by priestesses was  the impersonation of the goddess. According Marinatos "Minoan priesthood was a permeant profession and not a stage in the "career" of the nobility". and "I would think that the priesthood in palatial Crete formed a strong corporation from the ranks of which the priest-king and the goddess impersonator were chosen." <sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup> It should be noted, however, that because of the absence of sound information all these are speculations.

In recent years, however, new perspectives have effectively challenged not only the redistributive role of governing institutions but also the negative attitude towards the existence of market and market-like systems in the Aegean. <sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup> Once people started looking for them, markets have begun to appear in much earlier chronological horizons, shaping the emergence of state administrative institutions. <sup id="cite_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup> ( Garraty and Stark 2010).

<dd><b> ♠ food storage sites ♣ suspected unknown ♥ </b> The only known free-standing storage complexes are the Northeast House at Knossos <sup id="cite_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup> and the the Bastione at Hagia Triada. <sup id="cite_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup> Although there is no doubt for the storage function of these complexes, their "public" character is entirely uncertain. <sup id="cite_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup> Might the Northeast House have been a communal storehouse under the control of the community or of an elite group independent of that residing within the palace, or was it under the control of the central palace authority? A convincing answer to this question cannot be given; it would depend, to a certain extent, on the theoretical context adopted by each scholar in the approach to the Neopalatial polities. Those who see political organization under a heterarchical interpretative scheme would be in favor of a scenario according to which the wealth stored in the complex would be in the hands of the community or a powerful faction competing with the central administration. On the contrary, those who assign an important role to the ruling group residing within the palace, would see government officials as the managers of the stored goods within the setting of the highly specialized Knossian economy. It is highly unlikely that the Northeast House, built close to the palace, the seat of a ruling group that would have controlled many aspects of the daily life of the inhabitants of the city and other centers, would have been an independent storage unit under communal or factional control. The same arguments apply in the case of the Bastione at Hagia Triada.</dd></dl>

<p><b>♠ RA ♣ ♥</b> <i>The following were coded through pers. comm. with Kostis Christakis</i>
</p><p><b>♠ Expert ♣ Kostis Christakis ♥</b>
</p><p>General Description of warfare: The Minoan world was once thought to be a wondrous world of peaceful prosperity. This utopian vision was created by Sir Arthur Evans, the legendary excavator of the palace at Knossos. As he states in the introductory part of the first volume of <i>The Palace of Minos</i> " It was, however, reserved for Athenian chauvinism so to exaggerate the tyrannical side of that early sea-dominion as to convert the Palace of a long series of great rulers into an ogre’s den. But the fabulous accounts of the Minotaur and his victims are themselves expressive of a childish wonder at the mighty creations of a civilization beyond the ken of the new-comers. The spade of the excavator has indeed done much to explain and confute them. The ogre’s den turns out to be a peaceful abode of priest-kings, in some respects more modern in its equipments than anything produced by classical Greece." <sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup> Evans’s vision of a romantic and idealistic Minoan society owes a great deal to the general political, social and emotional angst in Europe of his time. <sup id="cite_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup> A vast array of testimonies including use of defensible sites, fortifications, guard houses, weapons, depictions on iconographic media, osteology, and evidence for the violent destruction of many contexts by human action shows that conflict and warfare have been an integral part of New Palace societies. <sup id="cite_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-68">[68]</a></sup> These data challenged the long established vision created by Evans of a <i>Pax Minoica</i>. As Molloy argued "When we take the evidence together in general terms, there is a staggering amount of violence in the symbolic grammar and material remains from prehistoric Crete. Weapons and warrior culture were materialized variously in sanctuaries, graves, domestic units and hoards, and symbolically on portable media intended for use during social interactions (administration, feasting, personal adornment). There were few spheres of interaction in Crete that dis not have a martial components, firth down to the symbols used in their written scripts. The social and institutional components of war impacted on settlement patterns, landscape exploitation, technological and trade networks, religious practices, art, administration and more, so that war was indirectly a constant factor in shaping the daily lives of people in prehistoric Crete." <sup id="cite_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-69">[69]</a></sup>

</p><p>RELIGION AND RITUAL IN NEW PALACE CRETE
</p><p>Evidence for cult and ritual becomes more extensive during the New Palace period. A vast array of testimonies including pictorial compositions from palaces, gold signet rings, seals, large groups of ritual utensils and sanctuary complexes is particularly informative. Understanding and interpreting these data, however, is not always so straightforward as it seems and many of the proposed narratives depending on accepting highly questionable hypotheses. <sup id="cite_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-70">[70]</a></sup> Cult in open-air sites became less spontaneous and more formal than it was before. Important open-air sanctuaries were that of Jouktas, very close to Knossos, and the sanctuary of Syme at Viannos, in the south area of east-central Crete. Both had monumental architectural structures inside which the ritual took palace. An outdoor sanctuary of this type is depicted in a low relief on the stone ritual rhyton from the Sanctuary Treasury of the palace at Zakros. <sup id="cite_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup> The rhyton, which was originally covered with gold, depicts a sacred enclosure topped with horns of consecration, altars, and a building with a tripartite facade with flagpoles in front. The central niche of the tripartite building is topped by  a baetylic object which represent a rock or the sacred mountain. The object musts have a great importance, for it is flanked by pairs of goats.
</p><p>The evidence from Syme is particularly relevant since provide information for changes in ritual practices from the Old to the New Palace period. <sup id="cite_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-72">[72]</a></sup> A grandiose enclosure, with a central podium, and a paved processional road along the west and south sides of the complex were built over the ruins of the roofed Old Palace complex. These architectural configurations mark a cut-off point in the history of the sanctuary, marking major changes in the cult. The open space defined by the enclosure was reserved for the lighting of fires, the slaughter and consumption of animals and the deposition of offerings. The pottery recovered from the interior includes tubular stands, goblets, chalices and stone libation tables. Similar rituals as these occurred in open-air sanctuaries took palace in sacred caves. Precious offerings, mainly bronze tools, figurines and weapons, have been discovered in the Psychro, Kamares and Skoteino caves and the Idaean cave. Unique is the case of Arkalochori cave where an impressive hoard of metal objects of bronze, silver and gold, has been found although there were no ritual vessels or other pottery. As Rethemiotakis argued “These metal finds seems to have been carefully selected from the offerings of some open-air sanctuaries for the purpose of exploitation, but they ended up in the cave, either accidentally or because of unpredictable factors, before they could reach their final destination. The contents of the cave of Archalochori thus offer relatively direct testimony to the wealth in metals that could be accumulated through worship, as well as to the role that the high priesthood played in handling and circulating precious materials, a process that granted prestige and power.” <sup id="cite_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-73">[73]</a></sup>
</p><p>Palaces were the centers of official religious activities. Important rituals, probably attended by large crowds were organized in the central courts of the complexes while ritual ceremonies involving a restricted number of individuals took place inside the complex itself. <sup id="cite_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-74">[74]</a></sup> Many of these ceremonies were depicted in wall-painting programs from the palace of Knossos. The fresco displayed on the walls of the "Corridor of the Procession" of the Knossian palace depicts life-size figures, most of them male, with raised arms in a position of worship. Some carried precious vessels.  The figures wore different garments and this might imply different status and age groups. Another wall-painting depicting an ascending procession of men carrying vessels and holding lotus flowers was displayed on the walls of the Grand Staircase. These glorious processions provide the means to the ruling class to display its power, prestige, wealth and its privileged association to the divine forces. Many of the objects depicted in these compositions were found in the palaces. The most impressive assemblage was that stored in the repository of the palace of Zakros (east Crete) -it comprise stone vases of high craftsmanship such as rhyta, communion chalices, and ceremonial amphora and jugs - suggesting that they were used in rituals that took place in the sanctuary of the west wing of the palace and/or in the so-called banquet  hall. <sup id="cite_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-75">[75]</a></sup> The central courts of the palaces and other open spaces around the complex were used for rituals attended by larger crowds. A series of miniature frescoes from the palace at Knossos, albeit too fragmentary to permite a safe reconstruction, is particularly informative on that direction. <sup id="cite_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-76">[76]</a></sup>  The "Sacred Grove fresco" depicts a large crow of male and female spectators participating in a public festival in a setting with paved areas and groves, possibly the West Court of the palace; the sexes are segregated and women seem to be the protagonists.  Another wall painting, the so-called "Grandstand fresco", depicts a crowd of spectators in a background of elaborate architectural facades with rows of columns with horns of consecration and double axes. The fresco probably shows festivals in the Central Court of the palace.
</p><p>Rituals of purification were held in <i>adyta</i> (lustral basins) built in palaces and lavish urban mansions. <sup id="cite_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-77">[77]</a></sup> These specially arranged rooms were sunk into the ground giving the impression of a basin and were accessible via a small staircase. The direct association of lustral basins with ceremonial spaces, decoration with frescos depicting religious themes, and artifactual assemblages indicates that these spaces were used for cultic activities and specifically for lustrations.  It has also been observed that many lustral basins are situated beyond pier-and-door partition spaces, i.e spaces with multiple door bays separated by wooden piers.  <sup id="cite_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-78">[78]</a></sup> This Minoan architectural invention was used to provide control of light, visual access, and circulation. Patterns of restricted/controlled accessibility around lustral  basins suggest that these spaces were places of separation and seclusion. At House (Xeste) 3 at Akrotiri, Thera, the lustral basin is decorated with a pictorial program related to a festival which celebrated the renewal of nature and in which initiation of young girls was involved. <sup id="cite_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-79">[79]</a></sup> Lustral basins, therefore, were also used for initiation rituals. "The adyton must be seen as a place of separation; descent into it might even carried connotations of contact with the earth to the underworld". <sup id="cite_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-80">[80]</a></sup>
</p><p>Large concentrations of pottery used for cooking, pouring, drinking and eating food and organic remains in many cultic contexts indicates that feasting was an important aspect of cult. <sup id="cite_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-81">[81]</a></sup> Collective feasting is particularly widespread during the New Place period and new convivial etiquettes have been promoted by some centers. <sup id="cite_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-82">[82]</a></sup> At Syme sanctuary ceremonial activities included the lighting of fires, sacrifice, the offering and eating animals (ships and goats) and the dedication of offerings. <sup id="cite_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-83">[83]</a></sup> The high percentage of cooking pots among the pottery assemblage indicates that the meat (and perhaps other goods) was not only offered directly to the fire to be roasted, but also cooked in cooking pots. Cups of various types and small chalices shows that liquids were also brought and consumed during feasting. Most are plain undecorated specimens and were probably used by large groups of pilgrims. Large communion chalices, products of skilled work, lavishly decorated were used by a more restricted number of persons and contain offerings to the divine. Similar feasting events, although not in the same scale as these observed at Syme, were also attested in many other places of cult including sacred caves. Consumption of food, beside the satisfaction of physiological needs, can establish, maintain and change social relations. <sup id="cite_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-84">[84]</a></sup>. Public feasting is an occasion where "information can be exchange and transmitted on a large scale, where commensality breaks down (or creates by means of exclusion) social distance, where social roles are negotiated, and can even be reversed or broken down, especially where intoxication is involved".<sup id="cite_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-85">[85]</a></sup>
</p><p>Many rituals were depicted on gold signet rings or on their impression on soft clay. <sup id="cite_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-86">[86]</a></sup> These precious rings, products of high craftsmanship, were used by highly ranked officials to seal objects and secure transactions of the upper level of state administration. Their iconographic themes reflect important religious ideas. A series of scenes depict baetylic rituals where a female or male figures kneeling and touching  a stone. <sup id="cite_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-87">[87]</a></sup>  Sacred stones, knowns as <i>baetylus</i>, were supposedly endowed with life. According to ancient sources of the historic periods, <i>baetylus</i> were meteorites, which were dedicated to the gods or revered as symbols of the gods themselves. The butterfly or bird approaching the kneeling figure conveys the power or presence of the divinity to the stone baetly. Warren, based on a series of scenes illustrated on signet rings and sealstones, reconstructed the sequence of ritual as follows: "First, a man or woman, a mortal participant in ritual, often naked, approached a baetly, perhaps having already deposited a female's dress as a votive offering or sacred robe elsewhere in the cult area. Second, the participant kneels and touches the baetly, and summons the divinity is indicated by a bird or butterfly epiphany. Third, the participant finally embraces and kisses the boulder in communion with the divinity". <sup id="cite_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-88">[88]</a></sup> Another ritual depicted on gold rings and seals is the presentation to the divinity, whether envisioned or in the person of a priestess, or in a cult statue or anionic object, a lavish robe. <sup id="cite_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-89">[89]</a></sup> A figure, sometimes naked, carries the sacred garment to the shrine and offered or clothed it to a goddess (or a priestess impersonating the goddess). The  votive faience clothing decorated with crocus flowers, found in the Temple Repositories of the palace at Knossos depicts actual garments offered to the deity. <sup id="cite_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-90">[90]</a></sup>  The ritual continues also during the Mycenaean period; it has been argued that the term <i>te-o-po-ri-ja</i> in Linear B tablets mean a carrying of an image together with cloth for dedication <sup id="cite_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-91">[91]</a></sup> The offering of the peplos to Athena and the dedication of jewelry and clothes to Eileithyia indicates that the robe ritual continues into historic periods. Tree-cult rituals were also depicted in many signet rings. Goddesses are often seated under trees receiving offerings. The tree, therefore, mark the sacred place. In other cases trees growing within enclosures or spouting out of shrines were worshiped by male and female ado rants, usually naked or half-naked.<sup id="cite_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-92">[92]</a></sup> Some of these rituals were depicted on the same ring.  The most famous case is the so-called the "Ring of Minos" the largest gold signet ring ever found. <sup id="cite_ref-93" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-93">[93]</a></sup> "The ring displays  a concise version of the three levels of Minoan cosmology. The goddess is shown in small scale at the upper right, hovering above the earth with her hair flying as she make her descent. The central zone of the bezel, rendered in larger scale, depicts the goddess seated on a stopped altar watching a three-cult ritual being performed by a man dressed in a loincloth who appears to be offering a fruit or a ceremonial vessel to  the goddess. A similar tree-cult scene with a naked or half-naked woman can be seen at the left. A large part of the composition is occupied by trees growing within enclosures. The movements, positions, and twisted bodies of the two ado rants vividly demonstrate their excitement at the advent of the goddess to the visible world. The lowest level of the composition presents a seafaring scene in which the goddess steers a boat that has a seahorse at its stern and a shrine with horns of consecration on its deck." ... "In essence, the depictions on this ring to celebrate the unity of the natural world by recording the passage of the goddess through the cosmic elements of earth, air, land, and sea, an image that summarizes the significance of the divine presence in the world of mortals." <sup id="cite_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-94">[94]</a></sup> The signet ring from Isopata represents the epiphany of the goddess, depicted as a hovering image descending from the sky, and an ecstatic dance of female adorants in a meadow bloom with lilies. Epiphany rituals consist of the apocalyptic appearance of the goddess in human form to mortals by way of a theatrical performance with priestesses. <sup id="cite_ref-95" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-95">[95]</a></sup>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣  bull leaping  ♥</b> Despite the wealth of excavated data, it is very difficult to say which ritual, exactly, was the largest collective ritual of the official cult in Neopalatial Crete. The present coding reflects the personal view of the coder, though this view is both supported by existing evidence and by our experts <sup id="cite_ref-98" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-98">[98]</a></sup>. The bull was identified with the Minoan world. <sup id="cite_ref-99" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-99">[99]</a></sup> Its indissoluble relationship to ritual does not merely highlight aspects of religious expression but also projects the political ideal of the palatial system, the sovereign power of the ruling group. The frequent depiction of bull-leaping, especially in the palatial context of Knossos, does not simply express the human attempt to tame nature, personified in the dynamic figure of the charging bull. Apart from the tension evoked by life-and-death situations, human mastery over the wild powers of nature is symbolic of the mastery of the ruling class, ensuring social cohesion and the preservation of the social hierarchy. The battle with the bull functions, above all, as a token of political dominance, which metaphorically reproduces the authority of the ruler. In this context, the depiction of bull-leaping scenes in the frescoes decorating the walls of, exclusively, the palace of Knossos, displays the dominant role of that palace. It is obviously no coincidence that the myth of the Minotaur, the monster with the body of a man and the head of a bull, was identified with Knossos and its Labyrinth, the reference-point of the Minoan world. The emblematic character of the bull was reinforced during the Neopalatial period and reached its peak in the pictorial decoration of the palace of Knossos. The power and masculinity of the bull inspired the execution of dangerous acrobatics with a bull in the context of bull-leaping games. In a display of physical strength, courage and even human dominance, young athletes attempted to leap over the back of a charging bull and land on their feet on the ground. The sport, in which both men and women participated, is attested as early as the Prepalatial period and continued to be performed in the same way throughout the Minoan era. It is depicted in a multitude of scenes in many different art-forms, demonstrating the powerful influence it exercised on wide social strata due to its spectacular nature and the high degree of risk for the athletes involved. The most characteristic and detailed scenes are those in a series of wall paintings, known as the “Taureador Frescoes”, from the palace of Knossos (1600-1400 BC). The fit male acrobat, his gender indicated by his dark brown skin, uses the bull's momentum to leap between its horns and flip over its back, landing behind it. In order to protect himself from the bull's horns as far as possible, he is aided by two people, presumably assistants, who hold onto the horns to slow the animal down and prevent it tossing its head dangerously, while a third helper waits behind the bull to catch the athlete as he lands. In bull-leaping depictions the acrobat's assistants are young women, perhaps adolescents, as indicated by their small breasts and their white skin, always a female attribute. In the unrestored scenes mentioned above, athletes are seen falling to the ground after unsuccessful leaps, highlighting the risks involved in the sport. Many condensed bull-leaping scenes are found on a series of seal impressions made by gold or silver signet rings, mainly from Hagia Triada and Sklavokambos, and on seals of various materials. This demonstrates both the great popularity of the spectacle and its use by senior officials and inspectors of the palatial bureaucracy, particularly that of Knossos. Knossos has also provided further bull-leaping images. One is actually three-dimensional: the famous ivory acrobat in mid-leap, originally part of a group, of which limbs and two heads of bull-leapers have been preserved. A similar group, in a very fragmentary state, was found during the excavation of the “Royal Road” between the palace and the “Little Palace” at Knossos. An exceptionally delicate bull-leaping scene on a rock-crystal plaque is a masterpiece of Minoan miniature art. The capture of the bull in the wild is associated, pictorially and perhaps also in fact, with the sport of bull-leaping, as a series of images shows. In Minoan-style scenes on two gold cups from Vapheio in Laconia, a wild bull is caught in a net tied between two trees. In another scene, a charging bull tosses two “hunters” who are, however, unarmed. The roles are reversed here - the bull is probably the hunter and the men the hunted. Their spectacular tumble, dangerous to life and limb, recalls the failed leaps and falls depicted in the frescoes of Knossos and Avaris.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ yearly ♥</b> Speculative, but supported by the following quote. "As to their social context, it seems logical that these formalized bull-games ending with bull-leaping and, probably, bull-sacrifice might have been too special to have occurred every month, but they are also too elaborately organized to occur only sporadically. On the one hand, the adolescent gymnasts would have to practice formal bull-leaping for a considerable time; on the other hand, their older trainers would be familiar with the sport and in shape themselves for an even longer time. These conditions, plus the very popularity of the sport, should imply a regular occurrence but not one too frequent to become humdrum. Once a year might satisfy the logical requirements. The event should also take place when bulls were no longer needed for stud services, and this requirement could be satisfied if the bull were captured and trained after the mating season--perhaps this is implied in the Vapheio Quiet Cup.

<dd><b>♠ animal sacrifice ♣ inferred present ♥</b> "What happened after the process bull-leaping is unknown. I imagine that sacrificing the bull would have formed a fitting close to the bull-games. The sacrifice of bulls is well illustrated and has received much attention; it undoubtedly occurred often during several kinds of rituals, including funeral rites and perhaps hero/ancestor worship. And there are some pieces of circumstantial evidence for relating bull-sacrifice to the bull-games. The garlands around the netted bull-rhyta should indicate the sacral character of captured bulls, emphasized by the loose garlands that some athletes wore; the Phaistos bull-leaping stand (if that's what it was) also had a sacral character at times, as the sacrificial trau found atop it testifies. And the frontal face of some bulls may imply they were destined for death." <sup id="cite_ref-118" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-118">[118]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ drinking ritual ♥</b> Despite the wealth of excavated data, it is very difficult to say which ritual exactly was the most frequent collective ritual of the official cult. However, it does seem that ritualised drinking was practiced very often. "While drinking and feasting can be detected from the Early Bronze Age (as indicated by the appearance of drinking vessels), it seems that it becomes more intense from the end of that phase and continuous through the first palace period, reaching its peak in the neopalatial period. This is the period when most evidence for wine production is found, as well as the period which is characterized by an explosion in the elaboration of material culture, the establishment of many buildings which imitate palatial styles and replicate their function, some in close proximity to each other (as in the area around Knossos), and the production of masses of drinking and serving vessels, with the conical cup as the most common shape. Such vessels are found in many hundreds and thousands and are mostly plain, indicating mass production (Table 1). This is also the period with the most evidence for ritualized consumption, as indicated by the large number of structured depositions of drinking cups, sometimes accompanied by other feasting evidence (Hamilakis 1995). Pottery production, especially of drinking vessels, shows trends of standardization, with the number of drinking shapes decreasing as the percentage of drinking-vessels increases (Table 1), indicating mass production." <sup id="cite_ref-119" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-119">[119]</a></sup> "I have suggested (Hamilakis 1995,1996) that this picture, which can also be seen with variations in other social arenas such as mortuary feasting (Hamilakis 1998a), may indicate complex social interactions characterized by intense competition for retinue and resources. Wine production may have been adopted as an elite distinction mechanism imitating 'oriental' customs (Sherratt and Sherratt 1991), but it must also have been triggered by the need for alcohol consumption in feasting and other social gatherings that intensify from the end of the Early Bronze Age, as elites were stepping up competition for authority and control. This process of competition is much more evident in the neopalatial period, where, I have suggested, a process of intense factionalism can be identified, with the many palatial centres operating as centres of competitive consumption, with feasting and drinking cere- monies as one of its main features (Hamilakis 1995,1997-8; cf.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Epiphany ♥</b> The central event in Minoan ritual enactments is the epiphany of the deity, the revelation of the divine presence to the faithful. In Minoan theological thought, the goddess descends from the heavens. Prayers, invocations, ceremonial dances and other sacred acts were intended to bring about her appearance from on high to bless her worshippers and alleviate human suffering. Doves or larger birds, or even mythological beings, accompanied her on her journey from heaven to earth. Scenes on sealstones and signet rings depict the different stages of the epiphany, forming impressive, poetic compositions. The intensity of the goddess's descent is stressed by her long, waving locks, while a rod-shaped sceptre is usually displayed as a symbol of authority by the young god. Often, specific ritual actions combined with typical features of the Cretan landscape, such as pulling the sacred tree or embracing a natural stone, hint at a mythological background associated with the deity worshipped, which is enacted in the form of a dance drama. The heavenly epiphany of the Minoan deities contributed to the location of cult on mountain peaks and low hills, in humble sanctuaries with few built structures. Simple countryfolk and townspeople alike made offerings of small human or animal figurines deposited in cracks in the rocks, invoking divine aid for the fertility of soil, flocks and herds, or for healing. Clay models of human limbs and other body parts functioned in a similar way to modern Greek votive offerings, indicating the afflicted area. The huge numbers of figurines and other offerings found at the peak sanctuaries of Juktas, Kophinas, Petsophas, Traostalos, Piskokephalo and Vrysinas demonstrate the religious sentiment of local communities. The gestures of the human figurines, in particular, express the pleas of the faithful for the god's blessing and awe before the deity. The arms may be folded on the breast or cover the face, protecting the worshipper from the light accompanying the revelation of the divine. The nature goddess was worshipped not only at the peak sanctuaries but also at open-air sanctuaries and sacred caves. A unique case of an extensive complex of supralocal character is the open-air sanctuary at Syme Viannou. The abundant votives and vessels of the open-air cult, centred on a sacred enclosure with a raised platform, highlight the special significance of the sanctuary throughout the Minoan period. Secondary residential areas for the priesthood bear witness to the organisation of the official cult. Open-air spaces functioned as the ideal backdrop for widely attended religious enactments, while elements of the Cretan landscape, such as the typical vegetation and natural rocks, formed the focus of ritual behaviours invested with a specific ideological content. However, the palatial management of the religious ceremonies, especially those centred on the epiphany, was indissolubly linked to the renewal of royal power and the imposition of a specific system of religious values, serving the political ideology of the dominant ruling class. <sup id="cite_ref-173" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-173">[173]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣  bull leaping  ♥</b> Despite the wealth of excavated data, it is very difficult to say which ritual, exactly, was <i>the</i> most dysphoric collective ritual in Neopalatial Crete. The present coding reflects the personal view of the coder, though this view is both supported by existing evidence and by our experts <sup id="cite_ref-213" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-213">[213]</a></sup>. The bull was identified with the Minoan world. <sup id="cite_ref-214" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-214">[214]</a></sup> Its indissoluble relationship to ritual does not merely highlight aspects of religious expression but also projects the political ideal of the palatial system, the sovereign power of the ruling group. The frequent depiction of bull-leaping, especially in the palatial context of Knossos, does not simply express the human attempt to tame nature, personified in the dynamic figure of the charging bull. Apart from the tension evoked by life-and-death situations, human mastery over the wild powers of nature is symbolic of the mastery of the ruling class, ensuring social cohesion and the preservation of the social hierarchy. The battle with the bull functions, above all, as a token of political dominance, which metaphorically reproduces the authority of the ruler. In this context, the depiction of bull-leaping scenes in the frescoes decorating the walls of, exclusively, the palace of Knossos, displays the dominant role of that palace. It is obviously no coincidence that the myth of the Minotaur, the monster with the body of a man and the head of a bull, was identified with Knossos and its Labyrinth, the reference-point of the Minoan world. The emblematic character of the bull was reinforced during the Neopalatial period and reached its peak in the pictorial decoration of the palace of Knossos. The power and masculinity of the bull inspired the execution of dangerous acrobatics with a bull in the context of bull-leaping games. In a display of physical strength, courage and even human dominance, young athletes attempted to leap over the back of a charging bull and land on their feet on the ground. The sport, in which both men and women participated, is attested as early as the Prepalatial period and continued to be performed in the same way throughout the Minoan era. It is depicted in a multitude of scenes in many different art-forms, demonstrating the powerful influence it exercised on wide social strata due to its spectacular nature and the high degree of risk for the athletes involved. The most characteristic and detailed scenes are those in a series of wall paintings, known as the “Taureador Frescoes”, from the palace of Knossos (1600-1400 BC). The fit male acrobat, his gender indicated by his dark brown skin, uses the bull's momentum to leap between its horns and flip over its back, landing behind it. In order to protect himself from the bull's horns as far as possible, he is aided by two people, presumably assistants, who hold onto the horns to slow the animal down and prevent it tossing its head dangerously, while a third helper waits behind the bull to catch the athlete as he lands. In bull-leaping depictions the acrobat's assistants are young women, perhaps adolescents, as indicated by their small breasts and their white skin, always a female attribute. In the unrestored scenes mentioned above, athletes are seen falling to the ground after unsuccessful leaps, highlighting the risks involved in the sport. Many condensed bull-leaping scenes are found on a series of seal impressions made by gold or silver signet rings, mainly from Hagia Triada and Sklavokambos, and on seals of various materials. This demonstrates both the great popularity of the spectacle and its use by senior officials and inspectors of the palatial bureaucracy, particularly that of Knossos. Knossos has also provided further bull-leaping images. One is actually three-dimensional: the famous ivory acrobat in mid-leap, originally part of a group, of which limbs and two heads of bull-leapers have been preserved. A similar group, in a very fragmentary state, was found during the excavation of the “Royal Road” between the palace and the “Little Palace” at Knossos. An exceptionally delicate bull-leaping scene on a rock-crystal plaque is a masterpiece of Minoan miniature art. The capture of the bull in the wild is associated, pictorially and perhaps also in fact, with the sport of bull-leaping, as a series of images shows. In Minoan-style scenes on two gold cups from Vapheio in Laconia, a wild bull is caught in a net tied between two trees. In another scene, a charging bull tosses two “hunters” who are, however, unarmed. The roles are reversed here - the bull is probably the hunter and the men the hunted. Their spectacular tumble, dangerous to life and limb, recalls the failed leaps and falls depicted in the frescoes of Knossos and Avaris.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ yearly ♥</b> Speculative, but supported by the following quote. "As to their social context, it seems logical that these formalized bull-games ending with bull-leaping and, probably, bull-sacrifice might have been too special to have occurred every month, but they are also too elaborately organized to occur only sporadically. On the one hand, the adolescent gymnasts would have to practice formal bull-leaping for a considerable time; on the other hand, their older trainers would be familiar with the sport and in shape themselves for an even longer time. These conditions, plus the very popularity of the sport, should imply a regular occurrence but not one too frequent to become humdrum. Once a year might satisfy the logical requirements. The event should also take place when bulls were no longer needed for stud services, and this requirement could be satisfied if the bull were captured and trained after the mating season--perhaps this is implied in the Vapheio Quiet Cup. We could expect, therefore, bull-games to take place annually in the early Spring." <sup id="cite_ref-215" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-215">[215]</a></sup></dd>

And there are some pieces of circumstantial evidence for relating bull-sacrifice to the bull-games. The garlands around the netted bull-rhyta should indicate the sacral character of captured bulls, emphasized by the loose garlands that some athletes wore; the Phaistos bull-leaping stand (if that's what it was) also had a sacral character at times, as the sacrificial trau found atop it testifies.

<p><b>♠ Rulers are legitimated by gods ♣ inferred present ♥</b> Referring to the appearance of palaces in the Old Palace period: "The great wave of innovation that accompanied their advent had two main effects in the religious sphere. On the one hand, it involved the transfer of collective rituals, based on the communal consumption of food and drink, and on ritual interments, inside the palaces, with the explicit purpose of integrating forms of religious practice already established in the surrounding territory. On the other hand, in the context of a social strategy designed to reinforce the power of the dominant groups, it led to the creation of a palace religion. This received a decisive impulse from the importation of objects, ideas, beliefs and symbols from the Near East. The elites involved in this process were seeking 'to claim affinity with distant elites and represent themselves at a local level as qualitatively different beings'. From now onwards, and up to the end of the Bronze Age, the groups that controlled the palace system worked to achieve a progressive concentration of the exploitation of sacrality as a means of exercising social control." <sup id="cite_ref-234" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-234">[234]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Rulers are gods ♣ inferred present♥</b> <sup id="cite_ref-235" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-235">[235]</a></sup> Minoan Crete: The tiara is a sign of both royalty and divinity in Syria, Hittite Anatolia, and Minoan Crete. This suggests that the Minoan god was probably conceived as a king of his pantheon. It further suggests that we can never know for sure if one particular representation shows the god or the king. Because this ambiguity is deliberate, it need not concern us much. <sup id="cite_ref-236" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-236">[236]</a></sup> King is considered the chief priest. “The Greeks, who did not have divine kingship, rejected the idea of proskynesis.” However, it must be concluded that “Crete had a Near Eastern type of theocracy. This final point may serve as a definition of sacral kingship. Evans was right after all; sacral kingship did exist in Crete. The monarch (and his mythical prototype, the Storm God) was acknowledged as divine.” Rings with the Storm God date to the New Palace epoch. They were designed during the period of one royal dynasty (which may have comprised some four to five kings), and this dynasty promoted the Storm God as a patron of kingship. <sup id="cite_ref-237" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-237">[237]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of equality ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Archaeological and iconographic evidence for status- and sex-based segregation during rituals. "For example, at Ayia Triada stone chalices appear to have been used in the rooms belonging to the Quartiere signorile di nord-ovest, where, according to Robert Koehl, the rites of the andreion were performed, while hundreds of conical cups, which were probably involved in the same rites of ritual consumption, were found in the nearby storeroom.81 The technical and morphological standardization of these vessels, devoid of stylistic elaboration, and the difference in the raw material between the chalices and the cups are clear signs of the unlikelihood of interaction between elites, at the focal center of the rite, and the public, which may have watched or participated but only as anonymous actors. [...] In Minoan ritual, the distance between the common populace and the elites was metaphorically expressed in iconographic representations such as the genii and the enthroned deity (which appear, for example, on the wellknown ring from Tiryns). Among examples of this iconographic type that show serving and pouring activities, the Kamilari clay model best illustrates these activities as tasks of subordinates or nonhuman beings, excluded from social exchange." <sup id="cite_ref-238" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-238">[238]</a></sup> "Evidence from frescoes also suggests that Minoan society was sex-segregated, at least at ceremonial gatherings. The Grandstand fresco portrays women in elegant flounced dresses sitting together and apart from a large undifferentiated red mass of men dressed (like the agricultural workers on the Harvester Vase) only in breechcloths with codpieces, their chests and limbs bare. [...] The representations on sealstones and in frescoes show major gender differences as well. There are clear representations of powerful men and women, but their power is expressed in different ways. Female deities usually sit on a platform associated with a small built structure, perhaps an altar or shrine; animals and people bearing gifts approach them. In a couple of instances the women are accompanied by supernatural animals, a leashed griffin in the fresco from Xeste 3 at Akrotiri (Pl. 7.2), Thera, and “genii” on a gold finger ring from Tiryns on the mainland (but datable to the very end of the Neopalatial period). [...] Powerful human men also appear: men standing erect hold out a staff in front of them in the Commanding Gesture, as on the “Master” seal impression from Chania (Pl. 7.3), and on the Chieftain Cup from Ayia Triada; and in the ship fresco from the West House, Akrotiri, men sit bundled up either alone in open shipboard cabins or under awnings. Several important human women can also be detected, but they are not obviously wielding or enjoying power. [...] More women than men, however, appear in powerful roles, at a larger relative scale, and their importance seems assured by the number of them who sit on camp stools, stools like hassocks, and thrones (chairs with arm rails and backs)." <sup id="cite_ref-239" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-239">[239]</a></sup>

"For example, at Ayia Triada stone chalices appear to have been used in the rooms belonging to the Quartiere signorile di nord-ovest, where, according to Robert Koehl, the rites of the andreion were performed, while hundreds of conical cups, which were probably involved in the same rites of ritual consumption, were found in the nearby storeroom.81 The technical and morphological standardization of these vessels, devoid of stylistic elaboration, and the difference in the raw material between the chalices and the cups are clear signs of the unlikelihood of interaction between elites, at the focal center of the rite, and the public, which may have watched or participated but only as anonymous actors. [...] In Minoan ritual, the distance between the common populace and the elites was metaphorically expressed in iconographic representations such as the genii and the enthroned deity (which appear, for example, on the wellknown ring from Tiryns). Among examples of this iconographic type that show serving and pouring activities, the Kamilari clay model best illustrates these activities as tasks of subordinates or nonhuman beings, excluded from social exchange." <sup id="cite_ref-284" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-284">[284]</a></sup></dd>

Front and rear assistants helped with the leap. And all this while the bull was charging!" <sup id="cite_ref-285" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-285">[285]</a></sup></dd>
