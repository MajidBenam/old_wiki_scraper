<p><b> ♠ Duration  ♣ 1650-1250 BCE ♥ </b>
</p><p>"On the basis of new radiocarbon data, early Shang culture dates from around 1600 to 1300 BC (Expert Team 2000: 63-64). Because of the continuous cultural development from the first stage represented by the early Shang city of Zhengzhou to the later stage represented by the Xiaoshuang- qiao 小双桥 site about 20 km from Zhengzhou, the consensus is that they belong to the same culture. But we still have a short chronological gap between the early Shang remains at Xiaoshuangqiao and the later early Shang remains at Anyang in northern Henan represented by the Huayuanzhuang 花园庄 site, more commonly referred to as Huanbei 洹北 (Guangming Daily 2000). Given the similarities in artifacts and the chronological information so far, I tentatively conclude that Huanbei should be considered an early Shang site (see Chapter 17)." <sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>
</p><p>Periodization:
</p><p>"During Erligang phase I the ceramics show the influences of multiple traditions2 with many different styles of the diagnostic li-tripods (ZSKY 2003:171). Few bronze vessels either in terms of
type or quantity can be dated to this period (currently only some jue and few of those). The vessels, moreover, tend to have thin walls, suggesting, perhaps, that there was not much metal in circulation. Nevertheless, some of the “palace-temple” structures and city walls were constructed in this phase,3 while the bronze foundry at Nanguanwai began production as well.
</p><p>During phase II the ceramic assemblage still shows the multiple influences of the previous period, but bronze artifacts increase in type and quantity, as well as in thickness. Both bronze jue and jia are known from this period. Phase II is considered to be a period of growth and development for the site.
Phase III (the first phase of the upper Erligang period) is Zhengzhou’s apogee. Bronzes from this period increase in both numbers and type, and the foundry at Zijingshan North went into production. The foundry site at Nanguangwai continued to produce as well, meaning that in phase III, Zhengzhou had at least two major bronze workshops in simultaneous operation.
</p><p>During Erligang phase IV (Xiaoshuang- qiao-Huanbei phase I), most of the large structures in the palace-temple area were built over with nonelite structures, and the bronze foundries went out of service by the end. Nevertheless, two bronze hoards, as well as several bronze-vessel-yielding tombs, have all been found at Zhengzhou dating to phase IV. If Zhengzhou was indeed in decline, the tombs suggest it had not yet been completely abandoned by its elites, at least as a burial ground. The hoards, on the other hand, might suggest a scenario of rapid abandonment similar to the case of the late Western Zhou bronze hoards." <sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>

<b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ quasi-polity; confederated state ♥ </b> "These scholars also see the presence of these walled sites and the Erligang expansion in general as evidence for the direct control of a huge territory by a centralized state (Bagley 1999). While the presence of walled Erligang-type sites over a large area suggests a common elite cultural sphere, even while the unparalleled scale of Zhengzhou suggests a cultural and political core, the actual relationships between sites and the mechanisms of putative political control remain unknown. If the analogy to the Anyang period can be made, lacking the infrastructure of later Qin-Han-type imperial control, political relationships even within the Central Plains cultural sphere were likely indirect, mutable, and based on ritually reinforced kinship hierarchy, alliance, and sporadic, rather than routine, mechanisms of coercion. It is also likely that—as with the Zhou dynasts, who set up statelets in strategic areas after the conquest of the Shang—the political, economic, and cultural relationships between sites changed over the course of their occupation, each site and each region having its own local historical trajectory related to, but not necessarily determined by, the fate of the cultural and political core." <sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>

Already, in Erlitou IV and increasingly toward the end of the phase, Erligang-type ceramics were found in the Erlitou assemblage. Six kilometers away and roughly contemporary with the second half of Erlitou IV, the large Shang walled site of Yanshi was built, and, in the Zhengzhou area, an even larger walled site was being constructed. The “Erlitou expansion” was not followed by a retraction of Central Plains material culture, but rather it was incorporated into an even larger “Erligang expansion.” " <sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup></dd>

To the west, north, and northwest in western Shaanxi and Gansu, Inner Mongolia, and northern Shanxi provinces, local traditions, though showing increasing interaction with the Erligang period cultural world, nevertheless preserved material cultural traditions (including bronze-casting) and likely social organization and lifeways different from those of the Zhengzhou core. In Liaoning and Inner Mongolia in the northeast, the Lower Xiajiadian-tradition area was still home to societies living in networks of stone fortified sites, who shared certain cultural forms with other sites across a broad expanse of the north and northwest, while in the east the Yueshi areas, while showing increased contact with the Erligang-period cultural sphere, was nonetheless distinct. Although in its time, the Erligang-period urban site at Zhengzhou may have stood at the center of the largest and most influential sphere of civilization in contemporary East Asia, the elites at Zhengzhou nevertheless inhabited a complex cultural landscape, with multiple and multidirectional networks of resources, culture, and knowledge." <sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup></dd>

<p>Tertiary center
</p><p>"The structure of the political centers of the Erligang period is different from anything seen before. Although many of them are enclosed by rammed-earth walls, a tradition that was underway during the Neolithic period, their standard rectangular shape and clear internal division suggest a much more formal definition of what such a city should look like (Fig. 7). The walls of two sites are impressive, measuring 17-25 m wide at the base and 9 m tall. The inner walls of Zhengzhou enclosed an area of about 300 ha, but the area inside the recently discovered outer walls was as large as 1,500 ha (Fig. 8). The area inside the walls of Yanshi, which may have been one of the secondary centers of Zhengzhou, is roughly 200 ha. While there has not yet been a systematic survey, settlement around the two sites is reportedly very dense, including relatively large tertiary centers (Liu and Chen 2003, pp. 87-101; Yuan and Zeng 2004)." <sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup>
</p><p>"Differences in site size for the early Shang period can be explained with reference to terms for different kinds of settlements from various Chinese historical texts. It seems that the different settlement tiers identified by archaeologists represent a hierarchical social structure which included large settlements that were regional capitals (du 都), military towns or large sites that served as auxiliary capitals (yi 邑), small cities that functioned as military strongholds, and common settlements. My colleagues and I have identified four sizes or ranks of settlements for the early Shang period as a whole (ranks 1-4, from large to small). My discussion below focuses on interpreting the functions of each type of site for the entire early Shang period.
</p><p>The very large or rank 1 sites such as Zhengzhou, Xiaoshuangqiao, and Huanbei should be interpreted as capitals (see Table 16.1). Each of these sites is several hundred hectares in size, and each has a walled palace zone. [...] Rank 2 settlements are large sites that served as auxiliary capitals or important military stations. Most of these sites have a surrounding wall of rammed earth. The site of Yanshi, for example, is rectangular and covers an area of 190ha. [...] Rank 3 sites are relatively small cities that served as military fortresses. These settlements are considered cities because they are walled. Generally they are located at important transportation junctions in the peripheral region of the early Shang dynasty.
Panlongcheng 盘龙城 is located about 5km from Wuhan city, Hubei province. Since it has a walled palace zone, it also probably once had a wall surrounding the settlement as well. Therefore, many scholars regard it as a city. The walled zone is approximately rectangular in plan, encompassing an area of 75 ha. [...] Commoners lived in the smallest (rank 4) settlements about 10-30 ha in size. They must have had close relations with larger, neighboring sites. For instance, Mengzhuang 孟庄 is relatively large and circular in shape, around 30ha in size. The excavations there discovered trash pits, building foundations, pottery kilns, water wells, and burials (Henan Provincial 1999: 241-246)." <sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup>

<dd><b> ♠ Religious literature ♣ inferred present ♥ </b> "A few inscribed oracle bones have been found in the Zhengzhou city site since the early fieldwork there, raising many debates about context and interpretation. Three bone fragments were found with characters. One of them is a cattle bone found in April 1953 within a disturbed layer. Eleven characters were inscribed in three lines as follows (Henan First Team 1957: Plates 4-5). Fang Hui 方辉 provides the Englishtranslation from the Chinese translation by Chang Yuzhi 常玉芝 (2007): 乙丑贞:及孚.七月. Divination on the day of Yi Chou, we can make captures for sacrifices. . . . 贞:又乇土羊 Divination on one day, use sheep to sacrifice to the god of land at the place called Bo. As already mentioned, many sacrificial pits containing human victims, cattle heads and horns, dogs, and other remains were found at the large Xiaoshuangqiao site. The ceramic jars excavated from these sacrificial pits can be classified into two groups on the basis of their size. About 10 jars show traces of more than 20 characters written in cin- nabar. They mostly indicate single words that can be put into three categories: numbers (such as 二 two, 三 three, 七 seven); human-like symbols and pictographs (one from pit H101 has a human-like symbol near the vessel rim with a clear head, body, arms, and legs); and animal-like symbols. It should be pointed out that although these symbols or words were written on pottery vessels with cinnabar, their shape, strokes, structure, and techniques of expression reveal that they are in the family of oracle-bone inscriptions and inscriptions on bronze artifacts. The characters with smooth lines and beautiful structure are dated earlier than inscriptions on bone and bronze. It appears that these types of words represent a stage in the development of ancient Chinese writing. During the early Shang period, it was already quite developed (Song 2003)." <sup id="cite_ref-100" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-100">[100]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b> ♠ Bronze ♣ present ♥ </b> "Many lines of evidence point to a dramatic increase in the sophistication of craft production and the level of specialization during the Erligang period. The technology used to cast bronze vessels —the piece-mold or section-mold technique— was already developed by the Erlitou period, but it reached a much higher level of sophistication during this period. Vessel shapes were now much more varied than before and much more lavishly decorated. The complexity and sheer size of some of these vessels show their casting to have been a real technological achievement. For example, one bronze square ding (fangding 方鼎) dated to the Erligang period is 100 cm tall and weighs 86.4 kg. More bronze was used to cast this single vessel than was used for all of the known Erlitou vessels combined. Another example is three hoards of bronze objects discovered in the outer city of Zhengzhou, containing 28 bronzes with a total weight of over 500 kg (Thorp 2006, pp. 89-91). Mold parts found at the different bronze workshops in Zhengzhou suggest that one, the Nanguanwai (南关外), specialized in the production of ritual vessels (although it also produced tools and weapons), while another, Zijingshan (紫荆山), produced few vessels, if any, and focused instead on weapons and small tools (Fig. 8) (Henan 2001, pp. 307-383). Such workshop specialization, which can be seen in other crafts as well, may have to do not only with the artisans working in each foundry but also with the level of political control over and sponsorship of these workshops." <sup id="cite_ref-111" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-111">[111]</a></sup></dd>

The interpretation of an arsenal was made because the structure of the building was similar to that of an arsenal at Luoyang dating to the Han period (206 BC to AD 220) and Wei period (AD 220-534). In addition, it appears that the city walls of Yanshi were deliberately shaped with a military function in mind. The city walls are not straight as seen in most other early cities.

<p>Not much evidence for wars, but possibly military conquest:
</p><p>"Southern finds are not alone in suggesting that the Erligang culture was widespread. Although no city site comparable to Panlongcheng has been excavated elsewhere, typical Erligang bronzes have been found throughout a large part of North and Central China. Since the bronzes are indistinguishable from Zhengzhou counterparts no matter where they are found, they argue that the dispersion of the Erligang civilization was not a gradual process but a sharply defined event. It seems difficult to imagine any mechanism other than conquest that could spread a uniform inventory of bronze artifacts and a complex technology in a short space of time over so large an area, and the evidence of archaeology is thus that the Erligang period saw not only the formation of a civilization but also a sudden territorial expansion. The expansion seems, however, to have been short-lived. After the Erligang period bronzes no longer exhibit any widespread stylistic uniformity; nothing comparable is seen again in the archaeological record before the Zhou period. The next few centuries instead witnessed the rise of local bronze-using cultures, and presumably of local powers, in regions which before the arrival of the Erligang civilization probably had no knowledge of metallurgy (and metallurgy may be only the visible part of a larger debt). The most impressive and at the moment best-known regional bronze culture of the time immediately following the Erligang period was centered in northern Jiangxi, some 300km south of Panlongcheng, at modern Wucheng and Xin'gan on the Gan River. Here, just beyond the reach of the Erligang expansion, we find a local culture pushed over the threshold of civilization by contact with the culture of the north." <sup id="cite_ref-194" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-194">[194]</a></sup>

Second, the large, inner walled area at the Shang city of Zhengzhou that was contemporaneous with, or a little earlier than, the city of Yanshi is 300ha in size, while Yanshi is only 81ha in size. The unusually small size suggests that Yanshi had a special function. Third, as mentioned above, the concave and convex sections of the city walls seem to represent a conscious design for defense. The remains of a large arsenal or storage area for weapons also indicate the military function of the site." <sup id="cite_ref-195" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-195">[195]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<p>A collective ritual is a ritual in which two or more people participate. With the official cult we refer to the set of collective ritual practices that are most closely associated with legitimation of the power structure (including elites, if any).

</p><p><b>♠ Expert ♣ Katrinka Reinhart ♥</b> KR has suggested using more relevant data for this section. Currently, there is no difference between Erligang rituals and Late Shang ones. KR recommends having a look at Art and archaeology of the Erligang civilization, edited by Kyle Steinke with Dora C.Y. Ching. Unfortunately, this book is currently accessible for EC.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ elite feast ♥</b> "In many of the ritual contexts at Erligang sites, the linkage between two or more procedures in the ritual triad (divination, sacrifice, and feasting) is expressed. This joining occurs in different domains—graveside, temple, building construction sites, and within and around houses, as this study will demonstrate. As mentioned above, historical sources speak of events such as the cooking of sacrificial offerings and divining about presenting chopped up sacrificial victims at a feast. At the Erligang primary center of Zhengzhou, human bodies exhibiting signs of violence were buried along with animal bones and pottery. This included cooking pots (li tripod and ding vessel) and animal bones found inside a large pottery urn bearing signs of burning (Cao, 2009, p. 43). At Yanshi, as will be discussed in the following sections, there are examples in which remains of ritually killed humans were found in close proximity to remnants of feasting, such as at the palace ritual site and in the potters’ neighborhood. In some archaeological examples, the ritual triad is visible as a material set. Excavations at Zhengzhou, on Longhaima Street, for example, revealed pits containing human remains and human skulls associated with pottery and oracle bones (Henan Province Museum, 1973, p. 80, Plate 1). [...] The patron-role and diacritical types of feast may be appropriate models for certain types of elite feasting in the north China region during the Bronze Age. Underhill (2002) has argued that bronze food vessels and the foods contained within them functioned as gifts to supporters and ancestors; gifting political supporters helped instill loyalty and obligation and gifting ancestors helped ensure prosperity. Diacritical feasting also seems an especially appropriate model with its differentiation of ‘‘insider” and ‘‘outsider” roles and elaborate/expensive cuisine and related material culture. I have already noted that (1) insiders (palace elites) and outsiders (outer city residents) were spatially segregated at Yanshi, (2) later Bronze Age transmitted texts portray lavish elite banquets, and (3) bronze vessels have been found primarily in elite contexts. Exclusionary feasting involving distinction of elite food practices may have occurred in the inner space of the Yanshi palace (see also Bourdieu, 1984 on distinction and cuisine)."<sup id="cite_ref-196" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-196">[196]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ elite feast ♥</b> "In many of the ritual contexts at Erligang sites, the linkage between two or more procedures in the ritual triad (divination, sacrifice, and feasting) is expressed. This joining occurs in different domains—graveside, temple, building construction sites, and within and around houses, as this study will demonstrate. As mentioned above, historical sources speak of events such as the cooking of sacrificial offerings and divining about presenting chopped up sacrificial victims at a feast. At the Erligang primary center of Zhengzhou, human bodies exhibiting signs of violence were buried along with animal bones and pottery. This included cooking pots (li tripod and ding vessel) and animal bones found inside a large pottery urn bearing signs of burning (Cao, 2009, p. 43). At Yanshi, as will be discussed in the following sections, there are examples in which remains of ritually killed humans were found in close proximity to remnants of feasting, such as at the palace ritual site and in the potters’ neighborhood. In some archaeological examples, the ritual triad is visible as a material set. Excavations at Zhengzhou, on Longhaima Street, for example, revealed pits containing human remains and human skulls associated with pottery and oracle bones (Henan Province Museum, 1973, p. 80, Plate 1). [...] The patron-role and diacritical types of feast may be appropriate models for certain types of elite feasting in the north China region during the Bronze Age. Underhill (2002) has argued that bronze food vessels and the foods contained within them functioned as gifts to supporters and ancestors; gifting political supporters helped instill loyalty and obligation and gifting ancestors helped ensure prosperity. Diacritical feasting also seems an especially appropriate model with its differentiation of ‘‘insider” and ‘‘outsider” roles and elaborate/expensive cuisine and related material culture. I have already noted that (1) insiders (palace elites) and outsiders (outer city residents) were spatially segregated at Yanshi, (2) later Bronze Age transmitted texts portray lavish elite banquets, and (3) bronze vessels have been found primarily in elite contexts. Exclusionary feasting involving distinction of elite food practices may have occurred in the inner space of the Yanshi palace (see also Bourdieu, 1984 on distinction and cuisine)."<sup id="cite_ref-244" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-244">[244]</a></sup></dd>

These observations fit with the test expectations for exclusionary feasting as discussed above.
