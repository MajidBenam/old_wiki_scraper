<b> ♠ UTM zone ♣ 48 R ♥ </b> The Hmong inhabited several Chinese provinces: 'The various Miao groups are for the most part an unstratified agricultural people found in the uplands of several provinces of China and related to the Hmong of Southeast Asia. They are distinguished by language, dress, historical traditions, and cultural practice from neighboring ethnic groups and the dominant Han Chinese. They are not culturally homogeneous and the differences between local Miao cultures are often as great as between Miao and non-Miao neighbors. The term "Miao" is Chinese, and means "weeds" or "sprouts." 'The Ch'uan Miao are an ethnic group living on the borders of Szechwan, Kweichow, and Yunnan Provinces, western China.

Miao filled this role in Hunan and eastern Guizhou, but farther west the rulers were often drawn from a hereditary Yi nobility, a system that lasted into the twentieth century. In Guizhou, some tusi claimed Han ancestry, but were probably drawn from the ranks of assimilated Bouyei, Dong, and Miao. Government documents refer to the "Sheng Miao" (raw Miao), meaning those living in areas beyond government control and not paying taxes or labor service to the state. In the sixteenth century, in the more pacified areas, the implementation of the policy of gaitu guiliu began the replacement of native rulers with regular civilian and military officials, a few of whom were drawn from assimilated minority families. Land became a commodity, creating both landlords and some freeholding peasants in the areas affected.

Chinese policies toward the Miao shifted among assimilation, containment in "stockaded villages," dispersal, removal, and extermination. The frequent threat of "Miao rebellion" caused considerable anxiety to the state; in actuality, many of these uprisings included Bouyei, Dong, Hui, and other ethnic groups, including Han settlers and demobilized soldiers. At issue were heavy taxation, rising landlordism, rivalries over local resources, and official corruption. One of the last Miao uprisings occurred in 1905 in western Hunan in opposition to Guomindang (Republican) continuation of the tuntian   system, which forced the peasants to open up new lands and grow crops for the state.'

It is bounded on the north by Szechuan, on the east by Hunan, on the south by Kwangsi, and on the west by Yünnan.

The province slopes from a height of over 6000 feet in the west to less than 2000 feet in the east. Some valleys lie as high as 4000 feet, and mountain summits reach 9000. S. R. Clarke estimated that most of Kweichow is at least 3000 feet above sea level, the altitude constantly decreasing as one goes east. Wei-ning Lake, in the western part of the province is, he says, 7000 feet above sea level. The altitude of Kweiyang, the capital, is given by G. B. Cressey as 3468.56 feet.

Of all the Miao peoples, only the Hmong have migrated out of China.' <sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> The Hmong-Yao languages constitute a branch of the larger Sino-Tibetan language familiy according to the Chinese classification system: 'According to Chinese language classification, the Miao languages belong to the Miao-Yao Branch of Sino-Tibetan. Officially, these languages are termed fangyin  (dialects) although they are not mutually intelligible. There are at least three main languages, further divisible into distinct and separate sublanguages or dialects of varying degrees of closeness. The Miao languages are tonal. Xiangxi, spoken in western Hunan by close to one million speakers, is associated with the Red Miao. It is comprised of two sublanguages. The larger of the two has been taken as standard and given a romanization for school texts and other local publications. The Qiandong language of central and eastern Guizhou is associated with the Black Miao. It has three major subdivisions. The most widespread of the three has well over a million speakers, and is taken as the official standard. The others, with a half million speakers each, are regarded as dialects and, as of this writing, have no official recognition. The Chuanqiandian languages are spoken by White, Flowery, and Blue Miao. There are at least seven major subdivisions, each further divided into a number of local dialects. As of 1994, only Chuanqiandianci (White Miao) and Diandongbei (Hua Miao) are officially recognized. Both of these formerly used a phonetic script, introduced by missionaries at the turn of the century. The script has been supplanted by a government-introduced romanization. In addition there are some eight additional fangyin  , with several thousand speakers each, which do not fit into any of the major categories. Most of the Miao in Hainan are Yao speakers, and some Miao elsewhere speak only Dong or Chinese.' <sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup></dd></dl>

‘The wide dispersion makes it difficult to generalize about ecological settings. Miao settlements are found anywhere from a few hundred meters above sea level to elevations of 1,400 meters or more. The largest number are uplands people, often living at elevations over 1,200 meters and located at some distance from urban centers or the lowlands and river valleys where the Han are concentrated. Often, these upland villages and hamlets are interspersed with those of other minorities such as Yao, Dong, Zhuang, Yi, Hui, and Bouyei.' <sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> 'The Ch'uan Miao are an ethnic group living on the borders of Szechwan, Kweichow, and Yunnan Provinces, western China. The country is very mountainous with numerous peaks rising 3,000 to 6,000 feet above sea level. There are many streams, forests, waterfalls, perpendicular or overhanging cliffs, natural caves and natural bridges, and deepholes or pits where the water disappears into the bowels of the earth. While the roads between the Chinese towns and villages are generally paved with stones, most of the roads are narrow footpaths up and down the steep mountainsides or through fields and forests.' <sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> Some authors claim periodic decreases in population size for the rural Hmong population and report inconsistencies in the self-reporting of settled territory: 'The area of the Sheng Miao according to their exaggerated account, extends to 9,000 li, but actually the area is about 200 /sq./ li in length and width. It is a mountainous area, the highest peak at Teng-k'ung-ming-t'ang being 2,000 meters, and the total population about 10,000. The writer has visited altogether 101 Sheng Miao villages of all sizes, the largest being Chia-lu, Chia-mien, Chia-ya, Chia-lung, Chia-wêng, Cheng-yu, Tang-wêng and Chüeh-ts'ai-p'ing, with about 100 families in each.  Even today they do not have a single market fair within the area and this shows how circumscribed is the sphere of their economic activity. Their only means of livelihood is agriculture. Almost all the fields are terraced according to natural topography, rising from the bottom of the slope to the top in several hundred layers. The shape of the field is long and narrow, producing rice, wheat, corn and barley. [...] Being in direct contact with them, the writer could watch at close quarters their extremely miserable conditions, which are pitiable indeed. Because of their ignorance they do not know how to save or to improve the method of production. In case of famine they cannot escape starvation,  which is the most important reason for the decrease in their population.' <sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup>

Agricultural technologies and practices varied depending on the prevalence of dry swidden versus wet rice cultivation: 'Economic strategies vary. The Hua Miao were shifting-swidden agriculturalists, growing buckwheat, oats, corn, potatoes, and hemp, and using a simple wooden hand plow or hoe. Sheep and goats were fed on nearby pasture land. Additionally the Hua Miao hunted with crossbow and poisoned arrows and gathered foodstuffs in the forests. In parts of Guizhou, the Miao more closely resembled their Han neighbors in their economic strategies as well as in their technology (the bullock-drawn plow, harrowing, use of animal and human wastes as fertilizer). The Cowrie Shell Miao in central Guizhou were settled farmers growing rice in flooded fields, and also raising millet, wheat, beans, vegetables, and tobacco. Their livestock was limited to barnyard pigs and poultry, with hunting and gathering playing a very minor role. Some of the Black Miao in southeast Guizhou combine intensive irrigated terrace farming of rice with dry-field upland cropping.' <sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup> Many Hmong groups practice wet rice terrace irrigation and used the horse-driven wooden water-wheel.

Only some villages benefited from pipe construction schemes by missionaries, and this process did not start until the late 19th and early 20th centuries: 'The mountain community of Shimenkan (Stone Gateway) in northwestern Guizhou served as the headquarters of church activity. In addition to its own large primary school, it offered secondary schooling and teacher training. At least thirty Hua Miao continued on and graduated from university in the decades before 1949. Some of these became ordained Methodist ministers or doctors and one became a well-regarded anthropologist (Yang Hanxian). Generally the local chapels were served by lay preachers who were trained at Shimenkan. Other young people received training as nurses and agricultural extension workers. At various points in time, agricultural and industrial extension programs were held at Shimenkan. New strains of potatoes were introduced, fruit orchards were planted on the hillsides of many villages, vegetable gardens were encouraged, and a number of Miao learned the techniques of carpentry, brickmaking, and masonry. More efficient looms were designed for home production of cloth. During the prerevolutionary decades, some villages benefited from collective endeavors to build bridges and roads, and pipe systems that brought water into the community. Teams of medical workers, from Shimenkan or from the churchaffiliated hospitals in nearby Zhaotong City, traveled around the area periodically. Even those who were not interested in becoming church members participated in the economic innovations, accepted treatment from the medical workers, and sent their children to the schools.' <sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup> Accordingly, we have assumed that most Hmong communities did not rely on drinking water supply systems, especially not before the Republican period.</dd>

In any case, it was an insult. ('Hmong,' the name they prefer themselves, is usually said to mean 'free men,' but some scholars say that, like 'Inuit,' 'Dine,' and many other tribal names the world over, it simply means 'the people.')"<strong class="error mw-ext-cite-error">Cite error: Closing <code>&lt;/ref&gt;</code> missing for <code>&lt;ref&gt;</code> tag</strong> While much of the scholarship we rely on uses this term, out of respect, we use the name “Hmong” instead of "Miao", except for source titles and direct quotations
Sutton provides a general introduction to the Qing-period Hmong rebellions: '“Middle ground” is a valuable framework for the study of China’s frontiers, but in the case of western Hunan it needs to be carefully situated to allow for differences in time as well as space. In the changing internal frontier of western Hunan, the main flow of cultural influence can go in either direction; political authorities can be interventionist or passive; and Han population can trickle into or flood local society. Thus the middle ground in this region can be imagined dynamically, taking two different forms roughly corresponding to the contrasting political conditions of successive centuries: the seventeenth-century interdynastic period of low population, moderate in-migration, and indirect state control via hereditary tusi Ւ׹ chieftains, a period that added numerous Han settlers as individuals or communities - transfrontiersmen who tended to adopt local (Miao) cultural patterns and whose children might become Miao; and the eighteenth-century high Qing, a time of rapid Han Chinese in-migration and the intrusion of the state as the three new subprefectures were established, and a time of Han dominance, Miao acculturation, and Miao land-loss. By the nineteenth century, when Qing rule was maintained by reliance on Miao police and former tusi populations, the region no longer displayed the fluid cross-cultural movements characteristic of the “middle ground”; but this awaits investigation. From this point of view there are two turning points in western Hunan: first, the Qing replacement of tusi, the hereditary, imperially ratified local chieftains long based to the north at Baojing অ壃 and Yongshun ةႉʿ an administrative incorporation (gaitu guiliu ޏՒូఎ) that seismically shifted the gradient of the “middle ground” in favor of Han Chinese economic power and cultural influence; and second: the revolt of 1795, the last large-scale disturbance in this region, which, when suppressed, brought on political stability, Miao subjection, and the end of a free-wheeling internal periphery. I regard the two turning points as closely connected: the imposition of direct rule created the conditions for the grievances that prompted the revolt.' <sup id="cite_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-62">[62]</a></sup> 'The endemic cultural elements relevant to the uprising can be specified briefly. 1. Affinal connections were strongly emphasized with the help of frequent cross-cousin marriage and the levirate.11 2. After many decades of direct Qing rule, a loose structure of appointed hamlet (zhai ን) heads and baihu ۍ֪ʳ(“hundred-family heads”) had given some definition to what had been an acephalous
local society almost untouched by tusi authority centered far to the north. 3. Ecstatic possession was a key means of spiritual contact, and shamans played an important role as ritual leaders at the hamlet level. 4. There was a tradition of a Miao king appearing in times of collective trouble. 5. Organized feuds were an established custom, with a sequence of dispute, violence and negotiated recompense. In such feuds bloodoaths to the local gods, the White Emperor Heavenly Kings, preceded participation in violent raids, and kuanhui ཱིᄎ, a sort of intermittent, multi-hamlet association, helped to resolve them. The revolt’s loose structure and direction reflected these regional cultural practices and beliefs.12 In form it produced no novel organization, as the Taipings would fifty years later, and in spirit it was not a revolutionary attack on local society, at least on its Miao aspects, but a sharpening of its basic cultural and institutional features against the threat of outsiders, or those perceived as outsiders.' <sup id="cite_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-63">[63]</a></sup>

The possessed shakers (see below) of the Guizhou border region chose to gather in Liudeng’s house, and soon announced that a Miao king would appear in Sanbao’s hamlet. Wu Bayue of Qianzhou was said to be the richest of the Miao in the region through rents yielding an annual revenue of 400 tiao of unhulled grain, and was one of a handful of Miao who could read and write, along with his sons, whom he had taught. Wu Longdeng of Fenghuang was a deputy baihu, the subofficial baihu being the highest rank that a Miao could aspire to. Troop recruitment and leadership militarized existing ties, and blood oaths reinforced and extended the web of connection to many others. Drawing on their own habitual authority within Miao society, all four recruited troops from their respective zhai, and then led them out, initially at least, on a particular front. “Each road’s Miao had its own head, each zhai’s Miao also had its head,” said Shi Sanbao.17 Wu Bayue led the many hamlets in his region of Pinglong.

<p><b>♠ Inter-polity wars ♣ absent ♥</b> No evidence of this
</p><p><b>♠ Internal wars ♣ present ♥</b> The Hmong engaged in several anti-Chinese rebellions: 'During the Qing Dynasty the Miao fought three wars against the empire.[11] In 1735 in the southeastern province of Guizhou, the Miao rose up against the government's forced assimilation. Eight counties involving 1,224 villages fought until 1738 when the revolt ended. According to Xiangtan University Professor Wu half the Miao population were affected by the war.'<sup id="cite_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-92">[92]</a></sup> 'During the Qing, uprisings and military encounters escalated. There were major disturbances in western Hunan (1795-1806) and a continuous series of rebellions in Guizhou (1854-1872). Chinese policies toward the Miao shifted among assimilation, containment in "stockaded villages," dispersal, removal, and extermination. The frequent threat of " Miao rebellion" caused considerable anxiety to the state; in actuality, many of these uprisings included Bouyei, Dong, Hui, and other ethnic groups, including Han settlers and demobilized soldiers. At issue were heavy taxation, rising landlordism, rivalries over local resources, and official corruption.' <sup id="cite_ref-93" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-93">[93]</a></sup> 'During the Ts'ung Cheng reign period /1628/ /the end of the Ming dynasty/, the Miao rebelled, demolishing the guard stations and leveling the border wall. The “Great Wall” to blockade Miao country disappeared. The 7,800 guard troops /shou ping/ in the Miao area of the Ming dynasty were reduced to 1,600 men at the beginning of the Ch'ing dynasty. When the rebellion of Wu San-kwei was pacified and all was peaceful again, there was another reduction of 500 men, leaving 1,100 men. Military strengh was slight and the defense system was relaxed. Further, following the change from native headmen to Chinese officials, and the use of Chinese as the head of every hundred families, intercourse between the Chinese and the Miao was no longer prohibited. In the twenty-ninth year of Ch'ien Lung /i.e. 1764/, in view of the Miao having undergone acculturation for a long time, they were allowed to intermarry with the Chinese. The original idea was to change the Miao by teaching, but with the passing of time evils developed, when rapacious Chinese under the pretext of trade entered the Miao area and seduced crafty Miao to enter into thievery. Unlike soldiers they entered Miao country for personal reasons and mistreated the Miao. The Miao made a pretext of these guest men's exploitations and encroachments on their land and banded together to make trouble, and brought about the great rebellion during the Ch'ien Lung /1736-95/ and Chia Ch'ing /1796-1820/ reign periods. After the rebellion was put down, the Manchu court realized that the time was yet inopportune to change the Miao by teaching, and the blockade policy was once more used. The various hsiens along the Miao border were heavily garrisoned for protection.' <sup id="cite_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-94">[94]</a></sup> Sutton provides a general introduction to the ethnic aspects of the conflict and its historical background: '“Middle ground” is a valuable framework for the study of China’s frontiers, but in the case of western Hunan it needs to be carefully situated to allow for differences in time as well as space. In the changing internal frontier of western Hunan, the main flow of cultural influence can go in either direction; political authorities can be interventionist or passive; and Han population can trickle into or flood local society. Thus the middle ground in this region can be imagined dynamically, taking two different forms roughly corresponding to the contrasting political conditions of successive centuries: the seventeenth-century interdynastic period of low population, moderate in-migration, and indirect state control via hereditary tusi Ւ׹ chieftains, a period that added numerous Han settlers as individuals or communities - transfrontiersmen who tended to adopt local (Miao) cultural patterns and whose children might become Miao; and the eighteenth-century high Qing, a time of rapid Han Chinese in-migration and the intrusion of the state as the three new subprefectures were established, and a time of Han dominance, Miao acculturation, and Miao land-loss. By the nineteenth century, when Qing rule was maintained by reliance on Miao police and former tusi populations, the region no longer displayed the fluid cross-cultural movements characteristic of the “middle ground”; but this awaits investigation. From this point of view there are two turning points in western Hunan: first, the Qing replacement of tusi, the hereditary, imperially ratified local chieftains long based to the north at Baojing অ壃 and Yongshun ةႉʿ an administrative incorporation (gaitu guiliu ޏՒូఎ) that seismically shifted the gradient of the “middle ground” in favor of Han Chinese economic power and cultural influence; and second: the revolt of 1795, the last large-scale disturbance in this region, which, when suppressed, brought on political stability, Miao subjection, and the end of a free-wheeling internal periphery. I regard the two turning points as closely connected: the imposition of direct rule created the conditions for the grievances that prompted the revolt.' <sup id="cite_ref-95" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-95">[95]</a></sup> 'In its short duration (though mopping up persisted until 1807) and narrow range (a few hundred square miles), this Miao revolt differs from the rebellion that devastated Guizhou for twenty years starting in the 1860s, which has been studied by Robert Jenks. Jenks convincingly sees this later revolt as multi-ethnic, and places “Miao” in quotation marks.13 Unlike the Guizhou rebellion, this uprising was not spurred by a subsistence crisis or galvanized by anger at the official and illegal exactions of local government. Its religious elements, though not entirely different from the Guizhou rebellion, were distinctive to the eastern Miao of the Hunan-Guizhou borderlands. It was dominated by a small core group of leaders and was never broadly cross-ethnic in participation. But these matters deserve close examination.' ref&gt;SUTTON, D. S.. (2003).

Qing forces gradually moved through the mountains, destroying whole hamlets along the way and methodically securing supply lines and establishing encampments on the slopes and heights.

</p><p><b>♠ Wars on steppe frontier ♣ absent ♥</b> Hmong subsisted on horticulture and agriculture, not pastoralism
</p><p><b>♠ Wars on agricultural frontier ♣ absent ♥</b> Qing and Hmong groups were agriculturalists. Conflict over arable land between Hmong and Han Chinese was indeed a major factor in the rebellion: 'There were other pressures as well. Population throughout the region had increased rapidly, as in much of late-eighteenth-century China. Besides Han in-migration, there was natural demographic increase among the Hmong. “What had once been a single household with several male members might have grown into several households and several tens of males; what had been one hamlet might have divided into several, and then several tens of hamlets.” 6 When Fenghuang and Qianzhou had been established in 1704, 313 hamlets were counted and brought under control. By the end of the century there were estimated to be about 4,000 Miao hamlets in the three subprefectures (see map, above) with a further 1,070 in Songtao.7 The increase had been made possible by the conversion of forest land to agriculture; by good harvests, as elsewhere in central China in the late-eighteenth century; and by the improvement of Miao agricultural techniques, though not to the Han Chinese level. The result was a kind of demographic crisis with land in increasingly short supply. It was not exactly a subsistence crisis - the harvest of 1794 was a good one, enough in the following spring for rebel hamlets to send out their braves fully supplied - but rather a question of declining standards and open envy of Han prosperity in the valleys their Miao grandparents had tilled.8 Two easily overlooked repercussions of demographic pressure were, ecologically, the diminution of fauna that the frontier people had long hunted with muskets and spears; and, socially, the frustration of the Miao practice of newly-marrieds setting up a separate household,9 which especially affected young unmarried males who would be the main fighters in the Miao forces.' <sup id="cite_ref-113" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-113">[113]</a></sup>

One was a tobacco-leaf trader acquaintance of Shi Liudeng who “joined up”at his request and who burned and robbed some thirty zhai, and the other a tile roofer who had been approached by two men, one a relative of his Miao wife: “Shi Liudeng invited [me] to burn and rob some cunzhai, and would I like to join the gang?”90 There is no hint of a wider purpose here. A certain Long Duma ᚊᗑᏖ added that there were “quite a few” Hanjian in Liudeng’s force, and nineteen Han appear in a list of sixty-nine captives.91 These Han, none of them serving as troop leaders, constituted a small fraction of the thousands of rebels he recruited. Even for Liudeng’s force, the assertion that “a sizable number of Chinese settlers had taken up with the rebels” seems overdrawn.' <sup id="cite_ref-122" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-122">[122]</a></sup> Sutton mentions pillaging: 'The crisis of early 1795 upended the social system created by this differentiation. The soldiers were too few and scattered to withstand the Miao, who took control of the roads, and in some places (particularly in Qianzhou) the “guests” fled their homes. Thus turen, as people in the middle, played a crucial role in the revolt. Left to fend for themselves, the temptation might have been to ally with the Miao rebels and pillage the roadside valley lands, but - whether out of caution (they were more familiar than the Miao were with the nature of imperial power) or on account of hostile feelings against their Miao neighbors - they organized defensive forces of varying size and waited uneasily to see what would happen. Governor-general Bi Yuan ฅީ (1739-1797) and governor Jiang Sheng deliberately courted the turen. Their winning over of Zhang Tingzhong of Yongshun, which the Hunan literatus Yan Ruyi ᣤڕᅄ (1759-1826) said saved Chenzhou and Yongshun from the Miao,113 was their greatest success. In general, the diverse peoples called the turen effectively exploited their position as people in the middle, siding with Qing in 1795, though not without dithering and mistrust. Qing reliance on the relatively more acculturated groups in 1795 presaged the P.R.C. policy in the autonomous region. Eventually the turen would grow by external augmentation and natural increase and see themselves as a single group. The (Mandarin-speaking) Tujia of the P. R. C. now predominate in population and political power in the ten-county West Hunan Tujia and Miao Autonomous Region.' <sup id="cite_ref-123" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-123">[123]</a></sup>

When the rebellion of Wu San-kwei was pacified and all was peaceful again, there was another reduction of 500 men, leaving 1,100 men. Military strengh was slight and the defense system was relaxed. Further, following the change from native headmen to Chinese officials, and the use of Chinese as the head of every hundred families, intercourse between the Chinese and the Miao was no longer prohibited. In the twenty-ninth year of Ch'ien Lung /i.e. 1764/, in view of the Miao having undergone acculturation for a long time, they were allowed to intermarry with the Chinese. The original idea was to change the Miao by teaching, but with the passing of time evils developed, when rapacious Chinese under the pretext of trade entered the Miao area and seduced crafty Miao to enter into thievery. Unlike soldiers they entered Miao country for personal reasons and mistreated the Miao. The Miao made a pretext of these guest men's exploitations and encroachments on their land and banded together to make trouble, and brought about the great rebellion during the Ch'ien Lung /1736-95/ and Chia Ch'ing /1796-1820/ reign periods.

The continuing suppression, vigorously conducted from hamlet to hamlet by Fu Nai ແⷘʳof Fenghuang to accomplish the late Qianlong emperor’s draconian cleansing policy, permanently removed charismatic Miao leadership, wiped out many communities, and replaced the parallel (if unequal) Miao and Han Chinese social hierarchies with a class system where the great majority of Miao were poor peasants under the dominance of turen (from the mid-twentieth century, “Tujia”) and allied to external Han Chinese authority. On the other hand, closer political integration with the empire introduced an (albeit rickety) ladder of success as a new Miao militia force took over local constabulary duties, and assimilated Miao men were given new educational opportunities. Self-consciousness tends to increase in contact conditions whether in unequal competition between groups or in violent confrontation, and it is likely that neither the suppression nor the renewed trend toward acculturation altered the sense of Miao consciousness that had intensified in the decades since incorporation and the subsequent wave of Han in-migration, and had found expression in the revolt of 1795-1797. On present evidence, it seems reasonable to describe that revolt as a key phase in Miao ethnogenesis. The modern Miao nationality had emerged at least in part of the southwest, with the conversion of the Chinese term “Miao” into something felt and acted upon as well as recognized by others. But we should repeat that local Miao consciousness took only the Eastern Miao as its significant political community. This ethno-regionalism, recognizing no broad Miao /Hmong community, did not change until later, in the twentieth century. Thus the local clans in western Hunan would not make common cause with the “Miao” risings, correctly labeled multi-ethnic, which spread over much of the neighboring province of Guizhou in the decade beginning in 1864.' <sup id="cite_ref-153" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-153">[153]</a></sup> We are unsure whether this meets our own criteria for 'ethnocide' in the sense of a systematic attempt to displace a subjected culture with that of the victor. We have coded 'present' for the time being, but this is open to review and in need of further confirmation.

</p><p>NB: The Hmong are not coded for in the Ritual Database <sup id="cite_ref-154" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-154">[154]</a></sup>. The below rituals were derived from Chinese-period ethnography and are thus largely based on inference. Furthermore, there was considerable variability among the different Hmong groups when it comes to ritual practice. The codes are accordingly open to review; consistency in particular is a concern on this data sheet as rituals practiced by one Hmong group may be celebrated differently among others. Expert feedback is needed on the matter.
</p><p>NBB: 'The Chinese called the Hmong the Miao or Meo, which means, depending on which linguistic historian you read, 'barbarians', 'bumpkins', 'people who sound like cats', or 'wild uncultivated grasses'. In any case, it was an insult. ('Hmong', the name they prefer themselves, is usually said to mean 'free men', but some scholars say that, like 'Inuit', 'Dine', and many other tribal names the world over, it simply means 'the people').' <sup id="cite_ref-155" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-155">[155]</a></sup>
</p><p>The following general description was extracted from eHRAF: 'Religious beliefs and activities vary by locale and subethnic identity. The situation is further complicated by partial adoption of elements of folk Daoism and Buddhism, or by conversion to Christianity (as among segments of the White and Flowery Miao). Traditional religious beliefs concern powerful suprahuman forces associated with sacred groves, stones, caves, and other natural phenomena, as well as with bridges and wells. Other protective spirits guard the household and hamlet. The latter are sometimes thought of as dragons. It is believed that at death, the soul divides into three parts, one of which returns to protect the household as an ancestral spirit. There is also concern with evil spirits and with ghosts of those who died bad deaths and who may cause illness and misfortune. Religious beliefs are supported by a complex series of sung or chanted poetic myths, which treat the creation of the universe, the doings of divine beings and culture heroes, and early Miao history.' <sup id="cite_ref-156" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-156">[156]</a></sup> 'Most religious ritual is performed or guided by various part-time specialists who act as priests, diviners, or shamans for the local community or for kin groups. Most of them are males. They engage in ordinary work, and only the most important religious activities require them to don special items of dress and decoration to mark them from others. There are no written texts for learning the chants, songs, dances, and rituals: they are memorized. If called by a family, specialists receive a small payment (often in foodstuffs) for their assistance. Shamans play a key role at funerals and postburial rites. They are also involved in analysis and healing of illness: some are skilled in herbal medicine as well as ritual procedures. Shamans also provide explanations of the possible causes of misfortune and can provide protective amulets. Ceremonies on behalf of the village community or a gathering of kin from several villages are conducted by skilled male elders who function as priests, following ritual procedures, administering the necessary animal and food sacrifices, and chanting the songs and myths without going into trance or communicating directly with the supernaturals and spirits. Some ceremonies are led by the male head of household on behalf of his immediate family.' <sup id="cite_ref-157" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-157">[157]</a></sup> 'The calendrical year holds a number of set ceremonies that vary from group to group in content, purpose, and timing. For example, as of the 1990s some groups celebrated the lunar New Year along with their Han neighbors, whereas others celebrated the year's start in the tenth lunar month, following the harvest, and marked it with bullfights and cattle sacrifices. Others marked the New Year with cockfights or sacrifice of pigs and chickens, or intervillage assemblages enlivened by antiphonal singing, dancing, and the playing of the lusheng  . Among the important festivals found in many (not all) Miao communities are the Dragon Boat Festival, which is synchronic with the Han festivities to a large extent, and the Mountain Flower festivals, which were an important institution for bringing together marriageable young people from different hamlets. The Drum Society festivals are held by dispersed kin groups to honor their ancestors every seven, ten, or twelve years, and are not strictly tied to the calendar. Most festivals involve the lavish offering of animal sacrifices, and for this reason the state has discouraged them.' <sup id="cite_ref-158" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-158">[158]</a></sup>
</p><p>The Hmong were criticized by the Qing Emperor Jiaqing for their cattle sacrifices.<sup id="cite_ref-159" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-159">[159]</a></sup> 'On the eighth day of their fourth lunar month (around mid-May), the Miao celebrate a festival during which they offer sacrifices to their ancestors and cultural heroes. This festival commemorates the day in which the heroes Ya Yi and Ya Nu died in battle while preventing a cruel ruler from his cruel custom of annually forcing the Miao to choose one of their beautiful young women to be his concubine. At the festival, they sing, play reed pipes (lusheng in Chinese) and bonze drums, and dance to honor their ancestors, ensure a good harvest and drive away evil spirits. On special occasions such as this, the Miao women wear large quantities of silver necklaces, bracelets and headdresses which jingle when they dance. This silver jewelry is handed down as a family heirloom.'<sup id="cite_ref-160" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-160">[160]</a></sup>
</p><p>Graham is the only source reviewed so far that describes initiation ceremonies <sup id="cite_ref-161" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-161">[161]</a></sup>. We have therefore chosen to exclude initiation rituals.
</p><p>The ethnography provides on overview of the festival cycle of some Hmong groups:
</p><p>'Festivals were abundant and differed widely by region, although the New Year was commonly of central importance. Everywhere the Miao lusheng or bamboo reed pipe organ was a key musical instrument along with drums, different horns and flutes, a kind of jew's harp, and a long tubular instrument called the mantong. Blowing through leaves also was widespread. Multiple genres of song were accompanied by numerous conventions for their social usages. Other activities at festivals included processional dancing, bullfights, horse races, cock and other bird fights, mountain climbing, ball tossing, and dragon boat races.' <sup id="cite_ref-162" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-162">[162]</a></sup> 'Although the calendar used by the Miao -I is identical to that of the Chinese and likewise the year is divided into twelve months, the festivals observed are somewhat different in importance. The Hua Miao, the Ch 'ing Miao and the Chung-chia, for instance, regard the sixth day of the sixth month as the greatest festival. The following is a month by month account of the festivals of the Miao -I at An-shun during the year.' <sup id="cite_ref-163" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-163">[163]</a></sup> 'The First Month. The first day of the first month is the beginning of the year. The Miao -I in this district would stick up paper money on the door of the house, which is also decorated with red peppers strung together with scented rice straw. Some of the Chung-chia people imitate the Chinese by asking calligraphers to pen symmetrical New Year verses for the door, [Page 99] 180 cont. and then hang out knots of scented rice straw, but no red peppers. These decorations are in expectation of a prosperous year.' <sup id="cite_ref-164" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-164">[164]</a></sup> 'After having celebrated “The Big Year” on the thirtieth day of the twelfth month and having decorated the door on the New Year's day, the Hua Miao and the Ch'ing Miao would remain at home to rest without doing any work. The food for the New Year was prepared in advance on a lucky day (dragon and dog days are lucky), and it is not cooked again until another lucky day comes around.181 So on New Year's day there is no kitchen drudgery as only pre-cooked meals are eaten. The New Year's day being the first of the year, everything has to be auspicious and inhibitions are many. For instance, 1) no sewing is done by women at home; 2) nothing is taken into the house from outside; 3) no water is carried; 4) no knife is used; 5) no one is allowed to go barefooted and shoes must be worn; 6) no cursing is allowed; 7) no rapping on the wall is allowed; 8) the floor must not be swept; 9) no collection of debt is permitted. Besides, there are the proverbial “three days of liberty” when parents would allow their sons and daughters unrestrained freedom in the pursuit of recreation and happiness on the first, second and third days of the year. After this period the children once more submit themselves to parental restraint. On the first day of the year the old and young are clothed in new garments and have fun all day long. Only the Hsiung and Yang families among the Ch'ing Miao have the custom of worshipping ancestors in the evening. At the time of the sacrifice, the head of the family would spread a straw mat on the floor of the middle room or the side room and place on it incense and candles as well as three bowls of rice. In each bowl is pitched a piece of pork on a bamboo stick with three straw knots to represent the ancestors. In addition there are three bowls of beancurd and three pieces of tz'u-pa /glutinous rice balls/. They call out aloud to ask their ancestors to pass the New Year with them. Then the male members of the family begin to kowtow in the order of their age. After the paper money is completely burned, they gather up the things on the straw mat. The rice straw and the bamboo [Page 100] 181 cont. sticks are thrown into the temple of the Earth God outside the village.' <sup id="cite_ref-165" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-165">[165]</a></sup> 'The New Year activities of the Chung-chia are slightly different from those of the Hua Miao and Ch'ing- Miao. On the first day of the year they also wear new clothes and decorate their doorway. At about seven o'clock in the morning they make sacrifices to their ancestors in the hall with several bowls of rice and meat while incense and candles are burned and fire-crackers are set off. The whole family, old and young, male and female, all participate in the ceremony as they perform the ritual of “three kneelings and nine kowtows.” After the sacrifice, the family settles down to a New Year feast in the hall, after which they stop working and laugh and joke all day. Their restrictions are similar to those of the Hua Miao and Ch'ing Miao. But the Chung-chia have a peculiar superstition that if on the first day of the year a dog should bark after cockcrow, there would surely be a robbery in the village; and if the crow caws first, there would surely be many sicknesses among them during the year; on the other hand, if another animal should make a noise before the dog and the crow, then there would be a very lucky year ahead. All these superstitious notions are firmly believed in by the Chung-Chia, and for this reason early in the morning of the New Year's day all the families would cock their ears to listen to the bird or animal that first makes noise. On the second day of the New Year, the Hua Miao and the Ch'ing Miao would gather their family members after breakfast and with spades on their shoulders and wearing straw hats they would march off to their farms to do a little ploughing and digging, the idea being that this first “earth-removing” inaugurates a year's agricultural activities. With the Chung-chia, there is no definite day for the beginning of farm work, but it is generally around the tenth day of the first month. During the first three days of the year the Hua Miao, the Ch'ing Miao and the chung-chia would all stay home without going out for fear of meeting with unlucky events. On the fourth day the villages become astir with New Year visits between [Page 101] 182 cont. friends and relatives, and the younger generations pay respects to their elders (The New Year gifts for the children vary from ten to twenty cents.) When they exchange visits and greetings they bring with them a couple of home-made tz'u pa (each about 1 sheng of rice), candies and refreshments as gifts. The host and hostesses must entertain the visitors with tea and wine. The tenant farmers also present similar New Year gifts to their landlords, who in return would give them pieces of cloth or other household articles. As a rule such New Year greetings do not extend beyond the twelfth day though intimate relatives may offer theirs until the fifteenth. If a relative who has kept up these New Year visits throughout the past years fails to turn up, the family will be greatly offended. The Miao -I take the New Year greetings very seriously, and hence they should not be neglected.' <sup id="cite_ref-166" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-166">[166]</a></sup> 'The Hua Miao and the Ch'ing Miao in the hsien district have a custom of flower dance. There is a fixed location for the dancing ground, called the “flower bed.” The dates for flower dances are set according to schedules in various places, and are generally between the fourth and the fifteenth day of the first month. On this occasion visitors gather like clouds in great jubilation, and it is indeed the most important festival of the Hua Miao and the Ch'ing Miao throughout the year. The fifteenth day of the first month is the “Small New Year” with the Hua Miao and the Ch'ing Miao. That evening they put in front of the doorway a small table, on which are placed as sacrificial offerings a bowl of rice, a piece of meat and a cup of rice wine. Burning incense and lighting candles, they would kneel down and pray: “We pray to the Buddha tonight to guide us this year smoothly to wealth and prosperity.” After the prayer, the old and young, except the womenfolk, worship in turn. Then they sit down together for a feast in the hall. After dinner they have fun for the rest of the evening. The Chung-chia celebrate the “Small New Year” on the thirtieth day of the first month. Besides other delicacies at the table, every family makes tz'u-pa balls fried in oil, known as “eating oil balls.” They make sacrifices to their ancestors in great piety.' <sup id="cite_ref-167" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-167">[167]</a></sup> 'The Second Month. In the second month all New Year festivities are over, and every one among the Miao -I must attend to his duties. If one does not work during the second month, he is adjudged an idler and is ridiculed. In the middle of the second month, four or five days after the beginning of spring /Feb. 5-18/ according to the lunar calendar, the Miao -I in the district have a custom similar to the Chinese there. Any tomb that is not yet three years old is visited by one or two male members of the family with a basket which contains a tray of beancurd, a piece of fried tz'u-pa, a tray of pork, a cup of wine, a bowl of rice, a pair of candles, nine sticks of incense and some paper money. These are offered in sacrifice. A small number of rich families would lay out a feast at the graveyard, and this is called “lan-shê.” The Third Month. On the third day of this month the Miao -I eat tz'u-pa made of buckwheat flour called “ch'iao-erh-pa.” In the Ching-ming season /April 5-19/ they sweep the grave, a custom known as “hanging the paper.” They stick new willow twigs on their door. On the Ch'ing-ming day they first visit the public grave (the oldest grave of the original ancestor), and then their private graves. In preparation for the visit to the public grave they buy collectively a huge pig as well as candles and incense, firecrackers, wine and delicacies. Members of the entire clan in the village go there to make sacrifices, after which they feast themselves at the grave. After the visit to the public grave they separately prepare items of sacrifice to be offered at their private graves. There are also a small number of rich families who would set up several dozen tables of feasts at the family graveyard to entertain the guests. A few days later, if the wind is mild and the weather fine, the mountain side would be dotted with men and women promenading and enjoying nature. The Fourth Month. The eighth day of this month is observed as a “Buddha-bathing festival” by the local Chinese. The Chung-chia in the hsien district would set up their ancestral tablets, make tz'u-pa, prepare wine and meat, and burn incense for sacrifice. The Chung-chia in this district as well as the Kuhuang Miao (one branch of the Hua Miao) in four or five areas [Page 103] 183 cont. consider this day as the birthday of the cow-king, and so all the cows in the field have a day of rest.' <sup id="cite_ref-168" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-168">[168]</a></sup> 'The Fifth Month. The fifth day of this month is the Tuanyang festival, also known locally as “Tuan-wu.” The Miao -I families in the hsien district would steam glutinous rice on the fourth day and mash it into tz'u-pa the next morning. Every member of the family would receive a few pieces and these are eaten with maple sugar and crushed bean paste in the place of meals for that day. But it is 184 not a holiday and they still work as usual in the fields. Recently many Miao -I imitate the Chinese by hanging rush and artemisia leaves at the door, and at noon time they drink realgar wine and eat glutinous rice dumplings /wrapped in bamboo leaves/ and noodles instead of rice. After the transplantation of rice-plants in the fourth and fifth months and at the time of their flowering (called locally “yang flowers”) in the seventh and eighth months, the Hua Miao and the Ch'ing Miao both have a dancing festival as festive as the New Year flower dance. The Sixth Month. The temples of the local gods in all the Chinese and Miao -I villages in the district are scenes of great celebration on the sixth day of this month. The Miao -I build their local temples outside the village gate, and on this day they would hold processions in honor of the Earth God. The day before, the village head prepared in advance a big pig and many varieties of meats and vegetables. On the sixth day all the items of sacrifice are carried to the village gate and deposited there in front of the Earth God temple. After setting off the firecrackers, every family takes turns to perform a ritual before the temple. After the sacrifice the pork is divided up among the families, the quantity being designated by each family to be paid for in grain after the autumn harvest. The remainder of the pork together with the other meats and vegetables are cooked together on the spot in a huge cauldron and eaten by all the people present. After feasting each family brings home a small quantity of pork, from which a piece is cut off for sacrifice on the border of one's field. A string of paper money is also stuck there as a token to [Page 104] 184 cont. invoke a prosperous harvest. In the afternoon every family contributes a few dimes for the purchase of vegetables and sends a representative to the party, at which rules and regulations are discussed regarding indemnities for damages to crops. He who can write is asked to list the rules on a piece of white paper to be affixed at the village gate. Then on the top of a high mound near the village they set up a straw mark and let loose a din of firecrackers to announce to villages far and near that this village has already passed its laws so that none may go there to violate them.' <sup id="cite_ref-169" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-169">[169]</a></sup> 'On this day the number of people making sacrifices before the Earth God temple among the Chung-chia is also large, but in addition each family has to prepare separate glutinous rice dumplings and a chicken for sacrifice to the ancestors. In the afternoon the children would bring dumplings and chicken legs to some nearby river banks to enjoy themselves. Toward evening they would wash their hands and feet in the river before coming home, and this is called “the first wash.” The Seventh Month. The first dragon day of this month is the “new crop festival.” On this day all the children of the Hua Miao and Ch'ing Miao 185 wear new clothes. In the morning they would go to the field, each plucking three bunches of grain stalks, which they cook in rice. They also cook a few ears of corn with some blue fish for sacrifice to the ancestors. After the ritual the whole family would sit down to a meal of new rice and corn. The custom of the Chung-chia is similar, except that after the sacrifice the new rice and corn are first fed to the dog of the house before they are eaten by men. According to their tradition, it is said that at the time of creation there was no rice in the world, and that a dog brought the seed from heaven for men to plant. It was only then that people had rice for food. So on the “new corp day ” each year rice is first fed to the dog to show that his benefaction has not been forgotten. Among the Chung-chia there is another superstition: from the “new crop day” to the time of the autumn harvest no one in the house, old or young, may sit on the doorsill so as to avoid misfortune.' <sup id="cite_ref-170" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-170">[170]</a></sup> 'The Eighth Month. The fifteenth day of this month is the mid-autumn festival. The local Chinese have the custom of making offerings to the moon, which the Miao -I do not have. Before this date, however, some frolicsome fellows among them might steal a pumpkin from somebody's yard and on the eve of the fifteenth day would dress it up into the likeness of an infant, complete with garment and shoes, and wrap it inside a dress. While one man carries the pumpkin, another would walk behind, simulating baby talk or baby cry. They also carry with them different eatables and visit neighbors and relatives who do not have children. On arriving, they would set off firecrackers and then knock at the door to ask for entrance. The childless family, knowing the visit in advance, would prepare a feast to entertain the visitors in the hall. After entering the house, the visitors would take the pumpkin to an inner chamber and place it on a bed, imitating at the same time a child's crying. One visitor would then spit into the bed and exclaim: “The baby is wet!” On hearing this noise the owner of the house dashes into the room and invites the visitors to the feast. This performance is commonly known as “presenting the old pumpkin,” and is regarded by childless couples as a good omen for childbearing. If in the future the recipient should actually give birth to a son, the pumpkin bearers would be treated to another feast. The Ninth Month. The ninth day of the ninth month is the Ch'ung-yang festival. On this day the Miao -I families within the district all eat tz'u-pa and make wine, known as Ch'ung-yang wine. It is said that the wine made on this day is especially delicious in taste and can last for a whole year without becoming weak. The Tenth Month. No festivals. The Eleventh Month. No festivals. The Twelfth Month. The eighth day of this month is known as “La-pa,” on which the Miao -I have the custom of competing for the first bucket of water. The bearers are all women, who rise early in the morning to go to the nearest well to draw the first bucketful of water to carry home. It is used to cook rice for the animals, to wash the women's hair, and to brew [Page 106] 186 cont. tea. It is said that this tea, when drunk by old folks, can cure coughing. On this La-pa day the families cook the soft congee rice /chou/, known as “la-pa-chou,” instead of the hard, dry rice. This custom is the same as that of the local Chinese.' <sup id="cite_ref-171" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-171">[171]</a></sup> 'The last day of the twelfth month is the day to banish all bad luck, and is known as the “Big New Year Eve.” On this day all the Miao -I families do a thorough house-cleaning. They go to the mountain to collect bamboo branches and tie them in a bundle to be used as a broom to brush away the dust accumulated during the year. They also wash their household implements and utensils, and thus tidy up the whole house to give it a completely new look both inside and outside. In the morning they make tz'u-pa to feed the cow and buy from the village fair many varieties of New Year delicacies. In the evening they put wine and food outside the gate as offerings to heaven and earth and their ancestors. After the sacrifice they gather together for dinner in the house. They pick out some rice and meat from the table to feed the dog. After dinner the elder of the house distributes cash presents to the children. No one goes to bed on the New Year Eve as candles burn, firecrackers resound, and singing and music from the reed-organ rend the air the whole night until dawn. This is known as keeping the vigil of the year.' <sup id="cite_ref-172" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-172">[172]</a></sup>
</p><p>Some sources report sexual licence among young people as part of Hmong festivals, but this is contested:
</p><p>'Marriages generally require parental consent but are based on mutual attraction and choice. In the past, many communities had "youth houses" where unmarried young people could gather. Groups of young men traveled around to court girls in other villages. In the absence of parental consent, elopement was an alternative. Festivals and trips to periodic markets still provide an opportunity for young people to meet, engage in antiphonal singing and dancing, and establish new friendships. Since the 1950s, travel restrictions and state disapproval of premarital sexual behavior has increased the parental role in marriage arrangement. Marriages are monogamous. Marriage outside the dialect or language group is rare. Divorce and remarriages are permitted. Postmarital residence is usually in the man's home village but only the youngest son lives with his parents after his marriage, and in instances where there are no sons a family may bring in a son-in-law or an aged widow or widower might join her married daughter's household. In some areas, there is delayed transfer of the bride until after the birth of her first child, or the practice of starting out with residence with the bride's family.' <sup id="cite_ref-173" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-173">[173]</a></sup> 'On the second or third days of the second moon, at tuan yang □, and on the sixth day of the sixth moon, men and women and boys and girls go to market. There they make advances to each other and a boy or a man goes home with a girl or a woman. On the way or in her home they are likely to enjoy sexual intercourse. They may or may not be married people. If anybody in the home of the woman or girl objects, a quarrel ensues. Generally no trouble is made by the wife or husband of either of the actors. But sometimes a woman who has irregular sexual relations with men other than her husband objects to her husband's doing likewise and in rare cases she commits suicide. It is said that among the Ch'uan Miao there are no harlots, women who habitually sell themselves for money and depend on that for a living. Sexual relations are generally the result of love affairs.' <sup id="cite_ref-174" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-174">[174]</a></sup> 'Among the Miao the premarital sex life of the young men and women is rather free. When a virgin has intercourse with a man, her parents know about it but do not forbid it. On the contrary, they consider this evidence that the man finds their daughter desirable. Sometimes, the girl brings home her lover, and her parents will kill a chicken to entertain him. There are even public houses set up specially for the use of young men and women to gather together. For instance, in Chapter II reference was made to the Pa Chai Miao, recorded in Yung-sui T'ing Chih, to the effect that an empty shed was built near the village, where unmarried men and women gathered together to sing. If a couple fell in love, a cow was sent as a betrothal gift. Again, the unmarried men among the Ch'ing Chiang He Miao were called “lohan”; in the spring they would [Page 130] 94 cont. carry wine and food up the mountain, singing and dancing reciprocally. Those who became fond of each other would drink from an ox horn. There is the custom among the Miao of dancing for the new year, dancing for the moon, and singing for autumn. On such occasions, young men and women form groups and sing in response to each other all night until daybreak. After singing they mix with each other, drinking and joking, even to the extent of having sexual relations. This is called fang yeh “going wild.”' <sup id="cite_ref-175" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-175">[175]</a></sup> 'The former marriage customs of the Miao were slightly different from their present ways. Yung-sui T'ing Chih says: “Miao marriage is just like a purchase. They do not follow the /Chinese/ custom of asking names (as a preliminary to fixing a betrothal) and sending presents to the bride's home to fix the betrothal. They only negotiate about the number of horses and cattle through a broker. The broker is a Miao marriage go-between. It definitely requires five or six horses or heads of cattle to initiate a trade for one wife. When the agreement [Page 131] 94 cont. is reached an inauspicious /sic/ day is chosen to welcome the wife. The bride wears a moon-white gown and walks holding a parasol, half open, half shut, called the shame-hiding parasol. Her father and mother, brothers, and relatives escort her to the husband's house. The dowry consists of everything from cattle and sheep and goats to plows and harrows. They do not enter by the main door but through a hole bored through a wall. Men and women sit together. The bride is not allowed to look left or right, or else the husband would be displeased for fear that shermay be fond of some one else. The couple takes each a bowl of rice, a piece of fish, and a cup of wine dregs. Next they visit the paternal uncles' houses in the same village, at each eating and drinking the same items. On their return home they are husband and wife, but they do not spend the night together.” It also says: “The Miao do not object to marriage between people of the same surname, but relatives do not marry. On the wedding night the bride sleeps with her mother, who leaves only when the groom gives her some silver as a gift 95, called the “mother's money” or “milk money.” It is generally about two or three liang of silver. A wealthy family, seeing a pretty girl, might order their son to drag the girl from behind. This is called “carrying off a woman and marrying her by force.” The girl's family attracted by their wealth, do not engage the girl to anyone else, but get a go-between to discuss betrothal presents. When a virgin has an affair with a man, her parents know about it but do not forbid it. On the contrary, they consider this evidence that the man finds her desirable. But, if one's wife or concubine is seduced, then they raise knives, facing each other, and money is required as compensation. If a husband and wife do not get along, the husband may divorce her and marry again, and the wife may do the same. As to improper sexual conduct, instances were very rare even in former days, and today the Miao have become more aware of ethical and moral obligations.” (What is recorded in the Miao Fang Pei Lan is to the same effect.)' <sup id="cite_ref-176" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-176">[176]</a></sup> 'Youth. Young people grew up much less hedged about with conventions than were the Chinese of the locality. They worked and played together, as in the cleaning of stables, fishing in the pond, harvesting, and the New Year holiday. At that time girls sat about two fires in the space bounded by the buffalo bullfighting meadow, a bamboo thicket, a cluster of grave mounds, and the highway along the southern edge of the wood. There they embroidered, played the flute, and sang, as they entertained young men from other Cowrie Shell Miao villages. A group of women with their children sat about the third fire, but did not interfere with the teasing, snatching of turbans and ornaments, and chasing which went on. During this period boys from other villages stayed all night in the homes of this village, and a group went to market together. If there was sexual promiscuity at this time, it was not practised openly.' <sup id="cite_ref-177" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-177">[177]</a></sup> 'Marriage among the Miao is mostly the result of love, but the mediation of the match-maker and the engagement ceremony are necessary before fixing the date of marriage. Young men and women 19 at the “liu sheng /reed-wind instrument/ dance” in the first lunar month may openly fall in love with each other without the intervention of parents or brothers of the family. In ordinary times, especially during the holidays, they may also court each other at will. So on the mountain slope or in the field we often observe scenes of “yao-ma-lang” (i.e., love-making), when they sing songs to each other in questions and answers. One party would ask a question in a song, and if the other party is willing she sings back the answer. These songs are extemporized, full of freedom and naturalness. Such serenades last till sunset when they begin to return home. After a suitable period of time, if their feelings persist then the parents would find a go-between to arrange the engagement. This system of love and marriage seem very free, yet there is no promiscuity. Their conduct is regulated by unwritten laws and they all have a high sense of decency. For instance, yao-ma-lang is carried on out of sight of old people, and yet it has to be within sight of passers-by. Furthermore, men and women must remain at least five feet apart, and necking and embracing are taboo. (The Long-skirt Miao not far away from them permit [Page 23] 19 cont. embracing.) So, pre-marital relations between men and women are rare if not altogether absent.' <sup id="cite_ref-178" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-178">[178]</a></sup>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ New Year's Festival ♥</b> The New Year's Festival features prominently in the ethnography, although there is some variation in the importance of individual festivals among different Hmong groups. 'Festivals were abundant and differed widely by region, although the New Year was commonly of central importance. Everywhere the Miao lusheng or bamboo reed pipe organ was a key musical instrument along with drums, different horns and flutes, a kind of jew's harp, and a long tubular instrument called the mantong. Blowing through leaves also was widespread. Multiple genres of song were accompanied by numerous conventions for their social usages. Other activities at festivals included processional dancing, bullfights, horse races, cock and other bird fights, mountain climbing, ball tossing, and dragon boat races.' <sup id="cite_ref-179" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-179">[179]</a></sup>//The Chinese material provides a general description of some Miao New Year's Festivals: 'The First Month. The first day of the first month is the beginning of the year. The Miao -I in this district would stick up paper money on the door of the house, which is also decorated with red peppers strung together with scented rice straw. Some of the Chung-chia people imitate the Chinese by asking calligraphers to pen symmetrical New Year verses for the door, [Page 99] 180 cont. and then hang out knots of scented rice straw, but no red peppers. These decorations are in expectation of a prosperous year.' <sup id="cite_ref-180" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-180">[180]</a></sup>//'After having celebrated “The Big Year” on the thirtieth day of the twelfth month and having decorated the door on the New Year's day, the Hua Miao and the Ch'ing Miao would remain at home to rest without doing any work. The food for the New Year was prepared in advance on a lucky day (dragon and dog days are lucky), and it is not cooked again until another lucky day comes around. So on New Year's day there is no kitchen drudgery as only pre-cooked meals are eaten. The New Year's day being the first of the year, everything has to be auspicious and inhibitions are many. For instance, 1) no sewing is done by women at home; 2) nothing is taken into the house from outside; 3) no water is carried; 4) no knife is used; 5) no one is allowed to go barefooted and shoes must be worn; 6) no cursing is allowed; 7) no rapping on the wall is allowed; 8) the floor must not be swept; 9) no collection of debt is permitted. Besides, there are the proverbial “three days of liberty” when parents would allow their sons and daughters unrestrained freedom in the pursuit of recreation and happiness on the first, second and third days of the year. After this period the children once more submit themselves to parental restraint. On the first day of the year the old and young are clothed in new garments and have fun all day long. Only the Hsiung and Yang families among the Ch'ing Miao have the custom of worshipping ancestors in the evening. At the time of the sacrifice, the head of the family would spread a straw mat on the floor of the middle room or the side room and place on it incense and candles as well as three bowls of rice. In each bowl is pitched a piece of pork on a bamboo stick with three straw knots to represent the ancestors. In addition there are three bowls of beancurd and three pieces of tz'u-pa /glutinous rice balls/. They call out aloud to ask their ancestors to pass the New Year with them. Then the male members of the family begin to kowtow in the order of their age. After the paper money is completely burned, they gather up the things on the straw mat. The rice straw and the bamboo [Page 100] 181 cont. sticks are thrown into the temple of the Earth God outside the village.' <sup id="cite_ref-181" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-181">[181]</a></sup>//'The New Year activities of the Chung-chia are slightly different from those of the Hua Miao and Ch'ing- Miao. On the first day of the year they also wear new clothes and decorate their doorway. At about seven o'clock in the morning they make sacrifices to their ancestors in the hall with several bowls of rice and meat while incense and candles are burned and fire-crackers are set off. The whole family, old and young, male and female, all participate in the ceremony as they perform the ritual of “three kneelings and nine kowtows.” After the sacrifice, the family settles down to a New Year feast in the hall, after which they stop working and laugh and joke all day. Their restrictions are similar to those of the Hua Miao and Ch'ing Miao. [...] On the second day of the New Year, the Hua Miao and the Ch'ing Miao would gather their family members after breakfast and with spades on their shoulders and wearing straw hats they would march off to their farms to do a little ploughing and digging, the idea being that this first “earth-removing” inaugurates a year's agricultural activities. With the Chung-chia, there is no definite day for the beginning of farm work, but it is generally around the tenth day of the first month. During the first three days of the year the Hua Miao, the Ch'ing Miao and the Chung-Chia would all stay home without going out for fear of meeting with unlucky events. On the fourth day the villages become astir with New Year visits between [Page 101] 182 cont. friends and relatives, and the younger generations pay respects to their elders (The New Year gifts for the children vary from ten to twenty cents.) When they exchange visits and greetings they bring with them a couple of home-made tz'u pa (each about 1 sheng of rice), candies and refreshments as gifts. The host and hostesses must entertain the visitors with tea and wine. The tenant farmers also present similar New Year gifts to their landlords, who in return would give them pieces of cloth or other household articles. As a rule such New Year greetings do not extend beyond the twelfth day though intimate relatives may offer theirs until the fifteenth. If a relative who has kept up these New Year visits throughout the past years fails to turn up, the family will be greatly offended. The Miao -I take the New Year greetings very seriously, and hence they should not be negleoted.' <sup id="cite_ref-182" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-182">[182]</a></sup>//'The fifteenth day of the first month is the “Small New Year” with the Hua Miao and the Ch'ing Miao. That evening they put in front of the doorway a small table, on which are placed as sacrificial offerings a bowl of rice, a piece of meat and a cup of rice wine. Burning incense and lighting candles, they would kneel down and pray: “We pray to the Buddha tonight to guide us this year smoothly to wealth and prosperity.” After the prayer, the old and young, except the womenfolk, worship in turn. Then they sit down together for a feast in the hall. After dinner they have fun for the rest of the evening. The Chung-chia celebrate the “Small New Year” on the thirtieth day of the first month. Besides other delicacies at the table, every family makes tz'u-pa balls fried in oil, known as “eating oil balls.” They make sacrifices to their ancestors in great piety.' <sup id="cite_ref-183" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-183">[183]</a></sup>//New Year's festivities were celebrated with games and other amusements as well as gift exchange: 'Among the Miao there is a swing game, which is quite interesting. On farm holidays when there are fairs or during the New Year festival, they put up frameworks for swings on a vacant lot. Each framework supports two swings, and every swing has four compartments, each fastened with ropes and a board. Each swing seats four men or women, going around with the wheel (Illus. 120). Men and women sing back and forth as they swing along (see chapter, “Folk Songs” /not translated/). The following song is about the origin of the swing: Songs and singing are as old as time,   Found in all books everywhere. A son of a unicorn was born in the   Sung dynasty. The young man with a clever mind sought   a mate. He searched for a beauty but was   ashamed of his own ugliness. He loved beauty but beauty was   hard to meet. He asked someone for a plan. And was told to make a swing for people   to enjoy. [Page 353] 236 Page 356] 239 cont. Shouting, he made known his invitation.   A maid from the Sleeping Tiger Mountain, Came to ride on the eight-men swing.   She was loved by all present. Soon, a go-between was found - Man and wife were joined together for a   hundred years.' <sup id="cite_ref-184" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-184">[184]</a></sup>//'Besides weddings and funerals, friends and relatives may exchange presents on New Year festivals or other happy occasions. Ordinarily when friends and relatives visit a family, the host, no matter whether he is rich or poor, must serve wine and food, if he did not the guests would view it as a sign of contempt. Intimate friends and relatives making the first call are not treated with goose or duck for fear that there might be quarrels between them later to hurt each other's feelings, as the beaks of the goose and duck are flat and large and therefore portend querulousness.

For this purpose he or she goes to the market place on the third day of the third moon, at tuan yang □ on the fifth day of the [Page [facing p. 36]] [Page 36] fifth moon, or at some other convenient time, or attends one of the Miao feasts or festivals, or joins those playing on the mountain-sides at New Year time. Either the boy or the girl can make the first advances. The methods are to look lovingly with the eyes, to squeeze hands and to speak loving words. This is inconvenient if there are many people about. A boy may take a girl's handkerchief or a girl take a boy's. Then the person who gets the handkerchief goes away and the other says, “That person has taken my handkerchief. Stay here and I will go after him (or her).” Then in a quiet secluded place they make love. They say loving words, squeeze each other's hands, and embrace. A very great evidence of love is when one spits and the other swallows the spittal. Copulation often follows after which a handkerchief or a ring may be given by the boy to the girl or vice versa and they make a vow such as, “If you do not marry me and marry another, you must take this engagement present and eat it and then I will make no trouble.” It is believed by the Ch'uan Miao men that copulation is one of the surest ways to a woman's affection.' <sup id="cite_ref-186" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-186">[186]</a></sup>//Graham provides a translation of incantations performed on New Year's--the following examples are particularly relevant to Seshat.

<dd><b>♠ obligations to each other's families ♣ present ♥</b> Graham provides a translation of incantations performed on New Year's--the following is particularly relevant here. 'When the rice biscuits have been eaten, you must go and remove diseases and remove calamities and remove pains and remove quarrels and remove sins. You must leave them on the roads of the Lolo and the Chinese. You must add to the strength of your descendants so we can go and sow. You must add to their power so they can make clearings in the wilderness, so that your descendants will have food and clothing. Then you will have meat to eat and wine to drink and your descendants will sacrifice to three generations of female and male ancestors.' <sup id="cite_ref-219" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-219">[219]</a></sup> It should be noted that this quote comes from a twentieth-century source. 'Besides weddings and funerals, friends and relatives may exchange presents on New Year festivals or other happy occasions. Ordinarily when friends and relatives visit a family, the host, no matter whether he is rich or poor, must serve wine and food, if he did not the guests would view it as a sign of contempt. Intimate friends and relatives making the first call are not treated with goose or duck for fear that there might be quarrels between them later to hurt each other's feelings, as the beaks of the goose and duck are flat and large and therefore portend querulousness. If a chicken is used it must be cooked whole to see if the two eyes are completely closed.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Sacrifice to Ancestors ♥</b> Hmong families regularly performed sacrifices to ancestors. '“Eating pigs” is called [kue□ mba□] in the Miao language, which means the “kuei”of pigs.” It is great sacrificial ceremony of the Miao, which honors the grandparents and the house kuei as well as the thunder kuei. From beginning to end it is performed for four days and is divided into 14 parts. For this occasion four pigs are prepared beforehand as well as a number of chin of waterbuffalo meat. The beef is cooked, and cut into slices, which are [Page 194] 131 cont. strung together in strings /skewers?/ of meat. There are 14 strings of seven slices each and 18 strings of nine slices each. The relatives by marriage, of a different surname, i. e. the mother's family and the wife's family, are invited to the function beforehand; and the mother's brother or the wife's maternal uncle are considered to belong to the lower generation for the ceremony.' <sup id="cite_ref-229" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-229">[229]</a></sup>//'On the first night the first part is performed, which they call the opening of the affair. A large table is set up in the middle of the house. On it are placed five bowls of wine and five bowls of meat, one bowl of sour soup, one plate of cut-up beef, and a wooden bucket on which is placed a dried rice shoot. The sorcerer-priest's performance consists of first setting off firecrackers, next blowing a signal horn, and last beating a gong and drum, which is the end. The second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth parts are performed on the second day. In the morning the second part is performed, which is the sacrifice to the grandparents and the house kuei. A small table is placed outside the main entrance. On it is placed an upper millstone upside down. A wooden bucket is placed on the stone, and on it are put a knife, two dried rice shoots, a few shoots of cow grass, and a sheaf of t'u-t'ou pai-yeh. There is also a tray with five cups of wine and a certain number of slices of cut-up beef. No beeswax is burned and the sorcerer-priest only utters an incantation and that is all. The third part is the sacrifice to the thunder kuei. It is very important not to eat any salt, because of the Miao superstition that the thunder kuei is very much afraid of salt. A large table is also set outside the fire entrance /? huo men/ and under it are put a hoe, rain clothes, and a plow. Moreover, on the table is put a tile, in the center of which are put a few small lumps of charcoal on which to burn the beeswax. Then [Page 195] they spread seven bowls each of wine, cooked rice, and waterbuffalo meat, a bowl of tea, and a bowl of sour soup. Altogether there are 23 bowls. In addition they put out two large bowls of water-buffalo meat, and place beside the table a live pig, whose four legs are tied up. On the outside wall of the house is hung a red rug. A spear piercing a piece of wood stands upside down on the ground beside the blanket. The sorcerer-priest sits down at the right side, holding a double-edged sword in the right hand, a sheaf of t'u-t'ou-pai-yeh in the left, and a bracelet. He utters an incantation, while attendants hold the wine pot and pass the wine, blow the signal horn, beat the gong and drum, and set off firecrackers, as in Illus. 59. First, seven strings [Page 196] 133 cont. of water-buffalo meat are offered, one string being offered each time, and ending with the seventh string. Then after the pig is offered to the kuei by the sorcerer-priest, the pig is sent to the kitchen to be killed and cooked. Then the cut-up meat of the pig and the heart, liver, intestines, and lungs are distributed in seven bowls and offered to the kuei.' <sup id="cite_ref-230" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-230">[230]</a></sup>//'The fourth part is performed in the afternoon toward evening. A small table is set outside the entrance, on which are placed incense, rice, and li-shih (1) , and a pair of green candles as well as five cups of wine. The fifth part is performed at night after the first night watch is sounded. Two large tables are put together in the middle room. It is surrounded by a number of benches. On the tables are spread out 12 bowls of wine in two rows, six in a row, and 12 bowls of cooked rice in one long row. On top of each bowl of rice is a piece of pork and a pair of chopsticks stuck in it. There are also 12 bowls of meat, placed like the bowls of rice in a long row. In front of the bowls of meat are a bowl of tea and a bowl of sour soup. On one corner of the table is a wooden bucket, on which are two dried rice shoots and a double-edged sword. The sorcerer-priest and the members of the lower generation as well as the close relatives of the same clan sit down around the table. The sorcerer-priest performs his ritual, and the rest light firecrackers, blow the signal horn, and beat the drum, filling the hall with rumbling and roaring. The sixth part is performed after the second watch is sounded. A long door plank is set up outside the ground floor. On the plank are laid nine bowls of wine, nine bowls of meat, nine bowls of sweet wine, a bowl of sour soup, and a bowl of tea. On the right side is placed anupper millstone, on which is set up a bucket on which are put a dried rice shoot and a double-edged sword. The sorcerer-priest and three members of the lower generation are seated in a row, and behind them is hung a red rug. [Page 197] 133 cont. The sorcerer-priest carries out his performance by three times toasting and three times offering, five times toasting and five times offering, seven times toasting and seven times offering, until nine toasts and nine offerings have been made /sic/. The three members of the lower generation sit respectfully to keep the kuei company, as in Illus. 60. They sit until one of them has to go outside to relieve himself. Then the hostess gets out a cock, which is offered as a sacrifice by the sorcerer-priest, after which it is killed and cooked, and offered to the kuei.' <sup id="cite_ref-231" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-231">[231]</a></sup>//'On the third day, the seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth parts are performed. The seventh part is performed in the early morning. A long door plank is again set up, and on it are laid nine bowls each of wine and meat, a bowl of sour soup, and a bowl of tea, as well as incense, rice /uncooked/, and li-shih /paper horse/. A bow and arrow, a silver bracelet, and a bamboo splint are stuck on the table. There is also an upper millstone on which is a /Illus. 60 appears on p. 134/ 135 wooden bucket with two dry rice shoots and a double-edged sword on it. On the handle of the millstone is a bamboo-handled sieve, in which is found crosswise a wood plank, one end of which is cut into the shape of a fish with a small hole in it, tied with a piece of red cord. On the wood is carved the sign X. When everything is set out the sorcerer-priest starts to carry out his performance. The eighth part is performed with wine, cooked rice, and tea, seven bowls each, placed on the floor of the main house at the base of a pillar. The sorcerer-priest enacts his performance, uttering an incantation and making sacrifices to the ancestors. The Miao consider the base of the middle pillar the family altar where their ancestors rest. The ninth part is performed in the room to the left of the main house. A big fat pig is used, its four legs tied up and a wooden rod going through /between the legs/. The two ends of the rod are tied onto two wooden sticks. First, the sorcerer-priest offers the animal to the kuei. Then it is killed and cooked, and the meat packed into seven small bamboo baskets. The meat is then put into seven bowls, which are set up with seven bowls of [Page 198] 134 [Page 199] 135 cont. wine and cooked rice. In addition meat is sliced, and seven slices strung together to make one string. In all, seven strings of meat are put on a platter. The sorcerer-priest utters an incantation and divines with the chiao and sends off the kuei. This is the sacrifice to the kuei of the five grains.' <sup id="cite_ref-232" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-232">[232]</a></sup>//'The tenth part is performed at noon, when two “Five-Flowr pillars (1) are set up in an open area, and to each pillar is tied a pig. The hind legs of the pigs are bound together with hemp ropes. This rope must have been made by members of the lower generation. Moreover, a cock is tied to a small wooden pillar near the ornate pillars by means of a fine hemp string threaded through the beak. The sorcerer-priest stands under the eaves of the house, wearing a cap and long gown and holding in his hand a tree branch. The host wears a ceremonial hat and a red rug thrown over his body. He first picks up a bench and places it against one of the Five-Flower pillars, holding in his left hand a double-edged sword and a bamboo splint and flourishing the latter as if he were driving the pigs away. The sorcerer-priest utters an incantation to send the pigs away, and after the incense and the paper are burned, the various members of the lower generation come out grasping weapons as in Illus. 61. They bow three times facing the interior of the house and three times facing the outside. Then they kill the pigs and the chicken. The eleventh part is performed in front of the main house. A bamboo mat is spread on the ground and on it are placed the caps and clothes of the members of the lower generation. Behind the mat there is a bench, on which are placed a bowl of wine and a piece of water-buffalo meat. The sorcerer-priest stands outside the entrance, wearing a wide rain hat on his head and carrying a bamboo cage on his back, in which are clothes and other articles. [Page 200] 136 [Page 201] 135 cont Wielding a wooden rod, he utters an incantation, telling of the source of the kuei of pigs. After the incantation he goes directly into the house and partakes of the wine and meat on the bench.' <sup id="cite_ref-233" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-233">[233]</a></sup>//'The twelfth part is performed late at night or in the fourth or fifth watch. The long door boards are put up as a table. /Illus. 61 appears on p. 136/ 137 The two paris of pigs from the Five-Flower pillars, which have been killed, cut up, and washed clean, are put on the table with the heads of the pigs facing the interior of the house. On the table are further laid out wine, meat, and sweet wine, nine bowls each, as well as a bowl of sour soup and a bowl of tea. There are also 12 bowls of cooked rice, on each of which is placed a string of lean and fat pork. The upper millstone, incense, rice /uncooked/ and li-shih are also there. There is no blowing and beating of instruments, only the sorcerer-priest's soft-voiced, gentle petition. On the fourth day the thirteenth and the fourteenth parts are performed. The thirteenth takes place when the cock crows in the fifth watch. A member of the lower generation with a felt rug thrown over his body and a straw hat on his head holds an ox horn containing wine in his left hand and a knife in his right hand, as well as grasping a string of seven slices of pork. He walks to a river bank or a well. He empties the wine from the horn and puts in clear water. While returning, he eats the seven slices of meat. Arriving at the gate, he imitates the crowing of the cock. After entering the house he sits down. On the table is laid a tray on which are set three cups of wine and three slices of meat. Under the tray is a jar, into which the water is emptied from the horn. The sorcerer-priest strikes the drum and utters an incantation. After the incantation the water carrier runs out the door, while the host throws ashes from used firewood on his body. The fourteenth part is to send the kuei away and is performed in the early morning. The pigs' heads are cooked and cut into small slices or chunks, and are distributed in three trays, on each of which are placed three cups of wine. One tray is put at the foot of the middle pillar in the main house; one tray is placed on the floor of the front-half side room; and one [Page 202] 137 cont. tray is put beside the entrance. The incantation, uttered by the sorcerer-priest sends off the kuei.' <sup id="cite_ref-234" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-234">[234]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ healing rituals ♥</b> There are many ethnographic accounts of different types of Hmong healing rituals. The following is particularly detailed. 'When a Miao becomes ill and taking medicine does not make him better, then he must make a vow to “ta chia hsien” /lit. “beat the family ancestors”/, which in the Miao language is called [pa□ mba□ □ior□], which means “beating Miao pigs.” It may be performed during the illness or after the recovery. Before the event takes place, the host must serve notice to members of the mother's brother's family, inviting them to send seven members of the maternal uncle's family (six men and a woman) to be guests. If that family does not have so many people, the maternal uncle may ask other people to make up the number. But the persons invited should not have the same surname as the host. No day needs to be selected as lucky, but the following days must be avoided: if a child is born in the family, it is necessary to wait one month before the ceremony is performed; the birth of kittens also necessitates one month's separation; the birth of pigs, goats, cows, horses, and dogs causes a postponement of 12 days; the hatching of chicks, ducklings, and goslings, three days; a funeral in the family or when the head of the family has witnessed a funeral of another family, 12 days. If the notice should arrive before the time of expiration of any of the above periods, the maternal uncle's family may refuse such an invitation. If the host because he seeks an immediate recovery from a sickness cannot wait any longer, he may invite other guests, but they may not have the same surname as he. The Ta Chia Hsien ceremony is divided into four parts, requiring a whole day from morning till night. There are altogether eight kuei invited: [na□ n□ t□ te□], n□ ma□ bu□ □ie□], tso□ te□ tso□ tie□], [bu□ ie□ tsei□ n□] (it is said that these four are the ordinary names for the kuei of [Page 203] 138 cont. the ancestors). □, (this is the oldest ancestral kuei); [tso□ me□ t□ □io□], [iso□ to□ t□ lie□], (these are the kuei names of the seven invited guests). The place is beside the fire pit inside the house. The Miao sorcerer-priest sits on a low stool behind the fire pit, facing the entrance. In front of him is a bamboo tube and a bowl of wax. In front of the fire pit is set up a square table, on which are placed ten square pieces of fancy /flower/ paper divided in two rows. On each square of paper in the back row is placed a bowl of wine, and behind the back row are stuck up four paper kuei. In the two far corners of the table are stuck up two paper flags. Two chickens are tied to the legs of the table with fine cord through their beaks. Two pigs with their feet tied up with rope are placed in front of the chickens, heads facing the stove. To the right of the Miao sorcerer-priest, on the floor, there is a bamboo mat, on which is a /cooked/ rice bucket /Illus. 62 appears here/ 139 with the lid off, and a bit in front is a jar, in which is put a piece of fancy paper with a bowl of wine on it. In front of the mat to the right of the fire pit is a winnowing basket. Above it three pieces of bamboo form a semicircular top, on the outside of which paper is pasted, and then cloth. Inside are stuck three paper kuei, in the middle four pieces of fancy paper, and on each of the two pieces of paper in the rear is placed a bowl of wine, see Illus. 62.' <sup id="cite_ref-274" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-274">[274]</a></sup>//'For the first part, which concerns inviting the shen, the Miao sorcerer sits on the stool, without using any of his magic implements, and only uttering an incantation, whose general purport is as follows: "All you older and younger relatives of the host! The host has recently run into bad luck. When he walked on the road, he saw strange happenings among the grass and trees. When he ate, there were inexplicable fragments and pieces of a broken saucepan in his rice. When the host looked quickly, then he saw these strange phenomena. The (here the name of the ancestral kuei of the family is mentioned) kuei, wanting food to eat, first came and did these things, then made the host fall sick. The host, not getting well, made a vow, and after this, his sickness left him. [Page 204] 139 cont. The vow has extricated him from the clutches of the kuei, and the sickness has not come back, but is forever uprooted. The host has saved money and bought a fat pig from the market as well as paper money. Having waited for the passing of the days to be avoided, then he comes to the sacrifice to the kuei. Sorcerer-priests are very few in this world, and he came to my home to invoke my help. So, here I am. I ask all the kuei to come here. I burn a bowl of beeswax. The bamboo tube and the bell are beside the fire pit. The two winnowing baskets filled with meat, the gold and silver cans, the gold and silver chair cushions, all are set at the sides of the pit. The table for the sacrifice to the kuei, the paper money for the redemption of the soul, the fancy /flowr/ bowl to hold the wine, the fat pigs, big and small, two large chickens-these [Page 205] 139 cont. are all placed beside the table. We request the kuei to come to take them. And after taking them, please eat quickly." (He utters the name of the ancestral kuei of the family.)'  <sup id="cite_ref-275" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-275">[275]</a></sup>//'The second part consists of beating the bamboo tube. While beating the bamboo tube, the Miao sorcerer utters an incantation, generally describing many supernatural phenomena, such as the mischievous behavior of the 12 large trees; strange happenings after eating fish, meat, bamboo shoots, and smoking tobacco; strange happenings with the water at the time of using water, in a bath or sitting in a boat; strange happenings with clothes; strange happenings with ants and snails; with wooden rods and bamboo poles, etc. The third part is the handing over of the animals. After the incantation for the second part is finished, there is a short respite. The Miao sorcerer then picks up the bamboo tube and the bowl of beeswax is moved onto the table. Afterward he asks a man and a woman from among the seven guests from the maternal uncle's family to sit opposite each other, the man inside next to the bamboo mat facing outward, the woman outside next to the winnowing basket facing inward. The rest of the five men sit at the table on a bench next to the fire pit, without making a movement. The Miao sorcerer, holding a bamboo chiao in his right hand and ringing the hand bell with his left, begins once more to utter an incantation:140 “The wine for ta chia hsien is now ready. There are altogether seven empty wine bowls, two beside the fire pit and five beside the entrance. Please come and take them! After taking them, please do not drink right away. As for the pigs and chickens, if not sent they will not arrive. Once we send them they will arrive. I invoke my patron saint's soldiers and horses; I order my own 1,000 men and 10,000 horses to help deliver the large pig, to help send the small pig and the two chickens. The chickens are sent to the coop, the small pig is sent to the pig sty, and the large pig is sent to the tower.”' <sup id="cite_ref-276" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-276">[276]</a></sup>//'At this point the sorcerer-priest makes the gesture of forcibly sending off the pig. While sending off the pig he says three phrases of a magic formula in a low tone. The bystanders can only see his lips moving but cannot hear anything. According to the Miao sorcerer, at the time his teacher taught him this formula, he repeatedly warned him that after that day he must not teach it to any insincere disciple and must not teach them indiscriminatingly to anyone, or else, the person who teaches it may lose his life or his methods would not be effective. After having finished the three phrases of the magic formula to send off the pig, once more in a loud voice he intones: “Helpers take the wooden rod and hit the pig in the chest and kill it. Roast it with fire and wash it with water! Do it quickly! The kuei have been waiting here for fully half a day already.” After the incantation is over, the host and the helpers kill the animal with the rod and carry it inside the house. They roast it over the fire, then wash it with water, lay bare the stomach, and cut the pig into two halves: one half is taken by the host, with one leg cut off for the sorcerer-priest, and the other half is received by the seven guests. The other pig is similarly distributed, but after the host's share is put aside, the guests' share is cut into small chunks, and seven bowls are filled with meat. Two bowls are placed on fancy paper in the winnowing basket, and five bowls, on fancy paper at the table. Then, a few other chunks of meat are put into a tin can on the mat. After the meat has been set up, each person returns to his original seat. The fourth part is to send the kuei away. The sorcerer-priest, ringing the hand bell with his left hand and holding the chiao with his right hand, utters an incantation to the following effect: “The pork has been cooked in the saucepan. Seven fine bowls of meat and seven fine bowls of wien have been placed beside the stove. Another ten bowls of meat have been put beside the entrance. This sorcerer-priest takes this wine and meat and offers them to the ancestral kuei. So, please receive them.”' <sup id="cite_ref-277" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-277">[277]</a></sup> 'After the incantation, divination with chiao is performed for every member of the family. Next, divination is performed to see whether the kuei have gone. If the kuei have gone, then the guests taste a little of the pork, and then return home, carrying with them their share of the meat. At this time the sorcerer-priest and the host both cannot eat the pork. The sorcerer-priest has to collect all the paper kuei, paper flags, and paper money, and burn them up on the main road. Meanwhile, the host kills the two chickens and cooks them, and waits for the sorcerer-priest to come back so that they may eat it together.' <sup id="cite_ref-278" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-278">[278]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Ox Sacrifice ♥</b> Oxen were sacrificed after the termination of serious illness or childlessness. 'Bludgeoning the Ox is called in the Miao language /kueηy □ie□/, meaning the “kuei of the water buffalo,” and is the greatest of all Miao sacrificial rites. When a Miao is seriously ill and it is found through divination that the kuei of the water buffalo is causing the trouble, or when a person is childless by middle age and it is divined that the water buffalo kuei is preventing the Queen of the Nether World at South Heaven Gate to send forth a child, a Miao sorcerer is invited to the house to burn beeswax, to beat gong and drum, and to make a great vow to bludgeon an ox. After the vow is made, if the sickness has been cured or the son sought is born, it is then believed that the kuei of the ox has bestowed it. Then, it becomes necessary to make preparations to fulfil the vow to bludgeon an ox. The selection of the water buffalo to buy is most important. It is necessary to select a water buffalo with the four quarters having four spirals /?/ and the ears, eyes, mouth, nose, horns, and hoofs must be right and complete. Sometimes it is very difficult to buy such an animal, and when found, the price is always prohibitive. If the host succeeds in buying a water buffalo at the market, then someone is sent home ahead to carry the news, so that the members of the family can prepare gongs and drums to meet the ox halfway. When the ox is led into the house, the gongs and drums stop, and [Page 208] 141 cont. incense and paper are burned. They watch the stance of the animal to divine good and bad luck. If the water buffalo, on entering the house, lifts his feet to advance, with its head facing the incense censer, and glances at the ancestral shrine, then it portends good luck. If the water buffalo is stubborn and refuses to move forward or even tries to back out as if frightened, then it portends bad luck. After the water buffalo has been bought, a Miao sorcerer is asked to come to the house to present the ox to the kuei, and also to beseech the kuei. After this presentation, the family has to wait for the first frost after the autumn harvest to make the sacrifice. When the date is decided it is never changed or postponed.' <sup id="cite_ref-315" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-315">[315]</a></sup>//'After the autumn harvest has been completed and the first frost has arrived, an auspicious day is chosen to sacrifice to the kuei. Half a month before, four paternal male cousins are asked to go separately to where the relatives live to notify them. The most important relatives are the families of the hosts mother's brother and the wife's maternal uncle, who are said to be the “leg-bearing relatives.” They are so-called because after sacrificing to the kuei, one leg of the buffalo is given to the maternal uncle's relatives. A buffalo is divided into four legs. The first belongs to the /host's/ mother's brother, the second to the wife's maternal uncle, and the third and fourth are sent to other close relatives. The “leg-bearing relatives on receiving the notification presents the messenger with a strip of red cloth as an expression of gratitude. Moreover, within the 12 days before the sacrifice, one must avoid seeing unclean things, such as a dead cat, a dead dog, or a dead person. If this avoidance is violated, then the person may not be in the company of the buffalo kuei. The “leg-bearing” relatives often go together with the clan brothers /of the host/, making up a number of at least ten or more men up to as many as 60 or 70. Also invited are musicians, trumpeteers /?/, and drummers, to go in formation. Wealthy families imitate the old customs of the former Manchu dynasty, displaying official insignia, playing fine music, and beating gongs and carrying parasols. The maternal uncle's family entitled to the first leg [Page 209] 141 cont. also must provide a sharp spear and a large creeper. The spear is used to stab the ox, and the creeper, to tie its head.' <sup id="cite_ref-316" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-316">[316]</a></sup>//'The Bludgeoning the Ox sacrifice to the kuei is the most lavish affair of the Miao. In addition to the water buffalo, the host also has to buy a common ox, two pigs, two chickens, and incense and paper, firecrackers, sweet wine, and sour fish. The relatives all have to send gifts. Formerly the Miao Bludgeoning-the-Buffalo sacrifice to the kuei lasted for five days, but now it lasts only three days. The first day is to honor the guests. That morning the “leg-bearing” relatives arrive in formation. As they approach the host's house they set, off firecrackers and play music. The host comes out to welcome them by burning incense and paper before them and kowtowing three times. The Miao consider that the water buffalo kuei comes with the mother's brother. By the time the lamps are lit in the evening, most of the guests invited have arrived; and after supper men and women guests begin to sing songs (see the chapter “Folk Songs,” songs Nos. 29 and 30, “Eating Ox Song,” and songs 33, 34, and 35, called “Beating the Flower Drum Song” /not translated/) and dance drum dances. [...] The host first starts the drumming, followed by the “leg-bearing” relatives, then by other guests according to the degree of relationship with the host, and last by the helpers. At the same time the sorcerer-priest begins his performance, using two large tables put together in the main house to make a long table, on which are then spread rice husks, on which are placed wine bowls, meat bowls, an iron tripod holding a tin can, and an upper millstone. The table is surrounded on all four sides with a number of plank benches. The sorcerer-priest and four “leg-bearing” relatives properly dressed in full dress, and sometimes they wear spirit robes /shen p'ao/. The sorcerer-priest sits in the middle and the four men sit next. Those who blow trumpets and beat drums and gongs sit below. The sorcerer-priest, ringing a hand bell with his right hand and holding a chiao-tzu in his left hand, begins uttering an incantation. [Page 210] 142 cont. After each passage the musicians play their instruments a while. When the sorcerer-priest has occasion to stand up, the four “leg-bearing” men who accompanied the kuei also stand up; when the sorcerer-priest sits down, the “leg-bearing” men also sit down; when he presents wine, they must also do so. From first to last it is done nine times until late at night.' <sup id="cite_ref-317" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-317">[317]</a></sup>//'In the morning of the second day the sorcerer-priest orders the helpers to go outside the village to choose an open area to erect Five-Flower pillars. After the pillars are erected they make bamboo rings with bamboo strips and put them around the pillars. A piece of hemp rope is used to tie the nose of the ox to the bamboo ring. The creeper brought by the “leg-bearing” relatives are used to bind up the horns so that the animal cannot hurt anyone with the horns, see Illus. 63. After the arrangements have been finished, the sorcerer-priest is asked to make an inspection, and if he finds everything satisfactorily arranged, then they can proceed. The host then changes into new clothes, and offers wine and meat as sacrifices to the kuei, burns incense and paper, and kneels three times and kowtows nine times facing the ox. At the same time the sorcerer-priest utters an incantation, telling the origin of the ox kuei. After the incantation is finished, the mother's brother takes hold of the spear and acts as if he were chasing the ox to stab it. The spear is then taken by a young man to do the actual stabbing of the animal. At the same time the din from the drums and gongs rends the air and the ox runs around the Five-Flower pillars, /Illus. 63 appears between pp. 142 and 143./ 143 with the man pursuing and repeatedly stabbing, until the animal is dazed and falls to the ground. They note the direction in which the head falls to decide whether the sign is auspicious or not. If the head faces toward the host's house, it is a good omen; if the head faces away, then it is a bad omen. After the animal has been stabbed to death, then the meat is divided up. The head and heart, liver, entrails, and bowels go to the host to be used to sacrifice to the kuei. The left and right hind legs go to the “first- and second-leg-bearing” relatives, [Page 211] between pp. 142 and 143. [Page 212] 143 cont. and the left and right forelegs to the “third- and fourth-leg-bearing” relatives. The breast portion goes to the sorcerer-priest.' <sup id="cite_ref-318" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-318">[318]</a></sup>//'In the morning of the third day, the sorcerer-priest once more performs his ritual in the main house. At the same time the guests are leaving. Besides the “leg-bearing” relatives, who each receives a leg, the other friends and relatives all get portions of the beef from six liang to half a chin, sometimes as much as two chin, depending upon the degree of intimacy they have with the host.' <sup id="cite_ref-319" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-319">[319]</a></sup></dd>

In the event of a death, it must be performed not later than within five or six days after the death. The kuei invoked are called [□ioŋ□ lio□ □ioŋ□ ko□]. The place for the sacrifice is beside the fire pit inside the house and the time is in the early morning. They set up a winnowing basket in which are placed five bowls of wine, five bowls of meat, with the rest of the space filled with pa-pa. The winnowing basket is laid down on the left side of the fire pit, and a bowl of beeswax and a bamboo tube on the right. The Miao Sorcerer sits facing the fire pit, beating the bamboo tube with his right hand, uttering incantations, the general idea of which is as follows: “The fifth and the sixth months has already gone by; the ninth and the tenth months have arrived. In the loaded fields the five grains have ripened. They carry the grain back home, the men on their shoulders with a pole and the women on their backs. They cannot eat it all; they invited me to come. I brought soldiers and horses to fill this house; I am burning beeswax, beating the bamboo tube, and have prepared the wine, meat, pa-pa, and paper money. I beg you kuei to receive them, but hold them for the time being without eating them!” At this point he ceases to beat the bamboo tube and with a pair of chiao-tzu (1) divines the fortunes of the whole family [Page 192] 130 cont. one by one. 131 Yang chiao (both chiao looking down) signifies wealth; yin chiao (both chiao looking down) signifies sickness and calamity. Sheng (“excellent,” also written with the homonym meaning “holy”) (1) chiao (one chiao looking [Page 193] 131 cont. down, one looking up) indicates nothing is going to happen. At the same time he utters the following incantation: “The five bowls of meat and the five bowls of wine as well as all the pa-pa in the winnowing basket are all offered to the ancestors, and we beg you to eat!” At this point the host burns the paper money to send off the kuei, and the sorcerer-priest continues the incantation: “You have now eaten up the wine and meat. Now we are burning paper money for you! Before being burned it is paper but after being burned it becomes money, Divide it equally among you. Please go back and be good kuei and do not think of coming among mortals. (■) In this world, in the morning and night when we eat our meals, we shall call you. When called, then please come. If, in your spirit /yin/ world, you know of our calamities, please do your best to help us.” On finishing the incantation he divines for a second time with the chiao-tzu, and when he gets the yin chiao, then the performance is considered finished. While performing the sacrifice to the ancestors, the sorcerer-priest remains seated from beginning to end. When the ancestral sacrifice is performed because of a death in the family, then a basin of water is used, in which all members of the family must wash their hands in order to remove bad luck. The wine, meat, and the pa-pa for the sacrifice are eaten by the family and the sorcerer-priest. Whatever remains is given to the sorcerer-priest to take back with him.' <sup id="cite_ref-361" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-361">[361]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from military ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Imperial control shifted from indirect rule to government by appointed Chinese officials before a mixed system was established after a Hmong rebellion.<sup id="cite_ref-393" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-393">[393]</a></sup> 'According to the despatch quoted above the Miao officials, although they were military officers such as the native shou-pei and ch'ien-tsung, aside from their jurisdiction over the Miao soldiers, were also given considerable authority in Miao civilian affairs. In the tenth year of Chia Ch'ing /1805/ 107 the t'un land within the Miao area were placed under the control of Miao officials.'<sup id="cite_ref-394" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-394">[394]</a></sup> We are unsure to which degree executive and military authority/civil and military administration were separate in the area during the Qing period. We have provisionally assumed that some separation was practiced, but this is open to review. More material is needed.</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from legislative ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> We have found no evidence of legislative bodies in the area.</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from judiciary ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Informal Hmong customs co-existed with formal Chinese institutions. Hmong legal customs were informal and did not operate according to a written code: 'Among the Ch'uan Miao there are no written laws. The customs and habits of the group are the laws and what is customary is right. Crimes are infractions against the customs or mores of the group.' <sup id="cite_ref-395" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-395">[395]</a></sup> 'In every Sheng Miao village there is a set of rules and regulations which are voluntarily observed. In case of violation the offense is quickly adjudged by the public and an elder is invited to execute the punishment. Before it is carried out, however, he would tell the accused in a solemn manner the myths of their ancestors. Also in the case of a serious dispute the elder would summon both parties together, and first tell them the story of their ancestors before settling the dispute. After a decision is rendered in this fashion both parties would show compliance and would not carry the case to the law courts. Although the mythology handed down from mouth to mouth does not have religious contents, it becomes a kind of prophecy to those people who hold everything pertaining to their ancestors in the highest respect. It is entirely due to this inherent respect for their ancestors that the ancestral myth is recounted before carrying out the punishment or at the time of settling a dispute. The idea is to employ the will of the ancestors to restrain the actions of their descendants. It is interesting to note that the mythology of the Sheng Miao, meant originally to inform posterity of the stories of their ancestors' life, has also assumed the corrective and preventive functions of law.' <sup id="cite_ref-396" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-396">[396]</a></sup> 'These, of course, were only a few of the disputes which arose in the village or among the whole group of Cowrie Shell Miao. Most small matters were settled among themselves. Much of the old man's time was taken up with such cases. Sometimes others of the village elders were called in for consultation. This was according to the Chinese Government system, though in effect this formed the village government, or council. If matters could not be settled by them, they were taken before the lien pao official, and, if necessary, to the hsien magistrate.' <sup id="cite_ref-397" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-397">[397]</a></sup> Disputes were handled by local headmen, sometimes through ordeals: 'The Miao are addicted to kuei and to litigation. Sometimes litigation may last a year, and the court, unable to decide the case, may ask both parties to eat blood. This serves as a deterrent. Yen Ju-yü in his Miao Fang-pei Lan says: “Those who enter the temple to drink blood move on their knees and bellies, not daring to look up; those who are in the wrong dare not drink it, but repent and yield.” In the course of our investigations in the Miao frontier area, the private secretary of the hsien government at Feng-huang, Mr. Wang Yüeh-yen told us: “The T 'ien Wang temple is the Supreme Court of the Miao area. When a Miao is not satisfied with the decision of the hsien government, then he is ordered to go to the T 'ien Wang temple to drink blood. Whatever the litigation, big or small, it receives immediate settlement.” It can be seen that the Miao's awe of kuei is greater than their awe of the law.' <sup id="cite_ref-398" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-398">[398]</a></sup> Where literate residents were available, ad hoc regulations for specific situations were written down occasionally: 'After feasting each family brings home a small quantity of pork, from which a piece is cut off for sacrifice on the border of one's field. A string of paper money is also stuck there as a token to  invoke a prosperous harvest. In the afternoon every family contributes a few dimes for the purchase of vegetables and sends a representative to the party, at which rules and regulations are discussed regarding indemnities for damages to crops. He who can write is asked to list the rules on a piece of white paper to be affixed at the village gate. Then on the top of a high mound near the village they set up a straw mark and let loose a din of firecrackers to announce to villages far and near that this village has already passed its laws so that none may go there to violate them.' <sup id="cite_ref-399" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-399">[399]</a></sup> Formal courts presided over by Chinese judges were located in towns.<sup id="cite_ref-400" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-400">[400]</a></sup> Cases were transferred to formal courts operating under Chinese law when local settlement proved impossible: among the Magpie Hmong, 'Disputes between members of the same hamlet are settled, if possible, within the hamlet. Those between members of different hamlets of the same village are adjudicated by a council composed of the village headman and the heads of the hamlets involved. If this council cannot effect a settlement, the litigants have a right to carry their dispute to the chief of the township or even to the Chinese court of the county.'<sup id="cite_ref-401" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-401">[401]</a></sup> The above material refers to the Republican period. We still need to ascertain whether this is applicable to the Qing period as well. It appears that the sources only refer to the Republican period when it comes to legal matters. According to Graham, only a small number of cases was taken to Chinese courts even in the Republican period.<sup id="cite_ref-402" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-402">[402]</a></sup> This may have been even more rare in the Qing period. Accordingly, more information is needed before the relevant variables can be coded.</dd></dl>

<p><b>♠ State-level administrators ♣ present ♥</b> eHRAF provides a general description of the administrative history of the region: 'Chinese scholarship links the present-day Miao to tribal confederations that moved southward some 2,000 years ago from the plain between the Yellow River and the Yangtze toward the Dongting Lake area. These became the San Miao mentioned in Han dynasty texts. Over the next thousand years, between the Han and the Song dynasties, these presumed ancestors of the Miao continued to migrate westward and southward, under pressure from expanding Han populations and the imperial armies. Chinese texts and Miao oral history establish that over those years the ancestors settled in western Hunan and Guizhou, with some moving south into Guangxi or west along the Wu River to southeastern Sichuan and into Yunnan. The period was marked by a number of uprisings and battles between Miao and the Han or local indigenous groups, recalled in the oral histories of local groups. Though the term "Miao" was sometimes used in Tang and Song histories, the more usual term was "Man," meaning "barbarians." Migration continued through the Yuan, Ming, and early Qing, with some groups moving into mainland Southeast Asia. The retreat from Han control brought some into territories controlled by the Yi in northeast Yunnan/northwest Guizhou. The various migrations can also be seen as "vertical" migrations into the undeveloped hillside and mountain areas that were of lesser interest to Han. Depending on the terrain, the settled farming cited in Miao historical myths gave way to shifting slash-and-burn agriculture, facilitated by the introduction of the Irish potato and maize in the sixteenth century, and the adoption of high-altitude/cool-weather crops like barley, buckwheat, and oats. Farming was supplemented by forest hunting, fishing, gathering, and pastoralism. During the Qing, uprisings and military encounters escalated. There were major disturbances in western Hunan (1795-1806) and a continuous series of rebellions in Guizhou (1854-1872). Chinese policies toward the Miao shifted among assimilation, containment in "stockaded villages," dispersal, removal, and extermination. The frequent threat of "Miao rebellion" caused considerable anxiety to the state; in actuality, many of these uprisings included Bouyei, Dong, Hui, and other ethnic groups, including Han settlers and demobilized soldiers. At issue were heavy taxation, rising landlordism, rivalries over local resources, and official corruption. One of the last Miao uprisings occurred in 1936 in western Hunan in opposition to Guomindang (Republican) continuation of the tuntian   system, which forced the peasants to open up new lands and grow crops for the state.' <sup id="cite_ref-403" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-403">[403]</a></sup> 'From Song on, in periods of relative peace, government control was exercised through the tusi   system of indirect rule by appointed native headmen who collected taxes, organized corvée, and kept the peace. Miao filled this role in Hunan and eastern Guizhou, but farther west the rulers were often drawn from a hereditary Yi nobility, a system that lasted into the twentieth century. In Guizhou, some tusi   claimed Han ancestry, but were probably drawn from the ranks of assimilated Bouyei, Dong, and Miao. Government documents refer to the "Sheng Miao" (raw Miao), meaning those living in areas beyond government control and not paying taxes or labor service to the state. In the sixteenth century, in the more pacified areas, the implementation of the policy of gaitu guiliu   began the replacement of native rulers with regular civilian and military officials, a few of whom were drawn from assimilated minority families. Land became a commodity, creating both landlords and some freeholding peasants in the areas affected. In the Yunnan-Guizhou border area, the tusi   system continued and Miao purchase of land and participation in local markets was restricted by law until the Republican period (1911-1949).' <sup id="cite_ref-404" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-404">[404]</a></sup> The region has a long history of Chinese military intervention: 'The two regions referred to above can be demarcated by the ruins of the boundary wall erected under the Ming dynasty. Miao Fang-pei Lan, Shu Wang Lu /Detailed Old Records from the M.F.L./, states: “In the forty-third year of the Wan Li reign period (1615 A.D.) the Ping-pei Ts'an-cheng /Administrative Officer of Military Preparedness/ at Ch'en and Yüan rivers, Ts'ai Fu-i, reported that because the garrison outposts were so scattered and the Miao roads so rugged, it was difficult to defend against Miao incursions. He requested the appropriation of some 40,000 in gold currency for the erection of an earth wall, from T'ung-jen down to Pao-ch'ing, winding along the mountains and the streams for more than 300 li. Thus the border was made relatively secure. Again, during the second year of T'ien Chi (1622 A.D.), the assistant commissioner of the circuit of the garrison at Ch'en and Yüan rivers, Hu I-hung ordered Teng Tsuyü, a guerrila commander, to add another 60 li of wall from Chen-ch'i-so to Hsi-ch'üeh-ying.” The ruins of this wall start from Wang-hui-ying and T'ing-tzu-kuan in the southeast corner of the Miao area and proceeds northeast, ending at Hsi-ch'üeh-ying, dividing the Miao area into the southeast and the northwest regions. The building of the boundary wall under the Ming dynasty was not intentionally based on the topography but rather in accordance with the limits of Chinese colonization in the Miao area. The Chinese first occupied the region where the rivers flowed down in the southeast, and the Miao retreated to the La-erh plateau, defending themselves behind its natural advantages. The Chinese and the Miao were already divided according to topography (Illus. 2, 8) some 300 years ago. The frontier wall of that time, although serving as a boundary line between the Chinese and the Miao, became at the same time a [Page 54] 30 cont. line of demarcation between the two natural regions. So today the actual area of the Miao is northwest of the boundary wall, limited to the La-erh plateau. Although the Miao area is not a barren wilderness, the area is small and densely populated, with a high birth rate leading to population pressure, which has led the Miao to invade the southeastern region. Therefore, whenever there is a Miao rebellion, the whole area /Illus. 7 on p. 31/ 32 is occupied by them. The territorial limits designated by Yen Ju-yü as the Miao area is not entirely without reason. The Miao regard this area as their native land, and they seldom exceed its limits even in time of strife.' <sup id="cite_ref-405" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-405">[405]</a></sup> 'The development of the Miao area began during the time of the juncture of the Yuan dynasty and the Ming. The geographical section of the Ming Shih /History of the Ming Dynasty/ states: “A ch'ang kuan szu /a native leader set up by the Chinese government to head the district/ was established at Wu-chai during the Yuan dynasty, and in the sixth month of the seventh year of Hung Wu /1374, during the first reign period of the Ming dynasty/ the office was continued. A ch'ang kuan szu was set up at Kan-tzu-p'ing in the sixth month of the year chia ch'en of the first Ming emperor /1359/, at the headquarters of the commander-in-chief at Kan-tzu-p'ing. Later it was abolished. In the seventh month of the third year of the Yung Lo /1405/, it was reestablished.” Furthermore, the entry for Headman Hu Kuang in the “T'u szu Lieh Chuan” /Biographies of Headmen/ states: “In the third year of Yung Lo, Kung Neng and others at the Ch'en-chou military station summoned Liao Piao and others of the uncivilized Miao /i. e. those not under Chinese control/ from 35 villages of Kan-tzu-p'ing to send sons to pay tribute, and for this reason a ch'ang kuan szu was set up for Kan-tzu-p'ing, with Piao to be the official, under the jurisdiction of Pao-ching.” The city of the ch'ang kuan szu of Wu-chai was the present chief city of Feng-huang hsien, but that of Kan-tzu-p'ing was also within Feng-huang, situated 70 li northeast of the chief town of the hsien. In Vol. 3 of the revised edition of Feng-huang T'ing Chih, published in the fourth year of Tao Kuang /1824/, it says: “The old city of the ch'ang kuan szu of Kan-tzu-p'ing was situated 70 li northeast of the T'ing. In the first year of the first Ming emperor /1368/, a yüan-shuai-fu /commander-in-chief's post/ was set up. In the third year of Yung Lo /i. e. [Page 149] 104 cont. 1405/ it was changed to ch'ang kuan szu, with two city seats, one on the mountain top and another at the foot of the mountain. Today they have been abolished. The old city of the Wu-chai ch'ang kuan szu is the present seat of the T'ing /i.e. Feng-huang sub-prefecture/ administration, but it has been greatly expanded. During the Ming period all was under the jurisdiction of the Pacification Commissioner at Pao-ching.”' <sup id="cite_ref-406" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-406">[406]</a></sup> 'Kan Ch'eng was opened somewhat later, when at the end of the Hung Wu reign period /1368-98/ a ch'ien hu suo /a ch'ien hu was an official at a military station, in charge of 1,000 soldiers; suo = office or bureau/ was established. The “Shu Wang P'ien” /historical section/ of the Miao Fang Pei Lan states: “In the second month of the thirtieth year of Hung Wu /1397/ there was set up at Chen-ch'i a military and civilian ch'ien hu bureau. Sun Ying-lung, who was then keeper of the records at Lu-ch'i, proclaimed that the tribal people of the upper five tu /hsien subdivisions/ should be divided into ten li /neighborhoods/, to be under the jurisdiction of Ch'en-chou. Ying-lung was promoted by imperial mandate to be in charge of the pacification. He selected the head ch'ien hu in charge of the ch'ien hu bureau at Chien-ch'ang, Kiangsi, to go to the capital to be given a bronze seal and given the hereditary office of ch'ien hu of Chen-ch'i. When the emperor went to the pavilion to send him on his way, he proclaimed: ‘I have a single pellet of Miao territory, and I ask you to go ahead to open up headquarters for bringing the barbarians under our administration. Do what is good for them, and your descendants will enjoy the use /of the office/ without limit.’ Moreover, he ordered the Board of War to select Ch'en Ya of Wu-sa military station in Kweichow and Sung Kuei of Lu-chou military station in Szechwan to be assistnat ch'ien hu to go with him to assist him. He ordered the Board of Civil Office to select a head constable, and the provincial treasurer to allot for district police officers, who were granted, wrapped up an ivory tablet, paper money, and a silver belt, and entertained ceremoniously, and sent on their way. In the fifth [Page 150] 104 cont. month Tuan Wen reached Chen-ch'i, established the Military Station Office, and inaugurated the system, dividing 124 native villages into ten li, making Yang Erh, the main leader, a pe fu ch'ang /head of hundred men/. The other 132 villages 105 became a local army ‘to protect the city moats.’ When there were uprisings then they would be called to service; when conditions were peaceful then they would disperse as civilians. Hence the name, Military and Civilian Office” Chen-ch'i then is modern Suo-li, which is 20 li northeast of Kan-ch'eng hsien's main city.' <sup id="cite_ref-407" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-407">[407]</a></sup> 'Yung-sui was formerly under the jurisdiction of the native headman of Pao-ching, and Liu-li in it was also under the jurisdiction of Kan-chou.

But because of using an administrative policy of blockade against Miao country, the 270 years under the Ming [Page 166] 113 cont. did not witness serious trouble. The method of this blockade consisted of setting up stone guard posts /tiao-pao/, establishing guard stations /ying shao/, and building border walls, strictly demarcating the boundary between the Chinese and Miao areas, without allowing any infringement by one on the other. The section on government in the historical section of Miao Fang Pei Lan, recording the system of defense against the Miao during the Ming dynasty, has this to say: “During the fifth year of Hsüan Te i.e. 1430, the senior official /chang kuan/ at Kan-tzu-p'ing, Wu Pi-lang, and the Miao of Tung-jen, Kweichow, started a rebellion. The brigadier general /tsung ping kuan/, Hsiao Shou, built 24 guard posts /pao/ around the area to protect it. In the thirty-first year of Chia Ching i.e. 1552, the Miao in Hupeh-Hunan and Kweichow were pacified. The Court sent Governor General Chang Yo to hold down Yüanchou. Yo in consultation with Assistant Commissioner /fu shih/ Kao Hsien, and Lieutenant Colonel /ts'an chiang/ Sun Hsien drew up a plan to abolish the guard posts at Wan-chi. Then he built 12 outposts /shao/ called: Wu-chai, Yung-an, Ch'ing-ch'i, Ho-k'ou, Kan-tzu, Kan-chou, Ch'iang-hu, Shih-yang, Shao-p'o, Tung-hsin, Shui-t'ang-yao, Shui-t'ien-ying, which with that at Chen-ch'i-so came to 13 in all. Every guard station had a wall, a tower, a drill yard, a narrow gate, an office, and a community storehouse /she ts'ang/. The officer corps included a tu-pei /“head of senior soldiers”/, ling-pan /“section leader”/, ling-tui /“company leader”/, ling-cheng /“recruitment and arms officer?”/, kuan-piao /“keeper of banners”/, kuan-ts'ang /“keeper of the storehouse”/, and li-mu /“head constable and keeper of the jail”/. The local official had under him t'ou-mu /“headmen”/, she-jen /“official secretaries”/, shih-tzu /“readers”/, chien-pu /“strong walkers”/, ta-shou /?lit., “move the hands”/ hsiang-t'u /?lit., geographers”/, po-k'ai /heralds/, and the Ch'i Miao soldiers. In all the officers and men totaled 6, 000 or more, commanded by a lieutenant colonel /ts'an-chiang piao ying/, with a second [Page 167] 113 cont. captain /shou-pei/ assisting him. Moreover, at the two military stations /wei/ of Ch'en and Yüan, the frontier guard officers and men, amounted to 6,600 or more, and the annual disbursement to the Yüan-chou treasury for paying the troops was more than 30,089 /sic/ liang of silver, that to the Ma-yang, Ch'ienyang, and Kan-chou military rations granaries and the autumn government rations at Chen-ch'i-so were 31,890 or more. At this time, the lieutenant colonel /tsan-chiang Tu-ling/ directed matters at the top, the majors /yu-chi/ and second captains /shou-pei/ attended to things at the middle level, and the guard stations /ying-shao/ carried out defense duties at the lower level. Furthermore, fearing the difficulty of communications in times of trouble, it was arranged for the sake of convenience as follows: ‘For operations involving under 3,000 men, decisions may be made on the spot, but for operations involving more than 3,000 men, the decision must be made after consultation with the military defense officials. As the number of soldiers increased and generals became more strong, the border regions became more quiet and peaceful. In the forty-third year Wan Li /i.e. 1615/, the Military Defense Ts'an Cheng, Ts'ai Fu-i, because the guard stations being spread out and the Miao roads rugged, it was difficult to prevent spying, applied for an appropriation of 40,000 or more gold for the construction of a frontier earth wall, starting from T'ung-jen and going down to Pao-ching guard station, along mountains and extending in all more than 300 li, so that frontier defense could be made somewhat more 114 secure. In the second year of T'ien Ch'i /i.e. 1622/, a provincial governor was set up at P'ien-yüan…. The then pei tao fu shih /assistant commissioner of defense?/ Hu I-hung at Ch'en Yüan despatched Major Teng Tsu-yü from Chen-ch'i-so to Hsi-ch'üeh-ying to build an additional 60 more li of frontier wall.”' <sup id="cite_ref-411" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-411">[411]</a></sup> In the Qing period, Hmong migrations occurred after a number of failed rebellions, affecting the geographical distribution of individual Hmong sub-groups: 'The pure Miao tribe in Kweichow is further divided into five subgroups, the Hung Miao, the He Miao, the Pe Miao, the Ch'ing Miao, and the Hua Miao. The geographical distribution of the Hung Miao is along the eastern part of Kweichow bordering Hunan and the vicinity of T'ung-jen is the center. The He Miao are spread over a wide area in southeastern Kweichow, including such hisen as Tu-yün, Pa-chai, Tan-chiang, Yung-chiang, Yung-ts'ung, Li-p'ing, Chien-ho, T'ai-kung, Chen-yüan, Shih-ping, Huang-p'ing, Lu-shan, etc. It lies in the region south of the Hunan-Kweichow highway and east of the Kwangsi-Kweichow highway. The Pe Miao are found in the central part of Kweichow, starting in the east at Kwei-ting and Lung-li, passing through Kwei-chu, Hsiu-wen, and Ch'ien-hsi, and reaching Chih-chin and Lang-tai in the west. The Ch'ing Miao are also found in central Kweichow, principally in the vicinity of Kuei-yang, but also at Hsiu-wen, Ch'ing-chen, Ch'ien-hsi, and Chen-ning. The distribution of Hua Miao is the most extensive, starting from the vicinity of Kuei-yang, scattering over the northern and northwestern parts of Kweichow province in K'ai-yang, Jen-huai, Chih-chin, Lang-tai, Shui-ch'eng, and An-shun hsiens.' <sup id="cite_ref-412" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-412">[412]</a></sup> 'Owing to repeated military attacks during the Yüan and Ming periods, many of the Miao tribes in Kweichow moved outward. The Hung Miao who lived in the vicinity of Tung-jen in eastern Kweichow moved eastward to the three sub-prefectures /t'ing/ of western Hunan. During the four rebellions in the Ch'ing dynasty, in 1698, 1732, 1794, and 1855, when armies were used to put them down, the Miao fled in all [Page 34] 18 cont. directions, which led to the mass migration of Miao tribes in modern times. The He Miao gradually migrated to Hunan and Kwangsi. The Pe Miao moved from the northwest to Szechwan and Yunnan. The Hua Miao moved through An-shun in the west to the eastern part of Yunnan and north to Wu-ting and along the banks of the Chin-sha-chiang River, and again through the southeastern part of Yunnan to the north of Tonkin in Indochina. The Ch'ing Miao dispersed in all directions in the three provinces of Hunan, Kwangsi, and Yunnan. The foregoing relates to the major migratory trends of the Miao, but actually in the interior of Hunan, Kwangsi, Szechwan, and Yunnan several Miao subgroups are often found in one area. The writers found three subgroups at Meng-tzu, Yunnan, the Pe Miao, the Hua Miao, and the Ch'ing Miao, but the last two were not easily distinguishable from their dress. Furthermore, several groups inhabiting the same area are likely to intermarry so that after a considerable length of time has passed, it is difficult to distinguish between them.' <sup id="cite_ref-413" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-413">[413]</a></sup> 'Topography. (Illus. 2). - Topographically, the Miao area may be divided into two natural regions. The northwestern section can be called the La-erh plateau region; the southeastern section is the region where the rivers flow down. Although the plateau rises about 700 kung ch'ih above sea level, on it there are a great many small basins, with many springs and ponds good for irrigation. The Miao call such small basins p'ing /a plain/, t'ang /a pond/, or ch'ung. The best known among these is the Pao-mu-ying-p'ing, about 70 li north 30 of Feng-huang-ch'eng /city/. Surrounded by mountains, this level area measures five to six li in length and three to four li in width and has seven or eight spring-fed ponds, supplying ample drinking water. It is the largest basin on the plateau. Ya-pao-chai (Illus. 7), situated in the Ya-pao-shan mountains, about 93 li north of Feng-huang-ch'eng, is very high and cold. It has several fish ponds and produces rough rice and yams. In 1795, when the Miao revolted, the headman, Wu Lung-teng, whose family had lived there for generations, was entrenched there. The above two places are the largest among the basins on the plateau. There are countless small basins /p'ing and ch'ung/. There are numerous wells and springs in the mountains, wells being found even on the peaks. The “Yao K'ao” section of the Miao Fang-pei Lan states: “Fifty li southwest outside the city is Ma-an Shan /“Horse Saddle Mountain”/, which is about eight or nine li in height, is very steep, and resembles a horse saddle in shape. On top of the mountain there is a well that never goes dry. On the mountain there are pockets where there are irrigated rice fields. It is a strategic point for the uncivilized Miao to defend.” The La-erh plateau is dotted with Miao villages and settlements because of its level places /p'ing/ and wells and springs, and there the Miao people thrive.' <sup id="cite_ref-414" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-414">[414]</a></sup> Imperial control shifted from indirect rule to government by appointed Chinese officials before a mixed system was established after a Hmong rebellion: 'After the five hsien in the Miao frontier region were opened, from the Yuan and Ming dynasties to the beginning of the Ch'ing dynasty, they were under the control of native headmen. During the K'ang Hsi reign period of the early Ch'ing /1662-1722/, a gradual change was begun from native headmen to regular government officials. In the forty-sixth year of K'ang Hsi /1707/, the senior official /ch'ang kuan szu/ at Wu-chai, T'ien Hung-t'ien, being harsh and cruel, the provincial governor, Chao Shen-ch'iao, sent up a memorial [Page 151] 105 cont. to the Emperor requesting that he be dismissed from office and that no hereditary substitute be allowed. In the forty-eighth year /1709/, because the Miao at Liu-li of the Chen-ch'i Office did not wish to be under the control of the native headman at Pao-ching, they repeatedly requested the change from native headman to government official, and the provincial governor, Chao Shen-ch'iao, again sent up a memorial requesting transference of control to the government. In the fourth year of Yung Cheng /1726/, the headman at Pao-ching, P'eng, Yü-pin, was removed from office for being avaricious and cruel, and in the fifth year the change was made from native headman to government official. Yü-pin was peacefully settled at Liao-yang. In the fifth year of Yung Cheng, the headman at Yung-shun, P'eng Chao-huai, personally applied for the change from native headman to government official. He returned to his native place in Chi-shui, Kiangsi. San-t'u-chou /“three local chou”/ and Wu-ch'ang-kuan-szu /“five senior officials”/ under the jurisdiction of the headman of Yung-shun were also changed from native to government officials.' <sup id="cite_ref-415" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-415">[415]</a></sup> 'After the voluntary change from the native headmen in the Miao frontier region, in each Miao village there was set up a local village chief over 100 families /i.e., a pe hu chai ch'ang, “100 families village chief”/, in order to govern the Miao and bring them under the administration of government officials. But the chiefs of the 100 families were not always Miao, sometimes Chinese being appointed to these positions. As time passed, gradually, there were rapacious, unscrupulous rogues, whose mistreatment caused disturbances, so that the unprecedented Miao rebellion took place during the sixtieth year of Ch'ien Lung /1795/. When the Miao rebellion was put down in the first year of Chia Ch'ing /1796/, it was found that the policy of governing the Miao with Chinese was wrong. The then governor-general of Hunan and Kwangtung, Pi Yüan, submitted a plan to govern the Miao with Miao. (6) The ministry's response to the memorial setting up regulations for Miao officials, Miao Chiang Chin-106 Yao Shan-Hou Shih I /Important Remedial Measures for the Miao Frontier Region/, has a passage, “Miao Chiang Pe Hu Chai Ch'ang Ming-Mu Ying Cho Liang Keng Ting /The Names of the Village Leaders of 100 Families Should be Decided after Due Deliberation/,” stating: “According to the memorial, in the three provinces of Szechwan, Kweichow, and Hupeh, such areas as Yu-yang and T'ung-jen were all previously governed by headmen, but following their application to be put under government officials, the administrative areas of chou, hsien, and ying [Page 153] 106 cont. were established, subject to the jurisdiction of civil and military authorities. In the Miao villages, there were established only village chiefs to govern a unit of 100 families. However, since Chinese were also permitted to fill these posts, gradually there were rapacious, unscrupulous rogues, whose mistreatment caused disturbances. It is requested that from among the Miao who have submitted, and on whom were conferred the peacock feather decoration /for merit, in early Ch'ing times/, there be selected some intelligent, aware persons, to be appointed at each ying /military station/ as native second captain /shoupei/, lieutenant /ch'ien-tsung/, and sergeant or corporal /wai-wei/, such positions to be filled through the governor-general and governor's /tu-wu/ yamen /tu-wu ya-men/ and to be subject to the control of the civil and military authorities. When the various t'ang hsin in the Miao area have official despatches to send, they can order the said native petty officers to select Miao to question and send, and also to give them some cash and rations. When officials traveling on official business require servants, they may also recruit them from the Miao, and pay them wages according to the Chinese scales. It would appear that the 100-families village chief was originally inaugurated to discipline the Miao, but these men were unimportant and their powers limited, as that the Miao did not heed them. Moreover, among the Chinese holding such positions there were rapacious, unscrupulous rogues, whose mistreatment led to disturbances. This should naturally be explained, deliberated, and changed, so as to fix responsibility. During the recent campaign those submissive Miao who accompanied the army and won peacock feather awards are numerous, therefore from these select those who are intelligent and aware, and who have the support of the rest, and according to the customary set-up of t'u-kuan /officials governing aboriginal tribes in West China/, every Ying should have one or two men to be native second captains, under whom there should be native lieutenants and sergeants, for better control of [Page 154] 106 cont. the Miao. Their number will depend upon the number of villages put under control, and they shall be appointed by the governor-general and governor's yamen and also be under the control of regional officials. If there are fights, robberies and thefts among the Miao these native officers will be asked to make the arrests. On their inspection tours, the governor-general and governor and military officials should examine the merits and demerits of these officers and reward or punish them accordingly to demonstrate justice, following the recommendations memorialized by Governor-general Ho Lin. When the t'ang-hsin system of communication in the Miao area has been abolished, official communications should be despatched according to old methods so as to avoid delay. In the regions where the t'ang-hsin system exists as before, the local officials /t'u kuan/ should be asked to pick out honest Miao to be given the responsibility of delivering messages after being questioned, to be paid wages and rations from unallotted funds, according to the scale for t'un soldiers. When officials traveling on official business need servants, then order the said Miao to serve, and pay them wages according to recommendations memorialized.” ' <sup id="cite_ref-416" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-416">[416]</a></sup> 'According to the despatch quoted above the Miao officials, although they were military officers such as the native shou-pei and ch'ien-tsung, aside from their jurisdiction over the Miao soldiers, were also given considerable authority in Miao civilian affairs. In the tenth year of Chia Ch'ing /1805/ 107 the t'un land within the Miao area were placed under the control of Miao officials. Article 8 of Pu Fu T'un t'ien Chang-ch'eng /The Ministry's Reply concerning Regulations about the T'un Land/ states: “It would seem that after the Miao rebels were pacified in the present year in the various localities of Yung-sui, [Page 155] 107 cont. the Miao were greatly impressed by the strength of the Imperial army and surrendered land previously forcefully occupied by them. Also it would seem that if there was property of refractory Miao; it was confiscated. The fields were distributed among the law-abiding Miao to plant and pay rent, so that a Miao army could be raised and supported. Now the usurped land surrendered in the various villages totals more than 30,100 mu, and the land confiscated from the property of the rebel Miao totals more than 5,040 mu. These are now being separately registered, distributed for tilling for rent, and the revenues derived therefrom should be able to support 5,000 Miao soldiers. Among the 9,900 native Miao soldiers discharged over time and remaining, those able to bring up a plan to make a living have been sent back to their villages, and those who are old, weak, and poor have been given fields to till. Now 5,000 strong and healthy Miao soldiers have been selected, 2,000 of whom come from Feng-huang sub-prefecture; 800, from Kan-chou sub-prefecture; 1,800 from Yung-sui sub-prefecture; 100, from Ku-chang-p'ing sub-prefecture; and 300, from Pao-ching hsien. To collect the grain given over as rent, the Miao petty officers have selected in the various villages spots for building granaries to store away the public grain. Two or three honest Miao officers are chosen for each granary to supervise receipts and disbursements of the grain. The said 35,000 mu of arable land is estimated to be capable of yielding more than 22,000 shih of seeds of grain. It is estimated that there remain in various Miao granaries about 40 shih of seeds of grain, which will be used to fill the need for rations for the Miao soldiers in the intercalary month. The Miao officers are still ordered to report the actual receipts of rent grain every year.” ' <sup id="cite_ref-417" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-417">[417]</a></sup> Ling et al describe the appointment of Hmong petty officials in that time period: 'Thus a Miao official was a military official having concurrent judicial and financial duties, whose power actually was equivalent to that of a t'u-szu /headman/. The only difference was that the position was not hereditary. As for the procedure of appointment, according to a reply from the Board of War in the twenty-eighth year of Tao Kuang /1848/, Miao Pei P'ieh Chi Ta /?/ Chang-ch'eng /Regulations concerning the Commissioning of Petty Officers of Miao Defense/, it is stated: “The 486 Miao officers in the five sub-prefectures and hsien of Ku-chang-p'ing, consisting of shou-pei, ch'ien-tsung, pa-tsung, and wai-wei, were recommended by the sub-prefectures and hsien to Ch'en-yüan tao for approval, and then commissioned with official seals by the governor-general, governor, and provincial commander-in-chief. According to the regulations for the promotion of Miao t'un officers, a pa-tsung is considered by the tao and then appointed by the Board; the wai-wei is appointed directly by the tao, and when the pa-tsung becomes due for promotion to ch'ien-tsung, his commission must be confirmed by the governor-general and governor, and when the ch'ien-tsung is promoted to shou-pei, his record must be examined by the commander-in-chief. Today, in the appointment of Miao petty officers, even wai-wei have to be commissioned by the governor-general and governor, hence there is a great deal of red tape involved. It is recommended that the Miao defense petty officers can be selected according to the regulations governing the t'un petty officers of the tao troups /piao, “banner”/. Hereafter the Miao wai-wei and pa-tsung are to be changed to be appointed by the tao, the Miao ch'ien-tsung to be appointed by the provincial governor with official seal, and the shou-pei to be appointed by the governor-general. The Board of War has found that the previous procedure of appointing Miao officials, through joint deliberation of the provincial governorgeneral, governor, and commander-in-chief is 108 too involved, [Page 157] 108 cont. and in order to simplify it the recommendations in the memorial of the said governor-general should be followed.” From this it may be seen that in the beginning, the appointment of a Miao official was regarded as a serious matter. A petty officer such as a wai wei had to be commissioned by the governor-general and governor.' <sup id="cite_ref-418" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-418">[418]</a></sup> Administrative organization differed somewhat between the individual districts: 'With regard to the organization of Miao officials at that time, it differed somewhat in the five hsien and sub-prefectures of the Miao region. Feng-huang sub-prefecture had four ying /battalions/: the middle ying's two Miao shou-pei /second captains/, four ch'ien-tsung /lieutenants/, six pa-tsung /sergeants/, and 20 wai wei /corporals/ were in charge of 96 villagers, totaling 2,680 families, consisting of 6,230 men and 3,479 women.

Furthermore, since the Miao dreaded seeing Chinese officials, then the Miao shou-pei, ch'ien-tsung, pa-tsung, and wai-wei were set up with the responsibility of controlling the Miao. In cases when the Miao were involved in such affairs as fights or theft, these petty officers were charged with the responsibility of apprehending the offenders. For the official despatches to be sent it was necessary to rely on them to get the messengers, and the pressing for rents and grain were also under the Miao officials' control. Moreover, the Miao petty officials were asked to submit seasonal affidavits as to whether there were Chinese entering the Miao villages.' <sup id="cite_ref-425" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-425">[425]</a></sup> 'The policy of having Miao officials to govern the Miao has been in practice now for 140 years. At the time of the original separation of the execution and administrative functions between the Chinese and the Miao, the idea of Miao regulating the Miao could be said to have been aimed at the abuses of the time. But now after a hundred and some tens of years, the Miao have gradually been sinicized. Formerly, there was the difference between the civilized and uncivilized Miao, but today they have all become civilized. The policy of separate administration for the Miao and the Chinese has been informally discarded. Consequently, the regulations for Miao officials should be abolished. But, since the Republic, the Miao officials are still able to exist, largely because Chinese officials have been profiting by taking brides for filling official posts. On the other hand, since the Miao officials get their positions through paying bribes, they go to great lengths to make extortions from the Miao people. The Miao people detest the Miao petty officials more than they do the Chinese officials. Moreover, today, the various hsien in the Miao area have been changed to the system of hsiang /villages/ and chen /towns/, each governed by a head, known as hsiang chang or chen chang, respectively. In view of this change, Miao officials have become superfluous. It is hoped that the authorities in the region will be able to do away with them soon.' <sup id="cite_ref-426" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-426">[426]</a></sup> Ling et al describe the development of the t'un system: 'During the Ts'ung Cheng reign period /1628/ /the end of the Ming dynasty/, the Miao rebelled, demolishing the guard stations and leveling the border wall. The “Great Wall” to blockade Miao country disappeared. The 7,800 guard troops /shou ping/ in the Miao area of the Ming dynasty were reduced to 1,600 men at the beginning of the Ch'ing dynasty. When the rebellion of Wu San-kwei was pacified and all was peaceful again, there was another reduction of 500 men, leaving 1,100 men. Military strength was slight and the defence system was relaxed. Further, following the change from native headmen to Chinese officials, and the use of Chinese as the head of every hundred families, intercourse between the Chinese and the Miao was no longer prohibited. In the twenty-ninth year of Ch'ien Lung /i.e. 1764/, in view of the Miao having undergone acculturation for a long time, they were allowed to intermarry with the Chinese. The original idea was to change the Miao by teaching, but with the passing of time evils developed, when rapacious Chinese under the pretext of trade entered the Miao area and seduced crafty Miao to enter into thievery. Unlike soldiers they entered Miao country for personal reasons and mistreated the Miao. The Miao made a pretext of these guest men's exploitations and encroachments on their land and banded together to make trouble, and brought about the great rebellion during the Ch'ien Lung /1736-95/ and Chia Ch'ing /1796-1820/ reign periods. After the rebellion was put down, the Manchu court realized that the time was yet inopportune to change the Miao by teaching, and the blockade policy was once more used. The various hsiens along the Miao border were heavily garrisoned for protection.' <sup id="cite_ref-427" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-427">[427]</a></sup> 'At that time in addition to stationing heavy complements of soldiers in the Miao area, there were also put up a total of 1,121 stone guard houses /tiao ch'ia/ along the ruins of the wall left from the Ming dynasty. In addition to the stationing of government troops at important positions, there were more than 800 of these guard houses where 9,000 soldiers were left to protect the border. Later when the nation became short of money, it was not possible to maintain large forces in this deep interior area for defense. Thus, suddenly, the frontier guards were withdrawn, then the stone guard houses became [Page 170] 115 cont. empty, and there was fear that the fierce Miao would start a rebellion. At this time Fu Nai of Yüan-ch'en tao met with Brigade General Fu Chih-na of Chen-kan Chen and summoned together people of the sub-prefecture to discuss a long-range plan. And so they began the t'un system of defense. Fields were allotted to feed the fighters and to defend the guard houses against the Miao. As for the people's /i.e. Chinese/ land, except for fields for sustenance, a male could retain three tou of grain, a woman one tou. As for the rest of the land seven were allotted while three were retained, for one shih of grain three tou was personally retained, and seven tou given up for allotment, to feed the fighters and guard the frontier. In the Feng-huang area there were more than 830 stone guard houses, requiring 4,000 men to man them in rotation. Further, 1,000 men were trained to be combat ready. The more than 22,000 mu of land allotted were not enough to meet the expense, and so another allotment of more than 12,300 mu at Lu-ch'i and Mo-yang was made. There were also 127 stone petty military stations /tiao pao/ at Kan-chou, manned by 800 soldiers, supported by more than 2,170 mu of allotted land. The original sect of government of Yung-sui, before the Miao rebellion during the reign period of Ch'ien Lung and Chia Ch'ing, was at Wei-ch'eng, which was entirely surrounded by the Miao. In the second year of Chia Ch'ing /1797/, the seat of government was moved to Hua-yüan with a newly built yamen. There were 126 stone guard houses with 2,000 soldiers. The people's land, i.e. Chinese land, usurped by rebels and recovered for public use, totaled more than 17,110 mu. There were over 70 stone military stations /tiao pao/, at Pao-ching, with 300 soldiers and over 2,170 mu of allotted land. There were only 18 stone guard houses at Ku-chang-p'ing with a hundred soldiers and over 120 mu of allotted land.' <sup id="cite_ref-428" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-428">[428]</a></sup> 'The above refers to Chinese t'un /min t'un/. In addition, there were also Miao t'un. After the suppression of the Miao rebellion, the Miao tribes, awed by military might, surrendered all the Chinese land formerly forcefully usurped by them, and [Page 171] 115 cont. also searched into the properties of the rebel Miao and decided to return them for public use. The forcefully usurped land totaling over 30,100 mu and the rebels' properties totaling over 5,400 mu were redistributed among the law-abiding Miao to farm. Granaries were built to collect rent /tsu/ for the maintenance of Miao soldiers. The pressing for rent, the inspecting of fields, the distribution and transportation of grain, and other duties were all the responsibility of Miao officials.' <sup id="cite_ref-429" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-429">[429]</a></sup> 'The total of the above fields and land is 131,640.6 mu. In the thirteenth year of Chia Ch'ing /1808/ a total of 15,219.3 mu of fields and land was surveyed in the three hsien, Feng-huang, Kan-chou, and Yung-sui. In the sixteenth year of Chia Ch'ing /1811/ another total of 5,873.2 mu of fields and land was surveyed, totaling 152,157.1 mu of fields and land. Of this besides the land allocated to the army for horses and farming, land lost through floods and erosion, and also the land used for stone guard houses and surroundings, totaling 11,084.3 mu, and another 37,849 mu distributed among the t'un able-bodied males, leaders, the aged, and the young, there remained 103,223.8 mu. Farmers were recruited to farm this land and rent /in kind/ collected. The annual receipt in grain totaled 105,488 shih, three tou, and nine sheng.' <sup id="cite_ref-430" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-430">[430]</a></sup> 'The t'un fields in the Miao frontier were divided into people's /i.e. Chinese/ t'uns and Miao t'uns, the two being entirely different in nature. The t'un males working on the Chinese t'uns were also divided into t'un men and fighting men. The t'un men received fields to cultivate, and guarded the t'un guard houses. The fighting men, also called home guards, were solely trained for military operations, and did not farm. In the five sub-prefectures and hsiens of the Miao frontier there are 7,000 t'un men, from among whom are appointed hsiao-ch'i, tsung-ch'i, and pe-tsung to facilitate control. The distribution of fields was as follows: the men /san ting/ are each given 4.5 mu; the hsiao-ch'i, 5.5 mu; the tsung-ch'i, 6.5 mu; and the pe-tsung, 7.5 mu. There are 1,000 fighting men, each being given 3 shih, 6 tou of rice per year. The non-fighting men are also each given annually 10.8 liang of silver for salt and vegetables. The hsiao-ch'i receives each year 12 liang of silver; the tsung-ch'i, 13.2 liang of silver; the pe-tsung, 16.8 liang of silver. Therefore, in the Chinese t'un, the fields and land left over after the t'un men have received their fields to plant and care for are leased out for the collection of rent. Granaries (Illus. 57) have been built to store the grain, and general t'un leaders are set up to manage these matters. There are no t'un men in the Miao t'uns, and the t'un fields are allotted to people to cultivate /Illus. 57 and 58 on pages 124 and 125/ 126 for the collection of rent, in order to feed the Miao soldiers, under the control of the Miao officials. The t'un fields in the Miao frontier region, at the inception of the system, totaled 150,000 mu of arable land, of which barely a third was directly cultivated by t'un personnel, the rest being allotted out as rented fields. Today, the t'un army in the Miao frontier region is about 1,000 strong. The maintainance of the Black Flag Battalion of the Miao troops (Illus. 58) largely comes from the rented fields. T'un fields were set up to support troops on the spot as a defense against the Miao. Today, the Miao have been largely acculturated by the Chinese and the boundary line between the Miao and the Chinese is gradually becoming [Page 183] 124 [Page 185] 126 cont. obliterated. There is no longer the need for this kind of system of t'un defense against the Miao. In fact, unrest in the Miao area today is often due to the maladministration of the t'un fields system. The Miao petty officers and the t'un leaders often are oppressive in collecting rent and sometimes are corrupt in their methods, thus causing dissatisfaction and disturbances. In the twenty-sixth year of the Republic /1937/ the Miao rebellion in western Hunan arose because of the t'un land system. It resulted in the burning of t'un granaries and killing of t'un officers. Although the rebellion was pacified only after bloody and expensive campaigns, it is imperative to change the t'un and enter the newly opened or reclaimed land as available for taxation, so as to reach a fundamental solution.' <sup id="cite_ref-431" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-431">[431]</a></sup>

</p><p><b>♠ Local-level administrators ♣ present ♥</b> eHRAF provides a general description of the administrative history of the region: 'Chinese scholarship links the present-day Miao to tribal confederations that moved southward some 2,000 years ago from the plain between the Yellow River and the Yangtze toward the Dongting Lake area. These became the San Miao mentioned in Han dynasty texts. Over the next thousand years, between the Han and the Song dynasties, these presumed ancestors of the Miao continued to migrate westward and southward, under pressure from expanding Han populations and the imperial armies. Chinese texts and Miao oral history establish that over those years the ancestors settled in western Hunan and Guizhou, with some moving south into Guangxi or west along the Wu River to southeastern Sichuan and into Yunnan. The period was marked by a number of uprisings and battles between Miao and the Han or local indigenous groups, recalled in the oral histories of local groups. Though the term "Miao" was sometimes used in Tang and Song histories, the more usual term was "Man," meaning "barbarians." Migration continued through the Yuan, Ming, and early Qing, with some groups moving into mainland Southeast Asia. The retreat from Han control brought some into territories controlled by the Yi in northeast Yunnan/northwest Guizhou. The various migrations can also be seen as "vertical" migrations into the undeveloped hillside and mountain areas that were of lesser interest to Han. Depending on the terrain, the settled farming cited in Miao historical myths gave way to shifting slash-and-burn agriculture, facilitated by the introduction of the Irish potato and maize in the sixteenth century, and the adoption of high-altitude/cool-weather crops like barley, buckwheat, and oats. Farming was supplemented by forest hunting, fishing, gathering, and pastoralism. During the Qing, uprisings and military encounters escalated. There were major disturbances in western Hunan (1795-1806) and a continuous series of rebellions in Guizhou (1854-1872). Chinese policies toward the Miao shifted among assimilation, containment in "stockaded villages," dispersal, removal, and extermination. The frequent threat of "Miao rebellion" caused considerable anxiety to the state; in actuality, many of these uprisings included Bouyei, Dong, Hui, and other ethnic groups, including Han settlers and demobilized soldiers. At issue were heavy taxation, rising landlordism, rivalries over local resources, and official corruption. One of the last Miao uprisings occurred in 1936 in western Hunan in opposition to Guomindang (Republican) continuation of the tuntian   system, which forced the peasants to open up new lands and grow crops for the state.' <sup id="cite_ref-438" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-438">[438]</a></sup> 'From Song on, in periods of relative peace, government control was exercised through the tusi   system of indirect rule by appointed native headmen who collected taxes, organized corvée, and kept the peace. Miao filled this role in Hunan and eastern Guizhou, but farther west the rulers were often drawn from a hereditary Yi nobility, a system that lasted into the twentieth century. In Guizhou, some tusi   claimed Han ancestry, but were probably drawn from the ranks of assimilated Bouyei, Dong, and Miao. Government documents refer to the "Sheng Miao" (raw Miao), meaning those living in areas beyond government control and not paying taxes or labor service to the state. In the sixteenth century, in the more pacified areas, the implementation of the policy of gaitu guiliu   began the replacement of native rulers with regular civilian and military officials, a few of whom were drawn from assimilated minority families. Land became a commodity, creating both landlords and some freeholding peasants in the areas affected. In the Yunnan-Guizhou border area, the tusi   system continued and Miao purchase of land and participation in local markets was restricted by law until the Republican period (1911-1949).' <sup id="cite_ref-439" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-439">[439]</a></sup> The region has a long history of Chinese military intervention: 'The two regions referred to above can be demarcated by the ruins of the boundary wall erected under the Ming dynasty. Miao Fang-pei Lan, Shu Wang Lu /Detailed Old Records from the M.F.L./, states: “In the forty-third year of the Wan Li reign period (1615 A.D.) the Ping-pei Ts'an-cheng /Administrative Officer of Military Preparedness/ at Ch'en and Yüan rivers, Ts'ai Fu-i, reported that because the garrison outposts were so scattered and the Miao roads so rugged, it was difficult to defend against Miao incursions. He requested the appropriation of some 40,000 in gold currency for the erection of an earth wall, from T'ung-jen down to Pao-ch'ing, winding along the mountains and the streams for more than 300 li. Thus the border was made relatively secure. Again, during the second year of T'ien Chi (1622 A.D.), the assistant commissioner of the circuit of the garrison at Ch'en and Yüan rivers, Hu I-hung ordered Teng Tsuyü, a guerrila commander, to add another 60 li of wall from Chen-ch'i-so to Hsi-ch'üeh-ying.” The ruins of this wall start from Wang-hui-ying and T'ing-tzu-kuan in the southeast corner of the Miao area and proceeds northeast, ending at Hsi-ch'üeh-ying, dividing the Miao area into the southeast and the northwest regions. The building of the boundary wall under the Ming dynasty was not intentionally based on the topography but rather in accordance with the limits of Chinese colonization in the Miao area. The Chinese first occupied the region where the rivers flowed down in the southeast, and the Miao retreated to the La-erh plateau, defending themselves behind its natural advantages. The Chinese and the Miao were already divided according to topography (Illus. 2, 8) some 300 years ago. The frontier wall of that time, although serving as a boundary line between the Chinese and the Miao, became at the same time a [Page 54] 30 cont. line of demarcation between the two natural regions. So today the actual area of the Miao is northwest of the boundary wall, limited to the La-erh plateau. Although the Miao area is not a barren wilderness, the area is small and densely populated, with a high birth rate leading to population pressure, which has led the Miao to invade the southeastern region. Therefore, whenever there is a Miao rebellion, the whole area /Illus. 7 on p. 31/ 32 is occupied by them. The territorial limits designated by Yen Ju-yü as the Miao area is not entirely without reason. The Miao regard this area as their native land, and they seldom exceed its limits even in time of strife.' <sup id="cite_ref-440" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-440">[440]</a></sup> 'The development of the Miao area began during the time of the juncture of the Yuan dynasty and the Ming. The geographical section of the Ming Shih /History of the Ming Dynasty/ states: “A ch'ang kuan szu /a native leader set up by the Chinese government to head the district/ was established at Wu-chai during the Yuan dynasty, and in the sixth month of the seventh year of Hung Wu /1374, during the first reign period of the Ming dynasty/ the office was continued. A ch'ang kuan szu was set up at Kan-tzu-p'ing in the sixth month of the year chia ch'en of the first Ming emperor /1359/, at the headquarters of the commander-in-chief at Kan-tzu-p'ing. Later it was abolished. In the seventh month of the third year of the Yung Lo /1405/, it was reestablished.” Furthermore, the entry for Headman Hu Kuang in the “T'u szu Lieh Chuan” /Biographies of Headmen/ states: “In the third year of Yung Lo, Kung Neng and others at the Ch'en-chou military station summoned Liao Piao and others of the uncivilized Miao /i. e. those not under Chinese control/ from 35 villages of Kan-tzu-p'ing to send sons to pay tribute, and for this reason a ch'ang kuan szu was set up for Kan-tzu-p'ing, with Piao to be the official, under the jurisdiction of Pao-ching.” The city of the ch'ang kuan szu of Wu-chai was the present chief city of Feng-huang hsien, but that of Kan-tzu-p'ing was also within Feng-huang, situated 70 li northeast of the chief town of the hsien. In Vol. 3 of the revised edition of Feng-huang T'ing Chih, published in the fourth year of Tao Kuang /1824/, it says: “The old city of the ch'ang kuan szu of Kan-tzu-p'ing was situated 70 li northeast of the T'ing. In the first year of the first Ming emperor /1368/, a yüan-shuai-fu /commander-in-chief's post/ was set up. In the third year of Yung Lo /i. e. [Page 149] 104 cont. 1405/ it was changed to ch'ang kuan szu, with two city seats, one on the mountain top and another at the foot of the mountain. Today they have been abolished. The old city of the Wu-chai ch'ang kuan szu is the present seat of the T'ing /i.e. Feng-huang sub-prefecture/ administration, but it has been greatly expanded. During the Ming period all was under the jurisdiction of the Pacification Commissioner at Pao-ching.”' <sup id="cite_ref-441" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-441">[441]</a></sup> 'Kan Ch'eng was opened somewhat later, when at the end of the Hung Wu reign period /1368-98/ a ch'ien hu suo /a ch'ien hu was an official at a military station, in charge of 1,000 soldiers; suo = office or bureau/ was established. The “Shu Wang P'ien” /historical section/ of the Miao Fang Pei Lan states: “In the second month of the thirtieth year of Hung Wu /1397/ there was set up at Chen-ch'i a military and civilian ch'ien hu bureau. Sun Ying-lung, who was then keeper of the records at Lu-ch'i, proclaimed that the tribal people of the upper five tu /hsien subdivisions/ should be divided into ten li /neighborhoods/, to be under the jurisdiction of Ch'en-chou. Ying-lung was promoted by imperial mandate to be in charge of the pacification. He selected the head ch'ien hu in charge of the ch'ien hu bureau at Chien-ch'ang, Kiangsi, to go to the capital to be given a bronze seal and given the hereditary office of ch'ien hu of Chen-ch'i. When the emperor went to the pavilion to send him on his way, he proclaimed: ‘I have a single pellet of Miao territory, and I ask you to go ahead to open up headquarters for bringing the barbarians under our administration. Do what is good for them, and your descendants will enjoy the use /of the office/ without limit.’ Moreover, he ordered the Board of War to select Ch'en Ya of Wu-sa military station in Kweichow and Sung Kuei of Lu-chou military station in Szechwan to be assistnat ch'ien hu to go with him to assist him. He ordered the Board of Civil Office to select a head constable, and the provincial treasurer to allot for district police officers, who were granted, wrapped up an ivory tablet, paper money, and a silver belt, and entertained ceremoniously, and sent on their way. In the fifth [Page 150] 104 cont. month Tuan Wen reached Chen-ch'i, established the Military Station Office, and inaugurated the system, dividing 124 native villages into ten li, making Yang Erh, the main leader, a pe fu ch'ang /head of hundred men/. The other 132 villages 105 became a local army ‘to protect the city moats.’ When there were uprisings then they would be called to service; when conditions were peaceful then they would disperse as civilians. Hence the name, Military and Civilian Office” Chen-ch'i then is modern Suo-li, which is 20 li northeast of Kan-ch'eng hsien's main city.' <sup id="cite_ref-442" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-442">[442]</a></sup> 'Yung-sui was formerly under the jurisdiction of the native headman of Pao-ching, and Liu-li in it was also under the jurisdiction of Kan-chou.

But because of using an administrative policy of blockade against Miao country, the 270 years under the Ming [Page 166] 113 cont. did not witness serious trouble. The method of this blockade consisted of setting up stone guard posts /tiao-pao/, establishing guard stations /ying shao/, and building border walls, strictly demarcating the boundary between the Chinese and Miao areas, without allowing any infringement by one on the other. The section on government in the historical section of Miao Fang Pei Lan, recording the system of defense against the Miao during the Ming dynasty, has this to say: “During the fifth year of Hsüan Te i.e. 1430, the senior official /chang kuan/ at Kan-tzu-p'ing, Wu Pi-lang, and the Miao of Tung-jen, Kweichow, started a rebellion. The brigadier general /tsung ping kuan/, Hsiao Shou, built 24 guard posts /pao/ around the area to protect it. In the thirty-first year of Chia Ching i.e. 1552, the Miao in Hupeh-Hunan and Kweichow were pacified. The Court sent Governor General Chang Yo to hold down Yüanchou. Yo in consultation with Assistant Commissioner /fu shih/ Kao Hsien, and Lieutenant Colonel /ts'an chiang/ Sun Hsien drew up a plan to abolish the guard posts at Wan-chi. Then he built 12 outposts /shao/ called: Wu-chai, Yung-an, Ch'ing-ch'i, Ho-k'ou, Kan-tzu, Kan-chou, Ch'iang-hu, Shih-yang, Shao-p'o, Tung-hsin, Shui-t'ang-yao, Shui-t'ien-ying, which with that at Chen-ch'i-so came to 13 in all. Every guard station had a wall, a tower, a drill yard, a narrow gate, an office, and a community storehouse /she ts'ang/. The officer corps included a tu-pei /“head of senior soldiers”/, ling-pan /“section leader”/, ling-tui /“company leader”/, ling-cheng /“recruitment and arms officer?”/, kuan-piao /“keeper of banners”/, kuan-ts'ang /“keeper of the storehouse”/, and li-mu /“head constable and keeper of the jail”/. The local official had under him t'ou-mu /“headmen”/, she-jen /“official secretaries”/, shih-tzu /“readers”/, chien-pu /“strong walkers”/, ta-shou /?lit., “move the hands”/ hsiang-t'u /?lit., geographers”/, po-k'ai /heralds/, and the Ch'i Miao soldiers. In all the officers and men totaled 6, 000 or more, commanded by a lieutenant colonel /ts'an-chiang piao ying/, with a second [Page 167] 113 cont. captain /shou-pei/ assisting him. Moreover, at the two military stations /wei/ of Ch'en and Yüan, the frontier guard officers and men, amounted to 6,600 or more, and the annual disbursement to the Yüan-chou treasury for paying the troops was more than 30,089 /sic/ liang of silver, that to the Ma-yang, Ch'ienyang, and Kan-chou military rations granaries and the autumn government rations at Chen-ch'i-so were 31,890 or more. At this time, the lieutenant colonel /tsan-chiang Tu-ling/ directed matters at the top, the majors /yu-chi/ and second captains /shou-pei/ attended to things at the middle level, and the guard stations /ying-shao/ carried out defense duties at the lower level. Furthermore, fearing the difficulty of communications in times of trouble, it was arranged for the sake of convenience as follows: ‘For operations involving under 3,000 men, decisions may be made on the spot, but for operations involving more than 3,000 men, the decision must be made after consultation with the military defense officials. As the number of soldiers increased and generals became more strong, the border regions became more quiet and peaceful. In the forty-third year Wan Li /i.e. 1615/, the Military Defense Ts'an Cheng, Ts'ai Fu-i, because the guard stations being spread out and the Miao roads rugged, it was difficult to prevent spying, applied for an appropriation of 40,000 or more gold for the construction of a frontier earth wall, starting from T'ung-jen and going down to Pao-ching guard station, along mountains and extending in all more than 300 li, so that frontier defense could be made somewhat more 114 secure. In the second year of T'ien Ch'i /i.e. 1622/, a provincial governor was set up at P'ien-yüan…. The then pei tao fu shih /assistant commissioner of defense?/ Hu I-hung at Ch'en Yüan despatched Major Teng Tsu-yü from Chen-ch'i-so to Hsi-ch'üeh-ying to build an additional 60 more li of frontier wall.”' <sup id="cite_ref-446" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-446">[446]</a></sup> In the Qing period, Hmong migrations occurred after a number of failed rebellions, affecting the geographical distribution of individual Hmong sub-groups: 'The pure Miao tribe in Kweichow is further divided into five subgroups, the Hung Miao, the He Miao, the Pe Miao, the Ch'ing Miao, and the Hua Miao. The geographical distribution of the Hung Miao is along the eastern part of Kweichow bordering Hunan and the vicinity of T'ung-jen is the center. The He Miao are spread over a wide area in southeastern Kweichow, including such hisen as Tu-yün, Pa-chai, Tan-chiang, Yung-chiang, Yung-ts'ung, Li-p'ing, Chien-ho, T'ai-kung, Chen-yüan, Shih-ping, Huang-p'ing, Lu-shan, etc. It lies in the region south of the Hunan-Kweichow highway and east of the Kwangsi-Kweichow highway. The Pe Miao are found in the central part of Kweichow, starting in the east at Kwei-ting and Lung-li, passing through Kwei-chu, Hsiu-wen, and Ch'ien-hsi, and reaching Chih-chin and Lang-tai in the west. The Ch'ing Miao are also found in central Kweichow, principally in the vicinity of Kuei-yang, but also at Hsiu-wen, Ch'ing-chen, Ch'ien-hsi, and Chen-ning. The distribution of Hua Miao is the most extensive, starting from the vicinity of Kuei-yang, scattering over the northern and northwestern parts of Kweichow province in K'ai-yang, Jen-huai, Chih-chin, Lang-tai, Shui-ch'eng, and An-shun hsiens.' <sup id="cite_ref-447" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-447">[447]</a></sup> 'Owing to repeated military attacks during the Yüan and Ming periods, many of the Miao tribes in Kweichow moved outward. The Hung Miao who lived in the vicinity of Tung-jen in eastern Kweichow moved eastward to the three sub-prefectures /t'ing/ of western Hunan. During the four rebellions in the Ch'ing dynasty, in 1698, 1732, 1794, and 1855, when armies were used to put them down, the Miao fled in all [Page 34] 18 cont. directions, which led to the mass migration of Miao tribes in modern times. The He Miao gradually migrated to Hunan and Kwangsi. The Pe Miao moved from the northwest to Szechwan and Yunnan. The Hua Miao moved through An-shun in the west to the eastern part of Yunnan and north to Wu-ting and along the banks of the Chin-sha-chiang River, and again through the southeastern part of Yunnan to the north of Tonkin in Indochina. The Ch'ing Miao dispersed in all directions in the three provinces of Hunan, Kwangsi, and Yunnan. The foregoing relates to the major migratory trends of the Miao, but actually in the interior of Hunan, Kwangsi, Szechwan, and Yunnan several Miao subgroups are often found in one area. The writers found three subgroups at Meng-tzu, Yunnan, the Pe Miao, the Hua Miao, and the Ch'ing Miao, but the last two were not easily distinguishable from their dress. Furthermore, several groups inhabiting the same area are likely to intermarry so that after a considerable length of time has passed, it is difficult to distinguish between them.' <sup id="cite_ref-448" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-448">[448]</a></sup> 'Topography. (Illus. 2). - Topographically, the Miao area may be divided into two natural regions. The northwestern section can be called the La-erh plateau region; the southeastern section is the region where the rivers flow down. Although the plateau rises about 700 kung ch'ih above sea level, on it there are a great many small basins, with many springs and ponds good for irrigation. The Miao call such small basins p'ing /a plain/, t'ang /a pond/, or ch'ung. The best known among these is the Pao-mu-ying-p'ing, about 70 li north 30 of Feng-huang-ch'eng /city/. Surrounded by mountains, this level area measures five to six li in length and three to four li in width and has seven or eight spring-fed ponds, supplying ample drinking water. It is the largest basin on the plateau. Ya-pao-chai (Illus. 7), situated in the Ya-pao-shan mountains, about 93 li north of Feng-huang-ch'eng, is very high and cold. It has several fish ponds and produces rough rice and yams. In 1795, when the Miao revolted, the headman, Wu Lung-teng, whose family had lived there for generations, was entrenched there. The above two places are the largest among the basins on the plateau. There are countless small basins /p'ing and ch'ung/. There are numerous wells and springs in the mountains, wells being found even on the peaks. The “Yao K'ao” section of the Miao Fang-pei Lan states: “Fifty li southwest outside the city is Ma-an Shan /“Horse Saddle Mountain”/, which is about eight or nine li in height, is very steep, and resembles a horse saddle in shape. On top of the mountain there is a well that never goes dry. On the mountain there are pockets where there are irrigated rice fields. It is a strategic point for the uncivilized Miao to defend.” The La-erh plateau is dotted with Miao villages and settlements because of its level places /p'ing/ and wells and springs, and there the Miao people thrive.' <sup id="cite_ref-449" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-449">[449]</a></sup> Imperial control shifted from indirect rule to government by appointed Chinese officials before a mixed system was established after a Hmong rebellion: 'After the five hsien in the Miao frontier region were opened, from the Yuan and Ming dynasties to the beginning of the Ch'ing dynasty, they were under the control of native headmen. During the K'ang Hsi reign period of the early Ch'ing /1662-1722/, a gradual change was begun from native headmen to regular government officials. In the forty-sixth year of K'ang Hsi /1707/, the senior official /ch'ang kuan szu/ at Wu-chai, T'ien Hung-t'ien, being harsh and cruel, the provincial governor, Chao Shen-ch'iao, sent up a memorial [Page 151] 105 cont. to the Emperor requesting that he be dismissed from office and that no hereditary substitute be allowed. In the forty-eighth year /1709/, because the Miao at Liu-li of the Chen-ch'i Office did not wish to be under the control of the native headman at Pao-ching, they repeatedly requested the change from native headman to government official, and the provincial governor, Chao Shen-ch'iao, again sent up a memorial requesting transference of control to the government. In the fourth year of Yung Cheng /1726/, the headman at Pao-ching, P'eng, Yü-pin, was removed from office for being avaricious and cruel, and in the fifth year the change was made from native headman to government official. Yü-pin was peacefully settled at Liao-yang. In the fifth year of Yung Cheng, the headman at Yung-shun, P'eng Chao-huai, personally applied for the change from native headman to government official. He returned to his native place in Chi-shui, Kiangsi. San-t'u-chou /“three local chou”/ and Wu-ch'ang-kuan-szu /“five senior officials”/ under the jurisdiction of the headman of Yung-shun were also changed from native to government officials.' <sup id="cite_ref-450" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-450">[450]</a></sup> 'After the voluntary change from the native headmen in the Miao frontier region, in each Miao village there was set up a local village chief over 100 families /i.e., a pe hu chai ch'ang, “100 families village chief”/, in order to govern the Miao and bring them under the administration of government officials. But the chiefs of the 100 families were not always Miao, sometimes Chinese being appointed to these positions. As time passed, gradually, there were rapacious, unscrupulous rogues, whose mistreatment caused disturbances, so that the unprecedented Miao rebellion took place during the sixtieth year of Ch'ien Lung /1795/. When the Miao rebellion was put down in the first year of Chia Ch'ing /1796/, it was found that the policy of governing the Miao with Chinese was wrong. The then governor-general of Hunan and Kwangtung, Pi Yüan, submitted a plan to govern the Miao with Miao. (6) The ministry's response to the memorial setting up regulations for Miao officials, Miao Chiang Chin-106 Yao Shan-Hou Shih I /Important Remedial Measures for the Miao Frontier Region/, has a passage, “Miao Chiang Pe Hu Chai Ch'ang Ming-Mu Ying Cho Liang Keng Ting /The Names of the Village Leaders of 100 Families Should be Decided after Due Deliberation/,” stating: “According to the memorial, in the three provinces of Szechwan, Kweichow, and Hupeh, such areas as Yu-yang and T'ung-jen were all previously governed by headmen, but following their application to be put under government officials, the administrative areas of chou, hsien, and ying [Page 153] 106 cont. were established, subject to the jurisdiction of civil and military authorities. In the Miao villages, there were established only village chiefs to govern a unit of 100 families. However, since Chinese were also permitted to fill these posts, gradually there were rapacious, unscrupulous rogues, whose mistreatment caused disturbances. It is requested that from among the Miao who have submitted, and on whom were conferred the peacock feather decoration /for merit, in early Ch'ing times/, there be selected some intelligent, aware persons, to be appointed at each ying /military station/ as native second captain /shoupei/, lieutenant /ch'ien-tsung/, and sergeant or corporal /wai-wei/, such positions to be filled through the governor-general and governor's /tu-wu/ yamen /tu-wu ya-men/ and to be subject to the control of the civil and military authorities. When the various t'ang hsin in the Miao area have official despatches to send, they can order the said native petty officers to select Miao to question and send, and also to give them some cash and rations. When officials traveling on official business require servants, they may also recruit them from the Miao, and pay them wages according to the Chinese scales. It would appear that the 100-families village chief was originally inaugurated to discipline the Miao, but these men were unimportant and their powers limited, as that the Miao did not heed them. Moreover, among the Chinese holding such positions there were rapacious, unscrupulous rogues, whose mistreatment led to disturbances. This should naturally be explained, deliberated, and changed, so as to fix responsibility. During the recent campaign those submissive Miao who accompanied the army and won peacock feather awards are numerous, therefore from these select those who are intelligent and aware, and who have the support of the rest, and according to the customary set-up of t'u-kuan /officials governing aboriginal tribes in West China/, every Ying should have one or two men to be native second captains, under whom there should be native lieutenants and sergeants, for better control of [Page 154] 106 cont. the Miao. Their number will depend upon the number of villages put under control, and they shall be appointed by the governor-general and governor's yamen and also be under the control of regional officials. If there are fights, robberies and thefts among the Miao these native officers will be asked to make the arrests. On their inspection tours, the governor-general and governor and military officials should examine the merits and demerits of these officers and reward or punish them accordingly to demonstrate justice, following the recommendations memorialized by Governor-general Ho Lin. When the t'ang-hsin system of communication in the Miao area has been abolished, official communications should be despatched according to old methods so as to avoid delay. In the regions where the t'ang-hsin system exists as before, the local officials /t'u kuan/ should be asked to pick out honest Miao to be given the responsibility of delivering messages after being questioned, to be paid wages and rations from unallotted funds, according to the scale for t'un soldiers. When officials traveling on official business need servants, then order the said Miao to serve, and pay them wages according to recommendations memorialized.” ' <sup id="cite_ref-451" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-451">[451]</a></sup> 'According to the despatch quoted above the Miao officials, although they were military officers such as the native shou-pei and ch'ien-tsung, aside from their jurisdiction over the Miao soldiers, were also given considerable authority in Miao civilian affairs. In the tenth year of Chia Ch'ing /1805/ 107 the t'un land within the Miao area were placed under the control of Miao officials. Article 8 of Pu Fu T'un t'ien Chang-ch'eng /The Ministry's Reply concerning Regulations about the T'un Land/ states: “It would seem that after the Miao rebels were pacified in the present year in the various localities of Yung-sui, [Page 155] 107 cont. the Miao were greatly impressed by the strength of the Imperial army and surrendered land previously forcefully occupied by them. Also it would seem that if there was property of refractory Miao; it was confiscated. The fields were distributed among the law-abiding Miao to plant and pay rent, so that a Miao army could be raised and supported. Now the usurped land surrendered in the various villages totals more than 30,100 mu, and the land confiscated from the property of the rebel Miao totals more than 5,040 mu. These are now being separately registered, distributed for tilling for rent, and the revenues derived therefrom should be able to support 5,000 Miao soldiers. Among the 9,900 native Miao soldiers discharged over time and remaining, those able to bring up a plan to make a living have been sent back to their villages, and those who are old, weak, and poor have been given fields to till. Now 5,000 strong and healthy Miao soldiers have been selected, 2,000 of whom come from Feng-huang sub-prefecture; 800, from Kan-chou sub-prefecture; 1,800 from Yung-sui sub-prefecture; 100, from Ku-chang-p'ing sub-prefecture; and 300, from Pao-ching hsien. To collect the grain given over as rent, the Miao petty officers have selected in the various villages spots for building granaries to store away the public grain. Two or three honest Miao officers are chosen for each granary to supervise receipts and disbursements of the grain. The said 35,000 mu of arable land is estimated to be capable of yielding more than 22,000 shih of seeds of grain. It is estimated that there remain in various Miao granaries about 40 shih of seeds of grain, which will be used to fill the need for rations for the Miao soldiers in the intercalary month. The Miao officers are still ordered to report the actual receipts of rent grain every year.” ' <sup id="cite_ref-452" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-452">[452]</a></sup> Ling et al describe the appointment of Miao petty officials in that time period: 'Thus a Miao official was a military official having concurrent judicial and financial duties, whose power actually was equivalent to that of a t'u-szu /headman/. The only difference was that the position was not hereditary. As for the procedure of appointment, according to a reply from the Board of War in the twenty-eighth year of Tao Kuang /1848/, Miao Pei P'ieh Chi Ta /?/ Chang-ch'eng /Regulations concerning the Commissioning of Petty Officers of Miao Defense/, it is stated: “The 486 Miao officers in the five sub-prefectures and hsien of Ku-chang-p'ing, consisting of shou-pei, ch'ien-tsung, pa-tsung, and wai-wei, were recommended by the sub-prefectures and hsien to Ch'en-yüan tao for approval, and then commissioned with official seals by the governor-general, governor, and provincial commander-in-chief. According to the regulations for the promotion of Miao t'un officers, a pa-tsung is considered by the tao and then appointed by the Board; the wai-wei is appointed directly by the tao, and when the pa-tsung becomes due for promotion to ch'ien-tsung, his commission must be confirmed by the governor-general and governor, and when the ch'ien-tsung is promoted to shou-pei, his record must be examined by the commander-in-chief. Today, in the appointment of Miao petty officers, even wai-wei have to be commissioned by the governor-general and governor, hence there is a great deal of red tape involved. It is recommended that the Miao defense petty officers can be selected according to the regulations governing the t'un petty officers of the tao troups /piao, “banner”/. Hereafter the Miao wai-wei and pa-tsung are to be changed to be appointed by the tao, the Miao ch'ien-tsung to be appointed by the provincial governor with official seal, and the shou-pei to be appointed by the governor-general. The Board of War has found that the previous procedure of appointing Miao officials, through joint deliberation of the provincial governorgeneral, governor, and commander-in-chief is 108 too involved, [Page 157] 108 cont. and in order to simplify it the recommendations in the memorial of the said governor-general should be followed.” From this it may be seen that in the beginning, the appointment of a Miao official was regarded as a serious matter. A petty officer such as a wai wei had to be commissioned by the governor-general and governor.' <sup id="cite_ref-453" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-453">[453]</a></sup> Administrative organization differed somewhat between the individual districts: 'With regard to the organization of Miao officials at that time, it differed somewhat in the five hsien and sub-prefectures of the Miao region. Feng-huang sub-prefecture had four ying /battalions/: the middle ying's two Miao shou-pei /second captains/, four ch'ien-tsung /lieutenants/, six pa-tsung /sergeants/, and 20 wai wei /corporals/ were in charge of 96 villagers, totaling 2,680 families, consisting of 6,230 men and 3,479 women. The left ying's two Miao shou-pei, three ch'ien-tsung, six pa-tsung, and 15 wai wei are in charge of 63 villages, totaling 2,387 families, consisting of 5,795 men and 4,673 women.

Furthermore, since the Miao dreaded seeing Chinese officials, then the Miao shou-pei, ch'ien-tsung, pa-tsung, and wai-wei were set up with the responsibility of controlling the Miao. In cases when the Miao were involved in such affairs as fights or theft, these petty officers were charged with the responsibility of apprehending the offenders. For the official despatches to be sent it was necessary to rely on them to get the messengers, and the pressing for rents and grain were also under the Miao officials' control. Moreover, the Miao petty officials were asked to submit seasonal affidavits as to whether there were Chinese entering the Miao villages.' <sup id="cite_ref-460" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-460">[460]</a></sup> 'The policy of having Miao officials to govern the Miao has been in practice now for 140 years. At the time of the original separation of the execution and administrative functions between the Chinese and the Miao, the idea of Miao regulating the Miao could be said to have been aimed at the abuses of the time. But now after a hundred and some tens of years, the Miao have gradually been sinicized. Formerly, there was the difference between the civilized and uncivilized Miao, but today they have all become civilized. The policy of separate administration for the Miao and the Chinese has been informally discarded. Consequently, the regulations for Miao officials should be abolished. But, since the Republic, the Miao officials are still able to exist, largely because Chinese officials have been profiting by taking brides for filling official posts. On the other hand, since the Miao officials get their positions through paying bribes, they go to great lengths to make extortions from the Miao people. The Miao people detest the Miao petty officials more than they do the Chinese officials. Moreover, today, the various hsien in the Miao area have been changed to the system of hsiang /villages/ and chen /towns/, each governed by a head, known as hsiang chang or chen chang, respectively. In view of this change, Miao officials have become superfluous. It is hoped that the authorities in the region will be able to do away with them soon.' <sup id="cite_ref-461" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-461">[461]</a></sup> Ling et al describe the development of the t'un system: 'During the Ts'ung Cheng reign period /1628/ /the end of the Ming dynasty/, the Miao rebelled, demolishing the guard stations and leveling the border wall. The “Great Wall” to blockade Miao country disappeared. The 7,800 guard troops /shou ping/ in the Miao area of the Ming dynasty were reduced to 1,600 men at the beginning of the Ch'ing dynasty. When the rebellion of Wu San-kwei was pacified and all was peaceful again, there was another reduction of 500 men, leaving 1,100 men. Military strengh was slight and the defense system was relaxed. Further, following the change from native headmen to Chinese officials, and the use of Chinese as the head of every hundred families, intercourse between the Chinese and the Miao was no longer prohibited. In the twenty-ninth year of Ch'ien Lung /i.e. 1764/, in view of the Miao having undergone acculturation for a long time, they were allowed to intermarry with the Chinese. The original idea was to change the Miao by teaching, but with the passing of time evils developed, when rapacious Chinese under the pretext of trade entered the Miao area and seduced crafty Miao to enter into thievery. Unlike soldiers they entered Miao country for personal reasons and mistreated the Miao. The Miao made a pretext of these guest men's exploitations and encroachments on their land and banded together to make trouble, and brought about the great rebellion during the Ch'ien Lung /1736-95/ and Chia Ch'ing /1796-1820/ reign periods. After the rebellion was put down, the Manchu court realized that the time was yet inopportune to change the Miao by teaching, and the blockade policy was once more used. The various hsiens along the Miao border were heavily garrisoned for protection.' <sup id="cite_ref-462" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-462">[462]</a></sup> 'At that time in addition to stationing heavy complements of soldiers in the Miao area, there were also put up a total of 1,121 stone guard houses /tiao ch'ia/ along the ruins of the wall left from the Ming dynasty. In addition to the stationing of government troops at important positions, there were more than 800 of these guard houses where 9,000 soldiers were left to protect the border. Later when the nation became short of money, it was not possible to maintain large forces in this deep interior area for defense. Thus, suddenly, the frontier guards were withdrawn, then the stone guard houses became [Page 170] 115 cont. empty, and there was fear that the fierce Miao would start a rebellion. At this time Fu Nai of Yüan-ch'en tao met with Brigade General Fu Chih-na of Chen-kan Chen and summoned together people of the sub-prefecture to discuss a long-range plan. And so they began the t'un system of defense. Fields were allotted to feed the fighters and to defend the guard houses against the Miao. As for the people's /i.e. Chinese/ land, except for fields for sustenance, a male could retain three tou of grain, a woman one tou. As for the rest of the land seven were allotted while three were retained, for one shih of grain three tou was personally retained, and seven tou given up for allotment, to feed the fighters and guard the frontier. In the Feng-huang area there were more than 830 stone guard houses, requiring 4,000 men to man them in rotation. Further, 1,000 men were trained to be combat ready. The more than 22,000 mu of land allotted were not enough to meet the expense, and so another allotment of more than 12,300 mu at Lu-ch'i and Mo-yang was made. There were also 127 stone petty military stations /tiao pao/ at Kan-chou, manned by 800 soldiers, supported by more than 2,170 mu of allotted land. The original sect of government of Yung-sui, before the Miao rebellion during the reign period of Ch'ien Lung and Chia Ch'ing, was at Wei-ch'eng, which was entirely surrounded by the Miao. In the second year of Chia Ch'ing /1797/, the seat of government was moved to Hua-yüan with a newly built yamen. There were 126 stone guard houses with 2,000 soldiers. The people's land, i.e. Chinese land, usurped by rebels and recovered for public use, totaled more than 17,110 mu. There were over 70 stone military stations /tiao pao/, at Pao-ching, with 300 soldiers and over 2,170 mu of allotted land. There were only 18 stone guard houses at Ku-chang-p'ing with a hundred soldiers and over 120 mu of allotted land.' <sup id="cite_ref-463" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-463">[463]</a></sup> 'The above refers to Chinese t'un /min t'un/. In addition, there were also Miao t'un. After the suppression of the Miao rebellion, the Miao tribes, awed by military might, surrendered all the Chinese land formerly forcefully usurped by them, and [Page 171] 115 cont. also searched into the properties of the rebel Miao and decided to return them for public use. The forcefully usurped land totaling over 30,100 mu and the rebels' properties totaling over 5,400 mu were redistributed among the law-abiding Miao to farm. Granaries were built to collect rent /tsu/ for the maintenance of Miao soldiers. The pressing for rent, the inspecting of fields, the distribution and transportation of grain, and other duties were all the responsibility of Miao officials.' <sup id="cite_ref-464" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-464">[464]</a></sup> 'The total of the above fields and land is 131,640.6 mu. In the thirteenth year of Chia Ch'ing /1808/ a total of 15,219.3 mu of fields and land was surveyed in the three hsien, Feng-huang, Kan-chou, and Yung-sui. In the sixteenth year of Chia Ch'ing /1811/ another total of 5,873.2 mu of fields and land was surveyed, totaling 152,157.1 mu of fields and land. Of this besides the land allocated to the army for horses and farming, land lost through floods and erosion, and also the land used for stone guard houses and surroundings, totaling 11,084.3 mu, and another 37,849 mu distributed among the t'un able-bodied males, leaders, the aged, and the young, there remained 103,223.8 mu. Farmers were recruited to farm this land and rent /in kind/ collected. The annual receipt in grain totaled 105,488 shih, three tou, and nine sheng.' <sup id="cite_ref-465" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-465">[465]</a></sup> 'The t'un fields in the Miao frontier were divided into people's /i.e. Chinese/ t'uns and Miao t'uns, the two being entirely different in nature. The t'un males working on the Chinese t'uns were also divided into t'un men and fighting men. The t'un men received fields to cultivate, and guarded the t'un guard houses. The fighting men, also called home guards, were solely trained for military operations, and did not farm. In the five sub-prefectures and hsiens of the Miao frontier there are 7,000 t'un men, from among whom are appointed hsiao-ch'i, tsung-ch'i, and pe-tsung to facilitate control. The distribution of fields was as follows: the men /san ting/ are each given 4.5 mu; the hsiao-ch'i, 5.5 mu; the tsung-ch'i, 6.5 mu; and the pe-tsung, 7.5 mu. There are 1,000 fighting men, each being given 3 shih, 6 tou of rice per year. The non-fighting men are also each given annually 10.8 liang of silver for salt and vegetables. The hsiao-ch'i receives each year 12 liang of silver; the tsung-ch'i, 13.2 liang of silver; the pe-tsung, 16.8 liang of silver. Therefore, in the Chinese t'un, the fields and land left over after the t'un men have received their fields to plant and care for are leased out for the collection of rent. Granaries (Illus. 57) have been built to store the grain, and general t'un leaders are set up to manage these matters. There are no t'un men in the Miao t'uns, and the t'un fields are allotted to people to cultivate /Illus. 57 and 58 on pages 124 and 125/ 126 for the collection of rent, in order to feed the Miao soldiers, under the control of the Miao officials. The t'un fields in the Miao frontier region, at the inception of the system, totaled 150,000 mu of arable land, of which barely a third was directly cultivated by t'un personnel, the rest being allotted out as rented fields. Today, the t'un army in the Miao frontier region is about 1,000 strong. The maintainance of the Black Flag Battalion of the Miao troops (Illus. 58) largely comes from the rented fields. T'un fields were set up to support troops on the spot as a defense against the Miao. Today, the Miao have been largely acculturated by the Chinese and the boundary line between the Miao and the Chinese is gradually becoming [Page 183] 124 [Page 185] 126 cont. obliterated. There is no longer the need for this kind of system of t'un defense against the Miao. In fact, unrest in the Miao area today is often due to the maladministration of the t'un fields system. The Miao petty officers and the t'un leaders often are oppressive in collecting rent and sometimes are corrupt in their methods, thus causing dissatisfaction and disturbances. In the twenty-sixth year of the Republic /1937/ the Miao rebellion in western Hunan arose because of the t'un land system. It resulted in the burning of t'un granaries and killing of t'un officers. Although the rebellion was pacified only after bloody and expensive campaigns, it is imperative to change the t'un and enter the newly opened or reclaimed land as available for taxation, so as to reach a fundamental solution.' <sup id="cite_ref-466" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-466">[466]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Multiple legal systems ♣ ♥</b> Note: Informal Hmong customs co-existed with formal Chinese institutions. Hmong legal customs were informal and did not operate according to a written code: 'Among the Ch'uan Miao there are no written laws. The customs and habits of the group are the laws and what is customary is right. Crimes are infractions against the customs or mores of the group.' <sup id="cite_ref-467" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-467">[467]</a></sup> 'In every Sheng Miao village there is a set of rules and regulations which are voluntarily observed. In case of violation the offense is quickly adjudged by the public and an elder is invited to execute the punishment. Before it is carried out, however, he would tell the accused in a solemn manner the myths of their ancestors. Also in the case of a serious dispute the elder would summon both parties together, and first tell them the story of their ancestors before settling the dispute.  After a decision is rendered in this fashion both parties would show compliance and would not carry the case to the law courts. Although the mythology handed down from mouth to mouth does not have religious contents, it becomes a kind of prophecy to those people who hold everything pertaining to their ancestors in the highest respect. It is entirely due to this inherent respect for their ancestors that the ancestral myth is recounted before carrying out the punishment or at the time of settling a dispute. The idea is to employ the will of the ancestors to restrain the actions of their descendants. It is interesting to note that the mythology of the Sheng Miao, meant originally to inform posterity of the stories of their ancestors' life, has also assumed the corrective and preventive functions of law.' <sup id="cite_ref-468" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-468">[468]</a></sup> 'These, of course, were only a few of the disputes which arose in the village or among the whole group of Cowrie Shell Miao. Most small matters were settled among themselves. Much of the old man's time was taken up with such cases. Sometimes others of the village elders were called in for consultation. This was according to the Chinese Government system, though in effect this formed the village government, or council. If matters could not be settled by them, they were taken before the lien pao official, and, if necessary, to the hsien magistrate.' <sup id="cite_ref-469" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-469">[469]</a></sup> Disputes were handled by local headmen, sometimes through ordeals: 'The Miao are addicted to kuei and to litigation. Sometimes litigation may last a year, and the court, unable to decide the case, may ask both parties to eat blood. This serves as a deterrent. Yen Ju-yü in his Miao Fang-pei Lan says: “Those who enter the temple to drink blood move on their knees and bellies, not daring to look up; those who are in the wrong dare not drink it, but repent and yield.” In the course of our investigations in the Miao frontier area, the private secretary of the hsien government at Feng-huang, Mr. Wang Yüeh-yen told us: “The T 'ien Wang temple is the Supreme Court of the Miao area. When a Miao is not satisfied with the decision of the hsien government, then he is ordered to go to the T 'ien Wang temple to drink blood. Whatever the litigation, big or small, it receives immediate settlement.” It can be seen that the Miao's awe of kuei is greater than their awe of the law.' <sup id="cite_ref-470" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-470">[470]</a></sup> Where literate residents were available, ad hoc regulations for specific situations were written down occasionally: 'After feasting each family brings home a small quantity of pork, from which a piece is cut off for sacrifice on the border of one's field. A string of paper money is also stuck there as a token to  invoke a prosperous harvest. In the afternoon every family contributes a few dimes for the purchase of vegetables and sends a representative to the party, at which rules and regulations are discussed regarding indemnities for damages to crops. He who can write is asked to list the rules on a piece of white paper to be affixed at the village gate. Then on the top of a high mound near the village they set up a straw mark and let loose a din of firecrackers to announce to villages far and near that this village has already passed its laws so that none may go there to violate them.' <sup id="cite_ref-471" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-471">[471]</a></sup> Formal courts presided over by Chinese judges were located in towns: 'Like Kweiyang, the hsien city of Lung-li was in an open plain, but a narrow one. The space between the mountains was sufficient for a walled town of one long street between the east and west gates and one or two on either side. There were fields outside the city walls. Its normal population was between three and four thousand, augmented during the war by the coming of some “companies” for the installation and repair of charcoal burners in motor lorries and the distillation of grain alcohol for fuel, an Army officers' training school, and the engineers' corps of the railway being built through the town from Kwangsi to Kweiyang. To it the people of the surrounding countryside, including at least three groups of Miao and the Chung-chia, went to market. It was also the seat of the hsien government and contained a middle school, postal and telegraph offices, and a cooperative bank, with all of which the non-Chinese, as well as the Chinese, had some dealings. A few of the more well-to-do families sent one of their boys to the middle school. Cases which could not be settled in the village or by the lien pao official, who was also a Chinese, were of necessity brought to the hsien court, as well as cases which involved both Miao and Chinese.' <sup id="cite_ref-472" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-472">[472]</a></sup> Cases were transferred to formal courts operating under Chinese law when local settlement proved impossible: 'The Magpie Miao live in villages, occasionally compact but normally consisting of a cluster of separate hamlets. These are located on mountain slopes, usually far enough away from main transportation routes to be inaccessible and readily defensible. The Miao lack any political organization of their own, and are thoroughly integrated into the Chinese administrative system. The basic political, as well as economic and social unit, is the village. Villages are grouped into townships and divided into hamlets of about ten to twenty households each. The headmen of both the village and the hamlet are appointed by the chief of the township. The members of different villages or hamlets are bound principally by affinal ties. They may cooperate for the common good, but they lack any formal organization of an indigenous character. Disputes between members of the same hamlet are settled, if possible, within the hamlet. Those between members of different hamlets of the same village are adjudicated by a council composed of the village headman and the heads of the hamlets involved. If this council cannot effect a settlement, the litigants have a right to carry their dispute to the chief of the township or even to the Chinese court of the county.' <sup id="cite_ref-473" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-473">[473]</a></sup> The above material refers to the Republican period. We still need to ascertain whether this is applicable to the Qing period as well. It appears that the sources only refer to the Republican period when it comes to legal matters. According to Graham, only a small number of cases was taken to Chinese courts even in the Republican period: 'Minor offences may be settled between the two persons concerned. When this cannot be accomplished, the families of the two persons endeavor to solve the difficulty. In more weighty and difficult matters, the local headmen or a number of the older people of the district are called in. It is said that only one or two per cent of the worst cases are taken to the Chinese courts. The reasons are not far to seek. Litigation in Chinese courts is expensive and a Miao, since he is a member of a different race, is likely to be discriminated against. In addition he is at a disadvantage because he cannot read Chinese characters.' <sup id="cite_ref-474" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-474">[474]</a></sup> This may have been even more rare in the Qing period. It is unclear at the moment when exactly Chinese courts were established in the area. eHRAF provides a general summary of the administrative history of the region, but includes no details on legal history: 'Chinese scholarship links the present-day Miao to tribal confederations that moved southward some 2,000 years ago from the plain between the Yellow River and the Yangtze toward the Dongting Lake area. These became the San Miao mentioned in Han dynasty texts. Over the next thousand years, between the Han and the Song dynasties, these presumed ancestors of the Miao continued to migrate westward and southward, under pressure from expanding Han populations and the imperial armies. Chinese texts and Miao oral history establish that over those years the ancestors settled in western Hunan and Guizhou, with some moving south into Guangxi or west along the Wu River to southeastern Sichuan and into Yunnan. The period was marked by a number of uprisings and battles between Miao and the Han or local indigenous groups, recalled in the oral histories of local groups. Though the term "Miao" was sometimes used in Tang and Song histories, the more usual term was "Man," meaning "barbarians." Migration continued through the Yuan, Ming, and early Qing, with some groups moving into mainland Southeast Asia. The retreat from Han control brought some into territories controlled by the Yi in northeast Yunnan/northwest Guizhou. The various migrations can also be seen as "vertical" migrations into the undeveloped hillside and mountain areas that were of lesser interest to Han. Depending on the terrain, the settled farming cited in Miao historical myths gave way to shifting slash-and-burn agriculture, facilitated by the introduction of the Irish potato and maize in the sixteenth century, and the adoption of high-altitude/cool-weather crops like barley, buckwheat, and oats. Farming was supplemented by forest hunting, fishing, gathering, and pastoralism. During the Qing, uprisings and military encounters escalated. There were major disturbances in western Hunan (1795-1806) and a continuous series of rebellions in Guizhou (1854-1872). Chinese policies toward the Miao shifted among assimilation, containment in "stockaded villages," dispersal, removal, and extermination. The frequent threat of "Miao rebellion" caused considerable anxiety to the state; in actuality, many of these uprisings included Bouyei, Dong, Hui, and other ethnic groups, including Han settlers and demobilized soldiers. At issue were heavy taxation, rising landlordism, rivalries over local resources, and official corruption. One of the last Miao uprisings occurred in 1936 in western Hunan in opposition to Guomindang (Republican) continuation of the tuntian   system, which forced the peasants to open up new lands and grow crops for the state.' <sup id="cite_ref-475" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-475">[475]</a></sup> 'From Song on, in periods of relative peace, government control was exercised through the tusi   system of indirect rule by appointed native headmen who collected taxes, organized corvée, and kept the peace. Miao filled this role in Hunan and eastern Guizhou, but farther west the rulers were often drawn from a hereditary Yi nobility, a system that lasted into the twentieth century. In Guizhou, some tusi   claimed Han ancestry, but were probably drawn from the ranks of assimilated Bouyei, Dong, and Miao. Government documents refer to the "Sheng Miao" (raw Miao), meaning those living in areas beyond government control and not paying taxes or labor service to the state. In the sixteenth century, in the more pacified areas, the implementation of the policy of gaitu guiliu   began the replacement of native rulers with regular civilian and military officials, a few of whom were drawn from assimilated minority families. Land became a commodity, creating both landlords and some freeholding peasants in the areas affected. In the Yunnan-Guizhou border area, the tusi system continued and Miao purchase of land and participation in local markets was restricted by law until the Republican period (1911-1949).' <sup id="cite_ref-476" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-476">[476]</a></sup> Accordingly, more information is needed before the relevant variables can be coded.

<p><b>♠ Non-state judiciary ♣ ♥</b> Informal Hmong customs co-existed with formal Chinese institutions. Hmong legal customs were informal and did not operate according to a written code: 'Among the Ch'uan Miao there are no written laws. The customs and habits of the group are the laws and what is customary is right. Crimes are infractions against the customs or mores of the group.' <sup id="cite_ref-477" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-477">[477]</a></sup> 'In every Sheng Miao village there is a set of rules and regulations which are voluntarily observed. In case of violation the offense is quickly adjudged by the public and an elder is invited to execute the punishment. Before it is carried out, however, he would tell the accused in a solemn manner the myths of their ancestors. Also in the case of a serious dispute the elder would summon both parties together, and first tell them the story of their ancestors before settling the dispute.  After a decision is rendered in this fashion both parties would show compliance and would not carry the case to the law courts. Although the mythology handed down from mouth to mouth does not have religious contents, it becomes a kind of prophecy to those people who hold everything pertaining to their ancestors in the highest respect. It is entirely due to this inherent respect for their ancestors that the ancestral myth is recounted before carrying out the punishment or at the time of settling a dispute. The idea is to employ the will of the ancestors to restrain the actions of their descendants. It is interesting to note that the mythology of the Sheng Miao, meant originally to inform posterity of the stories of their ancestors' life, has also assumed the corrective and preventive functions of law.' <sup id="cite_ref-478" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-478">[478]</a></sup> 'These, of course, were only a few of the disputes which arose in the village or among the whole group of Cowrie Shell Miao. Most small matters were settled among themselves. Much of the old man's time was taken up with such cases. Sometimes others of the village elders were called in for consultation. This was according to the Chinese Government system, though in effect this formed the village government, or council. If matters could not be settled by them, they were taken before the lien pao official, and, if necessary, to the hsien magistrate.' <sup id="cite_ref-479" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-479">[479]</a></sup> Disputes were handled by local headmen, sometimes through ordeals: 'The Miao are addicted to kuei and to litigation. Sometimes litigation may last a year, and the court, unable to decide the case, may ask both parties to eat blood. This serves as a deterrent. Yen Ju-yü in his Miao Fang-pei Lan says: “Those who enter the temple to drink blood move on their knees and bellies, not daring to look up; those who are in the wrong dare not drink it, but repent and yield.” In the course of our investigations in the Miao frontier area, the private secretary of the hsien government at Feng-huang, Mr. Wang Yüeh-yen told us: “The T 'ien Wang temple is the Supreme Court of the Miao area. When a Miao is not satisfied with the decision of the hsien government, then he is ordered to go to the T 'ien Wang temple to drink blood. Whatever the litigation, big or small, it receives immediate settlement.” It can be seen that the Miao's awe of kuei is greater than their awe of the law.' <sup id="cite_ref-480" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-480">[480]</a></sup> Where literate residents were available, ad hoc regulations for specific situations were written down occasionally: 'After feasting each family brings home a small quantity of pork, from which a piece is cut off for sacrifice on the border of one's field. A string of paper money is also stuck there as a token to  invoke a prosperous harvest. In the afternoon every family contributes a few dimes for the purchase of vegetables and sends a representative to the party, at which rules and regulations are discussed regarding indemnities for damages to crops. He who can write is asked to list the rules on a piece of white paper to be affixed at the village gate. Then on the top of a high mound near the village they set up a straw mark and let loose a din of firecrackers to announce to villages far and near that this village has already passed its laws so that none may go there to violate them.' <sup id="cite_ref-481" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-481">[481]</a></sup> Formal courts presided over by Chinese judges were located in towns: 'Like Kweiyang, the hsien city of Lung-li was in an open plain, but a narrow one. The space between the mountains was sufficient for a walled town of one long street between the east and west gates and one or two on either side. There were fields outside the city walls. Its normal population was between three and four thousand, augmented during the war by the coming of some “companies” for the installation and repair of charcoal burners in motor lorries and the distillation of grain alcohol for fuel, an Army officers' training school, and the engineers' corps of the railway being built through the town from Kwangsi to Kweiyang. To it the people of the surrounding countryside, including at least three groups of Miao and the Chung-chia, went to market. It was also the seat of the hsien government and contained a middle school, postal and telegraph offices, and a cooperative bank, with all of which the non-Chinese, as well as the Chinese, had some dealings. A few of the more well-to-do families sent one of their boys to the middle school. Cases which could not be settled in the village or by the lien pao official, who was also a Chinese, were of necessity brought to the hsien court, as well as cases which involved both Miao and Chinese.' <sup id="cite_ref-482" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-482">[482]</a></sup> Cases were transferred to formal courts operating under Chinese law when local settlement proved impossible: 'The Magpie Miao live in villages, occasionally compact but normally consisting of a cluster of separate hamlets. These are located on mountain slopes, usually far enough away from main transportation routes to be inaccessible and readily defensible. The Miao lack any political organization of their own, and are thoroughly integrated into the Chinese administrative system. The basic political, as well as economic and social unit, is the village. Villages are grouped into townships and divided into hamlets of about ten to twenty households each. The headmen of both the village and the hamlet are appointed by the chief of the township. The members of different villages or hamlets are bound principally by affinal ties. They may cooperate for the common good, but they lack any formal organization of an indigenous character. Disputes between members of the same hamlet are settled, if possible, within the hamlet. Those between members of different hamlets of the same village are adjudicated by a council composed of the village headman and the heads of the hamlets involved. If this council cannot effect a settlement, the litigants have a right to carry their dispute to the chief of the township or even to the Chinese court of the county.' <sup id="cite_ref-483" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-483">[483]</a></sup> The above material refers to the Republican period. We still need to ascertain whether this is applicable to the Qing period as well. It appears that the sources only refer to the Republican period when it comes to legal matters. According to Graham, only a small number of cases was taken to Chinese courts even in the Republican period: 'Minor offences may be settled between the two persons concerned. When this cannot be accomplished, the families of the two persons endeavor to solve the difficulty. In more weighty and difficult matters, the local headmen or a number of the older people of the district are called in. It is said that only one or two per cent of the worst cases are taken to the Chinese courts. The reasons are not far to seek. Litigation in Chinese courts is expensive and a Miao, since he is a member of a different race, is likely to be discriminated against. In addition he is at a disadvantage because he cannot read Chinese characters.' <sup id="cite_ref-484" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-484">[484]</a></sup> This may have been even more rare in the Qing period.

<p><b>♠ Private property (land) ♣ present ♥</b> eHRAF provides a general summary of the political and economic history of the area: 'From Song on, in periods of relative peace, government control was exercised through the tusi system of indirect rule by appointed native headmen who collected taxes, organized corvée, and kept the peace.

Southwestern China came under Communist government control by 1951, and Miao participated in land reform, collectivization, and the various national political campaigns. In the autonomous areas created beginning in 1952, the Miao were encouraged to revive and elaborate their costumes, music, and dance, while shedding "superstitious" or "harmful" customs. Some new technology and scientific knowledge was introduced, along with modern medicine and schooling. The Miao suffered considerably during the Cultural Revolution years, when expressions of ethnicity were again discouraged, but since 1979 the Miao have been promoted in the media and the government has encouraged tourism to the Miao areas of eastern and central Guizhou.' <sup id="cite_ref-488" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-488">[488]</a></sup> At the time, most Hmong were either smallholders or tenants, but some landlordship was also present: 'Miao everywhere, and by all reports, were agriculturalists, often tenants, and rarely landlords, except in Southeast Guizhou where they were more prosperous and more class-differentiated. They typically lived in small villages averaging ten to twenty households on mountain slopes remote from centers of Han settlement. In some places, village orientations were determined by geomancy, or “feng shui.” Their houses were constructed of wood, stone, or mud brick, depending on location. Using either swidden or paddy methods, they grew a variety of grains, including wet and dry rice, maize, buckwheat, millet, barley, gaoliang, and wheat. Their diet was supplemented with the cultivation of potatoes, vegetables, beans, and rape (for oil), with eggs and tofu, with hunting, and with domestic chicken, fish, pork, and occasionally beef. Opium, tobacco, and liquor also were produced, and different regions boasted other trade products such as tung oil, lacquer, herbal medicines, wool, and, most importantly, timber. They manufactured their own clothes with homegrown cotton, hemp, indigo, and other natural dyes and with techniques of weaving, dyeing, embroidery, and batik.' <sup id="cite_ref-489" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-489">[489]</a></sup> 'Prior to the 1950s land reform, some Miao were smallholders. Many, if not most, were tenants on lands owned by Han, Yi, Hui, and others. Few were true landlords, and most who rented out land were likely to work part of their holdings themselves with family labor. All land is now owned by the state, including undeveloped mountain and forest lands, thus limiting any expansion beyond lands officially assigned to an individual or village. In the process, pastoralism and forest hunting/gathering have been reduced. Before land reform, some Miao areas followed the practice of lineage or hamlet ownership of mountain and hillside lands even where some private holdings existed. People could open new lands for farming and settlement, share village pastures, or hunt away from their home area.' <sup id="cite_ref-490" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-490">[490]</a></sup> Mickey seems to imply that families typically held their own lands, which does not agree with material provided in the other sources: 'The possessions of the family as a whole were in land and animals. After the death of both parents the sons usually divided up the property, but all continued to work together in the cultivation of rice and the chief winter crops, leaving the care of gardens to the women of each household. If there were several married sons in a family, some had homes of their own, but they still gave mutual help. Some families had fairly extensive holdings in various directions from the village, but almost entirely in this one valley.' <sup id="cite_ref-491" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-491">[491]</a></sup> The primary socio-economic unit was the monogamous family: 'The basic social organization /sic/ of the Miao is the family, and moreover their family structure is the small family system, which consists of husband, wife, and children under age. This kind of small family system is the original system of the Miao. The Miao Fang Pei Lan, in the chapter on villages, says: “Among the Miao people father and sons and brothers do not live together in one house. When a son grows up he lives apart, erecting a new house and then there is another household.” Because of the small family system their living quarters as a rule consist of two or three rooms. In the house there is only one bed, and the husband, wife, and children all sleep on it together. When a girl grows up, a separate bed may be set up for her. As a rule the Miao practice monogamy. Sometimes they take a concubine, to live together with the wife, or to live separately. In the family economy, men and women share agricultural work, but household chores are mainly the women's responsibility. Family property consists of fields, houses, animals, and furniture, tools, and utensils. When the children grow up, a boy gets married at 17 or 18, and is given a certain amount of property in order to build a separate house and establish a family. A girl marries at fifteen or sixteen. So, the small family system among the Miao can always be maintained, and is not likely to be expanded.' <sup id="cite_ref-492" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-492">[492]</a></sup> Schein provides a general description of the kinship, residence and inheritance system: 'Miao society was predominantly patrilineal and generally organized [Page 53] in terms of exogamous village/lineage units. A patronymic system was widespread with surnames, of which there were no more than ten or twenty in use, borrowed from the Chinese. These surname groups constituted clanlike structures, which for purposes of mutual aid and large-scale rituals occasionally superseded the otherwise local village and patrilineal political organization. In some areas neolocal and/or matrilocal residence was found, but patrilocal residence was the most common. Premarital sex and courtship were characteristic among the Miao in most places, and arranged marriage was primarily according to the right of priority of a girl's maternal uncle to marry her to his son. Courtship took place at markets and festivals in which a special site sometimes was found for mingling, dancing, or antiphonal singing. Bride-price and sometimes dowry were provided by parents, once they approved their children's choices of partners. In some places, delayed transfer marriage was practiced, and divorce was acceptable, especially before the first child. Polygyny was uncommon, but not unknown. Inheritance was patrilineal, except for heirloom clothing and silver jewelry, which passed through the matriline.' <sup id="cite_ref-493" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-493">[493]</a></sup> Youngest sons were preferred heirs, but other sons and daughters received property at marriage: 'At marriage, sons and daughters receive property and assistance in building a new house. Marriage portions previously included livestock as well as household goods, tools, jewelry, and cloth. The youngest son and his descendants inherit the parental house and remaining wealth. A couple without sons will live with a daughter, who stands as heir.' <sup id="cite_ref-494" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-494">[494]</a></sup> 'Boys were more desired than girls because inheritance is in the male line and sons carry on the worship of ancestors, as among the Chinese, but girls were also loved and desired. They had a greater economic value than among the Chinese because of the work they did even after they were married. They also kept closer contact with their parents after marriage than Chinese girls can do. This was indicated by the fact that they took their maiden name, even though they remained in the home of the deceased husband.' <sup id="cite_ref-495" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-495">[495]</a></sup> The Chinese administration confiscated lands and leased them to compliant Hmong as t'un: 'According to the despatch quoted above the Miao officials, although they were military officers such as the native shou-pei and ch'ien-tsung, aside from their jurisdiction over the Miao soldiers, were also given considerable authority in Miao civilian affairs. In the tenth year of Chia Ch'ing /1805/ 107 the t'un land within the Miao area were placed under the control of Miao officials. Article 8 of Pu Fu T'un t'ien Chang-ch'eng /The Ministry's Reply concerning Regulations about the T'un Land/ states: “It would seem that after the Miao rebels were pacified in the present year in the various localities of Yung-sui, [Page 155] 107 cont. the Miao were greatly impressed by the strength of the Imperial army and surrendered land previously forcefully occupied by them. Also it would seem that if there was property of refractory Miao; it was confiscated. The fields were distributed among the law-abiding Miao to plant and pay rent, so that a Miao army could be raised and supported. Now the usurped land surrendered in the various villages totals more than 30,100 mu, and the land confiscated from the property of the rebel Miao totals more than 5,040 mu. These are now being separately registered, distributed for tilling for rent, and the revenues derived therefrom should be able to support 5,000 Miao soldiers. Among the 9,900 native Miao soldiers discharged over time and remaining, those able to bring up a plan to make a living have been sent back to their villages, and those who are old, weak, and poor have been given fields to till. Now 5,000 strong and healthy Miao soldiers have been selected, 2,000 of whom come from Feng-huang sub-prefecture; 800, from Kan-chou sub-prefecture; 1,800 from Yung-sui sub-prefecture; 100, from Ku-chang-p'ing sub-prefecture; and 300, from Pao-ching hsien. To collect the grain given over as rent, the Miao petty officers have selected in the various villages spots for building granaries to store away the public grain. Two or three honest Miao officers are chosen for each granary to supervise receipts and disbursements of the grain. The said 35,000 mu of arable land is estimated to be capable of yielding more than 22,000 shih of seeds of grain. It is estimated that there remain in various Miao granaries about 40 shih of seeds of grain, which will be used to fill the need for rations for the Miao soldiers in the intercalary month. The Miao officers are still ordered to report the actual receipts of rent grain every year.” ' <sup id="cite_ref-496" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-496">[496]</a></sup> Ling et al describe the development of the t'un system: 'During the Ts'ung Cheng reign period /1628/ /the end of the Ming dynasty/, the Miao rebelled, demolishing the guard stations and leveling the border wall. The “Great Wall” to blockade Miao country disappeared. The 7,800 guard troops /shou ping/ in the Miao area of the Ming dynasty were reduced to 1,600 men at the beginning of the Ch'ing dynasty. When the rebellion of Wu San-kwei was pacified and all was peaceful again, there was another reduction of 500 men, leaving 1,100 men. Military strength was slight and the defence system was relaxed. Further, following the change from native headmen to Chinese officials, and the use of Chinese as the head of every hundred families, intercourse between the Chinese and the Miao was no longer prohibited. In the twenty-ninth year of Ch'ien Lung /i.e. 1764/, in view of the Miao having undergone acculturation for a long time, they were allowed to intermarry with the Chinese. The original idea was to change the Miao by teaching, but with the passing of time evils developed, when rapacious Chinese under the pretext of trade entered the Miao area and seduced crafty Miao to enter into thievery. Unlike soldiers they entered Miao country for personal reasons and mistreated the Miao. The Miao made a pretext of these guest men's exploitations and encroachments on their land and banded together to make trouble, and brought about the great rebellion during the Ch'ien Lung /1736-95/ and Chia Ch'ing /1796-1820/ reign periods. After the rebellion was put down, the Manchu court realized that the time was yet inopportune to change the Miao by teaching, and the blockade policy was once more used. The various hsiens along the Miao border were heavily garrisoned for protection.' <sup id="cite_ref-497" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-497">[497]</a></sup> 'At that time in addition to stationing heavy complements of soldiers in the Miao area, there were also put up a total of 1,121 stone guard houses /tiao ch'ia/ along the ruins of the wall left from the Ming dynasty. In addition to the stationing of government troops at important positions, there were more than 800 of these guard houses where 9,000 soldiers were left to protect the border. Later when the nation became short of money, it was not possible to maintain large forces in this deep interior area for defence. Thus, suddenly, the frontier guards were withdrawn, then the stone guard houses became [Page 170] 115 cont. empty, and there was fear that the fierce Miao would start a rebellion. At this time Fu Nai of Yüan-ch'en tao met with Brigade General Fu Chih-na of Chen-kan Chen and summoned together people of the sub-prefecture to discuss a long-range plan. And so they began the t'un system of defense. Fields were allotted to feed the fighters and to defend the guard houses against the Miao.

They typically lived in small villages averaging ten to twenty households on mountain slopes remote from centers of Han settlement. In some places, village orientations were determined by geomancy, or “feng shui.” Their houses were constructed of wood, stone, or mud brick, depending on location. Using either swidden or paddy methods, they grew a variety of grains, including wet and dry rice, maize, buckwheat, millet, barley, gaoliang, and wheat. Their diet was supplemented with the cultivation of potatoes, vegetables, beans, and rape (for oil), with eggs and tofu, with hunting, and with domestic chicken, fish, pork, and occasionally beef. Opium, tobacco, and liquor also were produced, and different regions boasted other trade products such as tung oil, lacquer, herbal medicines, wool, and, most importantly, timber.

Many, if not most, were tenants on lands owned by Han, Yi, Hui, and others. Few were true landlords, and most who rented out land were likely to work part of their holdings themselves with family labor. All land is now owned by the state, including undeveloped mountain and forest lands, thus limiting any expansion beyond lands officially assigned to an individual or village. In the process, pastoralism and forest hunting/gathering have been reduced. Before land reform, some Miao areas followed the practice of lineage or hamlet ownership of mountain and hillside lands even where some private holdings existed. People could open new lands for farming and settlement, share village pastures, or hunt away from their home area.' <sup id="cite_ref-503" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-503">[503]</a></sup> The Chinese administration confiscated lands and leased them to compliant Miao as t'un: 'According to the despatch quoted above the Miao officials, although they were military officers such as the native shou-pei and ch'ien-tsung, aside from their jurisdiction over the Miao soldiers, were also given considerable authority in Miao civilian affairs.

Also it would seem that if there was property of refractory Miao; it was confiscated. The fields were distributed among the law-abiding Miao to plant and pay rent, so that a Miao army could be raised and supported. Now the usurped land surrendered in the various villages totals more than 30,100 mu, and the land confiscated from the property of the rebel Miao totals more than 5,040 mu. These are now being separately registered, distributed for tilling for rent, and the revenues derived therefrom should be able to support 5,000 Miao soldiers. Among the 9,900 native Miao soldiers discharged over time and remaining, those able to bring up a plan to make a living have been sent back to their villages, and those who are old, weak, and poor have been given fields to till. Now 5,000 strong and healthy Miao soldiers have been selected, 2,000 of whom come from Feng-huang sub-prefecture; 800, from Kan-chou sub-prefecture; 1,800 from Yung-sui sub-prefecture; 100, from Ku-chang-p'ing sub-prefecture; and 300, from Pao-ching hsien. To collect the grain given over as rent, the Miao petty officers have selected in the various villages spots for building granaries to store away the public grain. Two or three honest Miao officers are chosen for each granary to supervise receipts and disbursements of the grain. The said 35,000 mu of arable land is estimated to be capable of yielding more than 22,000 shih of seeds of grain. It is estimated that there remain in various Miao granaries about 40 shih of seeds of grain, which will be used to fill the need for rations for the Miao soldiers in the intercalary month. The Miao officers are still ordered to report the actual receipts of rent grain every year.” ' <sup id="cite_ref-504" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-504">[504]</a></sup> Ling et al describe the development of the t'un system: 'During the Ts'ung Cheng reign period /1628/ /the end of the Ming dynasty/, the Miao rebelled, demolishing the guard stations and leveling the border wall. The “Great Wall” to blockade Miao country disappeared. The 7,800 guard troops /shou ping/ in the Miao area of the Ming dynasty were reduced to 1,600 men at the beginning of the Ch'ing dynasty. When the rebellion of Wu San-kwei was pacified and all was peaceful again, there was another reduction of 500 men, leaving 1,100 men. Military strength was slight and the defense system was relaxed. Further, following the change from native headmen to Chinese officials, and the use of Chinese as the head of every hundred families, intercourse between the Chinese and the Miao was no longer prohibited. In the twenty-ninth year of Ch'ien Lung /i.e. 1764/, in view of the Miao having undergone acculturation for a long time, they were allowed to intermarry with the Chinese. The original idea was to change the Miao by teaching, but with the passing of time evils developed, when rapacious Chinese under the pretext of trade entered the Miao area and seduced crafty Miao to enter into thievery. Unlike soldiers they entered Miao country for personal reasons and mistreated the Miao. The Miao made a pretext of these guest men's exploitations and encroachments on their land and banded together to make trouble, and brought about the great rebellion during the Ch'ien Lung /1736-95/ and Chia Ch'ing /1796-1820/ reign periods. After the rebellion was put down, the Manchu court realized that the time was yet inopportune to change the Miao by teaching, and the blockade policy was once more used. The various hsiens along the Miao border were heavily garrisoned for protection.' <sup id="cite_ref-505" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-505">[505]</a></sup> 'At that time in addition to stationing heavy complements of soldiers in the Miao area, there were also put up a total of 1,121 stone guard houses /tiao ch'ia/ along the ruins of the wall left from the Ming dynasty. In addition to the stationing of government troops at important positions, there were more than 800 of these guard houses where 9,000 soldiers were left to protect the border. Later when the nation became short of money, it was not possible to maintain large forces in this deep interior area for defense. Thus, suddenly, the frontier guards were withdrawn, then the stone guard houses became [Page 170] 115 cont. empty, and there was fear that the fierce Miao would start a rebellion. At this time Fu Nai of Yüan-ch'en tao met with Brigade General Fu Chih-na of Chen-kan Chen and summoned together people of the sub-prefecture to discuss a long-range plan. And so they began the t'un system of defense. Fields were allotted to feed the fighters and to defend the guard houses against the Miao. As for the people's /i.e. Chinese/ land, except for fields for sustenance, a male could retain three tou of grain, a woman one tou.

On the other hand, some smallholders were present. Purchase of land by Hmong was restricted until the Republican period: 'From Song on, in periods of relative peace, government control was exercised through the tusi system of indirect rule by appointed native headmen who collected taxes, organized corvée, and kept the peace. Miao filled this role in Hunan and eastern Guizhou, but farther west the rulers were often drawn from a hereditary Yi nobility, a system that lasted into the twentieth century. In Guizhou, some tusi claimed Han ancestry, but were probably drawn from the ranks of assimilated Bouyei, Dong, and Miao. Government documents refer to the "Sheng Miao" (raw Miao), meaning those living in areas beyond government control and not paying taxes or labor service to the state. In the sixteenth century, in the more pacified areas, the implementation of the policy of gaitu guiliu began the replacement of native rulers with regular civilian and military officials, a few of whom were drawn from assimilated minority families. Land became a commodity, creating both landlords and some freeholding peasants in the areas affected.

There are 1,000 fighting men, each being given 3 shih, 6 tou of rice per year. The non-fighting men are also each given annually 10.8 liang of silver for salt and vegetables. The hsiao-ch'i receives each year 12 liang of silver; the tsung-ch'i, 13.2 liang of silver; the pe-tsung, 16.8 liang of silver. Therefore, in the Chinese t'un, the fields and land left over after the t'un men have received their fields to plant and care for are leased out for the collection of rent. Granaries (Illus. 57) have been built to store the grain, and general t'un leaders are set up to manage these matters. There are no t'un men in the Miao t'uns, and the t'un fields are allotted to people to cultivate /Illus. 57 and 58 on pages 124 and 125/ 126 for the collection of rent, in order to feed the Miao soldiers, under the control of the Miao officials. The t'un fields in the Miao frontier region, at the inception of the system, totaled 150,000 mu of arable land, of which barely a third was directly cultivated by t'un personnel, the rest being allotted out as rented fields. Today, the t'un army in the Miao frontier region is about 1,000 strong. The maintainance of the Black Flag Battalion of the Miao troops (Illus. 58) largely comes from the rented fields. T'un fields were set up to support troops on the spot as a defense against the Miao. Today, the Miao have been largely acculturated by the Chinese and the boundary line between the Miao and the Chinese is gradually becoming [Page 183] [Page 184] [Page 185] 126 cont. obliterated. There is no longer the need for this kind of system of t'un defense against the Miao. In fact, unrest in the Miao area today is often due to the maladministration of the t'un fields system. The Miao petty officers and the t'un leaders often are oppressive in collecting rent and sometimes are corrupt in their methods, thus causing dissatisfaction and disturbances. In the twenty-sixth year of the Republic /1937/ the Miao rebellion in western Hunan arose because of the t'un land system. It resulted in the burning of t'un granaries and killing of t'un officers. Although the rebellion was pacified only after bloody and expensive campaigns, it is imperative to change the t'un and enter the newly opened or reclaimed land as available for taxation, so as to reach a fundamental solution.' <sup id="cite_ref-514" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-514">[514]</a></sup> Given the specified purpose of t'un lands (production of surplus grain for government storehouses in order to support the military administration), this could be considered as a prescribed 'use of property'.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Property market ♣ absent ♥</b> Given the complexities of the Hmong situation under Chinese rule, this variable is difficult to code. See above. Hmong families transmitted property and exchanged goods, but much land was in the hands of landlords (generally from other ethnic groups) and the military administration, so Hmong tenants were in no place to participate in the property market. On the other hand, some smallholders were present. Purchase of land by Hmong was restricted until the Republican period: 'From Song on, in periods of relative peace, government control was exercised through the tusi system of indirect rule by appointed native headmen who collected taxes, organized corvée, and kept the peace. Miao filled this role in Hunan and eastern Guizhou, but farther west the rulers were often drawn from a hereditary Yi nobility, a system that lasted into the twentieth century. In Guizhou, some tusi claimed Han ancestry, but were probably drawn from the ranks of assimilated Bouyei, Dong, and Miao. Government documents refer to the "Sheng Miao" (raw Miao), meaning those living in areas beyond government control and not paying taxes or labor service to the state. In the sixteenth century, in the more pacified areas, the implementation of the policy of gaitu guiliu began the replacement of native rulers with regular civilian and military officials, a few of whom were drawn from assimilated minority families. Land became a commodity, creating both landlords and some freeholding peasants in the areas affected. In the Yunnan-Guizhou border area, the tusi system continued and Miao purchase of land and participation in local markets was restricted by law until the Republican period (1911-1949).' <sup id="cite_ref-515" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-515">[515]</a></sup> Accordingly, we have coded 'absent' for the Qing period.</dd></dl>
<p><b>♠ Other property ownership ♣ present ♥</b> Families owned houses, animals, furniture, and tools: 'The basic social organization /sic/ of the Miao is the family, and moreover their family structure is the small family system, which consists of husband, wife, and children under age. This kind of small family system is the original system of the Miao. The Miao Fang Pei Lan, in the chapter on villages, says: “Among the Miao people father and sons and brothers do not live together in one house. When a son grows up he lives apart, erecting a new house and then there is another household.” Because of the small family system their living quarters as a rule consist of two or three rooms. In the house there is only one bed, and the husband, wife, and children all sleep on it together. When a girl grows up, a separate bed may be set up for her. As a rule the Miao practice monogamy. Sometimes they take a concubine, to live together with the wife, or to live separately. In the family economy, men and women share agricultural work, but household chores are mainly the women's responsibility. Family property consists of fields, houses, animals, and furniture, tools, and utensils. When the children grow up, a boy gets married at 17 or 18, and is given a certain amount of property in order to build a separate house and establish a family. A girl marries at fifteen or sixteen. So, the small family system among the Miao can always be maintained, and is not likely to be expanded.' <sup id="cite_ref-516" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-516">[516]</a></sup> Non-heirs received livestock and other goods at marriage: 'At marriage, sons and daughters receive property and assistance in building a new house. Marriage portions previously included livestock as well as household goods, tools, jewelry, and cloth. The youngest son and his descendants inherit the parental house and remaining wealth. A couple without sons will live with a daughter, who stands as heir.' <sup id="cite_ref-517" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-517">[517]</a></sup> Women owned and transmitted ornaments: 'Inheritance. The family was the social unit. Descent was through males and the oldest living male was the head of the family. Non-personal property belonged to the family as a whole and even clothing and ornaments might be passed around, especially when one or more represented the family on some social occasion. Then, in order to do honor to the family and to their hosts, they made a display of the family wealth. A woman owned the [Page [42b]] ornaments she bought or had given her and the embroidery she made. She gave most of her ornaments to her daughters.' <sup id="cite_ref-518" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-518">[518]</a></sup> Some trade was practiced: 'No Miao communities are self-sufficient. All depend on the market for pottery, salt, processed foods, and various daily necessities. In Guizhou there is great demand for silver for making jewelry. What the Miao have to sell varies greatly by area. The Hua Miao market wool, hides, sheep and goats, wild game, firewood, and a variety of forest products. The Cowrie Shell Miao market agricultural produce, poultry and pigs, bamboo shoots, and home-crafted grass raincoats and sandals. Different areas have their specialties, such as cattle, horses, bamboo baskets, and herbal medicines. Before 1949, some Miao sold opium, but more often poppy growing and production of raw opium was the required rent for cropland and the profits went to the landlord and middlemen. Very few Miao were full-time merchants or traders.' <sup id="cite_ref-519" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-519">[519]</a></sup> 'Miao everywhere, and by all reports, were agriculturalists, often tenants, and rarely landlords, except in Southeast Guizhou where they were more prosperous and more class-differentiated. They typically lived in small villages averaging ten to twenty households on mountain slopes remote from centers of Han settlement. In some places, village orientations were determined by geomancy, or “feng shui.” Their houses were constructed of wood, stone, or mud brick, depending on location. Using either swidden or paddy methods, they grew a variety of grains, including wet and dry rice, maize, buckwheat, millet, barley, gaoliang, and wheat. Their diet was supplemented with the cultivation of potatoes, vegetables, beans, and rape (for oil), with eggs and tofu, with hunting, and with domestic chicken, fish, pork, and occasionally beef. Opium, tobacco, and liquor also were produced, and different regions boasted other trade products such as tung oil, lacquer, herbal medicines, wool, and, most importantly, timber. They manufactured their own clothes with homegrown cotton, hemp, indigo, and other natural dyes and with techniques of weaving, dyeing, embroidery, and batik.' <sup id="cite_ref-520" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-520">[520]</a></sup> 'The other key product that linked Miao to larger systems was opium. Opium was not widely used among the Miao, and it plays no central cultural or ritual role. However, it was used for some medicinal purposes. Miao cultivation of the opium poppy, by contrast, for three related reasons became widespread in China during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Once the British had introduced Indian opium as a trade item to the Chinese populace, demand for an indigenously produced variety steadily rose with increased addiction and, especially, in response to Chinese efforts to curtail British imports. Chinese attempts to ban domestic production only encouraged its cultivation in the mountainous minority regions least subject to policing. Finally, Miao swiddeners found the crop uniquely suitable to a mobile existence in which interruptions in agriculture required a portable trade item that could be exchanged for cash to purchase rice and other essentials.' <sup id="cite_ref-521" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-521">[521]</a></sup> We have assumed that at least some of the above, while referring to the Republican period, might be true of the Qing period as well.

<dd><b>♠ State expropriation ♣ present ♥</b> The Chinese administration confiscated lands in retaliation to rebellions and the leased it to compliant Hmong under the t'un system: 'According to the despatch quoted above the Miao officials, although they were military officers such as the native shou-pei and ch'ien-tsung, aside from their jurisdiction over the Miao soldiers, were also given considerable authority in Miao civilian affairs. In the tenth year of Chia Ch'ing /1805/ 107 the t'un land within the Miao area were placed under the control of Miao officials. Article 8 of Pu Fu T'un t'ien Chang-ch'eng /The Ministry's Reply concerning Regulations about the T'un Land/ states: “It would seem that after the Miao rebels were pacified in the present year in the various localities of Yung-sui, [Page 155] 107 cont. the Miao were greatly impressed by the strength of the Imperial army and surrendered land previously forcefully occupied by them. Also it would seem that if there was property of refractory Miao; it was confiscated. The fields were distributed among the law-abiding Miao to plant and pay rent, so that a Miao army could be raised and supported. Now the usurped land surrendered in the various villages totals more than 30,100 mu, and the land confiscated from the property of the rebel Miao totals more than 5,040 mu. These are now being separately registered, distributed for tilling for rent, and the revenues derived therefrom should be able to support 5,000 Miao soldiers. Among the 9,900 native Miao soldiers discharged over time and remaining, those able to bring up a plan to make a living have been sent back to their villages, and those who are old, weak, and poor have been given fields to till. Now 5,000 strong and healthy Miao soldiers have been selected, 2,000 of whom come from Feng-huang sub-prefecture; 800, from Kan-chou sub-prefecture; 1,800 from Yung-sui sub-prefecture; 100, from Ku-chang-p'ing sub-prefecture; and 300, from Pao-ching hsien. To collect the grain given over as rent, the Miao petty officers have selected in the various villages spots for building granaries to store away the public grain. Two or three honest Miao officers are chosen for each granary to supervise receipts and disbursements of the grain. The said 35,000 mu of arable land is estimated to be capable of yielding more than 22,000 shih of seeds of grain. It is estimated that there remain in various Miao granaries about 40 shih of seeds of grain, which will be used to fill the need for rations for the Miao soldiers in the intercalary month. The Miao officers are still ordered to report the actual receipts of rent grain every year.” ' <sup id="cite_ref-534" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-534">[534]</a></sup> Ling et al describe the development of the t'un system: 'During the Ts'ung Cheng reign period /1628/ /the end of the Ming dynasty/, the Miao rebelled, demolishing the guard stations and leveling the border wall. The “Great Wall” to blockade Miao country disappeared. The 7,800 guard troops /shou ping/ in the Miao area of the Ming dynasty were reduced to 1,600 men at the beginning of the Ch'ing dynasty. When the rebellion of Wu San-kwei was pacified and all was peaceful again, there was another reduction of 500 men, leaving 1,100 men. Military strengh was slight and the defense system was relaxed. Further, following the change from native headmen to Chinese officials, and the use of Chinese as the head of every hundred families, intercourse between the Chinese and the Miao was no longer prohibited. In the twenty-ninth year of Ch'ien Lung /i.e. 1764/, in view of the Miao having undergone acculturation for a long time, they were allowed to intermarry with the Chinese. The original idea was to change the Miao by teaching, but with the passing of time evils developed, when rapacious Chinese under the pretext of trade entered the Miao area and seduced crafty Miao to enter into thievery. Unlike soldiers they entered Miao country for personal reasons and mistreated the Miao. The Miao made a pretext of these guest men's exploitations and encroachments on their land and banded together to make trouble, and brought about the great rebellion during the Ch'ien Lung /1736-95/ and Chia Ch'ing /1796-1820/ reign periods. After the rebellion was put down, the Manchu court realized that the time was yet inopportune to change the Miao by teaching, and the blockade policy was once more used. The various hsiens along the Miao border were heavily garrisoned for protection.' <sup id="cite_ref-535" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-535">[535]</a></sup> 'At that time in addition to stationing heavy complements of soldiers in the Miao area, there were also put up a total of 1,121 stone guard houses /tiao ch'ia/ along the ruins of the wall left from the Ming dynasty. In addition to the stationing of government troops at important positions, there were more than 800 of these guard houses where 9,000 soldiers were left to protect the border. Later when the nation became short of money, it was not possible to maintain large forces in this deep interior area for defense. Thus, suddenly, the frontier guards were withdrawn, then the stone guard houses became [Page 170] 115 cont. empty, and there was fear that the fierce Miao would start a rebellion. At this time Fu Nai of Yüan-ch'en tao met with Brigade General Fu Chih-na of Chen-kan Chen and summoned together people of the sub-prefecture to discuss a long-range plan. And so they began the t'un system of defense. Fields were allotted to feed the fighters and to defend the guard houses against the Miao. As for the people's /i.e. Chinese/ land, except for fields for sustenance, a male could retain three tou of grain, a woman one tou. As for the rest of the land seven were allotted while three were retained, for one shih of grain three tou was personally retained, and seven tou given up for allotment, to feed the fighters and guard the frontier. In the Feng-huang area there were more than 830 stone guard houses, requiring 4,000 men to man them in rotation. Further, 1,000 men were trained to be combat ready. The more than 22,000 mu of land allotted were not enough to meet the expense, and so another allotment of more than 12,300 mu at Lu-ch'i and Mo-yang was made. There were also 127 stone petty military stations /tiao pao/ at Kan-chou, manned by 800 soldiers, supported by more than 2,170 mu of allotted land. The original sect of government of Yung-sui, before the Miao rebellion during the reign period of Ch'ien Lung and Chia Ch'ing, was at Wei-ch'eng, which was entirely surrounded by the Miao. In the second year of Chia Ch'ing /1797/, the seat of government was moved to Hua-yüan with a newly built yamen. There were 126 stone guard houses with 2,000 soldiers. The people's land, i.e. Chinese land, usurped by rebels and recovered for public use, totaled more than 17,110 mu. There were over 70 stone military stations /tiao pao/, at Pao-ching, with 300 soldiers and over 2,170 mu of allotted land. There were only 18 stone guard houses at Ku-chang-p'ing with a hundred soldiers and over 120 mu of allotted land.' <sup id="cite_ref-536" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-536">[536]</a></sup> 'The above refers to Chinese t'un /min t'un/. In addition, there were also Miao t'un. After the suppression of the Miao rebellion, the Miao tribes, awed by military might, surrendered all the Chinese land formerly forcefully usurped by them, and [Page 171] 115 cont. also searched into the properties of the rebel Miao and decided to return them for public use. The forcefully usurped land totaling over 30,100 mu and the rebels' properties totaling over 5,400 mu were redistributed among the law-abiding Miao to farm. Granaries were built to collect rent /tsu/ for the maintenance of Miao soldiers. The pressing for rent, the inspecting of fields, the distribution and transportation of grain, and other duties were all the responsibility of Miao officials.' <sup id="cite_ref-537" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-537">[537]</a></sup> 'The total of the above fields and land is 131,640.6 mu. In the thirteenth year of Chia Ch'ing /1808/ a total of 15,219.3 mu of fields and land was surveyed in the three hsien, Feng-huang, Kan-chou, and Yung-sui. In the sixteenth year of Chia Ch'ing /1811/ another total of 5,873.2 mu of fields and land was surveyed, totaling 152,157.1 mu of fields and land. Of this besides the land allocated to the army for horses and farming, land lost through floods and erosion, and also the land used for stone guard houses and surroundings, totaling 11,084.3 mu, and another 37,849 mu distributed among the t'un able-bodied males, leaders, the aged, and the young, there remained 103,223.8 mu. Farmers were recruited to farm this land and rent /in kind/ collected. The annual receipt in grain totaled 105,488 shih, three tou, and nine sheng.' <sup id="cite_ref-538" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-538">[538]</a></sup> 'The t'un fields in the Miao frontier were divided into people's /i.e. Chinese/ t'uns and Miao t'uns, the two being entirely different in nature. The t'un males working on the Chinese t'uns were also divided into t'un men and fighting men. The t'un men received fields to cultivate, and guarded the t'un guard houses. The fighting men, also called home guards, were solely trained for military operations, and did not farm. In the five sub-prefectures and hsiens of the Miao frontier there are 7,000 t'un men, from among whom are appointed hsiao-ch'i, tsung-ch'i, and pe-tsung to facilitate control. The distribution of fields was as follows: the men /san ting/ are each given 4.5 mu; the hsiao-ch'i, 5.5 mu; the tsung-ch'i, 6.5 mu; and the pe-tsung, 7.5 mu. There are 1,000 fighting men, each being given 3 shih, 6 tou of rice per year. The non-fighting men are also each given annually 10.8 liang of silver for salt and vegetables. The hsiao-ch'i receives each year 12 liang of silver; the tsung-ch'i, 13.2 liang of silver; the pe-tsung, 16.8 liang of silver. Therefore, in the Chinese t'un, the fields and land left over after the t'un men have received their fields to plant and care for are leased out for the collection of rent. Granaries (Illus. 57) have been built to store the grain, and general t'un leaders are set up to manage these matters. There are no t'un men in the Miao t'uns, and the t'un fields are allotted to people to cultivate /Illus. 57 and 58 on pages 124 and 125/ 126 for the collection of rent, in order to feed the Miao soldiers, under the control of the Miao officials. The t'un fields in the Miao frontier region, at the inception of the system, totaled 150,000 mu of arable land, of which barely a third was directly cultivated by t'un personnel, the rest being allotted out as rented fields. Today, the t'un army in the Miao frontier region is about 1,000 strong. The maintainance of the Black Flag Battalion of the Miao troops (Illus. 58) largely comes from the rented fields. T'un fields were set up to support troops on the spot as a defense against the Miao. Today, the Miao have been largely acculturated by the Chinese and the boundary line between the Miao and the Chinese is gradually becoming [Page 183] 124 [Page 185] 126 cont. obliterated. There is no longer the need for this kind of system of t'un defense against the Miao. In fact, unrest in the Miao area today is often due to the maladministration of the t'un fields system. The Miao petty officers and the t'un leaders often are oppressive in collecting rent and sometimes are corrupt in their methods, thus causing dissatisfaction and disturbances. In the twenty-sixth year of the Republic /1937/ the Miao rebellion in western Hunan arose because of the t'un land system. It resulted in the burning of t'un granaries and killing of t'un officers. Although the rebellion was pacified only after bloody and expensive campaigns, it is imperative to change the t'un and enter the newly opened or reclaimed land as available for taxation, so as to reach a fundamental solution.' <sup id="cite_ref-539" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-539">[539]</a></sup> However, this was not an 'inheritance tax' of any kind. It needs to be specified whether this variable refers to appropriation of inheritance exclusively or whether it is supposed to apply more widely.</dd>

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Monogamy ♣ present ♥</b> Reliable published findings on the kinship system are sparse: 'Generally, Miao have been pressured to take Chinese surnames, which are transmitted patrilineally. Descent is said to be patrilineal, and in some places the Han patrilineage form has been adopted. However, matrilineal kin are important in some areas. In practice, there is strong evidence that the system is bilateral.' <sup id="cite_ref-540" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-540">[540]</a></sup> 'No serious comparative study of kin terms and lineage organization is yet available, and some of the writings on the subject suggest Miao politeness in telling Han investigators what they want to hear.' <sup id="cite_ref-541" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-541">[541]</a></sup> eHRAF provides the following summary: 'Marriages generally require parental consent but are based on mutual attraction and choice. In the past, many communities had "youth houses" where unmarried young people could gather. Groups of young men traveled around to court girls in other villages. In the absence of parental consent, elopement was an alternative. Festivals and trips to periodic markets still provide an opportunity for young people to meet, engage in antiphonal singing and dancing, and establish new friendships. Since the 1950s, travel restrictions and state disapproval of premarital sexual behavior has increased the parental role in marriage arrangement. Marriages are monogamous. Marriage outside the dialect or language group is rare. Divorce and remarriages are permitted. Postmarital residence is usually in the man's home village but only the youngest son lives with his parents after his marriage, and in instances where there are no sons a family may bring in a son-in-law or an aged widow or widower might join her married daughter's household. In some areas, there is delayed transfer of the bride until after the birth of her first child, or the practice of starting out with residence with the bride's family.' <sup id="cite_ref-542" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-542">[542]</a></sup> 'The two-generation nuclear family is statistically the most common. Relations between spouses, and between parents and children, are more egalitarian than among the Han. Economic, social, and ritual ties are retained with natal kin. Visiting kinsfolk are welcome guests, and may come for extended visits.' <sup id="cite_ref-543" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-543">[543]</a></sup> Schein reports patrilineality, but overall her account is similar: 'Miao society was predominantly patrilineal and generally organized [Page 53] in terms of exogamous village/lineage units. A patronymic system was widespread with surnames, of which there were no more than ten or twenty in use, borrowed from the Chinese. These surname groups constituted clanlike structures, which for purposes of mutual aid and large-scale rituals occasionally superseded the otherwise local village and patrilineal political organization. In some areas neolocal and/or matrilocal residence was found, but patrilocal residence was the most common. Premarital sex and courtship were characteristic among the Miao in most places, and arranged marriage was primarily according to the right of priority of a girl's maternal uncle to marry her to his son. Courtship took place at markets and festivals in which a special site sometimes was found for mingling, dancing, or antiphonal singing. Bride-price and sometimes dowry were provided by parents, once they approved their children's choices of partners. In some places, delayed transfer marriage was practiced, and divorce was acceptable, especially before the first child. Polygyny was uncommon, but not unknown. Inheritance was patrilineal, except for heirloom clothing and silver jewelry, which passed through the matriline.' <sup id="cite_ref-544" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-544">[544]</a></sup> The monogamous family unit was the basic socio-economic unit of Miao society: 'The basic social organization /sic/ of the Miao is the family, and moreover their family structure is the small family system, which consists of husband, wife, and children under age. This kind of small family system is the original system of the Miao. The Miao Fang Pei Lan, in the chapter on villages, says: “Among the Miao people father and sons and brothers do not live together in one house. When a son grows up he lives apart, erecting a new house and then there is another household.” Because of the small family system their living quarters as a rule consist of two or three rooms. In the house there is only one bed, and the husband, wife, and children all sleep on it together. When a girl grows up, a separate bed may be set up for her. As a rule the Miao practice monogamy. Sometimes they take a concubine, to live together with the wife, or to live separately. In the family economy, men and women share agricultural work, but household chores are mainly the women's responsibility. Family property consists of fields, houses, animals, and furniture, tools, and utensils. When the children grow up, a boy gets married at 17 or 18, and is given a certain amount of property in order to build a separate house and establish a family. A girl marries at fifteen or sixteen. So, the small family system among the Miao can always be maintained, and is not likely to be expanded.' <sup id="cite_ref-545" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-545">[545]</a></sup> 'Because of strict adherence to the small family system, clan organization cannot develop. Among the pure Miao there are the following five surnames: Wu, Lung, Liao, Shih, and Ma. Such surnames as Yang, Shih, P'eng, Chang, and Hung were those of outsiders who married into Miao families and [Page 129] 93 cont. adopted their ways. Among the Shih /“rock”/ and Lung /“dragon”/ there are the Ta /“big”/ Shih and Shao /“small”/ Shih, the Ta Lung and Shao Lung. Shao Shih is also written with the character shih meaning “time,” and Shao Lung, also with the character lung meaning “eminent.” Although they have surnames, they do not have a closely knit organization of family clans, and so formerly they did not object to marriage between people of the same surname. However, no marriage was permitted between close relatives. In recent years they have come under Chinese influence, and know that people of the same surnames must not marry. Shao Shih /“small rock”/ was changed to be written with the character shih meaning “time,” and Shao Lung /“small dragon”/ was changed to be written with the character lung meaning “eminent,” in order to separate them from Ta Shih /“big rock”/ and Ta Lung /“big dragon”/, so that they could intermarry. Today, Miao family life has become more and more like that of the Chinese, and marriage and funeral rites largely follow Chinese customs, barely retaining remnants of some Miao customs.' <sup id="cite_ref-546" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-546">[546]</a></sup> Graham describes arranged marriages: 'Sexual attraction naturally results in love affairs and love affairs naturally result in sexual intercourse. Sometimes this results in marriage but often it does not.' <sup id="cite_ref-547" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-547">[547]</a></sup> 'Children are often married at a very early age. It is not uncommon for a child to be married when only three or four years old and most children are married by the time they are twelve. Of course these are not love matches, and serious love affairs later in life with men and women to whom they are not married are quite likely to occur.' <sup id="cite_ref-548" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-548">[548]</a></sup> 'The normal way is for engagements to be made by the parents of the boy through go-betweens. The initiative is taken by the parents of the young man. When they have decided that they wish to make an engagement between their son and a certain girl, they call two go-betweens who are invited to a meal in the boy's home. A chicken is killed for the meal and its tongue, its bones and other parts of its body are examined to ascertain whether or not the circumstances are propitious.' <sup id="cite_ref-549" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-549">[549]</a></sup> 'If the signs are propitious, the middle men proceed to the home of the girl. There they endeavor to secure a favorable reply from the girl's parents who in turn call in go-betweens. If her parents are favorable, the go-betweens are feasted and they proceed to determine the details of the gift which must be given by the boy's parents to those of the girl. The gift may include pork, domestic animals, rice, beans, corn, money, or any other commodity. When the engagement presents have been given and accepted by the girl's parents, the engagement is complete and is seldom broken. There is a second feast for the go-betweens and other friends at the time when the engagement gifts are presented. The engagement is a contract between the parents of the young people. While the bride is not actually purchased, the value of the gift often goes a long way towards securing a favorable decision by the girl's parents.' <sup id="cite_ref-550" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-550">[550]</a></sup> 'When the go-betweens arrive at the home of the girl much of the work of making the engagement is often done by means of songs. By certain songs they announce their mission to the girl's parents. Other songs carry the work along, even to the matter of approximately arranging the gift. There are songs when the gifts are presented. Sometimes these songs take the form of contests when the two sets of go-betweens ridicule or try to outwit each other or see who can keep going the longest.' <sup id="cite_ref-551" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-551">[551]</a></sup> Premarital sexual relations could culminate in marriage as well: 'When the parents are unwilling to marry off a daughter, or nobody seeks her hand in marriage, or when the parents are unable or fail to make an engagement for a son, the marriageable person endeavors to win a mate. For this purpose he or she goes to the market place on the third day of the third moon, at tuan yang □ on the fifth day of the [Page 36] fifth moon, or at some other convenient time, or attends one of the Miao feasts or festivals, or joins those playing on the mountain-sides at New Year time. Either the boy or the girl can make the first advances. The methods are to look lovingly with the eyes, to squeeze hands and to speak loving words. This is inconvenient if there are many people about. A boy may take a girl's handkerchief or a girl take a boy's. Then the person who gets the handkerchief goes away and the other says, “That person has taken my handkerchief. Stay here and I will go after him (or her).” Then in a quiet secluded place they make love. They say loving words, squeeze each other's hands, and embrace. A very great evidence of love is when one spits and the other swallows the spittal. Copulation often follows after which a handkerchief or a ring may be given by the boy to the girl or vice versa and they make a vow such as, “If you do not marry me and marry another, you must take this engagement present and eat it and then I will make no trouble.” It is believed by the Ch'uan Miao men that copulation is one of the surest ways to a woman's affection.' <sup id="cite_ref-552" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-552">[552]</a></sup> 'Later the parents must be informed and they must secure go-betweens and arrange engagement presents and so on. If the parents do not agree, then the young people run away together or the man carries away the girl. Then all the neighbors and friends urge the parents to consent and if they still do not agree the neighbors and friends practically compel them to do so. The gifts to the girl's parents are generally less than they would have been if the young people had been engaged and married in the usual way.' <sup id="cite_ref-553" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-553">[553]</a></sup> 'Marriage by capture is not unknown among the Ch'uan Miao. Sometimes the girls are quite willing to get married in this way, and it is said that happy marriages often result. Sometimes a man uses this method because he is in love with the girl.' <sup id="cite_ref-554" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-554">[554]</a></sup> According to Ling et al, premarital sexual relations were common and tolerated: 'Among the Miao the premarital sex life of the young men and women is rather free. When a virgin has intercourse with a man, her parents know about it but do not forbid it. On the contrary, they consider this evidence that the man finds their daughter desirable. Sometimes, the girl brings home her lover, and her parents will kill a chicken to entertain him. There are even public houses set up specially for the use of young men and women to gather together. For instance, in Chapter II reference was made to the Pa Chai Miao, recorded in Yung-sui T'ing Chih, to the effect that an empty shed was built near the village, where unmarried men and women gathered together to sing. If a couple fell in love, a cow was sent as a betrothal gift. Again, the unmarried men among the Ch'ing Chiang He Miao were called “lohan”; in the spring they would [Page 130] 94 cont. carry wine and food up the mountain, singing and dancing reciprocally. Those who became fond of each other would drink from an ox horn. There is the custom among the Miao of dancing for the new year, dancing for the moon, and singing for autumn. On such occasions, young men and women form groups and sing in response to each other all night until daybreak. After singing they mix with each other, drinking and joking, even to the extent of having sexual relations. This is called fang yeh “going wild.”'  <sup id="cite_ref-555" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-555">[555]</a></sup> However, parental consent was still required for marriage: 'Although unmarried men and women are free to fall in love, marriage, however, requires parental consent as well as the approval of the maternal uncle of the girl. The He Miao of Ch'ing Chiang, Kweichow have a marriage custom where they betroth the daughter of a paternal aunt to be the daughter-in-law of a maternal uncle. Should the maternal uncle have no son, the girl's family has to pay a large sum of money to him. Without such a payment the girl all her life may not marry. The Miao, other than close paternal cousins not being suitable mates, they do not object to marriage between people of the same surname. However, maternal cousins may not marry. This is a survival from a matrilineal society, because in a matrilineal society maternal cousins have the same surname whereas cross cousins or male and female first cousins on the father's side have different surnames. That maternal cousins cannot marry is evidence of their advance from a matrilineal society to a patrilineal society. The importance of the maternal uncle's position in sacrificial ceremonies as well as in the society is additional evidence.' <sup id="cite_ref-556" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-556">[556]</a></sup> Graham describes the proceedings at weddings: 'Parents generally desire to marry off their daughters, for it is the custom of marrying daughters into other homes that makes possible the securing of daughters-in-law to labor in the home and to give birth to descendants. Besides, the girl's parents receive engagement gifts and these are sometimes very valuable.' <sup id="cite_ref-557" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-557">[557]</a></sup> 'The bride generally weeps before leaving her parental home. Sometimes the sorrow is pretended but at other times she is sad and unwilling to go and the parents and friends and relatives have to use persuasion and even coercion. There is an old custom by which the parents actually push the girl out of the house. It is customary for the girl and her parents to weep, either as a matter of form or because of sincere sorrow.' <sup id="cite_ref-558" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-558">[558]</a></sup> 'Before the bride leaves her home, a meal is provided by her parents for her and for those who escort her. In the wedding procession there are generally one or more old women, relatives of the bride, a male relative or friend who manages the procession, the brothers of the bride and other friends who choose to go along. If it is a long distance to the groom's home, a meal is provided to be eaten by the way. In the bridal procession are generally carried such clothing, boxes, chests of drawers or other objects that have been given as bridal presents by her parents to the bride. The manager carries with him a bamboo tree with roots which symbolizes the large number of descendants of the couple. It is also supposed to have magic power to help the family thus to prosper. Sometimes a branch of a tea tree is also carried. Some plant the bamboo tree and others hang it up on the wall of the house. The liu shêng is not used at weddings for its notes are thought to be too sad for such occasions.' <sup id="cite_ref-559" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-559">[559]</a></sup> 'On arriving at the home of the groom, the brothers of the bride generally escort her into the house as a protection from demons. If she has no brothers, first cousins will do and lacking these, other male relatives may be invited to act as brothers. When entering the house the bride covers her face with a black and a white cloth. Her older brother goes in front and she holds onto his belt. Behind her an older or younger brother holds an umbrella over her as protection from demons.' <sup id="cite_ref-560" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-560">[560]</a></sup> 'Sometimes the bride and her companions enter the home and walk around in a circle three times. At other times, the Chinese custom of kowtowing three times to parents, relatives, and friends is followed. Tea is soon offered to the guests. According to an old custom that is no longer observed, the meat of a particular kind of bird and fish were provided at wedding feasts. There is always a wedding feast for the relatives and friends. One of the male relatives later counts before all the clothing, chests of drawers, and other things that have been sent along by the bride's parents. When her relatives and friends finally depart, the groom and his relatives go through a form of detaining her by force. This shows that [Page 38] they really want her but it is also true that brides sometimes run away at this time. Another ceremony that is sometimes performed at a wedding is that of calling the soul of the bride. Her soul may fail to come with her and if it does not come, she will die.' <sup id="cite_ref-561" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-561">[561]</a></sup> 'After a few months have passed, the bride is permitted occasionally to visit her parents, but henceforth her husband's home is her home and his family is her family. She calls her husband's parents father and mother.' <sup id="cite_ref-562" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-562">[562]</a></sup> 'During the marriage ceremonies offerings are generally made to the soil and to the ancestors who first gave grain to the Miao. These are regarded and treated practically as deities. There are two great demons or devils, and possibly three. gla□ d□y often drowns people in creeks and rivers. He seems to be related to the Chinese river demons who are the demons of people who are drowned themselves and who try to drown others so as to escape from their demon state. Some say that d□y means original and that gla□ d□y means original demon.' <sup id="cite_ref-563" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-563">[563]</a></sup> Marriage customs changed under Chinese influence, but go-betweens remained important: 'The former marriage customs of the Miao were slightly different from their present ways. Yung-sui T'ing Chih says: “Miao marriage is just like a purchase. They do not follow the /Chinese/ custom of asking names (as a preliminary to fixing a betrothal) and sending presents to the bride's home to fix the betrothal. They only negotiate about the number of horses and cattle through a broker. The broker is a Miao marriage go-between. It definitely requires five or six horses or heads of cattle to initiate a trade for one wife. When the agreement [Page 131] 94 cont. is reached an inauspicious /sic/ day is chosen to welcome the wife. The bride wears a moon-white gown and walks holding a parasol, half open, half shut, called the shame-hiding parasol. Her father and mother, brothers, and relatives escort her to the husband's house. The dowry consists of everything from cattle and sheep and goats to plows and harrows. They do not enter by the main door but through a hole bored through a wall. Men and women sit together. The bride is not allowed to look left or right, or else the husband would be displeased for fear that shermay be fond of some one else. The couple takes each a bowl of rice, a piece of fish, and a cup of wine dregs. Next they visit the paternal uncles' houses in the same village, at each eating and drinking the same items. On their return home they are husband and wife, but they do not spend the night together.” It also says: “The Miao do not object to marriage between people of the same surname, but relatives do not marry. On the wedding night the bride sleeps with her mother, who leaves only when the groom gives her some silver as a gift 95, called the “mother's money” or “milk money.” It is generally about two or three liang of silver. A wealthy family, seeing a pretty girl, might order their son to drag the girl from behind. This is called “carrying off a woman and marrying her by force.” The girl's family attracted by their wealth, do not engage the girl to anyone else, but get a go-between to discuss betrothal presents. When a virgin has an affair with a man, her parents know about it but do not forbid it. On the contrary, they consider this evidence that the man finds her desirable. But, if one's wife or concubine is seduced, then they raise knives, facing each other, and money is required as compensation. If a husband and wife do not get along, the husband may divorce her and marry again, and the wife may do the same. As to improper sexual conduct, instances were very rare even in former days, and today the Miao have become more aware of ethical and moral obligations.” (What is recorded in the Miao Fang Pei Lan is to the same effect.)' <sup id="cite_ref-564" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-564">[564]</a></sup> 'Today, the marriage customs of the Miao have been thoroughly influenced by the Chinese and have changed from the old ways. Boys and girls who like each other return home and tell their parents. The boy's family finds a go-between to approach the girl's family to discuss marriage. Once, twice, and sometimes three or four times, such approaches may be made before an agreement is reached. Having had indications of assent from the girl's family, the go-between goes back to report to the boy's family, who get ready two bottles of wine (a wealthy family would send along two chin of meat and two chin of noodles besides the wine). The gifts are carried back by the go-between to the girl's family, who invite him to drink wine and eat noodles. Where this procedure has been gone through then they reckon it to be the preliminary engagement, which in the Miao language is called (tiaŋ□ t□ mp`a□), meaning “to let the girl go,” also translated as /Chinese/ fang k'ou “to let go the mouth /door?/.”' <sup id="cite_ref-565" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-565">[565]</a></sup> 'After the preliminary engagement a period of time is allowed to elapse. Then the ceremony of sticking in incense has to take place, which is called /soŋ□ t'i □/), with the meaning of /Chinese/ na ts'ai, i.e. the sending of gifts to the bride's home and fix the betrothal. The date is selected by the boy's family, who then informs the girl's family. The gifts generally consist of 50 or 60 strings of cash, one outfit of clothing, a pair of earrings, a pair of bracelets, a few boxes of rice cakes, two chin of sweetmeats, two packages of firecrackers, one chin of oil, one chin of salt, a jug of wine, and several chin of meat. The quantity of the foregoing gift items depends largely upon the financial condition of the boy's family. Poor families may omit a few items, but money, clothes, rings, bracelets, firecrackers, wine, meat, incense and candles are necessary items. These gifts are carried by the brothers of the future groom, followed by the go-between, the future groom, and his father, to the girl's family. Sometimes, the future groom may not go. When the gifts arrive at the door to the house, firecrackers are set off, and the party is received outside the door by the clan [Page 133] 95 cont. brothers in the girl's family. After entering the door and a brief rest, the ceremony of sticking incense before the ancestral tablet of the girl's family begins. The groom kowtows three times. If he is not present, his father kowtows in his place. If the groom is present he must also kowtow to his future father-in-law, mother-in-law, and other elders. If the girl's family is wealthy, then a pig will be killed to entertain the guests from the groom's family. The guests remain in the girl's family for three days, during which the immediate relative of the girl's family take turns in entertaining them with meals, called “meals from door to door.” The closest relatives must entertain the visitors at breakfast, because breakfast is considered the most important meal in the Miao countryside. For instance, say there are six families, A, B, C, D, E, and F, with A and C being the closest relatives. Dinner on the first (■)ening is given by the host family, 96 breakfast on the second day is given by family A, lunch by family E, and dinner by family B. On the third day breakfast is given by family C, lunch by family F, and dinner by family D. When the guests are seen off on the fourth day, breakfast is given by the host family. As a rule three meals are served in a day, but when there are a large number of /clan/ brothers there are five or six meals in one day. After breakfast on the fourth day the guests depart. Return presents from the girl's family consist of a suit of clothes, a pair of shoes, and a hat for the future son-in-law, a piece of material for a pair of trousers for each guest, a pair of shoes each for the parents of the groom, and a pig's leg for the gobetween.' <sup id="cite_ref-566" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-566">[566]</a></sup> 'A few months or half a year before the marriage the gobetween visits the girl's family to ask for the date and time of her birth. He must bring with him two or four strings of cash and some sweetmeats. This ceremony is called “asking for the lucky birth date.” The girl's birth date and time thus obtained are matched with those of the groom in order to pick an auspicious day for the wedding. The date is communicated to the girl's family through the go-between. They then begin to [Page 134] 96 cont. get busy with the bride's marriage portion. Most commonly it consists of one or two trunks, four or five garments making one outfit, two pairs of trousers, and a suit of clothes for the groom. Such women's ornaments as earrings, rings, bracelets, and neck rings have been sent previously by the groom's family to the bride's, or silver is sent instead for the bride's family to have the ornaments made of it. On the day set the groom's family send along wine, meat, firecrackers, incense and candles, and torches, and recently they include sedan chairs or chairs. When they arrive before the entrance of the bride's family, recently, in imitation of the Chinese custom, they close the entrance and demand money for opening the gate in the sum of eight hundred cash or one string /one thousand/ of cash. Further, they intentionally curse the go-between and complain that the gifts of wine and meat sent by the boy's family are not enough. The bride then gets dressed up, and meanwhile a Miao sorcerer is invited to make sacrifices to the ancestors. A square table is laid with sacrificial items, incense and candles, and the sorcerer priest recites incantations, kowtows, and performs divination with straws, to cut off the powers of evil. He lights two torches, opens a parasol, and invites the bride to come out to kowtow three times to the ancestral tablet. After this she kowtows once to her parents, once to all her brothers and paternal male cousins, and once to her maternal grandparents. This done, she turns around facing outside and mounts the sedan chair (in a rich family) or walks (middle-class family), holding a half-opened parasol. The brothers, sisters, cousins, mother's married sisters, mother's brothers wives, and mother of the bride accompany her on the way. If the bride arrives too early at her husband's house, she has to wait in a side building or take a rest in a neighbor's house. At that time a table is laid in front of the entrance with incense and candles, a piece of cooked meat, and three cups of wine. A guest sorcerer offers the following prayer: “The day is auspicious, the moment is opportune, Heaven and earth open out. [Page 135] 96 cont. The bride arriving here brings Great luck and great prosperity. The peach tree is young and beautiful and upright! The maiden goes to her bridegroom's house to become     a pair of phoenixes. Acting correctly toward the members of the family,     she descends from the sedan chair, Lightly she moves with short steps into the decorated     hall. The bride's family's carriage and horses turn and go     back. The husband's carriage and horses come out to wel-     come her. And after this exchange of carriages and horses, Heaven will be long and earth lasting; Earth will be lasting and heaven long.” At this point he takes hold of a cock and continues: “This chicken is not an ordinary one, It is the chicken which announces dawn to the     Prince's Mother. Wearing a heroic comb and a fine beak, Dressed in silk gauze clothes in five hues, People of this world have no use for it.97 But I use it to exorcise evil influences, Of heaven and earth, Of the year, the month, the day, the hour, And of the twelve evil spirits. The evil influences of heaven return to heaven; Of the earth returns to Hades. Thus, the evil spirits retreat And the lucky stars descend.”' <sup id="cite_ref-567" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-567">[567]</a></sup> 'On finishing the incantation he bites open the comb of the cock and sprays its blood on the ground. Returning to the house, he sets another square table like the one before and continues: “O! ye, holy spirits of the heavens And the holy spirits of the earth! [Page 136] 97 cont. I am invoking the benignant spirits of union To this mundane world. The mission is none other than To officiate at this marriage rite. We ask the Heaven Uniting Spirit, The Earth Uniting Spirit, The Year Uniting Spirit, The Day Uniting Spirit, The Hour Uniting Spirit, The twelve uniting spirits and twelve uniting fairies, Tung Wang Kung /Lord of the East, leader of the male immortals/ Hsi Wang Mu /Lady of the West, leader of the female immortals/ The Cowherd and the Weaving Girl /names of stars/ And the Old Immortal in the moon.”' <sup id="cite_ref-568" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-568">[568]</a></sup> 'At this point he takes a cup of wine and a piece of meat, and writes out an incantation. After burning this he asks the groom to drink half of the wine and to eat half of the meat, the rest being for the bride when she comes in. These are called the uniting wine and the uniting meat. After the sorcerer priest has finished this performance, he sets off firecrackers and leads the bride into the house through a small side door. She sits down beside the fire pit, in which a huge fire has been started. The chair is placed slightly farther away for fear that the fire would give out too much heat. The chair cannot be pushed backward; it can only be pulled forward. The movement backward is recognized to be inauspicious; the forward movement then is auspicious. The sitting direction must be facing inside or in the direction of the ancestral tablet. After being seated she first washes her face with water. It has been boiled in a cooking pot with t'ung grass, pa-lun grass, and huang-mao grass, taken out and put in a basin, and incantations written and recited. While the bride is washing her face, the sorcerer priest sweeps with a broom several times behind her. After washing, she eats the meat and drinks the wine left by the groom. [Page 137] 97 cont. She is kept company by those who escorted her here. The brothers of the bride set the bridal chamber in order, and the groom's family gives them one or two strings of cash, a piece of meat, and two cups of wine. First half of the wine is spilled on the floor and the rest is drunk up, but the meat is all consumed. After these things have been done, the wedding feast begins. The dishes include beef, pork, bean-starch vermicelli, bean curd fried in oil, greens, etc. After the meal, the singing begins. Men and women guests gather in a group while men and women of the host family gather in another group. First the host of the groom's family begins to sing, (singing one of the “Welcoming the Bride Songs,” see the chapter, “Folk Songs,” no. 3). If the opposite side does not take up the singing, they use all means to encourage them. The phrases sung generally consist first of polite exchanges. In addition they sing legends, do Chinese characters, make riddles, and praise each other, etc. In the singing there is winning and losing: for instance, if A 's singing says B is polite, and B is not able to answer, saying he is not polite, then B is reckoned the loser; or if B sings that he himself is ignorant of etiquette, and A fails to sing back of his skill in etiquette, then B is the winner. Again, if A sings the name of a personage of antiquity whom B does not know, or if A offers a riddle which B fails to solve - these would be reckoned losing counts for B. The loser can no longer participate in the singing, and if a whole group fails to sing back the answer to the opposite side, then the whole group loses out. Experts in singing can match songs back and forth all night to a draw. 98 In the middle of the night they eat mi-pa /rice cakes/ as refreshments. In the singing the women keep things going, for they bring up subjects to be answered by the men. Ordinarily men are easily defeated, because women lose only when they can pick no more subjects for the men to answer. Sometimes the singing lasts for three nights, but usually one or two nights (see chapter, on “Folk Songs,” nos. four to 13, “Welcoming the Bride Songs,” and nos. 14 to 18, “Songs Sung in Company”). The guests remain [Page 138] 98 cont. for three days, the same as at the time of “sticking in incense.” They are also entertained in rotation by the closest relatives of the host. After breakfast on the third day a large table is set up in the main room. Eloquent elder men and women of the two families are invited to sit down around the table to count and announce the number of presents from the bride's family. First, the suit, shoes, and hat from the bride's parents to the son-in-law are announced, next the material for trousers from the guests to the groom, and then the presents from the bride's family to the elders of the groom's family. Then they record the cash and articles presented by the groom's family in return to the bride's family. For instance, if the dowry from the girl's family was 80 strings of cash, the groom's family returns 50. In a family of wealth, this money is usually left with the bride and not taken back. The guests who presented trousers receive one or two strings of cash in return. The bridesmaids also receive one or two strings of cash. The bride's family receives a pig's leg, and the go-between gets a pig's head. While the presents are being announced, the men and women sitting around the table talk and sing, in response to each other. (See Chapter 11, “Folk Songs,” songs no. 19, 20, 21, and 22, “Seeing the Guests off on the Third Morning.) During these three days the bride and groom do not share the same room. When the bride's family is escorted back, the bride goes along and stays for one or three days before she comes back to her new home to share the room with the groom.' <sup id="cite_ref-569" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-569">[569]</a></sup> Divorce was tolerated and fairly easy to obtain: 'Divorces are very easy with the Miao. The lack of good looks, a difference in wealth between the families, incompatibility, lack of good behavior - any of these constitutes grounds for divorce. Either side may initiate a divorce action. The children of a divorced couple are generally kept by the man, but an unweaned baby is kept by the woman to be restored to the man when it grows up. If the man's family is destitute, the children are kept by the woman's family. After the divorce either side may remarry at will.' <sup id="cite_ref-570" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-570">[570]</a></sup> Widows were free to re-marry, but required the approval of her brothers-in-law, who might pursue levirate marriage: 'A widow has freedom of sexual intercourse. There is no definite period of mourning for her deceased husband and she may remarry at any time, except that she must have the approval of the brothers of the deceased husband. If either the elder or the younger brother of the deceased wishes to marry the widowed sister-in-law, then she may not marry an outsider. Otherwise she returns to her family to marry again. At the time of the second marriage a sorcerer priest is also asked to perform the ritual. There is no go-between nor a formally set date. At the wedding the “shame-covering parasol” must be opened fully. On reaching her new husband's home she enters by the front entrance.99 A widow may marry again and again. Furthermore, she can have a husband marry into her household.' <sup id="cite_ref-571" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-571">[571]</a></sup> While the above descriptions refer to the Republican period, we have assumed them to be applicable to the Qing period as well.</dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Gender ♣ present ♥</b> Reliable published findings on the kinship system are sparse: 'Generally, Miao have been pressured to take Chinese surnames, which are transmitted patrilineally. Descent is said to be patrilineal, and in some places the Han patrilineage form has been adopted. However, matrilineal kin are important in some areas. In practice, there is strong evidence that the system is bilateral.' <sup id="cite_ref-572" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-572">[572]</a></sup> 'No serious comparative study of kin terms and lineage organization is yet available, and some of the writings on the subject suggest Miao politeness in telling Han investigators what they want to hear.' <sup id="cite_ref-573" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-573">[573]</a></sup> eHRAF provides the following summary: 'Marriages generally require parental consent but are based on mutual attraction and choice. In the past, many communities had "youth houses" where unmarried young people could gather. Groups of young men traveled around to court girls in other villages. In the absence of parental consent, elopement was an alternative. Festivals and trips to periodic markets still provide an opportunity for young people to meet, engage in antiphonal singing and dancing, and establish new friendships. Since the 1950s, travel restrictions and state disapproval of premarital sexual behavior has increased the parental role in marriage arrangement. Marriages are monogamous. Marriage outside the dialect or language group is rare. Divorce and remarriages are permitted. Postmarital residence is usually in the man's home village but only the youngest son lives with his parents after his marriage, and in instances where there are no sons a family may bring in a son-in-law or an aged widow or widower might join her married daughter's household. In some areas, there is delayed transfer of the bride until after the birth of her first child, or the practice of starting out with residence with the bride's family.' <sup id="cite_ref-574" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-574">[574]</a></sup> 'The two-generation nuclear family is statistically the most common. Relations between spouses, and between parents and children, are more egalitarian than among the Han. Economic, social, and ritual ties are retained with natal kin. Visiting kinsfolk are welcome guests, and may come for extended visits.' <sup id="cite_ref-575" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-575">[575]</a></sup> Schein reports patrilineality, but overall her account is similar: 'Miao society was predominantly patrilineal and generally organized [Page 53] in terms of exogamous village/lineage units. A patronymic system was widespread with surnames, of which there were no more than ten or twenty in use, borrowed from the Chinese. These surname groups constituted clanlike structures, which for purposes of mutual aid and large-scale rituals occasionally superseded the otherwise local village and patrilineal political organization. In some areas neolocal and/or matrilocal residence was found, but patrilocal residence was the most common. Premarital sex and courtship were characteristic among the Miao in most places, and arranged marriage was primarily according to the right of priority of a girl's maternal uncle to marry her to his son. Courtship took place at markets and festivals in which a special site sometimes was found for mingling, dancing, or antiphonal singing. Bride-price and sometimes dowry were provided by parents, once they approved their children's choices of partners. In some places, delayed transfer marriage was practiced, and divorce was acceptable, especially before the first child. Polygyny was uncommon, but not unknown. Inheritance was patrilineal, except for heirloom clothing and silver jewelry, which passed through the matriline.' <sup id="cite_ref-576" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-576">[576]</a></sup> Women contributed to agricultural work, but labour was still divided along gender lines: 'Both sexes engage in agriculture, care of livestock, and fishing, and men contribute some labor to domestic chores like cooking, gathering firewood, and child care. Men are expected to do the heaviest work, including plowing. Women sometimes participated on short hunting trips, but trips of several days or several weeks were undertaken by groups of men; hunting trips are now illegal. Labor exchange and cooperation between households was common even before collectivization.' <sup id="cite_ref-577" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-577">[577]</a></sup> 'Women, who never bound their feet, participated in most productive activities except plowing and hunting. They typically had a greater share in the family duties since they tended vegetable gardens, were often the ones who carried water, and did most of the household chores such as preparing food and washing clothes. Men did crafts such as silversmithing, woodworking, and basketry; women wove and decorated clothing. Childcare was shared. As a rule, men had higher status and more extensive roles in ritual activities, although elderly women were often honored in ritual, and women could become ritual experts such as shamans.' <sup id="cite_ref-578" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-578">[578]</a></sup> 'In the relationship between spouses a higher degree of respect is expected from the wife. The division of labor by sex in economic matters has already been described. Beyond this, the husband is more concerned with social and ceremonial activities, the wife with household affairs.' <sup id="cite_ref-579" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-579">[579]</a></sup> Boys were preferred over girls, but overall gender relations were more egalitarian than among neighbouring Chinese: 'Boys were more desired than girls because inheritance is in the male line and sons carry on the worship of ancestors, as among the Chinese, but girls were also loved and desired. They had a greater economic value than among the Chinese because of the work they did even after they were married. They also kept closer contact with their parents after marriage than Chinese girls can do. This was indicated by the fact that they took their maiden name, even though they remained in the home of the deceased husband.' <sup id="cite_ref-580" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-580">[580]</a></sup> Youngest sons were preferred heirs: 'At marriage, sons and daughters receive property and assistance in building a new house. Marriage portions previously included livestock as well as household goods, tools, jewelry, and cloth. The youngest son and his descendants inherit the parental house and remaining wealth. A couple without sons will live with a daughter, who stands as heir.' <sup id="cite_ref-581" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-581">[581]</a></sup> Most ritual specialists were men: 'Most religious ritual is performed or guided by various part-time specialists who act as priests, diviners, or shamans for the local community or for kin groups. Most of them are males. They engage in ordinary work, and only the most important religious activities require them to don special items of dress and decoration to mark them from others. There are no written texts for learning the chants, songs, dances, and rituals: they are memorized. If called by a family, specialists receive a small payment (often in foodstuffs) for their assistance. Shamans play a key role at funerals and postburial rites. They are also involved in analysis and healing of illness: some are skilled in herbal medicine as well as ritual procedures. Shamans also provide explanations of the possible causes of misfortune and can provide protective amulets. Ceremonies on behalf of the village community or a gathering of kin from several villages are conducted by skilled male elders who function as priests, following ritual procedures, administering the necessary animal and food sacrifices, and chanting the songs and myths without going into trance or communicating directly with the supernaturals and spirits. Some ceremonies are led by the male head of household on behalf of his immediate family.' <sup id="cite_ref-582" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-582">[582]</a></sup> Women were excluded from some ceremonial dances and feasts: 'There are two kinds of dances: the drumstick dance and the fist dance, the difference being that in the former the drum is struck with the drumstick and in the latter with the first. The first dances, except for the ta-pa-pa dance (see later), are men's dances and are not practiced by women. As for the drumstick dances, although they are for both men and women, there is a certain number exclusively for men. When we observed the Miao dances we felt at first that the movements were rather complicated, but after detailed analysis they are rather simple. Since within the short space of five minutes they can dance over 20 different steps in very rapid motion, each being interchangeable with the other, on-lookers cannot help but feel that the steps are extremely intricate. Following are accounts of the drumstick dance and the first dance.' <sup id="cite_ref-583" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-583">[583]</a></sup> 'The rest of the beef is roasted. To go with it they make all kinds of dishes containing beef. In the afternoon about one o'clock they set out the feast in the great hall. Boards and benches are put together to make a long table and the guests arrange themselves for a long feast. On the table they set all sorts of dishes having beef as a foundation. Of unfermented wine they drink from large bowls. If other families conduct the ritual at the same time, the guests who have come to the killing of the bull, after eating for a time at one place go on to other places. On that day only men are guests; women do not attend the feast. In many tribal societies, although all have meetings of a religious nature or rituals, women never take any part. Among the Cowrie Shell Miao women do not attend the feast of killing the bull, which is a very good example.' <sup id="cite_ref-584" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-584">[584]</a></sup> It appears that only men were appointed to positions as petty officials in the Chinese administration and informal leadership positions in villages were also usually taken by men.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Social class ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> There was little social stratification among the Hmong: 'The various Miao groups are for the most part an unstratified agricultural people found in the uplands of several provinces of China and related to the Hmong of Southeast Asia. They are distinguished by language, dress, historical traditions, and cultural practice from neighboring ethnic groups and the dominant Han Chinese. They are not culturally homogeneous and the differences between local Miao cultures are often as great as between Miao and non-Miao neighbors. The term "Miao" is Chinese, and means "weeds" or "sprouts." Chinese minority policies since the 1950s treat these diverse groups as a single nationality and associate them with the San Miao Kingdom of central China mentioned in histories of the Han dynasty (200 BC-AD 200).' <sup id="cite_ref-585" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-585">[585]</a></sup> 'Given the long period of Chinese rule, it is not possible to reconstruct precontact organization, though some areas still retain older lineage and clan names. Owing to dispersion, population decimation, and frequent migration, the multisurname settlement seems to be the most common. There was little class differentiation in the villages, and no formal political structure. Villages do not seem to have been formally linked by any kind of tribal organization and there was no formal political structure within villages.' <sup id="cite_ref-586" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-586">[586]</a></sup> Local leadership was largely informal: 'Respected knowledgeable elders, heads of family groups, and religious experts of both genders served as informal leaders.

The Cowrie Shell Miao were Chinese citizens, and officially entitled to the same rights and privileges as other Chinese. Their form of local government was Chinese. The leaders of the village [Page [44a]] were the elders, men who stood at the head of groups of closely related families, known as pao. There were three pao in Yang-chia-sai, and hence three elders, who formed the village council. Disputes within the family were settled, if possible, in the family, in the pao within the pao. Disputes within the village between members of different pao were ordinarily settled by the three elders. If, however, they were unable to effect a settlement, the litigants had the right to carry their dispute to the next higher official, the lien pao chang, who was a Chinese, and so on up to the Chinese court in the hsien city.' <sup id="cite_ref-588" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-588">[588]</a></sup> While elders and ritual specialists were respected, there were no distinct social classes: 'From very early times the Miao have had tribes but not tribal chiefs, and therefore they do not have different classes nor differentiated marriage or funeral ceremonial customs. The funeral for a Miao sorcerer, however, is slightly different from that for the ordinary person. When a sorcerer is at the point of death, 103 two other sorcerer priests are summoned to the house. When he breathes his last, the members of the family must not weep. One sorcerer priest climbs on the house and removes a few tiles from it to make an opening, which is called “opening the heaven's gate.” The other sorcerer priest sits below behind the deceased, and as soon as he sees “heaven's gate” has been opened, he immediately lets out a loud cry, to which the one on the roof responds with another cry, and thus, the two men, one above and the other below, start their ritual. It is said that the one above opens heaven's gate, and the one below shuts the grove /literally, “earth storehouse”/. This is to cause the departed sorcerer not to enter hell but to ascend to heaven. After this the family members may begin to cry and weep.' <sup id="cite_ref-589" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-589">[589]</a></sup> However, Miao populations found themselves at the bottom end of a complex interethnic hierarchy when integrated into the Chinese imperial structure: 'Chinese scholarship links the present-day Miao to tribal confederations that moved southward some 2,000 years ago from the plain between the Yellow River and the Yangtze toward the Dongting Lake area. These became the San Miao mentioned in Han dynasty texts. Over the next thousand years, between the Han and the Song dynasties, these presumed ancestors of the Miao continued to migrate westward and southward, under pressure from expanding Han populations and the imperial armies. Chinese texts and Miao oral history establish that over those years the ancestors settled in western Hunan and Guizhou, with some moving south into Guangxi or west along the Wu River to southeastern Sichuan and into Yunnan. The period was marked by a number of uprisings and battles between Miao and the Han or local indigenous groups, recalled in the oral histories of local groups. Though the term "Miao" was sometimes used in Tang and Song histories, the more usual term was "Man," meaning "barbarians." Migration continued through the Yuan, Ming, and early Qing, with some groups moving into mainland Southeast Asia. The retreat from Han control brought some into territories controlled by the Yi in northeast Yunnan/northwest Guizhou. The various migrations can also be seen as "vertical" migrations into the undeveloped hillside and mountain areas that were of lesser interest to Han. Depending on the terrain, the settled farming cited in Miao historical myths gave way to shifting slash-and-burn agriculture, facilitated by the introduction of the Irish potato and maize in the sixteenth century, and the adoption of high-altitude/cool-weather crops like barley, buckwheat, and oats. Farming was supplemented by forest hunting, fishing, gathering, and pastoralism. During the Qing, uprisings and military encounters escalated. There were major disturbances in western Hunan (1795-1806) and a continuous series of rebellions in Guizhou (1854-1872). Chinese policies toward the Miao shifted among assimilation, containment in "stockaded villages," dispersal, removal, and extermination. The frequent threat of "Miao rebellion" caused considerable anxiety to the state; in actuality, many of these uprisings included Bouyei, Dong, Hui, and other ethnic groups, including Han settlers and demobilized soldiers. At issue were heavy taxation, rising landlordism, rivalries over local resources, and official corruption. One of the last Miao uprisings occurred in 1936 in western Hunan in opposition to Guomindang (Republican) continuation of the tuntian system, which forced the peasants to open up new lands and grow crops for the state.' <sup id="cite_ref-590" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-590">[590]</a></sup> 'From Song on, in periods of relative peace, government control was exercised through the tusi system of indirect rule by appointed native headmen who collected taxes, organized corvée, and kept the peace. Miao filled this role in Hunan and eastern Guizhou, but farther west the rulers were often drawn from a hereditary Yi nobility, a system that lasted into the twentieth century. In Guizhou, some tusi claimed Han ancestry, but were probably drawn from the ranks of assimilated Bouyei, Dong, and Miao. Government documents refer to the "Sheng Miao" (raw Miao), meaning those living in areas beyond government control and not paying taxes or labor service to the state. In the sixteenth century, in the more pacified areas, the implementation of the policy of gaitu guiliu began the replacement of native rulers with regular civilian and military officials, a few of whom were drawn from assimilated minority families. Land became a commodity, creating both landlords and some freeholding peasants in the areas affected. In the Yunnan-Guizhou border area, the tusi system continued and Miao purchase of land and participation in local markets was restricted by law until the Republican period (1911-1949).' <sup id="cite_ref-591" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-591">[591]</a></sup> Most Hmong subsistence producers were either smallholders or dependent tenants who worked lands owned by landlords from other ethnic groups: 'Prior to the 1950s land reform, some Miao were smallholders. Many, if not most, were tenants on lands owned by Han, Yi, Hui, and others. Few were true landlords, and most who rented out land were likely to work part of their holdings themselves with family labor. All land is now owned by the state, including undeveloped mountain and forest lands, thus limiting any expansion beyond lands officially assigned to an individual or village. In the process, pastoralism and forest hunting/gathering have been reduced. Before land reform, some Miao areas followed the practice of lineage or hamlet ownership of mountain and hillside lands even where some private holdings existed. People could open new lands for farming and settlement, share village pastures, or hunt away from their home area.' <sup id="cite_ref-592" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-592">[592]</a></sup> Accordingly, low social status and ethnicity intersected in the case of the Hmong. It appears that while Hmong men were recruited by the Chinese administration as petty officials, they did not have access to higher-level positions in the imperial bureaucracy (see above). Combined with the unequal distribution of property in land, this seems to suggest that the Hmong may not have enjoyed the same legal rights as other groups. On the other hand, Hmong had access to the Chinese court system (see legal variables above). It might be that, as stated in some of the sources cited above, Hmong groups were entitled to the same legal rights as Chinese, but were discriminated against in practice. We have assumed this to be the case for the time being, but this is open to review.</dd>

Depending on the terrain, the settled farming cited in Miao historical myths gave way to shifting slash-and-burn agriculture, facilitated by the introduction of the Irish potato and maize in the sixteenth century, and the adoption of high-altitude/cool-weather crops like barley, buckwheat, and oats. Farming was supplemented by forest hunting, fishing, gathering, and pastoralism. During the Qing, uprisings and military encounters escalated. There were major disturbances in western Hunan (1795-1806) and a continuous series of rebellions in Guizhou (1854-1872). Chinese policies toward the Miao shifted among assimilation, containment in "stockaded villages," dispersal, removal, and extermination. The frequent threat of "Miao rebellion" caused considerable anxiety to the state; in actuality, many of these uprisings included Bouyei, Dong, Hui, and other ethnic groups, including Han settlers and demobilized soldiers. At issue were heavy taxation, rising landlordism, rivalries over local resources, and official corruption. One of the last Miao uprisings occurred in 1936 in western Hunan in opposition to Guomindang (Republican) continuation of the tuntian system, which forced the peasants to open up new lands and grow crops for the state.' <sup id="cite_ref-598" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-598">[598]</a></sup> 'From Song on, in periods of relative peace, government control was exercised through the tusi system of indirect rule by appointed native headmen who collected taxes, organized corvée, and kept the peace. Miao filled this role in Hunan and eastern Guizhou, but farther west the rulers were often drawn from a hereditary Yi nobility, a system that lasted into the twentieth century. In Guizhou, some tusi claimed Han ancestry, but were probably drawn from the ranks of assimilated Bouyei, Dong, and Miao. Government documents refer to the "Sheng Miao" (raw Miao), meaning those living in areas beyond government control and not paying taxes or labor service to the state. In the sixteenth century, in the more pacified areas, the implementation of the policy of gaitu guiliu began the replacement of native rulers with regular civilian and military officials, a few of whom were drawn from assimilated minority families. Land became a commodity, creating both landlords and some freeholding peasants in the areas affected. In the Yunnan-Guizhou border area, the tusi system continued and Miao purchase of land and participation in local markets was restricted by law until the Republican period (1911-1949).' <sup id="cite_ref-599" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-599">[599]</a></sup> Most Hmong subsistence producers were either smallholders or dependent tenants who worked lands owned by landlords from other ethnic groups: 'Prior to the 1950s land reform, some Miao were smallholders. Many, if not most, were tenants on lands owned by Han, Yi, Hui, and others. Few were true landlords, and most who rented out land were likely to work part of their holdings themselves with family labor. All land is now owned by the state, including undeveloped mountain and forest lands, thus limiting any expansion beyond lands officially assigned to an individual or village. In the process, pastoralism and forest hunting/gathering have been reduced. Before land reform, some Miao areas followed the practice of lineage or hamlet ownership of mountain and hillside lands even where some private holdings existed. People could open new lands for farming and settlement, share village pastures, or hunt away from their home area.' <sup id="cite_ref-600" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-600">[600]</a></sup> Accordingly, low social status and ethnicity intersected in the case of the Hmong. It appears that while Hmong men were recruited by the Chinese administration as petty officials, they did not have access to higher-level positions in the imperial bureaucracy (see above). Combined with the unequal distribution of property in land, this seems to suggest that the Hmong may not have enjoyed the same legal rights as other groups. On the other hand, Hmong had access to the Chinese court system (see legal variables above). It might be that, as stated in some of the sources cited above, Hmong groups were entitled to the same legal rights as Chinese, but were discriminated against in practice. We have assumed this to be the case for the time being, but this is open to review.</dd></dl>

<dd><b>♠ Education is available to both males and females ♣ absent ♥</b> Christian missionaries established primary and secondary schools, but this process did not start until the late 19th and early 20th centuries: 'The first missionaries among the Hua Miao belonged to the Bible Christian Church, a dissenting Methodist sect, that placed great importance on the ability to read the Bible for oneself. With missionary assistance and encouragement, a simple phonetic script was developed in 1905 and in the following years the New Testament was translated in full into Dian Dongbei. Hymnals and study guides were also produced, and a series of school primers. In the 1930s and 1940s a small newspaper was published. Village chapels, built with communal effort, functioned also as one-room primary schools and centers for adult education. The mountain community of Shimenkan (Stone Gateway) in northwestern Guizhou served as the headquarters of church activity. In addition to its own large primary school, it offered secondary schooling and teacher training. At least thirty Hua Miao continued on and graduated from university in the decades before 1949. Some of these became ordained Methodist ministers or doctors and one became a well-regarded anthropologist (Yang Hanxian). Generally the local chapels were served by lay preachers who were trained at Shimenkan. Other young people received training as nurses and agricultural extension workers. At various points in time, agricultural and industrial extension programs were held at Shimenkan. New strains of potatoes were introduced, fruit orchards were planted on the hillsides of many villages, vegetable gardens were encouraged, and a number of Miao learned the techniques of carpentry, brickmaking, and masonry. More efficient looms were designed for home production of cloth. During the prerevolutionary decades, some villages benefited from collective endeavors to build bridges and roads, and pipe systems that brought water into the community. Teams of medical workers, from Shimenkan or from the church affiliated hospitals in nearby Zhaotong City, traveled around the area periodically. Even those who were not interested in becoming church members participated in the economic innovations, accepted treatment from the medical workers, and sent their children to the schools.' <sup id="cite_ref-601" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-601">[601]</a></sup> Education was not available to a majority of Hmong children until the 1950s: 'Both parents are involved in child rearing. Verbal skills and work skills are valued. Children are expected to assist with work tasks from an early age. Some tasks, such as gathering firewood or caring for livestock, are not gender-linked, and both sexes are encouraged to take responsibility and act independently. Mothers teach their daughters to spin and weave and to do batik and embroidery, and sons learn hunting skills from their fathers. Since the 1950s, most boys and some girls attend primary school. Relatively few continue on to middle school since this usually involves boarding schools far from their home communities.' <sup id="cite_ref-602" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-602">[602]</a></sup> Accordingly, we have decided to code for 'absent'.

Men are expected to do the heaviest work, including plowing. Women sometimes participated on short hunting trips, but trips of several days or several weeks were undertaken by groups of men; hunting trips are now illegal. Labor exchange and cooperation between households was common even before collectivization.' <sup id="cite_ref-604" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-604">[604]</a></sup> 'Women, who never bound their feet, participated in most productive activities except plowing and hunting. They typically had a greater share in the family duties since they tended vegetable gardens, were often the ones who carried water, and did most of the household chores such as preparing food and washing clothes. Men did crafts such as silversmithing, woodworking, and basketry; women wove and decorated clothing. Childcare was shared. As a rule, men had higher status and more extensive roles in ritual activities, although elderly women were often honored in ritual, and women could become ritual experts such as shamans.' <sup id="cite_ref-605" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-605">[605]</a></sup> Youngest sons were preferred heirs, but other sons and daughters received some property at marriage: 'At marriage, sons and daughters receive property and assistance in building a new house. Marriage portions previously included livestock as well as household goods, tools, jewelry, and cloth. The youngest son and his descendants inherit the parental house and remaining wealth. A couple without sons will live with a daughter, who stands as heir.' <sup id="cite_ref-606" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-606">[606]</a></sup> 'Boys were more desired than girls because inheritance is in the male line and sons carry on the worship of ancestors, as among the Chinese, but girls were also loved and desired. They had a greater economic value than among the Chinese because of the work they did even after they were married. They also kept closer contact with their parents after marriage than Chinese girls can do. This was indicated by the fact that they took their maiden name, even though they remained in the home of the deceased husband.' <sup id="cite_ref-607" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-607">[607]</a></sup> Heirlooms were passed on matrilineally: 'Miao society was predominantly patrilineal and generally organized [Page 53] in terms of exogamous village/lineage units. A patronymic system was widespread with surnames, of which there were no more than ten or twenty in use, borrowed from the Chinese. These surname groups constituted clanlike structures, which for purposes of mutual aid and large-scale rituals occasionally superseded the otherwise local village and patrilineal political organization. In some areas neolocal and/or matrilocal residence was found, but patrilocal residence was the most common. Premarital sex and courtship were characteristic among the Miao in most places, and arranged marriage was primarily according to the right of priority of a girl's maternal uncle to marry her to his son. Courtship took place at markets and festivals in which a special site sometimes was found for mingling, dancing, or antiphonal singing. Bride-price and sometimes dowry were provided by parents, once they approved their children's choices of partners. In some places, delayed transfer marriage was practiced, and divorce was acceptable, especially before the first child. Polygyny was uncommon, but not unknown. Inheritance was patrilineal, except for heirloom clothing and silver jewelry, which passed through the matriline.' <sup id="cite_ref-608" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-608">[608]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Bureaucratic positions are open to people from all social classes ♣ present ♥</b> Imperial control shifted from indirect rule to government by appointed Chinese officials before a mixed system was established after a Hmong rebellion: 'After the five hsien in the Miao frontier region were opened, from the Yuan and Ming dynasties to the beginning of the Ch'ing dynasty, they were under the control of native headmen. During the K'ang Hsi reign period of the early Ch'ing /1662-1722/, a gradual change was begun from native headmen to regular government officials. In the forty-sixth year of K'ang Hsi /1707/, the senior official /ch'ang kuan szu/ at Wu-chai, T'ien Hung-t'ien, being harsh and cruel, the provincial governor, Chao Shen-ch'iao, sent up a memorial [Page 151] 105 cont. to the Emperor requesting that he be dismissed from office and that no hereditary substitute be allowed. In the forty-eighth year /1709/, because the Miao at Liu-li of the Chen-ch'i Office did not wish to be under the control of the native headman at Pao-ching, they repeatedly requested the change from native headman to government official, and the provincial governor, Chao Shen-ch'iao, again sent up a memorial requesting transference of control to the government. In the fourth year of Yung Cheng /1726/, the headman at Pao-ching, P'eng, Yü-pin, was removed from office for being avaricious and cruel, and in the fifth year the change was made from native headman to government official. Yü-pin was peacefully settled at Liao-yang. In the fifth year of Yung Cheng, the headman at Yung-shun, P'eng Chao-huai, personally applied for the change from native headman to government official. He returned to his native place in Chi-shui, Kiangsi. San-t'u-chou /“three local chou”/ and Wu-ch'ang-kuan-szu /“five senior officials”/ under the jurisdiction of the headman of Yung-shun were also changed from native to government officials.' <sup id="cite_ref-609" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-609">[609]</a></sup> 'After the voluntary change from the native headmen in the Miao frontier region, in each Miao village there was set up a local village chief over 100 families /i.e., a pe hu chai ch'ang, “100 families village chief”/, in order to govern the Miao and bring them under the administration of government officials. But the chiefs of the 100 families were not always Miao, sometimes Chinese being appointed to these positions. As time passed, gradually, there were rapacious, unscrupulous rogues, whose mistreatment caused disturbances, so that the unprecedented Miao rebellion took place during the sixtieth year of Ch'ien Lung /1795/. When the Miao rebellion was put down in the first year of Chia Ch'ing /1796/, it was found that the policy of governing the Miao with Chinese was wrong. The then governor-general of Hunan and Kwangtung, Pi Yüan, submitted a plan to govern the Miao with Miao. (6) The ministry's response to the memorial setting up regulations for Miao officials, Miao Chiang Chin-106 Yao Shan-Hou Shih I /Important Remedial Measures for the Miao Frontier Region/, has a passage, “Miao Chiang Pe Hu Chai Ch'ang Ming-Mu Ying Cho Liang Keng Ting /The Names of the Village Leaders of 100 Families Should be Decided after Due Deliberation/,” stating: “According to the memorial, in the three provinces of Szechwan, Kweichow, and Hupeh, such areas as Yu-yang and T'ung-jen were all previously governed by headmen, but following their application to be put under government officials, the administrative areas of chou, hsien, and ying [Page 153] 106 cont. were established, subject to the jurisdiction of civil and military authorities. In the Miao villages, there were established only village chiefs to govern a unit of 100 families. However, since Chinese were also permitted to fill these posts, gradually there were rapacious, unscrupulous rogues, whose mistreatment caused disturbances. It is requested that from among the Miao who have submitted, and on whom were conferred the peacock feather decoration /for merit, in early Ch'ing times/, there be selected some intelligent, aware persons, to be appointed at each ying /military station/ as native second captain /shoupei/, lieutenant /ch'ien-tsung/, and sergeant or corporal /wai-wei/, such positions to be filled through the governor-general and governor's /tu-wu/ yamen /tu-wu ya-men/ and to be subject to the control of the civil and military authorities. When the various t'ang hsin in the Miao area have official despatches to send, they can order the said native petty officers to select Miao to question and send, and also to give them some cash and rations. When officials traveling on official business require servants, they may also recruit them from the Miao, and pay them wages according to the Chinese scales. It would appear that the 100-families village chief was originally inaugurated to discipline the Miao, but these men were unimportant and their powers limited, as that the Miao did not heed them. Moreover, among the Chinese holding such positions there were rapacious, unscrupulous rogues, whose mistreatment led to disturbances. This should naturally be explained, deliberated, and changed, so as to fix responsibility. During the recent campaign those submissive Miao who accompanied the army and won peacock feather awards are numerous, therefore from these select those who are intelligent and aware, and who have the support of the rest, and according to the customary set-up of t'u-kuan /officials governing aboriginal tribes in West China/, every Ying should have one or two men to be native second captains, under whom there should be native lieutenants and sergeants, for better control of [Page 154] 106 cont. the Miao. Their number will depend upon the number of villages put under control, and they shall be appointed by the governor-general and governor's yamen and also be under the control of regional officials. If there are fights, robberies and thefts among the Miao these native officers will be asked to make the arrests. On their inspection tours, the governor-general and governor and military officials should examine the merits and demerits of these officers and reward or punish them accordingly to demonstrate justice, following the recommendations memorialized by Governor-general Ho Lin. When the t'ang-hsin system of communication in the Miao area has been abolished, official communications should be despatched according to old methods so as to avoid delay. In the regions where the t'ang-hsin system exists as before, the local officials /t'u kuan/ should be asked to pick out honest Miao to be given the responsibility of delivering messages after being questioned, to be paid wages and rations from unallotted funds, according to the scale for t'un soldiers. When officials traveling on official business need servants, then order the said Miao to serve, and pay them wages according to recommendations memorialized.” ' <sup id="cite_ref-610" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-610">[610]</a></sup> 'According to the despatch quoted above the Miao officials, although they were military officers such as the native shou-pei and ch'ien-tsung, aside from their jurisdiction over the Miao soldiers, were also given considerable authority in Miao civilian affairs. In the tenth year of Chia Ch'ing /1805/ 107 the t'un land within the Miao area were placed under the control of Miao officials. Article 8 of Pu Fu T'un t'ien Chang-ch'eng /The Ministry's Reply concerning Regulations about the T'un Land/ states: “It would seem that after the Miao rebels were pacified in the present year in the various localities of Yung-sui, [Page 155] 107 cont. the Miao were greatly impressed by the strength of the Imperial army and surrendered land previously forcefully occupied by them. Also it would seem that if there was property of refractory Miao; it was confiscated. The fields were distributed among the law-abiding Miao to plant and pay rent, so that a Miao army could be raised and supported. Now the usurped land surrendered in the various villages totals more than 30,100 mu, and the land confiscated from the property of the rebel Miao totals more than 5,040 mu. These are now being separately registered, distributed for tilling for rent, and the revenues derived therefrom should be able to support 5,000 Miao soldiers. Among the 9,900 native Miao soldiers discharged over time and remaining, those able to bring up a plan to make a living have been sent back to their villages, and those who are old, weak, and poor have been given fields to till. Now 5,000 strong and healthy Miao soldiers have been selected, 2,000 of whom come from Feng-huang sub-prefecture; 800, from Kan-chou sub-prefecture; 1,800 from Yung-sui sub-prefecture; 100, from Ku-chang-p'ing sub-prefecture; and 300, from Pao-ching hsien. To collect the grain given over as rent, the Miao petty officers have selected in the various villages spots for building granaries to store away the public grain. Two or three honest Miao officers are chosen for each granary to supervise receipts and disbursements of the grain. The said 35,000 mu of arable land is estimated to be capable of yielding more than 22,000 shih of seeds of grain. It is estimated that there remain in various Miao granaries about 40 shih of seeds of grain, which will be used to fill the need for rations for the Miao soldiers in the intercalary month. The Miao officers are still ordered to report the actual receipts of rent grain every year.” ' <sup id="cite_ref-611" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-611">[611]</a></sup> Ling et al describe the appointment of Hmong petty officials in that time period: 'Thus a Miao official was a military official having concurrent judicial and financial duties, whose power actually was equivalent to that of a t'u-szu /headman/. The only difference was that the position was not hereditary. As for the procedure of appointment, according to a reply from the Board of War in the twenty-eighth year of Tao Kuang /1848/, Miao Pei P'ieh Chi Ta /?/ Chang-ch'eng /Regulations concerning the Commissioning of Petty Officers of Miao Defense/, it is stated: “The 486 Miao officers in the five sub-prefectures and hsien of Ku-chang-p'ing, consisting of shou-pei, ch'ien-tsung, pa-tsung, and wai-wei, were recommended by the sub-prefectures and hsien to Ch'en-yüan tao for approval, and then commissioned with official seals by the governor-general, governor, and provincial commander-in-chief. According to the regulations for the promotion of Miao t'un officers, a pa-tsung is considered by the tao and then appointed by the Board; the wai-wei is appointed directly by the tao, and when the pa-tsung becomes due for promotion to ch'ien-tsung, his commission must be confirmed by the governor-general and governor, and when the ch'ien-tsung is promoted to shou-pei, his record must be examined by the commander-in-chief. Today, in the appointment of Miao petty officers, even wai-wei have to be commissioned by the governor-general and governor, hence there is a great deal of red tape involved. It is recommended that the Miao defence petty officers can be selected according to the regulations governing the t'un petty officers of the tao troups /piao, “banner”/. Hereafter the Miao wai-wei and pa-tsung are to be changed to be appointed by the tao, the Miao ch'ien-tsung to be appointed by the provincial governor with official seal, and the shou-pei to be appointed by the governor-general. The Board of War has found that the previous procedure of appointing Miao officials, through joint deliberation of the provincial governorgeneral, governor, and commander-in-chief is 108 too involved, [Page 157] 108 cont. and in order to simplify it the recommendations in the memorial of the said governor-general should be followed.” From this it may be seen that in the beginning, the appointment of a Miao official was regarded as a serious matter. A petty officer such as a wai wei had to be commissioned by the governor-general and governor.' <sup id="cite_ref-612" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-612">[612]</a></sup> Administrative organization differed somewhat between the individual districts: 'With regard to the organization of Miao officials at that time, it differed somewhat in the five hsien and sub-prefectures of the Miao region.

The 384 fighting men were appointed in 1805 and picked from among the guard soldiers.' <sup id="cite_ref-615" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-615">[615]</a></sup> 'The fourth, sixth, seventh, and eighth tu /subdivision of a hsien/ in Pao-ching each had a Miao shou-pei, nine ch'ien-tsung, 12 pa-tsung, 31 wai-wei, and 300 Miao soldiers.' <sup id="cite_ref-616" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-616">[616]</a></sup> 'The Miao officials appointed a(■) Ku-chang-p'ing included one shou-pei, two ch'ien-tsung, four pa-tsung, 12 wai-wei, and 100 Miao soldiers, controlling 58 Miao villages.' <sup id="cite_ref-617" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-617">[617]</a></sup> 'Regulations concerning Miao officials were set up in the second year of Chia Ch'ing (1797), and were still in existence when the authors were carrying out their investigations in the Miao area in 1933.

Furthermore, since the Miao dreaded seeing Chinese officials, then the Miao shou-pei, ch'ien-tsung, pa-tsung, and wai-wei were set up with the responsibility of controlling the Miao. In cases when the Miao were involved in such affairs as fights or theft, these petty officers were charged with the responsibility of apprehending the offenders. For the official despatches to be sent it was necessary to rely on them to get the messengers, and the pressing for rents and grain were also under the Miao officials' control. Moreover, the Miao petty officials were asked to submit seasonal affidavits as to whether there were Chinese entering the Miao villages.' <sup id="cite_ref-619" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-619">[619]</a></sup> 'The policy of having Miao officials to govern the Miao has been in practice now for 140 years. At the time of the original separation of the execution and administrative functions between the Chinese and the Miao, the idea of Miao regulating the Miao could be said to have been aimed at the abuses of the time. But now after a hundred and some tens of years, the Miao have gradually been sinicized. Formerly, there was the difference between the civilized and uncivilized Miao, but today they have all become civilized. The policy of separate administration for the Miao and the Chinese has been informally discarded. Consequently, the regulations for Miao officials should be abolished. But, since the Republic, the Miao officials are still able to exist, largely because Chinese officials have been profiting by taking brides for filling official posts. On the other hand, since the Miao officials get their positions through paying bribes, they go to great lengths to make extortions from the Miao people. The Miao people detest the Miao petty officials more than they do the Chinese officials. Moreover, today, the various hsien in the Miao area have been changed to the system of hsiang /villages/ and chen /towns/, each governed by a head, known as hsiang chang or chen chang, respectively. In view of this change, Miao officials have become superfluous. It is hoped that the authorities in the region will be able to do away with them soon.' <sup id="cite_ref-620" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-620">[620]</a></sup> Ling et al describe the development of the t'un system: 'During the Ts'ung Cheng reign period /1628/ /the end of the Ming dynasty/, the Miao rebelled, demolishing the guard stations and leveling the border wall. The “Great Wall” to blockade Miao country disappeared. The 7,800 guard troops /shou ping/ in the Miao area of the Ming dynasty were reduced to 1,600 men at the beginning of the Ch'ing dynasty. When the rebellion of Wu San-kwei was pacified and all was peaceful again, there was another reduction of 500 men, leaving 1,100 men. Military strengh was slight and the defense system was relaxed. Further, following the change from native headmen to Chinese officials, and the use of Chinese as the head of every hundred families, intercourse between the Chinese and the Miao was no longer prohibited. In the twenty-ninth year of Ch'ien Lung /i.e. 1764/, in view of the Miao having undergone acculturation for a long time, they were allowed to intermarry with the Chinese. The original idea was to change the Miao by teaching, but with the passing of time evils developed, when rapacious Chinese under the pretext of trade entered the Miao area and seduced crafty Miao to enter into thievery. Unlike soldiers they entered Miao country for personal reasons and mistreated the Miao. The Miao made a pretext of these guest men's exploitations and encroachments on their land and banded together to make trouble, and brought about the great rebellion during the Ch'ien Lung /1736-95/ and Chia Ch'ing /1796-1820/ reign periods. After the rebellion was put down, the Manchu court realized that the time was yet inopportune to change the Miao by teaching, and the blockade policy was once more used. The various hsiens along the Miao border were heavily garrisoned for protection.' <sup id="cite_ref-621" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-621">[621]</a></sup> 'At that time in addition to stationing heavy complements of soldiers in the Miao area, there were also put up a total of 1,121 stone guard houses /tiao ch'ia/ along the ruins of the wall left from the Ming dynasty. In addition to the stationing of government troops at important positions, there were more than 800 of these guard houses where 9,000 soldiers were left to protect the border. Later when the nation became short of money, it was not possible to maintain large forces in this deep interior area for defense. Thus, suddenly, the frontier guards were withdrawn, then the stone guard houses became [Page 170] 115 cont. empty, and there was fear that the fierce Miao would start a rebellion. At this time Fu Nai of Yüan-ch'en tao met with Brigade General Fu Chih-na of Chen-kan Chen and summoned together people of the sub-prefecture to discuss a long-range plan. And so they began the t'un system of defense. Fields were allotted to feed the fighters and to defend the guard houses against the Miao. As for the people's /i.e. Chinese/ land, except for fields for sustenance, a male could retain three tou of grain, a woman one tou. As for the rest of the land seven were allotted while three were retained, for one shih of grain three tou was personally retained, and seven tou given up for allotment, to feed the fighters and guard the frontier. In the Feng-huang area there were more than 830 stone guard houses, requiring 4,000 men to man them in rotation. Further, 1,000 men were trained to be combat ready. The more than 22,000 mu of land allotted were not enough to meet the expense, and so another allotment of more than 12,300 mu at Lu-ch'i and Mo-yang was made. There were also 127 stone petty military stations /tiao pao/ at Kan-chou, manned by 800 soldiers, supported by more than 2,170 mu of allotted land. The original sect of government of Yung-sui, before the Miao rebellion during the reign period of Ch'ien Lung and Chia Ch'ing, was at Wei-ch'eng, which was entirely surrounded by the Miao. In the second year of Chia Ch'ing /1797/, the seat of government was moved to Hua-yüan with a newly built yamen. There were 126 stone guard houses with 2,000 soldiers. The people's land, i.e. Chinese land, usurped by rebels and recovered for public use, totaled more than 17,110 mu. There were over 70 stone military stations /tiao pao/, at Pao-ching, with 300 soldiers and over 2,170 mu of allotted land. There were only 18 stone guard houses at Ku-chang-p'ing with a hundred soldiers and over 120 mu of allotted land.' <sup id="cite_ref-622" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-622">[622]</a></sup> 'The above refers to Chinese t'un /min t'un/. In addition, there were also Miao t'un. After the suppression of the Miao rebellion, the Miao tribes, awed by military might, surrendered all the Chinese land formerly forcefully usurped by them, and [Page 171] 115 cont. also searched into the properties of the rebel Miao and decided to return them for public use. The forcefully usurped land totaling over 30,100 mu and the rebels' properties totaling over 5,400 mu were redistributed among the law-abiding Miao to farm. Granaries were built to collect rent /tsu/ for the maintenance of Miao soldiers. The pressing for rent, the inspecting of fields, the distribution and transportation of grain, and other duties were all the responsibility of Miao officials.' <sup id="cite_ref-623" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-623">[623]</a></sup> 'The total of the above fields and land is 131,640.6 mu. In the thirteenth year of Chia Ch'ing /1808/ a total of 15,219.3 mu of fields and land was surveyed in the three hsien, Feng-huang, Kan-chou, and Yung-sui. In the sixteenth year of Chia Ch'ing /1811/ another total of 5,873.2 mu of fields and land was surveyed, totaling 152,157.1 mu of fields and land. Of this besides the land allocated to the army for horses and farming, land lost through floods and erosion, and also the land used for stone guard houses and surroundings, totaling 11,084.3 mu, and another 37,849 mu distributed among the t'un able-bodied males, leaders, the aged, and the young, there remained 103,223.8 mu. Farmers were recruited to farm this land and rent /in kind/ collected. The annual receipt in grain totaled 105,488 shih, three tou, and nine sheng.' <sup id="cite_ref-624" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-624">[624]</a></sup> 'The t'un fields in the Miao frontier were divided into people's /i.e. Chinese/ t'uns and Miao t'uns, the two being entirely different in nature. The t'un males working on the Chinese t'uns were also divided into t'un men and fighting men. The t'un men received fields to cultivate, and guarded the t'un guard houses. The fighting men, also called home guards, were solely trained for military operations, and did not farm. In the five sub-prefectures and hsiens of the Miao frontier there are 7,000 t'un men, from among whom are appointed hsiao-ch'i, tsung-ch'i, and pe-tsung to facilitate control. The distribution of fields was as follows: the men /san ting/ are each given 4.5 mu; the hsiao-ch'i, 5.5 mu; the tsung-ch'i, 6.5 mu; and the pe-tsung, 7.5 mu. There are 1,000 fighting men, each being given 3 shih, 6 tou of rice per year. The non-fighting men are also each given annually 10.8 liang of silver for salt and vegetables. The hsiao-ch'i receives each year 12 liang of silver; the tsung-ch'i, 13.2 liang of silver; the pe-tsung, 16.8 liang of silver. Therefore, in the Chinese t'un, the fields and land left over after the t'un men have received their fields to plant and care for are leased out for the collection of rent. Granaries (Illus. 57) have been built to store the grain, and general t'un leaders are set up to manage these matters. There are no t'un men in the Miao t'uns, and the t'un fields are allotted to people to cultivate /Illus. 57 and 58 on pages 124 and 125/ 126 for the collection of rent, in order to feed the Miao soldiers, under the control of the Miao officials. The t'un fields in the Miao frontier region, at the inception of the system, totaled 150,000 mu of arable land, of which barely a third was directly cultivated by t'un personnel, the rest being allotted out as rented fields. Today, the t'un army in the Miao frontier region is about 1,000 strong. The maintainance of the Black Flag Battalion of the Miao troops (Illus. 58) largely comes from the rented fields. T'un fields were set up to support troops on the spot as a defense against the Miao. Today, the Miao have been largely acculturated by the Chinese and the boundary line between the Miao and the Chinese is gradually becoming [Page 183] 124 [Page 185] 126 cont. obliterated. There is no longer the need for this kind of system of t'un defense against the Miao. In fact, unrest in the Miao area today is often due to the maladministration of the t'un fields system. The Miao petty officers and the t'un leaders often are oppressive in collecting rent and sometimes are corrupt in their methods, thus causing dissatisfaction and disturbances. In the twenty-sixth year of the Republic /1937/ the Miao rebellion in western Hunan arose because of the t'un land system. It resulted in the burning of t'un granaries and killing of t'un officers. Although the rebellion was pacified only after bloody and expensive campaigns, it is imperative to change the t'un and enter the newly opened or reclaimed land as available for taxation, so as to reach a fundamental solution.' <sup id="cite_ref-625" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-625">[625]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b>♠ Education is available to people from all social classes ♣ absent ♥</b> Christian missionaries established primary and secondary schools, but this process did not start until the late 19th and early 20th centuries: 'The first missionaries among the Hua Miao belonged to the Bible Christian Church, a dissenting Methodist sect, that placed great importance on the ability to read the Bible for oneself. With missionary assistance and encouragement, a simple phonetic script was developed in 1905 and in the following years the New Testament was translated in full into Dian Dongbei. Hymnals and study guides were also produced, and a series of school primers. In the 1930s and 1940s a small newspaper was published. Village chapels, built with communal effort, functioned also as one-room primary schools and centers for adult education. The mountain community of Shimenkan (Stone Gateway) in northwestern Guizhou served as the headquarters of church activity. In addition to its own large primary school, it offered secondary schooling and teacher training. At least thirty Hua Miao continued on and graduated from university in the decades before 1949. Some of these became ordained Methodist ministers or doctors and one became a well-regarded anthropologist (Yang Hanxian). Generally the local chapels were served by lay preachers who were trained at Shimenkan. Other young people received training as nurses and agricultural extension workers. At various points in time, agricultural and industrial extension programs were held at Shimenkan. New strains of potatoes were introduced, fruit orchards were planted on the hillsides of many villages, vegetable gardens were encouraged, and a number of Miao learned the techniques of carpentry, brickmaking, and masonry. More efficient looms were designed for home production of cloth. During the prerevolutionary decades, some villages benefited from collective endeavors to build bridges and roads, and pipe systems that brought water into the community. Teams of medical workers, from Shimenkan or from the churchaffiliated hospitals in nearby Zhaotong City, traveled around the area periodically. Even those who were not interested in becoming church members participated in the economic innovations, accepted treatment from the medical workers, and sent their children to the schools.' <sup id="cite_ref-626" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-626">[626]</a></sup> Education was not available to a majority of Hmong children until the 1950s: 'Both parents are involved in child rearing. Verbal skills and work skills are valued. Children are expected to assist with work tasks from an early age. Some tasks, such as gathering firewood or caring for livestock, are not gender-linked, and both sexes are encouraged to take responsibility and act independently. Mothers teach their daughters to spin and weave and to do batik and embroidery, and sons learn hunting skills from their fathers. Since the 1950s, most boys and some girls attend primary school. Relatively few continue on to middle school since this usually involves boarding schools far from their home communities.' <sup id="cite_ref-627" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-627">[627]</a></sup> Accordingly, we have decided to code for 'absent'.

<dd><b>♠ Property can be owned by people from all social classes ♣ present ♥</b> There was little social stratification among the Hmong: 'The various Miao groups are for the most part an unstratified agricultural people found in the uplands of several provinces of China and related to the Hmong of Southeast Asia. They are distinguished by language, dress, historical traditions, and cultural practice from neighboring ethnic groups and the dominant Han Chinese. They are not culturally homogeneous and the differences between local Miao cultures are often as great as between Miao and non-Miao neighbors. The term "Miao" is Chinese, and means "weeds" or "sprouts." Chinese minority policies since the 1950s treat these diverse groups as a single nationality and associate them with the San Miao Kingdom of central China mentioned in histories of the Han dynasty (200 BC-AD 200).' <sup id="cite_ref-628" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-628">[628]</a></sup> 'Given the long period of Chinese rule, it is not possible to reconstruct precontact organization, though some areas still retain older lineage and clan names. Owing to dispersion, population decimation, and frequent migration, the multisurname settlement seems to be the most common. There was little class differentiation in the villages, and no formal political structure. Villages do not seem to have been formally linked by any kind of tribal organization and there was no formal political structure within villages.' <sup id="cite_ref-629" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-629">[629]</a></sup> Local leadership was largely informal: 'Respected knowledgeable elders, heads of family groups, and religious experts of both genders served as informal leaders. Among the more Sinicized, landlords and those who had some literacy in Chinese exercised power in the community. Under the present system, those who are members of the Communist party stand as the official leaders of the community.' <sup id="cite_ref-630" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-630">[630]</a></sup> 'Political Institutions. The Cowrie Shell Miao were Chinese citizens, and officially entitled to the same rights and privileges as other Chinese. Their form of local government was Chinese. The leaders of the village [Page [44a]] were the elders, men who stood at the head of groups of closely related families, known as pao. There were three pao in Yang-chia-sai, and hence three elders, who formed the village council. Disputes within the family were settled, if possible, in the family, in the pao within the pao. Disputes within the village between members of different pao were ordinarily settled by the three elders. If, however, they were unable to effect a settlement, the litigants had the right to carry their dispute to the next higher official, the lien pao chang, who was a Chinese, and so on up to the Chinese court in the hsien city.' <sup id="cite_ref-631" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-631">[631]</a></sup> While elders and ritual specialists were respected, there were no distinct social classes: 'From very early times the Miao have had tribes but not tribal chiefs, and therefore they do not have different classes nor differentiated marriage or funeral ceremonial customs. The funeral for a Miao sorcerer, however, is slightly different from that for the ordinary person. When a sorcerer is at the point of death, 103 two other sorcerer priests are summoned to the house. When he breathes his last, the members of the family must not weep. One sorcerer priest climbs on the house and removes a few tiles from it to make an opening, which is called “opening the heaven's gate.” The other sorcerer priest sits below behind the deceased, and as soon as he sees “heaven's gate” has been opened, he immediately lets out a loud cry, to which the one on the roof responds with another cry, and thus, the two men, one above and the other below, start their ritual. It is said that the one above opens heaven's gate, and the one below shuts the grove /literally, “earth storehouse”/. This is to cause the departed sorcerer not to enter hell but to ascend to heaven. After this the family members may begin to cry and weep.' <sup id="cite_ref-632" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-632">[632]</a></sup> However, Hmong populations found themselves at the bottom end of a complex interethnic hierarchy when integrated into the Chinese imperial structure: 'Chinese scholarship links the present-day Miao to tribal confederations that moved southward some 2,000 years ago from the plain between the Yellow River and the Yangtze toward the Dongting Lake area. These became the San Miao mentioned in Han dynasty texts. Over the next thousand years, between the Han and the Song dynasties, these presumed ancestors of the Miao continued to migrate westward and southward, under pressure from expanding Han populations and the imperial armies. Chinese texts and Miao oral history establish that over those years the ancestors settled in western Hunan and Guizhou, with some moving south into Guangxi or west along the Wu River to southeastern Sichuan and into Yunnan. The period was marked by a number of uprisings and battles between Miao and the Han or local indigenous groups, recalled in the oral histories of local groups. Though the term "Miao" was sometimes used in Tang and Song histories, the more usual term was "Man," meaning "barbarians." Migration continued through the Yuan, Ming, and early Qing, with some groups moving into mainland Southeast Asia. The retreat from Han control brought some into territories controlled by the Yi in northeast Yunnan/northwest Guizhou. The various migrations can also be seen as "vertical" migrations into the undeveloped hillside and mountain areas that were of lesser interest to Han. Depending on the terrain, the settled farming cited in Miao historical myths gave way to shifting slash-and-burn agriculture, facilitated by the introduction of the Irish potato and maize in the sixteenth century, and the adoption of high-altitude/cool-weather crops like barley, buckwheat, and oats. Farming was supplemented by forest hunting, fishing, gathering, and pastoralism. During the Qing, uprisings and military encounters escalated. There were major disturbances in western Hunan (1795-1806) and a continuous series of rebellions in Guizhou (1854-1872). Chinese policies toward the Miao shifted among assimilation, containment in "stockaded villages," dispersal, removal, and extermination. The frequent threat of "Miao rebellion" caused considerable anxiety to the state; in actuality, many of these uprisings included Bouyei, Dong, Hui, and other ethnic groups, including Han settlers and demobilized soldiers. At issue were heavy taxation, rising landlordism, rivalries over local resources, and official corruption. One of the last Miao uprisings occurred in 1936 in western Hunan in opposition to Guomindang (Republican) continuation of the tuntian system, which forced the peasants to open up new lands and grow crops for the state.' <sup id="cite_ref-633" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-633">[633]</a></sup> 'From Song on, in periods of relative peace, government control was exercised through the tusi system of indirect rule by appointed native headmen who collected taxes, organized corvée, and kept the peace. Miao filled this role in Hunan and eastern Guizhou, but farther west the rulers were often drawn from a hereditary Yi nobility, a system that lasted into the twentieth century. In Guizhou, some tusi claimed Han ancestry, but were probably drawn from the ranks of assimilated Bouyei, Dong, and Miao. Government documents refer to the "Sheng Miao" (raw Miao), meaning those living in areas beyond government control and not paying taxes or labor service to the state. In the sixteenth century, in the more pacified areas, the implementation of the policy of gaitu guiliu began the replacement of native rulers with regular civilian and military officials, a few of whom were drawn from assimilated minority families. Land became a commodity, creating both landlords and some freeholding peasants in the areas affected. In the Yunnan-Guizhou border area, the tusi system continued and Miao purchase of land and participation in local markets was restricted by law until the Republican period (1911-1949).' <sup id="cite_ref-634" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-634">[634]</a></sup> Most Hmong subsistence producers were either smallholders or dependent tenants who worked lands owned by landlords from other ethnic groups: 'Prior to the 1950s land reform, some Miao were smallholders. Many, if not most, were tenants on lands owned by Han, Yi, Hui, and others. Few were true landlords, and most who rented out land were likely to work part of their holdings themselves with family labor. All land is now owned by the state, including undeveloped mountain and forest lands, thus limiting any expansion beyond lands officially assigned to an individual or village. In the process, pastoralism and forest hunting/gathering have been reduced. Before land reform, some Miao areas followed the practice of lineage or hamlet ownership of mountain and hillside lands even where some private holdings existed. People could open new lands for farming and settlement, share village pastures, or hunt away from their home area.' <sup id="cite_ref-635" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-635">[635]</a></sup> Accordingly, low social status and ethnicity intersected in the case of the Hmong. While most were tenants and thus often did not own the land they farmed, they could hold and exchange property in movables (see above). Smallholders owned their own plot of land.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Bureaucratic positions are open to people from all ethnic/racial groups ♣ present ♥</b> Imperial control shifted from indirect rule to government by appointed Chinese officials before a mixed system was established after a Hmong rebellion: 'After the five hsien in the Miao frontier region were opened, from the Yuan and Ming dynasties to the beginning of the Ch'ing dynasty, they were under the control of native headmen. During the K'ang Hsi reign period of the early Ch'ing /1662-1722/, a gradual change was begun from native headmen to regular government officials. In the forty-sixth year of K'ang Hsi /1707/, the senior official /ch'ang kuan szu/ at Wu-chai, T'ien Hung-t'ien, being harsh and cruel, the provincial governor, Chao Shen-ch'iao, sent up a memorial [Page 151] 105 cont. to the Emperor requesting that he be dismissed from office and that no hereditary substitute be allowed. In the forty-eighth year /1709/, because the Miao at Liu-li of the Chen-ch'i Office did not wish to be under the control of the native headman at Pao-ching, they repeatedly requested the change from native headman to government official, and the provincial governor, Chao Shen-ch'iao, again sent up a memorial requesting transference of control to the government. In the fourth year of Yung Cheng /1726/, the headman at Pao-ching, P'eng, Yü-pin, was removed from office for being avaricious and cruel, and in the fifth year the change was made from native headman to government official. Yü-pin was peacefully settled at Liao-yang. In the fifth year of Yung Cheng, the headman at Yung-shun, P'eng Chao-huai, personally applied for the change from native headman to government official. He returned to his native place in Chi-shui, Kiangsi. San-t'u-chou /“three local chou”/ and Wu-ch'ang-kuan-szu /“five senior officials”/ under the jurisdiction of the headman of Yung-shun were also changed from native to government officials.' <sup id="cite_ref-636" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-636">[636]</a></sup> 'After the voluntary change from the native headmen in the Miao frontier region, in each Miao village there was set up a local village chief over 100 families /i.e., a pe hu chai ch'ang, “100 families village chief”/, in order to govern the Miao and bring them under the administration of government officials. But the chiefs of the 100 families were not always Miao, sometimes Chinese being appointed to these positions. As time passed, gradually, there were rapacious, unscrupulous rogues, whose mistreatment caused disturbances, so that the unprecedented Miao rebellion took place during the sixtieth year of Ch'ien Lung /1795/. When the Miao rebellion was put down in the first year of Chia Ch'ing /1796/, it was found that the policy of governing the Miao with Chinese was wrong. The then governor-general of Hunan and Kwangtung, Pi Yüan, submitted a plan to govern the Miao with Miao. (6) The ministry's response to the memorial setting up regulations for Miao officials, Miao Chiang Chin-106 Yao Shan-Hou Shih I /Important Remedial Measures for the Miao Frontier Region/, has a passage, “Miao Chiang Pe Hu Chai Ch'ang Ming-Mu Ying Cho Liang Keng Ting /The Names of the Village Leaders of 100 Families Should be Decided after Due Deliberation/,” stating: “According to the memorial, in the three provinces of Szechwan, Kweichow, and Hupeh, such areas as Yu-yang and T'ung-jen were all previously governed by headmen, but following their application to be put under government officials, the administrative areas of chou, hsien, and ying [Page 153] 106 cont. were established, subject to the jurisdiction of civil and military authorities. In the Miao villages, there were established only village chiefs to govern a unit of 100 families. However, since Chinese were also permitted to fill these posts, gradually there were rapacious, unscrupulous rogues, whose mistreatment caused disturbances. It is requested that from among the Miao who have submitted, and on whom were conferred the peacock feather decoration /for merit, in early Ch'ing times/, there be selected some intelligent, aware persons, to be appointed at each ying /military station/ as native second captain /shoupei/, lieutenant /ch'ien-tsung/, and sergeant or corporal /wai-wei/, such positions to be filled through the governor-general and governor's /tu-wu/ yamen /tu-wu ya-men/ and to be subject to the control of the civil and military authorities. When the various t'ang hsin in the Miao area have official despatches to send, they can order the said native petty officers to select Miao to question and send, and also to give them some cash and rations. When officials traveling on official business require servants, they may also recruit them from the Miao, and pay them wages according to the Chinese scales. It would appear that the 100-families village chief was originally inaugurated to discipline the Miao, but these men were unimportant and their powers limited, as that the Miao did not heed them. Moreover, among the Chinese holding such positions there were rapacious, unscrupulous rogues, whose mistreatment led to disturbances. This should naturally be explained, deliberated, and changed, so as to fix responsibility. During the recent campaign those submissive Miao who accompanied the army and won peacock feather awards are numerous, therefore from these select those who are intelligent and aware, and who have the support of the rest, and according to the customary set-up of t'u-kuan /officials governing aboriginal tribes in West China/, every Ying should have one or two men to be native second captains, under whom there should be native lieutenants and sergeants, for better control of [Page 154] 106 cont. the Miao. Their number will depend upon the number of villages put under control, and they shall be appointed by the governor-general and governor's yamen and also be under the control of regional officials. If there are fights, robberies and thefts among the Miao these native officers will be asked to make the arrests. On their inspection tours, the governor-general and governor and military officials should examine the merits and demerits of these officers and reward or punish them accordingly to demonstrate justice, following the recommendations memorialized by Governor-general Ho Lin. When the t'ang-hsin system of communication in the Miao area has been abolished, official communications should be despatched according to old methods so as to avoid delay. In the regions where the t'ang-hsin system exists as before, the local officials /t'u kuan/ should be asked to pick out honest Miao to be given the responsibility of delivering messages after being questioned, to be paid wages and rations from unallotted funds, according to the scale for t'un soldiers. When officials traveling on official business need servants, then order the said Miao to serve, and pay them wages according to recommendations memorialized.” ' <sup id="cite_ref-637" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-637">[637]</a></sup> 'According to the despatch quoted above the Miao officials, although they were military officers such as the native shou-pei and ch'ien-tsung, aside from their jurisdiction over the Miao soldiers, were also given considerable authority in Miao civilian affairs. In the tenth year of Chia Ch'ing /1805/ 107 the t'un land within the Miao area were placed under the control of Miao officials. Article 8 of Pu Fu T'un t'ien Chang-ch'eng /The Ministry's Reply concerning Regulations about the T'un Land/ states: “It would seem that after the Miao rebels were pacified in the present year in the various localities of Yung-sui, [Page 155] 107 cont. the Miao were greatly impressed by the strength of the Imperial army and surrendered land previously forcefully occupied by them. Also it would seem that if there was property of refractory Miao; it was confiscated. The fields were distributed among the law-abiding Miao to plant and pay rent, so that a Miao army could be raised and supported. Now the usurped land surrendered in the various villages totals more than 30,100 mu, and the land confiscated from the property of the rebel Miao totals more than 5,040 mu. These are now being separately registered, distributed for tilling for rent, and the revenues derived therefrom should be able to support 5,000 Miao soldiers. Among the 9,900 native Miao soldiers discharged over time and remaining, those able to bring up a plan to make a living have been sent back to their villages, and those who are old, weak, and poor have been given fields to till. Now 5,000 strong and healthy Miao soldiers have been selected, 2,000 of whom come from Feng-huang sub-prefecture; 800, from Kan-chou sub-prefecture; 1,800 from Yung-sui sub-prefecture; 100, from Ku-chang-p'ing sub-prefecture; and 300, from Pao-ching hsien. To collect the grain given over as rent, the Miao petty officers have selected in the various villages spots for building granaries to store away the public grain. Two or three honest Miao officers are chosen for each granary to supervise receipts and disbursements of the grain. The said 35,000 mu of arable land is estimated to be capable of yielding more than 22,000 shih of seeds of grain. It is estimated that there remain in various Miao granaries about 40 shih of seeds of grain, which will be used to fill the need for rations for the Miao soldiers in the intercalary month. The Miao officers are still ordered to report the actual receipts of rent grain every year.” ' <sup id="cite_ref-638" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-638">[638]</a></sup> Ling et al describe the appointment of Hmong petty officials in that time period: 'Thus a Miao official was a military official having concurrent judicial and financial duties, whose power actually was equivalent to that of a t'u-szu /headman/. The only difference was that the position was not hereditary. As for the procedure of appointment, according to a reply from the Board of War in the twenty-eighth year of Tao Kuang /1848/, Miao Pei P'ieh Chi Ta /?/ Chang-ch'eng /Regulations concerning the Commissioning of Petty Officers of Miao Defense/, it is stated: “The 486 Miao officers in the five sub-prefectures and hsien of Ku-chang-p'ing, consisting of shou-pei, ch'ien-tsung, pa-tsung, and wai-wei, were recommended by the sub-prefectures and hsien to Ch'en-yüan tao for approval, and then commissioned with official seals by the governor-general, governor, and provincial commander-in-chief. According to the regulations for the promotion of Miao t'un officers, a pa-tsung is considered by the tao and then appointed by the Board; the wai-wei is appointed directly by the tao, and when the pa-tsung becomes due for promotion to ch'ien-tsung, his commission must be confirmed by the governor-general and governor, and when the ch'ien-tsung is promoted to shou-pei, his record must be examined by the commander-in-chief. Today, in the appointment of Miao petty officers, even wai-wei have to be commissioned by the governor-general and governor, hence there is a great deal of red tape involved. It is recommended that the Miao defense petty officers can be selected according to the regulations governing the t'un petty officers of the tao troups /piao, “banner”/. Hereafter the Miao wai-wei and pa-tsung are to be changed to be appointed by the tao, the Miao ch'ien-tsung to be appointed by the provincial governor with official seal, and the shou-pei to be appointed by the governor-general. The Board of War has found that the previous procedure of appointing Miao officials, through joint deliberation of the provincial governorgeneral, governor, and commander-in-chief is 108 too involved, [Page 157] 108 cont. and in order to simplify it the recommendations in the memorial of the said governor-general should be followed.” From this it may be seen that in the beginning, the appointment of a Miao official was regarded as a serious matter. A petty officer such as a wai wei had to be commissioned by the governor-general and governor.' <sup id="cite_ref-639" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-639">[639]</a></sup> Administrative organization differed somewhat between the individual districts: 'With regard to the organization of Miao officials at that time, it differed somewhat in the five hsien and sub-prefectures of the Miao region.

Furthermore, since the Miao dreaded seeing Chinese officials, then the Miao shou-pei, ch'ien-tsung, pa-tsung, and wai-wei were set up with the responsibility of controlling the Miao. In cases when the Miao were involved in such affairs as fights or theft, these petty officers were charged with the responsibility of apprehending the offenders. For the official despatches to be sent it was necessary to rely on them to get the messengers, and the pressing for rents and grain were also under the Miao officials' control. Moreover, the Miao petty officials were asked to submit seasonal affidavits as to whether there were Chinese entering the Miao villages.' <sup id="cite_ref-646" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-646">[646]</a></sup> 'The policy of having Miao officials to govern the Miao has been in practice now for 140 years. At the time of the original separation of the execution and administrative functions between the Chinese and the Miao, the idea of Miao regulating the Miao could be said to have been aimed at the abuses of the time. But now after a hundred and some tens of years, the Miao have gradually been sinicized. Formerly, there was the difference between the civilized and uncivilized Miao, but today they have all become civilized. The policy of separate administration for the Miao and the Chinese has been informally discarded. Consequently, the regulations for Miao officials should be abolished. But, since the Republic, the Miao officials are still able to exist, largely because Chinese officials have been profiting by taking brides for filling official posts. On the other hand, since the Miao officials get their positions through paying bribes, they go to great lengths to make extortions from the Miao people. The Miao people detest the Miao petty officials more than they do the Chinese officials. Moreover, today, the various hsien in the Miao area have been changed to the system of hsiang /villages/ and chen /towns/, each governed by a head, known as hsiang chang or chen chang, respectively. In view of this change, Miao officials have become superfluous. It is hoped that the authorities in the region will be able to do away with them soon.' <sup id="cite_ref-647" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-647">[647]</a></sup> Ling et al describe the development of the t'un system: 'During the Ts'ung Cheng reign period /1628/ /the end of the Ming dynasty/, the Miao rebelled, demolishing the guard stations and leveling the border wall. The “Great Wall” to blockade Miao country disappeared. The 7,800 guard troops /shou ping/ in the Miao area of the Ming dynasty were reduced to 1,600 men at the beginning of the Ch'ing dynasty. When the rebellion of Wu San-kwei was pacified and all was peaceful again, there was another reduction of 500 men, leaving 1,100 men. Military strength was slight and the defence system was relaxed. Further, following the change from native headmen to Chinese officials, and the use of Chinese as the head of every hundred families, intercourse between the Chinese and the Miao was no longer prohibited. In the twenty-ninth year of Ch'ien Lung /i.e. 1764/, in view of the Miao having undergone acculturation for a long time, they were allowed to intermarry with the Chinese. The original idea was to change the Miao by teaching, but with the passing of time evils developed, when rapacious Chinese under the pretext of trade entered the Miao area and seduced crafty Miao to enter into thievery. Unlike soldiers they entered Miao country for personal reasons and mistreated the Miao. The Miao made a pretext of these guest men's exploitations and encroachments on their land and banded together to make trouble, and brought about the great rebellion during the Ch'ien Lung /1736-95/ and Chia Ch'ing /1796-1820/ reign periods. After the rebellion was put down, the Manchu court realized that the time was yet inopportune to change the Miao by teaching, and the blockade policy was once more used. The various hsiens along the Miao border were heavily garrisoned for protection.' <sup id="cite_ref-648" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-648">[648]</a></sup> 'At that time in addition to stationing heavy complements of soldiers in the Miao area, there were also put up a total of 1,121 stone guard houses /tiao ch'ia/ along the ruins of the wall left from the Ming dynasty. In addition to the stationing of government troops at important positions, there were more than 800 of these guard houses where 9,000 soldiers were left to protect the border. Later when the nation became short of money, it was not possible to maintain large forces in this deep interior area for defence. Thus, suddenly, the frontier guards were withdrawn, then the stone guard houses became [Page 170] 115 cont. empty, and there was fear that the fierce Miao would start a rebellion. At this time Fu Nai of Yüan-ch'en tao met with Brigade General Fu Chih-na of Chen-kan Chen and summoned together people of the sub-prefecture to discuss a long-range plan. And so they began the t'un system of defense. Fields were allotted to feed the fighters and to defend the guard houses against the Miao. As for the people's /i.e. Chinese/ land, except for fields for sustenance, a male could retain three tou of grain, a woman one tou. As for the rest of the land seven were allotted while three were retained, for one shih of grain three tou was personally retained, and seven tou given up for allotment, to feed the fighters and guard the frontier. In the Feng-huang area there were more than 830 stone guard houses, requiring 4,000 men to man them in rotation. Further, 1,000 men were trained to be combat ready. The more than 22,000 mu of land allotted were not enough to meet the expense, and so another allotment of more than 12,300 mu at Lu-ch'i and Mo-yang was made. There were also 127 stone petty military stations /tiao pao/ at Kan-chou, manned by 800 soldiers, supported by more than 2,170 mu of allotted land. The original sect of government of Yung-sui, before the Miao rebellion during the reign period of Ch'ien Lung and Chia Ch'ing, was at Wei-ch'eng, which was entirely surrounded by the Miao. In the second year of Chia Ch'ing /1797/, the seat of government was moved to Hua-yüan with a newly built yamen. There were 126 stone guard houses with 2,000 soldiers. The people's land, i.e. Chinese land, usurped by rebels and recovered for public use, totaled more than 17,110 mu. There were over 70 stone military stations /tiao pao/, at Pao-ching, with 300 soldiers and over 2,170 mu of allotted land. There were only 18 stone guard houses at Ku-chang-p'ing with a hundred soldiers and over 120 mu of allotted land.' <sup id="cite_ref-649" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-649">[649]</a></sup> 'The above refers to Chinese t'un /min t'un/. In addition, there were also Miao t'un. After the suppression of the Miao rebellion, the Miao tribes, awed by military might, surrendered all the Chinese land formerly forcefully usurped by them, and [Page 171] 115 cont. also searched into the properties of the rebel Miao and decided to return them for public use. The forcefully usurped land totaling over 30,100 mu and the rebels' properties totaling over 5,400 mu were redistributed among the law-abiding Miao to farm. Granaries were built to collect rent /tsu/ for the maintenance of Miao soldiers. The pressing for rent, the inspecting of fields, the distribution and transportation of grain, and other duties were all the responsibility of Miao officials.' <sup id="cite_ref-650" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-650">[650]</a></sup> 'The total of the above fields and land is 131,640.6 mu. In the thirteenth year of Chia Ch'ing /1808/ a total of 15,219.3 mu of fields and land was surveyed in the three hsien, Feng-huang, Kan-chou, and Yung-sui. In the sixteenth year of Chia Ch'ing /1811/ another total of 5,873.2 mu of fields and land was surveyed, totaling 152,157.1 mu of fields and land. Of this besides the land allocated to the army for horses and farming, land lost through floods and erosion, and also the land used for stone guard houses and surroundings, totaling 11,084.3 mu, and another 37,849 mu distributed among the t'un able-bodied males, leaders, the aged, and the young, there remained 103,223.8 mu. Farmers were recruited to farm this land and rent /in kind/ collected. The annual receipt in grain totaled 105,488 shih, three tou, and nine sheng.' <sup id="cite_ref-651" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-651">[651]</a></sup> 'The t'un fields in the Miao frontier were divided into people's /i.e. Chinese/ t'uns and Miao t'uns, the two being entirely different in nature. The t'un males working on the Chinese t'uns were also divided into t'un men and fighting men. The t'un men received fields to cultivate, and guarded the t'un guard houses. The fighting men, also called home guards, were solely trained for military operations, and did not farm. In the five sub-prefectures and hsiens of the Miao frontier there are 7,000 t'un men, from among whom are appointed hsiao-ch'i, tsung-ch'i, and pe-tsung to facilitate control. The distribution of fields was as follows: the men /san ting/ are each given 4.5 mu; the hsiao-ch'i, 5.5 mu; the tsung-ch'i, 6.5 mu; and the pe-tsung, 7.5 mu. There are 1,000 fighting men, each being given 3 shih, 6 tou of rice per year. The non-fighting men are also each given annually 10.8 liang of silver for salt and vegetables. The hsiao-ch'i receives each year 12 liang of silver; the tsung-ch'i, 13.2 liang of silver; the pe-tsung, 16.8 liang of silver. Therefore, in the Chinese t'un, the fields and land left over after the t'un men have received their fields to plant and care for are leased out for the collection of rent. Granaries (Illus. 57) have been built to store the grain, and general t'un leaders are set up to manage these matters. There are no t'un men in the Miao t'uns, and the t'un fields are allotted to people to cultivate /Illus. 57 and 58 on pages 124 and 125/ 126 for the collection of rent, in order to feed the Miao soldiers, under the control of the Miao officials. The t'un fields in the Miao frontier region, at the inception of the system, totaled 150,000 mu of arable land, of which barely a third was directly cultivated by t'un personnel, the rest being allotted out as rented fields. Today, the t'un army in the Miao frontier region is about 1,000 strong. The maintainance of the Black Flag Battalion of the Miao troops (Illus. 58) largely comes from the rented fields. T'un fields were set up to support troops on the spot as a defense against the Miao. Today, the Miao have been largely acculturated by the Chinese and the boundary line between the Miao and the Chinese is gradually becoming [Page 183] 124 [Page 185] 126 cont. obliterated. There is no longer the need for this kind of system of t'un defense against the Miao. In fact, unrest in the Miao area today is often due to the maladministration of the t'un fields system. The Miao petty officers and the t'un leaders often are oppressive in collecting rent and sometimes are corrupt in their methods, thus causing dissatisfaction and disturbances. In the twenty-sixth year of the Republic /1937/ the Miao rebellion in western Hunan arose because of the t'un land system. It resulted in the burning of t'un granaries and killing of t'un officers. Although the rebellion was pacified only after bloody and expensive campaigns, it is imperative to change the t'un and enter the newly opened or reclaimed land as available for taxation, so as to reach a fundamental solution.' <sup id="cite_ref-652" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-652">[652]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b>♠ Education is available to people from all ethnic/racial groups ♣ absent ♥</b> Christian missionaries established primary and secondary schools, but this process did not start until the late 19th and early 20th centuries: 'The first missionaries among the Hua Miao belonged to the Bible Christian Church, a dissenting Methodist sect, that placed great importance on the ability to read the Bible for oneself. With missionary assistance and encouragement, a simple phonetic script was developed in 1905 and in the following years the New Testament was translated in full into Dian Dongbei. Hymnals and study guides were also produced, and a series of school primers. In the 1930s and 1940s a small newspaper was published. Village chapels, built with communal effort, functioned also as one-room primary schools and centers for adult education. The mountain community of Shimenkan (Stone Gateway) in northwestern Guizhou served as the headquarters of church activity. In addition to its own large primary school, it offered secondary schooling and teacher training. At least thirty Hua Miao continued on and graduated from university in the decades before 1949. Some of these became ordained Methodist ministers or doctors and one became a well-regarded anthropologist (Yang Hanxian). Generally the local chapels were served by lay preachers who were trained at Shimenkan. Other young people received training as nurses and agricultural extension workers. At various points in time, agricultural and industrial extension programs were held at Shimenkan. New strains of potatoes were introduced, fruit orchards were planted on the hillsides of many villages, vegetable gardens were encouraged, and a number of Miao learned the techniques of carpentry, brickmaking, and masonry. More efficient looms were designed for home production of cloth. During the prerevolutionary decades, some villages benefited from collective endeavors to build bridges and roads, and pipe systems that brought water into the community. Teams of medical workers, from Shimenkan or from the churchaffiliated hospitals in nearby Zhaotong City, traveled around the area periodically. Even those who were not interested in becoming church members participated in the economic innovations, accepted treatment from the medical workers, and sent their children to the schools.' <sup id="cite_ref-653" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-653">[653]</a></sup> Education was not available to a majority of Hmong children until the 1950s: 'Both parents are involved in child rearing. Verbal skills and work skills are valued. Children are expected to assist with work tasks from an early age. Some tasks, such as gathering firewood or caring for livestock, are not gender-linked, and both sexes are encouraged to take responsibility and act independently. Mothers teach their daughters to spin and weave and to do batik and embroidery, and sons learn hunting skills from their fathers. Since the 1950s, most boys and some girls attend primary school. Relatively few continue on to middle school since this usually involves boarding schools far from their home communities.' <sup id="cite_ref-654" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-654">[654]</a></sup> Accordingly, we have decided to code for 'absent'.

<dd><b>♠ Property can be owned by people from all ethnic/racial groups ♣ present ♥</b> There was little social stratification among the Hmong: 'The various Miao groups are for the most part an unstratified agricultural people found in the uplands of several provinces of China and related to the Hmong of Southeast Asia. They are distinguished by language, dress, historical traditions, and cultural practice from neighboring ethnic groups and the dominant Han Chinese. They are not culturally homogeneous and the differences between local Miao cultures are often as great as between Miao and non-Miao neighbors. The term "Miao" is Chinese, and means "weeds" or "sprouts." Chinese minority policies since the 1950s treat these diverse groups as a single nationality and associate them with the San Miao Kingdom of central China mentioned in histories of the Han dynasty (200 BC-AD 200).' <sup id="cite_ref-655" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-655">[655]</a></sup> 'Given the long period of Chinese rule, it is not possible to reconstruct precontact organization, though some areas still retain older lineage and clan names.

These became the San Miao mentioned in Han dynasty texts. Over the next thousand years, between the Han and the Song dynasties, these presumed ancestors of the Miao continued to migrate westward and southward, under pressure from expanding Han populations and the imperial armies. Chinese texts and Miao oral history establish that over those years the ancestors settled in western Hunan and Guizhou, with some moving south into Guangxi or west along the Wu River to southeastern Sichuan and into Yunnan. The period was marked by a number of uprisings and battles between Miao and the Han or local indigenous groups, recalled in the oral histories of local groups. Though the term "Miao" was sometimes used in Tang and Song histories, the more usual term was "Man," meaning "barbarians." Migration continued through the Yuan, Ming, and early Qing, with some groups moving into mainland Southeast Asia. The retreat from Han control brought some into territories controlled by the Yi in northeast Yunnan/northwest Guizhou. The various migrations can also be seen as "vertical" migrations into the undeveloped hillside and mountain areas that were of lesser interest to Han. Depending on the terrain, the settled farming cited in Miao historical myths gave way to shifting slash-and-burn agriculture, facilitated by the introduction of the Irish potato and maize in the sixteenth century, and the adoption of high-altitude/cool-weather crops like barley, buckwheat, and oats. Farming was supplemented by forest hunting, fishing, gathering, and pastoralism. During the Qing, uprisings and military encounters escalated. There were major disturbances in western Hunan (1795-1806) and a continuous series of rebellions in Guizhou (1854-1872). Chinese policies toward the Miao shifted among assimilation, containment in "stockaded villages," dispersal, removal, and extermination. The frequent threat of "Miao rebellion" caused considerable anxiety to the state; in actuality, many of these uprisings included Bouyei, Dong, Hui, and other ethnic groups, including Han settlers and demobilized soldiers. At issue were heavy taxation, rising landlordism, rivalries over local resources, and official corruption. One of the last Miao uprisings occurred in 1936 in western Hunan in opposition to Guomindang (Republican) continuation of the tuntian system, which forced the peasants to open up new lands and grow crops for the state.' <sup id="cite_ref-660" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-660">[660]</a></sup> 'From Song on, in periods of relative peace, government control was exercised through the tusi system of indirect rule by appointed native headmen who collected taxes, organized corvée, and kept the peace.

In Guizhou, some tusi claimed Han ancestry, but were probably drawn from the ranks of assimilated Bouyei, Dong, and Miao. Government documents refer to the "Sheng Miao" (raw Miao), meaning those living in areas beyond government control and not paying taxes or labor service to the state. In the sixteenth century, in the more pacified areas, the implementation of the policy of gaitu guiliu began the replacement of native rulers with regular civilian and military officials, a few of whom were drawn from assimilated minority families.

Few were true landlords, and most who rented out land were likely to work part of their holdings themselves with family labor. All land is now owned by the state, including undeveloped mountain and forest lands, thus limiting any expansion beyond lands officially assigned to an individual or village. In the process, pastoralism and forest hunting/gathering have been reduced. Before land reform, some Miao areas followed the practice of lineage or hamlet ownership of mountain and hillside lands even where some private holdings existed.

The Miao lack any political organization of their own, and are thoroughly integrated into the Chinese administrative system. The basic political, as well as economic and social unit, is the village. Villages are grouped into townships and divided into hamlets of about ten to twenty households each. The headmen of both the village and the hamlet are appointed by the chief of the township. The members of different villages or hamlets are bound principally by affinal ties. They may cooperate for the common good, but they lack any formal organization of an indigenous character. Disputes between members of the same hamlet are settled, if possible, within the hamlet.

The space between the mountains was sufficient for a walled town of one long street between the east and west gates and one or two on either side. There were fields outside the city walls. Its normal population was between three and four thousand, augmented during the war by the coming of some “companies” for the installation and repair of charcoal burners in motor lorries and the distillation of grain alcohol for fuel, an Army officers' training school, and the engineers' corps of the railway being built through the town from Kwangsi to Kweiyang. To it the people of the surrounding contryside, including at least three groups of Miao and the Chung-chia, went to market.

Most Hua Miao villages were tenant communities on lands held by Han or Hui, or more commonly in this area, by members of the elite strata of the Yi (also called Nosu or Black Yi). In the pacification of the region, large tracts of land were awarded to the Yi nobility by the expanding Chinese state. In return for the right to claim rentals and labor service, the Yi “native officials” (tu si) collected taxes for the state and generally maintained law and order within the boundaries of their estate holdings. This feudal system lasted until the 1920s. The Hua Miao met their obligations to these overlords by the forced growing of the opium poppy, payments in kind or in cash or a specified number of days of labor service (agricultural work, collecting of firewood, household service, transport work). However, as tenants they were free to move residence, to change landlords and to make their own marriage arrangements, rights that were not granted to the slave class within Yi society. Within the ethnic stratification of the area, the Hua Miao ranked below the Yi nobility and freeborn classes, and below the Hui and the Han, but their status was better than that of the Yi slaves-some of whom were Han who had been forced into slavery. Relations between the Hua Miao and their Yi overlords were tense but in general the Yi made no attempt to force the Hua Miao to assimilate to Yi cultural [Page 65] practices, and at times the Miao fled from the Han to the protection of the Yi.' <sup id="cite_ref-685" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-685">[685]</a></sup> Officials serving in the military administration received salaries and arable land, which was also rented out to tenants in order to generate government income: 'The t'un fields in the Miao frontier were divided into people's /i.e. Chinese/ t'uns and Miao t'uns, the two being entirely different in nature. The t'un males working on the Chinese t'uns were also divided into t'un men and fighting men. The t'un men received fields to cultivate, and guarded the t'un guard houses. The fighting men, also called home guards, were solely trained for military operations, and did not farm. In the five sub-prefectures and hsiens of the Miao frontier there are 7,000 t'un men, from among whom are appointed hsiao-ch'i, tsung-ch'i, and pe-tsung to facilitate control. The distribution of fields was as follows: the men /san ting/ are each given 4.5 mu; the hsiao-ch'i, 5.5 mu; the tsung-ch'i, 6.5 mu; and the pe-tsung, 7.5 mu. There are 1,000 fighting men, each being given 3 shih, 6 tou of rice per year. The non-fighting men are also each given annually 10.8 liang of silver for salt and vegetables. The hsiao-ch'i receives each year 12 liang of silver; the tsung-ch'i, 13.2 liang of silver; the pe-tsung, 16.8 liang of silver. Therefore, in the Chinese t'un, the fields and land left over after the t'un men have received their fields to plant and care for are leased out for the collection of rent. Granaries (Illus. 57) have been built to store the grain, and general t'un leaders are set up to manage these matters. There are no t'un men in the Miao t'uns, and the t'un fields are allotted to people to cultivate /Illus. 57 and 58 on pages 124 and 125/  for the collection of rent, in order to feed the Miao soldiers, under the control of the Miao officials. The t'un fields in the Miao frontier region, at the inception of the system, totaled 150,000 mu of arable land, of which barely a third was directly cultivated by t'un personnel, the rest being allotted  out as rented fields. Today, the t'un army in the Miao frontier region is about 1,000 strong. The maintainance of the Black Flag Battalion of the Miao troops (Illus. 58) largely comes from the rented fields. T'un fields were set up to support troops on the spot as a defense against the Miao. Today, the Miao have been largely acculturated by the Chinese and the boundary line between the Miao and the Chinese is gradually becoming      obliterated. There is no longer the need for this kind of system of t'un defense against the Miao. In fact, unrest in the Miao  area today is often due to the maladministration of the t'un fields system. The Miao petty officers and the t'un leaders often are oppressive in collecting rent and sometimes are corrupt in their methods, thus causing dissatisfaction and disturbances. In the twenty-sixth year of the Republic /1937/ the Miao rebellion in western Hunan arose because of the t'un land system. It resulted in the burning of t'un granaries and killing of t'un officers. Although the rebellion was pacified only after bloody and expensive campaigns, it is imperative to change the t'un and enter the newly opened or reclaimed land as available for taxation, so as to reach a fundamental solution.' <sup id="cite_ref-686" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-686">[686]</a></sup> We have assumed that these observations are true for the A-Hmao as well, despite of historical differences. [The A-Hmao group doesn't appear to have been directly involved in the more eastern 'Miao' rebellions, but it appears to have been increasingly subsumed by the Late Qing/Early Chinese in the aftermath of these rebellions.] eHRAF provides a general description of the political history of the region: 'Migration continued through the Yuan, Ming, and early Qing, with some groups moving into mainland Southeast Asia. The retreat from Han control brought some into territories controlled by the Yi in northeast Yunnan/northwest Guizhou. The various migrations can also be seen as "vertical" migrations into the undeveloped hillside and mountain areas that were of lesser interest to Han. Depending on the terrain, the settled farming cited in Miao historical myths gave way to shifting slash-and-burn agriculture, facilitated by the introduction of the Irish potato and maize in the sixteenth century, and the adoption of high-altitude/cool-weather crops like barley, buckwheat, and oats. Farming was supplemented by forest hunting, fishing, gathering, and pastoralism. During the Qing, uprisings and military encounters escalated. There were major disturbances in western Hunan (1795-1806) and a continuous series of rebellions in Guizhou (1854-1872). Chinese policies toward the Miao shifted among assimilation, containment in "stockaded villages," dispersal, removal, and extermination. The frequent threat of "Miao rebellion" caused considerable anxiety to the state; in actuality, many of these uprisings included Bouyei, Dong, Hui, and other ethnic groups, including Han settlers and demobilized soldiers. At issue were heavy taxation, rising landlordism, rivalries over local resources, and official corruption. One of the last Miao uprisings occurred in 1936 in western Hunan in opposition to Guomindang (Republican) continuation of the tuntian   system, which forced the peasants to open up new lands and grow crops for the state.' <sup id="cite_ref-687" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-687">[687]</a></sup> 'From Song on, in periods of relative peace, government control was exercised through the tusi   system of indirect rule by appointed native headmen who collected taxes, organized corvée, and kept the peace. Miao filled this role in Hunan and eastern Guizhou, but farther west the rulers were often drawn from a hereditary Yi nobility, a system that lasted into the twentieth century. In Guizhou, some tusi   claimed Han ancestry, but were probably drawn from the ranks of assimilated Bouyei, Dong, and Miao. Government documents refer to the "Sheng Miao" (raw Miao), meaning those living in areas beyond government control and not paying taxes or labor service to the state. In the sixteenth century, in the more pacified areas, the implementation of the policy of gaitu guiliu   began the replacement of native rulers with regular civilian and military officials, a few of whom were drawn from assimilated minority families. Land became a commodity, creating both landlords and some freeholding peasants in the areas affected. In the Yunnan-Guizhou border area, the tusi   system continued and Miao purchase of land and participation in local markets was restricted by law until the Republican period (1911-1949).' <sup id="cite_ref-688" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-688">[688]</a></sup> Due to the complexities of the Miao situation, this variable is difficult to code and may not be applicable here.</dd>

<p><b>♠ occupational mobility ♣ absent ♥</b> Most Miao were subsistence producers: 'Economic strategies vary. The Hua Miao were shifting-swidden agriculturalists, growing buckwheat, oats, corn, potatoes, and hemp, and using a simple wooden hand plow or hoe. Sheep and goats were fed on nearby pasture land. Additionally the Hua Miao hunted with crossbow and poisoned arrows and gathered foodstuffs in the forests. In parts of Guizhou, the Miao more closely resembled their Han neighbors in their economic strategies as well as in their technology (the bullock-drawn plow, harrowing, use of animal and human wastes as fertilizer). The Cowrie Shell Miao in central Guizhou were settled farmers growing rice in flooded fields, and also raising millet, wheat, beans, vegetables, and tobacco. Their livestock was limited to barnyard pigs and poultry, with hunting and gathering playing a very minor role. Some of the Black Miao in southeast Guizhou combine intensive irrigated terrace farming of rice with dry-field upland cropping.' <sup id="cite_ref-689" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-689">[689]</a></sup> '3) Occupations. The Miao-I people, being retarded in cultural development, have just entered the stage of agricultural community, and so their chief occupation is farming. 14 Those Miao-I living in the northwest of the province have high [Page 18] 14 cont. mountain terrain with poor soil, in which they can grow only corn, buckwheat and mixed grains. They also rear cattle, horses, pigs, and principally sheep. At Wei-ning and Ta-ting, where the territory is highly mountainous, the climate is cold, and the population is thin; it is unfit for raising crops but best fit for grazing. In the southeast the Miao-I areas are comparatively better and suitable for rice cultivation. Besides agriculture they are also engaged in simple handicraft industries, such as home spinning and weaving. The commercial centers of the Miao-I in all areas are the village fairs held during the day for the bartering of goods. The fairs are located like a network in some convenient spots in the cities, on a vacant lot, or on the slope of a hill. They are named after certain cyclic animals such as chicken, dog, cow and so on. At the time of the fair men and women who come from all places number from several hundred to several thousand. At the fair everyday articles of household use are displayed in rows of adjoining straw sheds. A fair is a scene of activity and gaiety. The villages in which the Miao-I live are often endowed with rich resources, but their belief in the earth as the dwelling place of the dragon spirit forbids them to exploit its wealth, such as felling the trees for timber and digging the mines for minerals. Hence their occupations are limited and their culture is backward.' <sup id="cite_ref-690" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-690">[690]</a></sup> Most were either tenants or smallholders: 'Prior to the 1950s land reform, some Miao were smallholders. Many, if not most, were tenants on lands owned by Han, Yi, Hui, and others. Few were true landlords, and most who rented out land were likely to work part of their holdings themselves with family labor. All land is now owned by the state, including undeveloped mountain and forest lands, thus limiting any expansion beyond lands officially assigned to an individual or village. In the process, pastoralism and forest hunting/gathering have been reduced. Before land reform, some Miao areas followed the practice of lineage or hamlet ownership of mountain and hillside lands even where some private holdings existed. People could open new lands for farming and settlement, share village pastures, or hunt away from their home area.' <sup id="cite_ref-691" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-691">[691]</a></sup> Labour was divided along gender lines: 'Both sexes engage in agriculture, care of livestock, and fishing, and men contribute some labor to domestic chores like cooking, gathering firewood, and child care. Men are expected to do the heaviest work, including plowing. Women sometimes participated on short hunting trips, but trips of several days or several weeks were undertaken by groups of men; hunting trips are now illegal. Labor exchange and cooperation between households was common even before collectivization.' <sup id="cite_ref-692" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-692">[692]</a></sup> There was little occupational specialization: 'Women continue to spin and weave cotton, hemp, ramie, and wool for home use, and to produce garments with elaborate batik and embroidered designs that vary by area and dialect and serve as subethnic markers. Complex silver necklaces, bracelets, earrings, and headdresses are a well-developed craft specialty for men and again are closely associated with ethnicity. They are not usually sold outside the local Miao community. Carpenters, basket makers and blacksmiths can be found among some Miao groups.' <sup id="cite_ref-693" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-693">[693]</a></sup> But trade was important: 'No Miao communities are self-sufficient. All depend on the market for pottery, salt, processed foods, and various daily necessities. In Guizhou there is great demand for silver for making jewelry. What the Miao have to sell varies greatly by area. The Hua Miao market wool, hides, sheep and goats, wild game, firewood, and a variety of forest products. The Cowrie Shell Miao market agricultural produce, poultry and pigs, bamboo shoots, and home-crafted grass raincoats and sandals. Different areas have their specialties, such as cattle, horses, bamboo baskets, and herbal medicines. Before 1949, some Miao sold opium, but more often poppy growing and production of raw opium was the required rent for cropland and the profits went to the landlord and middlemen. Very few Miao were full-time merchants or traders.' <sup id="cite_ref-694" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-694">[694]</a></sup>

</p><p><b>♠ Description of the Normative Ideology ♣ ♥</b> eHRAF provides the following general summary: 'Religious beliefs and activities vary by locale and subethnic identity. The situation is further complicated by partial adoption of elements of folk Daoism and Buddhism, or by conversion to Christianity (as among segments of the White and Flowery Miao). Traditional religious beliefs concern powerful suprahuman forces associated with sacred groves, stones, caves, and other natural phenomena, as well as with bridges and wells. Other protective spirits guard the household and hamlet. The latter are sometimes thought of as dragons. It is believed that at death, the soul divides into three parts, one of which returns to protect the household as an ancestral spirit. There is also concern with evil spirits and with ghosts of those who died bad deaths and who may cause illness and misfortune. Religious beliefs are supported by a complex series of sung or chanted poetic myths, which treat the creation of the universe, the doings of divine beings and culture heroes, and early Miao history.' <sup id="cite_ref-702" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-702">[702]</a></sup> 'Most religious ritual is performed or guided by various part-time specialists who act as priests, diviners, or shamans for the local community or for kin groups. Most of them are males. They engage in ordinary work, and only the most important religious activities require them to don special items of dress and decoration to mark them from others. There are no written texts for learning the chants, songs, dances, and rituals: they are memorized. If called by a family, specialists receive a small payment (often in foodstuffs) for their assistance. Shamans play a key role at funerals and postburial rites. They are also involved in analysis and healing of illness: some are skilled in herbal medicine as well as ritual procedures. Shamans also provide explanations of the possible causes of misfortune and can provide protective amulets. Ceremonies on behalf of the village community or a gathering of kin from several villages are conducted by skilled male elders who function as priests, following ritual procedures, administering the necessary animal and food sacrifices, and chanting the songs and myths without going into trance or communicating directly with the supernaturals and spirits. Some ceremonies are led by the male head of household on behalf of his immediate family.' <sup id="cite_ref-703" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-703">[703]</a></sup> 'The calendrical year holds a number of set ceremonies that vary from group to group in content, purpose, and timing. For example, as of the 1990s some groups celebrated the lunar New Year along with their Han neighbors, whereas others celebrated the year's start in the tenth lunar month, following the harvest, and marked it with bullfights and cattle sacrifices. Others marked the New Year with cockfights or sacrifice of pigs and chickens, or intervillage assemblages enlivened by antiphonal singing, dancing, and the playing of the lusheng  . Among the important festivals found in many (not all) Miao communities are the Dragon Boat Festival, which is synchronic with the Han festivities to a large extent, and the Mountain Flower festivals, which were an important institution for bringing together marriageable young people from different hamlets. The Drum Society festivals are held by dispersed kin groups to honor their ancestors every seven, ten, or twelve years, and are not strictly tied to the calendar. Most festivals involve the lavish offering of animal sacrifices, and for this reason the state has discouraged them.' <sup id="cite_ref-704" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-704">[704]</a></sup> Schein paints a similar picture: 'Miao religious practices comprised animistic, ancestor worship, and shamanistic elements. Animal sacrifice and other forms of propitiation were key parts of all these practices. For ceremonies and exorcisms, and sometimes depending on the nature of the occasion, ritual experts and shamans could be male or female, and they were skilled in incantations, animal sacrifice, and the manipulation of various objects. They were engaged for a variety of healing purposes as well as for life-cycle rituals. Other sorcerers, particularly women, operated surreptitiously in the practice of so-called gu witchcraft in which they controlled others through harm or the threat of harm inflicted by poisons gleaned from [Page 54] insects. In addition to these belief systems, a considerable (but never tallied) number of Miao had converted to Christianity beginning in the nineteenth century.' <sup id="cite_ref-705" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-705">[705]</a></sup>

<dd> <b>♠ Ideological thought equates elites and commoners ♣ present ♥</b> There was little social stratification among the Hmong: 'The various Miao groups are for the most part an unstratified agricultural people found in the uplands of several provinces of China and related to the Hmong of Southeast Asia. They are distinguished by language, dress, historical traditions, and cultural practice from neighboring ethnic groups and the dominant Han Chinese. They are not culturally homogeneous and the differences between local Miao cultures are often as great as between Miao and non-Miao neighbors. The term "Miao" is Chinese, and means "weeds" or "sprouts." Chinese minority policies since the 1950s treat these diverse groups as a single nationality and associate them with the San Miao Kingdom of central China mentioned in histories of the Han dynasty (200 BC-AD 200).' <sup id="cite_ref-731" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-731">[731]</a></sup> 'Given the long period of Chinese rule, it is not possible to reconstruct precontact organization, though some areas still retain older lineage and clan names. Owing to dispersion, population decimation, and frequent migration, the multisurname settlement seems to be the most common. There was little class differentiation in the villages, and no formal political structure. Villages do not seem to have been formally linked by any kind of tribal organization and there was no formal political structure within villages.' <sup id="cite_ref-732" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-732">[732]</a></sup> Local leadership was largely informal: 'Respected knowledgeable elders, heads of family groups, and religious experts of both genders served as informal leaders. Among the more Sinicized, landlords and those who had some literacy in Chinese exercised power in the community. Under the present system, those who are members of the Communist party stand as the official leaders of the community.' <sup id="cite_ref-733" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-733">[733]</a></sup> 'Political Institutions. The Cowrie Shell Miao were Chinese citizens, and officially entitled to the same rights and privileges as other Chinese. Their form of local government was Chinese. The leaders of the village [Page [44a]] were the elders, men who stood at the head of groups of closely related families, known as pao. There were three pao in Yang-chia-sai, and hence three elders, who formed the village council. Disputes within the family were settled, if possible, in the family, in the pao within the pao. Disputes within the village between members of different pao were ordinarily settled by the three elders. If, however, they were unable to effect a settlement, the litigants had the right to carry their dispute to the next higher official, the lien pao chang, who was a Chinese, and so on up to the Chinese court in the hsien city.' <sup id="cite_ref-734" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-734">[734]</a></sup> While elders and ritual specialists were respected, there were no distinct social classes: 'From very early times the Miao have had tribes but not tribal chiefs, and therefore they do not have different classes nor differentiated marriage or funeral ceremonial customs. The funeral for a Miao sorcerer, however, is slightly different from that for the ordinary person. When a sorcerer is at the point of death, 103 two other sorcerer priests are summoned to the house. When he breathes his last, the members of the family must not weep. One sorcerer priest climbs on the house and removes a few tiles from it to make an opening, which is called “opening the heaven's gate.” The other sorcerer priest sits below behind the deceased, and as soon as he sees “heaven's gate” has been opened, he immediately lets out a loud cry, to which the one on the roof responds with another cry, and thus, the two men, one above and the other below, start their ritual. It is said that the one above opens heaven's gate, and the one below shuts the grove /literally, “earth storehouse”/. This is to cause the departed sorcerer not to enter hell but to ascend to heaven. After this the family members may begin to cry and weep.' <sup id="cite_ref-735" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-735">[735]</a></sup> However, Hmong populations found themselves at the bottom end of a complex interethnic hierarchy when integrated into the Chinese imperial structure: 'Chinese scholarship links the present-day Miao to tribal confederations that moved southward some 2,000 years ago from the plain between the Yellow River and the Yangtze toward the Dongting Lake area. These became the San Miao mentioned in Han dynasty texts. Over the next thousand years, between the Han and the Song dynasties, these presumed ancestors of the Miao continued to migrate westward and southward, under pressure from expanding Han populations and the imperial armies. Chinese texts and Miao oral history establish that over those years the ancestors settled in western Hunan and Guizhou, with some moving south into Guangxi or west along the Wu River to southeastern Sichuan and into Yunnan. The period was marked by a number of uprisings and battles between Miao and the Han or local indigenous groups, recalled in the oral histories of local groups. Though the term "Miao" was sometimes used in Tang and Song histories, the more usual term was "Man," meaning "barbarians." Migration continued through the Yuan, Ming, and early Qing, with some groups moving into mainland Southeast Asia. The retreat from Han control brought some into territories controlled by the Yi in northeast Yunnan/northwest Guizhou. The various migrations can also be seen as "vertical" migrations into the undeveloped hillside and mountain areas that were of lesser interest to Han. Depending on the terrain, the settled farming cited in Miao historical myths gave way to shifting slash-and-burn agriculture, facilitated by the introduction of the Irish potato and maize in the sixteenth century, and the adoption of high-altitude/cool-weather crops like barley, buckwheat, and oats. Farming was supplemented by forest hunting, fishing, gathering, and pastoralism. During the Qing, uprisings and military encounters escalated. There were major disturbances in western Hunan (1795-1806) and a continuous series of rebellions in Guizhou (1854-1872). Chinese policies toward the Miao shifted among assimilation, containment in "stockaded villages," dispersal, removal, and extermination. The frequent threat of "Miao rebellion" caused considerable anxiety to the state; in actuality, many of these uprisings included Bouyei, Dong, Hui, and other ethnic groups, including Han settlers and demobilized soldiers. At issue were heavy taxation, rising landlordism, rivalries over local resources, and official corruption. One of the last Miao uprisings occurred in 1936 in western Hunan in opposition to Guomindang (Republican) continuation of the tuntian system, which forced the peasants to open up new lands and grow crops for the state.' <sup id="cite_ref-736" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-736">[736]</a></sup> 'From Song on, in periods of relative peace, government control was exercised through the tusi system of indirect rule by appointed native headmen who collected taxes, organized corvée, and kept the peace. Miao filled this role in Hunan and eastern Guizhou, but farther west the rulers were often drawn from a hereditary Yi nobility, a system that lasted into the twentieth century. In Guizhou, some tusi claimed Han ancestry, but were probably drawn from the ranks of assimilated Bouyei, Dong, and Miao. Government documents refer to the "Sheng Miao" (raw Miao), meaning those living in areas beyond government control and not paying taxes or labor service to the state. In the sixteenth century, in the more pacified areas, the implementation of the policy of gaitu guiliu began the replacement of native rulers with regular civilian and military officials, a few of whom were drawn from assimilated minority families. Land became a commodity, creating both landlords and some freeholding peasants in the areas affected. In the Yunnan-Guizhou border area, the tusi system continued and Miao purchase of land and participation in local markets was restricted by law until the Republican period (1911-1949).' <sup id="cite_ref-737" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-737">[737]</a></sup> Most Hmong subsistence producers were either smallholders or dependent tenants who worked lands owned by landlords from other ethnic groups: 'Prior to the 1950s land reform, some Miao were smallholders. Many, if not most, were tenants on lands owned by Han, Yi, Hui, and others. Few were true landlords, and most who rented out land were likely to work part of their holdings themselves with family labor. All land is now owned by the state, including undeveloped mountain and forest lands, thus limiting any expansion beyond lands officially assigned to an individual or village. In the process, pastoralism and forest hunting/gathering have been reduced. Before land reform, some Miao areas followed the practice of lineage or hamlet ownership of mountain and hillside lands even where some private holdings existed. People could open new lands for farming and settlement, share village pastures, or hunt away from their home area.' <sup id="cite_ref-738" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-738">[738]</a></sup> Accordingly, there was reinforcement of equality among the Hmong themselves, but reinforcement of inequality between Hmong and higher-status ethnic groups.

<dd> <b>♠ Ideological thought distinguishes men and women ♣ present ♥</b> Reliable published findings on the kinship system are sparse: 'Generally, Miao have been pressured to take Chinese surnames, which are transmitted patrilineally. Descent is said to be patrilineal, and in some places the Han patrilineage form has been adopted. However, matrilineal kin are important in some areas. In practice, there is strong evidence that the system is bilateral.' <sup id="cite_ref-747" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-747">[747]</a></sup> 'No serious comparative study of kin terms and lineage organization is yet available, and some of the writings on the subject suggest Miao politeness in telling Han investigators what they want to hear.' <sup id="cite_ref-748" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-748">[748]</a></sup> eHRAF provides the following summary: 'Marriages generally require parental consent but are based on mutual attraction and choice. In the past, many communities had "youth houses" where unmarried young people could gather. Groups of young men traveled around to court girls in other villages. In the absence of parental consent, elopement was an alternative. Festivals and trips to periodic markets still provide an opportunity for young people to meet, engage in antiphonal singing and dancing, and establish new friendships. Since the 1950s, travel restrictions and state disapproval of premarital sexual behavior has increased the parental role in marriage arrangement. Marriages are monogamous. Marriage outside the dialect or language group is rare. Divorce and remarriages are permitted. Postmarital residence is usually in the man's home village but only the youngest son lives with his parents after his marriage, and in instances where there are no sons a family may bring in a son-in-law or an aged widow or widower might join her married daughter's household. In some areas, there is delayed transfer of the bride until after the birth of her first child, or the practice of starting out with residence with the bride's family.' <sup id="cite_ref-749" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-749">[749]</a></sup> 'The two-generation nuclear family is statistically the most common. Relations between spouses, and between parents and children, are more egalitarian than among the Han. Economic, social, and ritual ties are retained with natal kin. Visiting kinsfolk are welcome guests, and may come for extended visits.' <sup id="cite_ref-750" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-750">[750]</a></sup> Schein reports patrilineality, but overall her account is similar: 'Miao society was predominantly patrilineal and generally organized [Page 53] in terms of exogamous village/lineage units. A patronymic system was widespread with surnames, of which there were no more than ten or twenty in use, borrowed from the Chinese. These surname groups constituted clanlike structures, which for purposes of mutual aid and large-scale rituals occasionally superseded the otherwise local village and patrilineal political organization. In some areas neolocal and/or matrilocal residence was found, but patrilocal residence was the most common. Premarital sex and courtship were characteristic among the Miao in most places, and arranged marriage was primarily according to the right of priority of a girl's maternal uncle to marry her to his son. Courtship took place at markets and festivals in which a special site sometimes was found for mingling, dancing, or antiphonal singing. Bride-price and sometimes dowry were provided by parents, once they approved their children's choices of partners. In some places, delayed transfer marriage was practiced, and divorce was acceptable, especially before the first child. Polygyny was uncommon, but not unknown. Inheritance was patrilineal, except for heirloom clothing and silver jewelry, which passed through the matriline.' <sup id="cite_ref-751" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-751">[751]</a></sup> Women contributed to agricultural work, but labour was still divided along gender lines: 'Both sexes engage in agriculture, care of livestock, and fishing, and men contribute some labor to domestic chores like cooking, gathering firewood, and child care. Men are expected to do the heaviest work, including plowing. Women sometimes participated on short hunting trips, but trips of several days or several weeks were undertaken by groups of men; hunting trips are now illegal. Labor exchange and cooperation between households was common even before collectivization.' <sup id="cite_ref-752" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-752">[752]</a></sup> 'Women, who never bound their feet, participated in most productive activities except plowing and hunting. They typically had a greater share in the family duties since they tended vegetable gardens, were often the ones who carried water, and did most of the household chores such as preparing food and washing clothes. Men did crafts such as silversmithing, woodworking, and basketry; women wove and decorated clothing. Childcare was shared. As a rule, men had higher status and more extensive roles in ritual activities, although elderly women were often honored in ritual, and women could become ritual experts such as shamans.' <sup id="cite_ref-753" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-753">[753]</a></sup> 'In the relationship between spouses a higher degree of respect is expected from the wife. The division of labor by sex in economic matters has already been described. Beyond this, the husband is more concerned with social and ceremonial activities, the wife with household affairs.' <sup id="cite_ref-754" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-754">[754]</a></sup> Boys were preferred over girls, but overall gender relations were more egalitarian than among neighbouring Chinese: 'Boys were more desired than girls because inheritance is in the male line and sons carry on the worship of ancestors, as among the Chinese, but girls were also loved and desired. They had a greater economic value than among the Chinese because of the work they did even after they were married. They also kept closer contact with their parents after marriage than Chinese girls can do. This was indicated by the fact that they took their maiden name, even though they remained in the home of the deceased husband.' <sup id="cite_ref-755" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-755">[755]</a></sup> Youngest sons were preferred heirs: 'At marriage, sons and daughters receive property and assistance in building a new house. Marriage portions previously included livestock as well as household goods, tools, jewelry, and cloth. The youngest son and his descendants inherit the parental house and remaining wealth. A couple without sons will live with a daughter, who stands as heir.' <sup id="cite_ref-756" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-756">[756]</a></sup> Most ritual specialists were men: 'Most religious ritual is performed or guided by various part-time specialists who act as priests, diviners, or shamans for the local community or for kin groups. Most of them are males. They engage in ordinary work, and only the most important religious activities require them to don special items of dress and decoration to mark them from others. There are no written texts for learning the chants, songs, dances, and rituals: they are memorized. If called by a family, specialists receive a small payment (often in foodstuffs) for their assistance. Shamans play a key role at funerals and postburial rites. They are also involved in analysis and healing of illness: some are skilled in herbal medicine as well as ritual procedures. Shamans also provide explanations of the possible causes of misfortune and can provide protective amulets. Ceremonies on behalf of the village community or a gathering of kin from several villages are conducted by skilled male elders who function as priests, following ritual procedures, administering the necessary animal and food sacrifices, and chanting the songs and myths without going into trance or communicating directly with the supernaturals and spirits. Some ceremonies are led by the male head of household on behalf of his immediate family.' <sup id="cite_ref-757" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-757">[757]</a></sup> Women were excluded from some ceremonial dances and feasts: 'There are two kinds of dances: the drumstick dance and the fist dance, the difference being that in the former the drum is struck with the drumstick and in the latter with the first. The first dances, except for the ta-pa-pa dance (see later), are men's dances and are not practiced by women. As for the drumstick dances, although they are for both men and women, there is a certain number exclusively for men. When we observed the Miao dances we felt at first that the movements were rather complicated, but after detailed analysis they are rather simple. Since within the short space of five minutes they can dance over 20 different steps in very rapid motion, each being interchangeable with the other, on-lookers cannot help but feel that the steps are extremely intricate. Following are accounts of the drumstick dance and the first dance.' <sup id="cite_ref-758" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-758">[758]</a></sup> 'The rest of the beef is roasted. To go with it they make all kinds of dishes containing beef. In the afternoon about one o'clock they set out the feast in the great hall. Boards and benches are put together to make a long table and the guests arrange themselves for a long feast. On the table they set all sorts of dishes having beef as a foundation. Of unfermented wine they drink from large bowls. If other families conduct the ritual at the same time, the guests who have come to the killing of the bull, after eating for a time at one place go on to other places. On that day only men are guests; women do not attend the feast. In many tribal societies, although all have meetings of a religious nature or rituals, women never take any part. Among the Cowrie Shell Miao women do not attend the feast of killing the bull, which is a very good example.' <sup id="cite_ref-759" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-759">[759]</a></sup> It appears that only men were appointed to positions as petty officials in the Chinese administration and informal leadership positions in villages were also usually taken by men.</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Ideological thought distinguishes people from different locations ♣ absent ♥</b> There was considerable regional variation in economic and cultural practices. However, we have not found evidence of explicit and hierarchical ideological distinctions between different locations made by Hmong themselves rather than Chinese.</dd></dl>
<p><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of inequality ♣ present ♥</b> There was little social stratification among the Hmong: 'The various Miao groups are for the most part an unstratified agricultural people found in the uplands of several provinces of China and related to the Hmong of Southeast Asia. They are distinguished by language, dress, historical traditions, and cultural practice from neighboring ethnic groups and the dominant Han Chinese. They are not culturally homogeneous and the differences between local Miao cultures are often as great as between Miao and non-Miao neighbors. The term "Miao" is Chinese, and means "weeds" or "sprouts." Chinese minority policies since the 1950s treat these diverse groups as a single nationality and associate them with the San Miao Kingdom of central China mentioned in histories of the Han dynasty (200 BC-AD 200).' <sup id="cite_ref-760" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-760">[760]</a></sup> 'Given the long period of Chinese rule, it is not possible to reconstruct precontact organization, though some areas still retain older lineage and clan names. Owing to dispersion, population decimation, and frequent migration, the multisurname settlement seems to be the most common. There was little class differentiation in the villages, and no formal political structure. Villages do not seem to have been formally linked by any kind of tribal organization and there was no formal political structure within villages.' <sup id="cite_ref-761" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-761">[761]</a></sup> Local leadership was largely informal: 'Respected knowledgeable elders, heads of family groups, and religious experts of both genders served as informal leaders. Among the more Sinicized, landlords and those who had some literacy in Chinese exercised power in the community. Under the present system, those who are members of the Communist party stand as the official leaders of the community.' <sup id="cite_ref-762" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-762">[762]</a></sup> 'Political Institutions. The Cowrie Shell Miao were Chinese citizens, and officially entitled to the same rights and privileges as other Chinese. Their form of local government was Chinese. The leaders of the village [Page [44a]] were the elders, men who stood at the head of groups of closely related families, known as pao. There were three pao in Yang-chia-sai, and hence three elders, who formed the village council. Disputes within the family were settled, if possible, in the family, in the pao within the pao. Disputes within the village between members of different pao were ordinarily settled by the three elders. If, however, they were unable to effect a settlement, the litigants had the right to carry their dispute to the next higher official, the lien pao chang, who was a Chinese, and so on up to the Chinese court in the hsien city.' <sup id="cite_ref-763" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-763">[763]</a></sup> While elders and ritual specialists were respected, there were no distinct social classes: 'From very early times the Miao have had tribes but not tribal chiefs, and therefore they do not have different classes nor differentiated marriage or funeral ceremonial customs. The funeral for a Miao sorcerer, however, is slightly different from that for the ordinary person. When a sorcerer is at the point of death, 103 two other sorcerer priests are summoned to the house. When he breathes his last, the members of the family must not weep. One sorcerer priest climbs on the house and removes a few tiles from it to make an opening, which is called “opening the heaven's gate.” The other sorcerer priest sits below behind the deceased, and as soon as he sees “heaven's gate” has been opened, he immediately lets out a loud cry, to which the one on the roof responds with another cry, and thus, the two men, one above and the other below, start their ritual. It is said that the one above opens heaven's gate, and the one below shuts the grove /literally, “earth storehouse”/. This is to cause the departed sorcerer not to enter hell but to ascend to heaven. After this the family members may begin to cry and weep.' <sup id="cite_ref-764" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-764">[764]</a></sup> However, Hmong populations found themselves at the bottom end of a complex interethnic hierarchy when integrated into the Chinese imperial structure: 'Chinese scholarship links the present-day Miao to tribal confederations that moved southward some 2,000 years ago from the plain between the Yellow River and the Yangtze toward the Dongting Lake area. These became the San Miao mentioned in Han dynasty texts. Over the next thousand years, between the Han and the Song dynasties, these presumed ancestors of the Miao continued to migrate westward and southward, under pressure from expanding Han populations and the imperial armies. Chinese texts and Miao oral history establish that over those years the ancestors settled in western Hunan and Guizhou, with some moving south into Guangxi or west along the Wu River to southeastern Sichuan and into Yunnan. The period was marked by a number of uprisings and battles between Miao and the Han or local indigenous groups, recalled in the oral histories of local groups. Though the term "Miao" was sometimes used in Tang and Song histories, the more usual term was "Man," meaning "barbarians." Migration continued through the Yuan, Ming, and early Qing, with some groups moving into mainland Southeast Asia. The retreat from Han control brought some into territories controlled by the Yi in northeast Yunnan/northwest Guizhou. The various migrations can also be seen as "vertical" migrations into the undeveloped hillside and mountain areas that were of lesser interest to Han. Depending on the terrain, the settled farming cited in Miao historical myths gave way to shifting slash-and-burn agriculture, facilitated by the introduction of the Irish potato and maize in the sixteenth century, and the adoption of high-altitude/cool-weather crops like barley, buckwheat, and oats. Farming was supplemented by forest hunting, fishing, gathering, and pastoralism. During the Qing, uprisings and military encounters escalated. There were major disturbances in western Hunan (1795-1806) and a continuous series of rebellions in Guizhou (1854-1872). Chinese policies toward the Miao shifted among assimilation, containment in "stockaded villages," dispersal, removal, and extermination. The frequent threat of "Miao rebellion" caused considerable anxiety to the state; in actuality, many of these uprisings included Bouyei, Dong, Hui, and other ethnic groups, including Han settlers and demobilized soldiers. At issue were heavy taxation, rising landlordism, rivalries over local resources, and official corruption. One of the last Miao uprisings occurred in 1936 in western Hunan in opposition to Guomindang (Republican) continuation of the tuntian system, which forced the peasants to open up new lands and grow crops for the state.' <sup id="cite_ref-765" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-765">[765]</a></sup> 'From Song on, in periods of relative peace, government control was exercised through the tusi system of indirect rule by appointed native headmen who collected taxes, organized corvée, and kept the peace. Miao filled this role in Hunan and eastern Guizhou, but farther west the rulers were often drawn from a hereditary Yi nobility, a system that lasted into the twentieth century. In Guizhou, some tusi claimed Han ancestry, but were probably drawn from the ranks of assimilated Bouyei, Dong, and Miao. Government documents refer to the "Sheng Miao" (raw Miao), meaning those living in areas beyond government control and not paying taxes or labor service to the state. In the sixteenth century, in the more pacified areas, the implementation of the policy of gaitu guiliu began the replacement of native rulers with regular civilian and military officials, a few of whom were drawn from assimilated minority families. Land became a commodity, creating both landlords and some freeholding peasants in the areas affected. In the Yunnan-Guizhou border area, the tusi system continued and Miao purchase of land and participation in local markets was restricted by law until the Republican period (1911-1949).' <sup id="cite_ref-766" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-766">[766]</a></sup> Most Hmong subsistence producers were either smallholders or dependent tenants who worked lands owned by landlords from other ethnic groups: 'Prior to the 1950s land reform, some Miao were smallholders. Many, if not most, were tenants on lands owned by Han, Yi, Hui, and others. Few were true landlords, and most who rented out land were likely to work part of their holdings themselves with family labor. All land is now owned by the state, including undeveloped mountain and forest lands, thus limiting any expansion beyond lands officially assigned to an individual or village. In the process, pastoralism and forest hunting/gathering have been reduced. Before land reform, some Miao areas followed the practice of lineage or hamlet ownership of mountain and hillside lands even where some private holdings existed. People could open new lands for farming and settlement, share village pastures, or hunt away from their home area.' <sup id="cite_ref-767" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-767">[767]</a></sup> Accordingly, there was reinforcement of equality among the Hmong themselves, but reinforcement of inequality between Hmong and higher-status ethnic groups.

This kind of small family system is the original system of the Miao. The Miao Fang Pei Lan, in the chapter on villages, says: “Among the Miao people father and sons and brothers do not live together in one house. When a son grows up he lives apart, erecting a new house and then there is another household.” Because of the small family system their living quarters as a rule consist of two or three rooms. In the house there is only one bed, and the husband, wife, and children all sleep on it together. When a girl grows up, a separate bed may be set up for her. As a rule the Miao practice monogamy. Sometimes they take a concubine, to live together with the wife, or to live separately. In the family economy, men and women share agricultural work, but household chores are mainly the women's responsibility. Family property consists of fields, houses, animals, and furniture, tools, and utensils. When the children grow up, a boy gets married at 17 or 18, and is given a certain amount of property in order to build a separate house and establish a family. A girl marries at fifteen or sixteen. So, the small family system among the Miao can always be maintained, and is not likely to be expanded.' <sup id="cite_ref-773" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-773">[773]</a></sup> 'Because of strict adherence to the small family system, clan organization cannot develop. Among the pure Miao there are the following five surnames: Wu, Lung, Liao, Shih, and Ma. Such surnames as Yang, Shih, P'eng, Chang, and Hung were those of outsiders who married into Miao families and [Page 129] 93 cont. adopted their ways. Among the Shih /“rock”/ and Lung /“dragon”/ there are the Ta /“big”/ Shih and Shao /“small”/ Shih, the Ta Lung and Shao Lung. Shao Shih is also written with the character shih meaning “time,” and Shao Lung, also with the character lung meaning “eminent.” Although they have surnames, they do not have a closely knit organization of family clans, and so formerly they did not object to marriage between people of the same surname. However, no marriage was permitted between close relatives. In recent years they have come under Chinese influence, and know that people of the same surnames must not marry. Shao Shih /“small rock”/ was changed to be written with the character shih meaning “time,” and Shao Lung /“small dragon”/ was changed to be written with the character lung meaning “eminent,” in order to separate them from Ta Shih /“big rock”/ and Ta Lung /“big dragon”/, so that they could intermarry. Today, Miao family life has become more and more like that of the Chinese, and marriage and funeral rites largely follow Chinese customs, barely retaining remnants of some Miao customs.' <sup id="cite_ref-774" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-774">[774]</a></sup> Graham describes arranged marriages: 'Sexual attraction naturally results in love affairs and love affairs naturally result in sexual intercourse. Sometimes this results in marriage but often it does not.' <sup id="cite_ref-775" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-775">[775]</a></sup> 'Children are often married at a very early age. It is not uncommon for a child to be married when only three or four years old and most children are married by the time they are twelve. Of course these are not love matches, and serious love affairs later in life with men and women to whom they are not married are quite likely to occur.' <sup id="cite_ref-776" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-776">[776]</a></sup> 'The normal way is for engagements to be made by the parents of the boy through go-betweens. The initiative is taken by the parents of the young man. When they have decided that they wish to make an engagement between their son and a certain girl, they call two go-betweens who are invited to a meal in the boy's home. A chicken is killed for the meal and its tongue, its bones and other parts of its body are examined to ascertain whether or not the circumstances are propitious.' <sup id="cite_ref-777" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-777">[777]</a></sup> 'If the signs are propitious, the middle men proceed to the home of the girl. There they endeavor to secure a favorable reply from the girl's parents who in turn call in go-betweens. If her parents are favorable, the go-betweens are feasted and they proceed to determine the details of the gift which must be given by the boy's parents to those of the girl. The gift may include pork, domestic animals, rice, beans, corn, money, or any other commodity. When the engagement presents have been given and accepted by the girl's parents, the engagement is complete and is seldom broken. There is a second feast for the go-betweens and other friends at the time when the engagement gifts are presented. The engagement is a contract between the parents of the young people. While the bride is not actually purchased, the value of the gift often goes a long way towards securing a favorable decision by the girl's parents.' <sup id="cite_ref-778" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-778">[778]</a></sup> 'When the go-betweens arrive at the home of the girl much of the work of making the engagement is often done by means of songs. By certain songs they announce their mission to the girl's parents. Other songs carry the work along, even to the matter of approximately arranging the gift. There are songs when the gifts are presented. Sometimes these songs take the form of contests when the two sets of go-betweens ridicule or try to outwit each other or see who can keep going the longest.' <sup id="cite_ref-779" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-779">[779]</a></sup> Premarital sexual relations could culminate in marriage as well: 'When the parents are unwilling to marry off a daughter, or nobody seeks her hand in marriage, or when the parents are unable or fail to make an engagement for a son, the marriageable person endeavors to win a mate. For this purpose he or she goes to the market place on the third day of the third moon, at tuan yang □ on the fifth day of the [Page 36] fifth moon, or at some other convenient time, or attends one of the Miao feasts or festivals, or joins those playing on the mountain-sides at New Year time. Either the boy or the girl can make the first advances. The methods are to look lovingly with the eyes, to squeeze hands and to speak loving words. This is inconvenient if there are many people about. A boy may take a girl's handkerchief or a girl take a boy's. Then the person who gets the handkerchief goes away and the other says, “That person has taken my handkerchief. Stay here and I will go after him (or her).” Then in a quiet secluded place they make love. They say loving words, squeeze each other's hands, and embrace. A very great evidence of love is when one spits and the other swallows the spittal. Copulation often follows after which a handkerchief or a ring may be given by the boy to the girl or vice versa and they make a vow such as, “If you do not marry me and marry another, you must take this engagement present and eat it and then I will make no trouble.” It is believed by the Ch'uan Miao men that copulation is one of the surest ways to a woman's affection.' <sup id="cite_ref-780" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-780">[780]</a></sup> 'Later the parents must be informed and they must secure go-betweens and arrange engagement presents and so on. If the parents do not agree, then the young people run away together or the man carries away the girl. Then all the neighbors and friends urge the parents to consent and if they still do not agree the neighbors and friends practically compel them to do so. The gifts to the girl's parents are generally less than they would have been if the young people had been engaged and married in the usual way.' <sup id="cite_ref-781" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-781">[781]</a></sup> 'Marriage by capture is not unknown among the Ch'uan Miao. Sometimes the girls are quite willing to get married in this way, and it is said that happy marriages often result. Sometimes a man uses this method because he is in love with the girl.' <sup id="cite_ref-782" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-782">[782]</a></sup> According to Ling et al, premarital sexual relations were common and tolerated: 'Among the Miao the premarital sex life of the young men and women is rather free. When a virgin has intercourse with a man, her parents know about it but do not forbid it. On the contrary, they consider this evidence that the man finds their daughter desirable. Sometimes, the girl brings home her lover, and her parents will kill a chicken to entertain him. There are even public houses set up specially for the use of young men and women to gather together. For instance, in Chapter II reference was made to the Pa Chai Miao, recorded in Yung-sui T'ing Chih, to the effect that an empty shed was built near the village, where unmarried men and women gathered together to sing. If a couple fell in love, a cow was sent as a betrothal gift. Again, the unmarried men among the Ch'ing Chiang He Miao were called “lohan”; in the spring they would [Page 130] 94 cont. carry wine and food up the mountain, singing and dancing reciprocally. Those who became fond of each other would drink from an ox horn. There is the custom among the Miao of dancing for the new year, dancing for the moon, and singing for autumn. On such occasions, young men and women form groups and sing in response to each other all night until daybreak. After singing they mix with each other, drinking and joking, even to the extent of having sexual relations. This is called fang yeh “going wild.”'  <sup id="cite_ref-783" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-783">[783]</a></sup> However, parental consent was still required for marriage: 'Although unmarried men and women are free to fall in love, marriage, however, requires parental consent as well as the approval of the maternal uncle of the girl. The He Miao of Ch'ing Chiang, Kweichow have a marriage custom where they betroth the daughter of a paternal aunt to be the daughter-in-law of a maternal uncle. Should the maternal uncle have no son, the girl's family has to pay a large sum of money to him. Without such a payment the girl all her life may not marry. The Miao, other than close paternal cousins not being suitable mates, they do not object to marriage between people of the same surname. However, maternal cousins may not marry. This is a survival from a matrilineal society, because in a matrilineal society maternal cousins have the same surname whereas cross cousins or male and female first cousins on the father's side have different surnames. That maternal cousins cannot marry is evidence of their advance from a matrilineal society to a patrilineal society. The importance of the maternal uncle's position in sacrificial ceremonies as well as in the society is additional evidence.' <sup id="cite_ref-784" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-784">[784]</a></sup> Graham describes the proceedings at weddings: 'Parents generally desire to marry off their daughters, for it is the custom of marrying daughters into other homes that makes possible the securing of daughters-in-law to labor in the home and to give birth to descendants. Besides, the girl's parents receive engagement gifts and these are sometimes very valuable.' <sup id="cite_ref-785" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-785">[785]</a></sup> 'The bride generally weeps before leaving her parental home. Sometimes the sorrow is pretended but at other times she is sad and unwilling to go and the parents and friends and relatives have to use persuasion and even cocrcion. There is an old custom by which the parents actually push the girl out of the house. It is customary for the girl and her parents to weep, either as a matter of form or because of sincere sorrow.' <sup id="cite_ref-786" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-786">[786]</a></sup> 'Before the bride leaves her home, a meal is provided by her parents for her and for those who escort her. In the wedding procession there are generally one or more old women, relatives of the bride, a male relative or friend who manages the procession, the brothers of the bride and other friends who choose to go along. If it is a long distance to the groom's home, a meal is provided to be eaten by the way. In the bridal procession are generally carried such clothing, boxes, chests of drawers or other objects that have been given as bridal presents by her parents to the bride. The manager carries with him a bamboo tree with roots which symbolizes the large number of descendants of the couple. It is also supposed to have magic power to help the family thus to prosper. Sometimes a branch of a tea tree is also carried. Some plant the bamboo tree and others hang it up on the wall of the house. The liu shêng is not used at weddings for its notes are thought to be too sad for such occasions.' <sup id="cite_ref-787" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-787">[787]</a></sup> 'On arriving at the home of the groom, the brothers of the bride generally escort her into the house as a protection from demons. If she has no brothers, first cousins will do and lacking these, other male relatives may be invited to act as brothers. When entering the house the bride covers her face with a black and a white cloth. Her older brother goes in front and she holds onto his belt. Behind her an older or younger brother holds an umbrella over her as protection from demons.' <sup id="cite_ref-788" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-788">[788]</a></sup> 'Sometimes the bride and her companions enter the home and walk around in a circle three times. At other times, the Chinese custom of kowtowing three times to parents, relatives, and friends is followed. Tea is soon offered to the guests. According to an old custom that is no longer observed, the meat of a particular kind of bird and fish were provided at wedding feasts. There is always a wedding feast for the relatives and friends. One of the male relatives later counts before all the clothing, chests of drawers, and other things that have been sent along by the bride's parents. When her relatives and friends finally depart, the groom and his relatives go through a form of detaining her by force. This shows that [Page 38] they really want her but it is also true that brides sometimes run away at this time. Another ceremony that is sometimes performed at a wedding is that of calling the soul of the bride. Her soul may fail to come with her and if it does not come, she will die.' <sup id="cite_ref-789" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-789">[789]</a></sup> 'After a few months have passed, the bride is permitted occasionally to visit her parents, but henceforth her husband's home is her home and his family is her family. She calls her husband's parents father and mother.' <sup id="cite_ref-790" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-790">[790]</a></sup> 'During the marriage ceremonies offerings are generally made to the soil and to the ancestors who first gave grain to the Miao. These are regarded and treated practically as deities. There are two great demons or devils, and possibly three. gla□ d□y often drowns people in creeks and rivers. He seems to be related to the Chinese river demons who are the demons of people who are drowned themselves and who try to drown others so as to escape from their demon state. Some say that d□y means original and that gla□ d□y means original demon.' <sup id="cite_ref-791" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-791">[791]</a></sup> Marriage customs changed under Chinese influence, but go-betweens remained important: 'The former marriage customs of the Miao were slightly different from their present ways. Yung-sui T'ing Chih says: “Miao marriage is just like a purchase. They do not follow the /Chinese/ custom of asking names (as a preliminary to fixing a betrothal) and sending presents to the bride's home to fix the betrothal. They only negotiate about the number of horses and cattle through a broker. The broker is a Miao marriage go-between. It definitely requires five or six horses or heads of cattle to initiate a trade for one wife. When the agreement [Page 131] 94 cont. is reached an inauspicious /sic/ day is chosen to welcome the wife. The bride wears a moon-white gown and walks holding a parasol, half open, half shut, called the shame-hiding parasol. Her father and mother, brothers, and relatives escort her to the husband's house. The dowry consists of everything from cattle and sheep and goats to plows and harrows. They do not enter by the main door but through a hole bored through a wall. Men and women sit together. The bride is not allowed to look left or right, or else the husband would be displeased for fear that shermay be fond of some one else. The couple takes each a bowl of rice, a piece of fish, and a cup of wine dregs. Next they visit the paternal uncles' houses in the same village, at each eating and drinking the same items. On their return home they are husband and wife, but they do not spend the night together.” It also says: “The Miao do not object to marriage between people of the same surname, but relatives do not marry. On the wedding night the bride sleeps with her mother, who leaves only when the groom gives her some silver as a gift 95, called the “mother's money” or “milk money.” It is generally about two or three liang of silver. A wealthy family, seeing a pretty girl, might order their son to drag the girl from behind. This is called “carrying off a woman and marrying her by force.” The girl's family attracted by their wealth, do not engage the girl to anyone else, but get a go-between to discuss betrothal presents. When a virgin has an affair with a man, her parents know about it but do not forbid it. On the contrary, they consider this evidence that the man finds her desirable. But, if one's wife or concubine is seduced, then they raise knives, facing each other, and money is required as compensation. If a husband and wife do not get along, the husband may divorce her and marry again, and the wife may do the same. As to improper sexual conduct, instances were very rare even in former days, and today the Miao have become more aware of ethical and moral obligations.” (What is recorded in the Miao Fang Pei Lan is to the same effect.)' <sup id="cite_ref-792" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-792">[792]</a></sup> 'Today, the marriage customs of the Miao have been thoroughly influenced by the Chinese and have changed from the old ways. Boys and girls who like each other return home and tell their parents. The boy's family finds a go-between to approach the girl's family to discuss marriage. Once, twice, and sometimes three or four times, such approaches may be made before an agreement is reached. Having had indications of assent from the girl's family, the go-between goes back to report to the boy's family, who get ready two bottles of wine (a wealthy family would send along two chin of meat and two chin of noodles besides the wine). The gifts are carried back by the go-between to the girl's family, who invite him to drink wine and eat noodles. Where this procedure has been gone through then they reckon it to be the preliminary engagement, which in the Miao language is called (tiaŋ□ t□ mp`a□), meaning “to let the girl go,” also translated as /Chinese/ fang k'ou “to let go the mouth /door?/.”' <sup id="cite_ref-793" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-793">[793]</a></sup> 'After the preliminary engagement a period of time is allowed to elapse. Then the ceremony of sticking in incense has to take place, which is called /soŋ□ t'i □/), with the meaning of /Chinese/ na ts'ai, i.e. the sending of gifts to the bride's home and fix the betrothal. The date is selected by the boy's family, who then informs the girl's family. The gifts generally consist of 50 or 60 strings of cash, one outfit of clothing, a pair of earrings, a pair of bracelets, a few boxes of rice cakes, two chin of sweetmeats, two packages of firecrackers, one chin of oil, one chin of salt, a jug of wine, and several chin of meat. The quantity of the foregoing gift items depends largely upon the financial condition of the boy's family. Poor families may omit a few items, but money, clothes, rings, bracelets, firecrackers, wine, meat, incense and candles are necessary items. These gifts are carried by the brothers of the future groom, followed by the go-between, the future groom, and his father, to the girl's family. Sometimes, the future groom may not go. When the gifts arrive at the door to the house, firecrackers are set off, and the party is received outside the door by the clan [Page 133] 95 cont. brothers in the girl's family. After entering the door and a brief rest, the ceremony of sticking incense before the ancestral tablet of the girl's family begins. The groom kowtows three times. If he is not present, his father kowtows in his place. If the groom is present he must also kowtow to his future father-in-law, mother-in-law, and other elders. If the girl's family is wealthy, then a pig will be killed to entertain the guests from the groom's family. The guests remain in the girl's family for three days, during which the immediate relative of the girl's family take turns in entertaining them with meals, called “meals from door to door.” The closest relatives must entertain the visitors at breakfast, because breakfast is considered the most important meal in the Miao countryside. For instance, say there are six families, A, B, C, D, E, and F, with A and C being the closest relatives. Dinner on the first (■)ening is given by the host family, 96 breakfast on the second day is given by family A, lunch by family E, and dinner by family B. On the third day breakfast is given by family C, lunch by family F, and dinner by family D. When the guests are seen off on the fourth day, breakfast is given by the host family. As a rule three meals are served in a day, but when there are a large number of /clan/ brothers there are five or six meals in one day. After breakfast on the fourth day the guests depart. Return presents from the girl's family consist of a suit of clothes, a pair of shoes, and a hat for the future son-in-law, a piece of material for a pair of trousers for each guest, a pair of shoes each for the parents of the groom, and a pig's leg for the gobetween.' <sup id="cite_ref-794" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-794">[794]</a></sup> 'A few months or half a year before the marriage the gobetween visits the girl's family to ask for the date and time of her birth. He must bring with him two or four strings of cash and some sweetmeats. This ceremony is called “asking for the lucky birth date.” The girl's birth date and time thus obtained are matched with those of the groom in order to pick an auspicious day for the wedding. The date is communicated to the girl's family through the go-between. They then begin to [Page 134] 96 cont. get busy with the bride's marriage portion. Most commonly it consists of one or two trunks, four or five garments making one outfit, two pairs of trousers, and a suit of clothes for the groom. Such women's ornaments as earrings, rings, bracelets, and neck rings have been sent previously by the groom's family to the bride's, or silver is sent instead for the bride's family to have the ornaments made of it. On the day set the groom's family send along wine, meat, firecrackers, incense and candles, and torches, and recently they include sedan chairs or chairs. When they arrive before the entrance of the bride's family, recently, in imitation of the Chinese custom, they close the entrance and demand money for opening the gate in the sum of eight hundred cash or one string /one thousand/ of cash. Further, they intentionally curse the go-between and complain that the gifts of wine and meat sent by the boy's family are not enough. The bride then gets dressed up, and meanwhile a Miao sorcerer is invited to make sacrifices to the ancestors. A square table is laid with sacrificial items, incense and candles, and the sorcerer priest recites incantations, kowtows, and performs divination with straws, to cut off the powers of evil. He lights two torches, opens a parasol, and invites the bride to come out to kowtow three times to the ancestral tablet. After this she kowtows once to her parents, once to all her brothers and paternal male cousins, and once to her maternal grandparents. This done, she turns around facing outside and mounts the sedan chair (in a rich family) or walks (middle-class family), holding a half-opened parasol. The brothers, sisters, cousins, mother's married sisters, mother's brothers wives, and mother of the bride accompany her on the way. If the bride arrives too early at her husband's house, she has to wait in a side building or take a rest in a neighbor's house. At that time a table is laid in front of the entrance with incense and candles, a piece of cooked meat, and three cups of wine. A guest sorcerer offers the following prayer: “The day is auspicious, the moment is opportune, Heaven and earth open out. [Page 135] 96 cont. The bride arriving here brings Great luck and great prosperity. The peach tree is young and beautiful and upright! The maiden goes to her bridegroom's house to become     a pair of phoenixes. Acting correctly toward the members of the family,     she descends from the sedan chair, Lightly she moves with short steps into the decorated     hall. The bride's family's carriage and horses turn and go     back. The husband's carriage and horses come out to wel-     come her. And after this exchange of carriages and horses, Heaven will be long and earth lasting; Earth will be lasting and heaven long.” At this point he takes hold of a cock and continues: “This chicken is not an ordinary one, It is the chicken which announces dawn to the     Prince's Mother. Wearing a heroic comb and a fine beak, Dressed in silk gauze clothes in five hues, People of this world have no use for it.97 But I use it to exorcise evil influences, Of heaven and earth, Of the year, the month, the day, the hour, And of the twelve evil spirits. The evil influences of heaven return to heaven; Of the earth returns to Hades. Thus, the evil spirits retreat And the lucky stars descend.”' <sup id="cite_ref-795" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-795">[795]</a></sup> 'On finishing the incantation he bites open the comb of the cock and sprays its blood on the ground. Returning to the house, he sets another square table like the one before and continues: “O! ye, holy spirits of the heavens And the holy spirits of the earth! [Page 136] 97 cont. I am invoking the benignant spirits of union To this mundane world. The mission is none other than To officiate at this marriage rite. We ask the Heaven Uniting Spirit, The Earth Uniting Spirit, The Year Uniting Spirit, The Day Uniting Spirit, The Hour Uniting Spirit, The twelve uniting spirits and twelve uniting fairies, Tung Wang Kung /Lord of the East, leader of the male immortals/ Hsi Wang Mu /Lady of the West, leader of the female immortals/ The Cowherd and the Weaving Girl /names of stars/ And the Old Immortal in the moon.”' <sup id="cite_ref-796" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-796">[796]</a></sup> 'At this point he takes a cup of wine and a piece of meat, and writes out an incantation. After burning this he asks the groom to drink half of the wine and to eat half of the meat, the rest being for the bride when she comes in. These are called the uniting wine and the uniting meat. After the sorcerer priest has finished this performance, he sets off firecrackers and leads the bride into the house through a small side door. She sits down beside the fire pit, in which a huge fire has been started. The chair is placed slightly farther away for fear that the fire would give out too much heat. The chair cannot be pushed backward; it can only be pulled forward. The movement backward is recognized to be inauspicious; the forward movement then is auspicious. The sitting direction must be facing inside or in the direction of the ancestral tablet. After being seated she first washes her face with water. It has been boiled in a cooking pot with t'ung grass, pa-lun grass, and huang-mao grass, taken out and put in a basin, and incantations written and recited. While the bride is washing her face, the sorcerer priest sweeps with a broom several times behind her. After washing, she eats the meat and drinks the wine left by the groom. [Page 137] 97 cont. She is kept company by those who escorted her here. The brothers of the bride set the bridal chamber in order, and the groom's family gives them one or two strings of cash, a piece of meat, and two cups of wine. First half of the wine is spilled on the floor and the rest is drunk up, but the meat is all consumed. After these things have been done, the wedding feast begins. The dishes include beef, pork, bean-starch vermicelli, bean curd fried in oil, greens, etc. After the meal, the singing begins. Men and women guests gather in a group while men and women of the host family gather in another group. First the host of the groom's family begins to sing, (singing one of the “Welcoming the Bride Songs,” see the chapter, “Folk Songs,” no. 3). If the opposite side does not take up the singing, they use all means to encourage them. The phrases sung generally consist first of polite exchanges. In addition they sing legends, do Chinese characters, make riddles, and praise each other, etc. In the singing there is winning and losing: for instance, if A 's singing says B is polite, and B is not able to answer, saying he is not polite, then B is reckoned the loser; or if B sings that he himself is ignorant of etiquette, and A fails to sing back of his skill in etiquette, then B is the winner. Again, if A sings the name of a personage of antiquity whom B does not know, or if A offers a riddle which B fails to solve - these would be reckoned losing counts for B. The loser can no longer participate in the singing, and if a whole group fails to sing back the answer to the opposite side, then the whole group loses out. Experts in singing can match songs back and forth all night to a draw. 98 In the middle of the night they eat mi-pa /rice cakes/ as refreshments. In the singing the women keep things going, for they bring up subjects to be answered by the men. Ordinarily men are easily defeated, because women lose only when they can pick no more subjects for the men to answer. Sometimes the singing lasts for three nights, but usually one or two nights (see chapter, on “Folk Songs,” nos. four to 13, “Welcoming the Bride Songs,” and nos. 14 to 18, “Songs Sung in Company”). The guests remain [Page 138] 98 cont. for three days, the same as at the time of “sticking in incense.” They are also entertained in rotation by the closest relatives of the host. After breakfast on the third day a large table is set up in the main room. Eloquent elder men and women of the two families are invited to sit down around the table to count and announce the number of presents from the bride's family. First, the suit, shoes, and hat from the bride's parents to the son-in-law are announced, next the material for trousers from the guests to the groom, and then the presents from the bride's family to the elders of the groom's family. Then they record the cash and articles presented by the groom's family in return to the bride's family. For instance, if the dowry from the girl's family was 80 strings of cash, the groom's family returns 50. In a family of wealth, this money is usually left with the bride and not taken back. The guests who presented trousers receive one or two strings of cash in return. The bridesmaids also receive one or two strings of cash. The bride's family receives a pig's leg, and the go-between gets a pig's head. While the presents are being announced, the men and women sitting around the table talk and sing, in response to each other. (See Chapter 11, “Folk Songs,” songs no. 19, 20, 21, and 22, “Seeing the Guests off on the Third Morning.) During these three days the bride and groom do not share the same room. When the bride's family is escorted back, the bride goes along and stays for one or three days before she comes back to her new home to share the room with the groom.' <sup id="cite_ref-797" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-797">[797]</a></sup> Divorce was tolerated and fairly easy to obtain: 'Divorces are very easy with the Miao. The lack of good looks, a difference in wealth between the families, incompatibility, lack of good behavior - any of these constitutes grounds for divorce. Either side may initiate a divorce action. The children of a divorced couple are generally kept by the man, but an unweaned baby is kept by the woman to be restored to the man when it grows up. If the man's family is destitute, the children are kept by the woman's family. After the divorce either side may remarry at will.' <sup id="cite_ref-798" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-798">[798]</a></sup> Widows were free to re-marry, but required the approval of her brothers-in-law, who might pursue levirate marriage: 'A widow has freedom of sexual intercourse. There is no definite period of mourning for her deceased husband and she may remarry at any time, except that she must have the approval of the brothers of the deceased husband. If either the elder or the younger brother of the deceased wishes to marry the widowed sister-in-law, then she may not marry an outsider. Otherwise she returns to her family to marry again. At the time of the second marriage a sorcerer priest is also asked to perform the ritual. There is no go-between nor a formally set date. At the wedding the “shame-covering parasol” must be opened fully. On reaching her new husband's home she enters by the front entrance.99 A widow may marry again and again. Furthermore, she can have a husband marry into her household.' <sup id="cite_ref-799" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-799">[799]</a></sup> While the above descriptions refer to the Republican period, we have assumed them to be true of the Qing period as well.

The New Year's festival features prominently in the ethnography: 'Festivals were abundant and differed widely by region, although the New Year was commonly of central importance. Everywhere the Miao lusheng or bamboo reed pipe organ was a key musical instrument along with drums, different horns and flutes, a kind of jew's harp, and a long tubular instrument called the mantong. Blowing through leaves also was widespread. Multiple genres of song were accompanied by numerous conventions for their social usages. Other activities at festivals included processional dancing, bullfights, horse races, cock and other bird fights, mountain climbing, ball tossing, and dragon boat races.' <sup id="cite_ref-802" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-802">[802]</a></sup>//'The First Month. The first day of the first month is the beginning of the year. The Miao -I in this district would stick up paper money on the door of the house, which is also decorated with red peppers strung together with scented rice straw. Some of the Chung-chia people imitate the Chinese by asking calligraphers to pen symmetrical New Year verses for the door, [Page 99] 180 cont. and then hang out knots of scented rice straw, but no red peppers. These decorations are in expectation of a prosperous year.' <sup id="cite_ref-803" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-803">[803]</a></sup>//'After having celebrated “The Big Year” on the thirtieth day of the twelfth month and having decorated the door on the New Year's day, the Hua Miao and the Ch'ing Miao would remain at home to rest without doing any work. The food for the New Year was prepared in advance on a lucky day (dragon and dog days are lucky), and it is not cooked again until another lucky day comes around. So on New Year's day there is no kitchen drudgery as only pre-cooked meals are eaten. The New Year's day being the first of the year, everything has to be auspicious and inhibitions are many. For instance, 1) no sewing is done by women at home; 2) nothing is taken into the house from outside; 3) no water is carried; 4) no knife is used; 5) no one is allowed to go barefooted and shoes must be worn; 6) no cursing is allowed; 7) no rapping on the wall is allowed; 8) the floor must not be swept; 9) no collection of debt is permitted. Besides, there are the proverbial “three days of liberty” when parents would allow their sons and daughters unrestrained freedom in the pursuit of recreation and happiness on the first, second and third days of the year. After this period the children once more submit themselves to parental restraint. On the first day of the year the old and young are clothed in new garments and have fun all day long. Only the Hsiung and Yang families among the Ch'ing Miao have the custom of worshipping ancestors in the evening. At the time of the sacrifice, the head of the family would spread a straw mat on the floor of the middle room or the side room and place on it incense and candles as well as three bowls of rice. In each bowl is pitched a piece of pork on a bamboo stick with three straw knots to represent the ancestors. In addition there are three bowls of beancurd and three pieces of tz'u-pa /glutinous rice balls/. They call out aloud to ask their ancestors to pass the New Year with them. Then the male members of the family begin to kowtow in the order of their age. After the paper money is completely burned, they gather up the things on the straw mat. The rice straw and the bamboo [Page 100] 181 cont. sticks are thrown into the temple of the Earth God outside the village.' <sup id="cite_ref-804" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-804">[804]</a></sup>//'The New Year activities of the Chung-chia are slightly different from those of the Hua Miao and Ch'ing- Miao. On the first day of the year they also wear new clothes and decorate their doorway. At about seven o'clock in the morning they make sacrifices to their ancestors in the hall with several bowls of rice and meat while incense and candles are burned and fire-crackers are set off. The whole family, old and young, male and female, all participate in the ceremony as they perform the ritual of “three kneelings and nine kowtows.” After the sacrifice, the family settles down to a New Year feast in the hall, after which they stop working and laugh and joke all day. Their restrictions are similar to those of the Hua Miao and Ch'ing Miao. [...] On the second day of the New Year, the Hua Miao and the Ch'ing Miao would gather their family members after breakfast and with spades on their shoulders and wearing straw hats they would march off to their farms to do a little ploughing and digging, the idea being that this first “earth-removing” inaugurates a year's agricultural activities. With the Chung-chia, there is no definite day for the beginning of farm work, but it is generally around the tenth day of the first month. During the first three days of the year the Hua Miao, the Ch'ing Miao and the Chung-Chia would all stay home without going out for fear of meeting with unlucky events. On the fourth day the villages become astir with New Year visits between [Page 101] 182 cont. friends and relatives, and the younger generations pay respects to their elders (The New Year gifts for the children vary from ten to twenty cents.) When they exchange visits and greetings they bring with them a couple of home-made tz'u pa (each about 1 sheng of rice), candies and refreshments as gifts. The host and hostesses must entertain the visitors with tea and wine. The tenant farmers also present similar New Year gifts to their landlords, who in return would give them pieces of cloth or other household articles. As a rule such New Year greetings do not extend beyond the twelfth day though intimate relatives may offer theirs until the fifteenth. If a relative who has kept up these New Year visits throughout the past years fails to turn up, the family will be greatly offended. The Miao -I take the New Year greetings very seriously, and hence they should not be neglected.' <sup id="cite_ref-805" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-805">[805]</a></sup>//'The fifteenth day of the first month is the “Small New Year” with the Hua Miao and the Ch'ing Miao. That evening they put in front of the doorway a small table, on which are placed as sacrificial offerings a bowl of rice, a piece of meat and a cup of rice wine. Burning incense and lighting candles, they would kneel down and pray: “We pray to the Buddha tonight to guide us this year smoothly to wealth and prosperity.” After the prayer, the old and young, except the womenfolk, worship in turn. Then they sit down together for a feast in the hall. After dinner they have fun for the rest of the evening. The Chung-chia celebrate the “Small New Year” on the thirtieth day of the first month. Besides other delicacies at the table, every family makes tz'u-pa balls fried in oil, known as “eating oil balls.” They make sacrifices to their ancestors in great piety.' <sup id="cite_ref-806" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-806">[806]</a></sup>//'Among the Miao there is a swing game, which is quite interesting. On farm holidays when there are fairs or during the New Year festival, they put up frameworks for swings on a vacant lot. Each framework supports two swings, and every swing has four compartments, each fastened with ropes and a board. Each swing seats four men or women, going around with the wheel (Illus. 120). Men and women sing back and forth as they swing along (see chapter, “Folk Songs” /not translated/). The following song is about the origin of the swing: Songs and singing are as old as time,   Found in all books everywhere. A son of a unicorn was born in the   Sung dynasty. The young man with a clever mind sought   a mate. He searched for a beauty but was   ashamed of his own ugliness. He loved beauty but beauty was   hard to meet. He asked someone for a plan. And was told to make a swing for people   to enjoy. [Page 353] 236 Page 356] 239 cont. Shouting, he made known his invitation.   A maid from the Sleeping Tiger Mountain, Came to ride on the eight-men swing.   She was loved by all present. Soon, a go-between was found - Man and wife were joined together for a   hundred years.' <sup id="cite_ref-807" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-807">[807]</a></sup>//'Besides weddings and funerals, friends and relatives may exchange presents on New Year festivals or other happy occasions. Ordinarily when friends and relatives visit a family, the host, no matter whether he is rich or poor, must serve wine and food, if he did not the guests would view it as a sign of contempt. Intimate friends and relatives making the first call are not treated with goose or duck for fear that there might be quarrels between them later to hurt each other's feelings, as the beaks of the goose and duck are flat and large and therefore portend querulousness. If a chicken is used it must be cooked whole to see if the two eyes are completely closed. If one or two eyes are half open, then it is an evil portent.' <sup id="cite_ref-808" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-808">[808]</a></sup>//Some authors claim sexual licence among young people as part of the festivities, but this has been contested: 'When the parents are unwilling to marry off a daughter, or nobody seeks her hand in marriage, or when the parents are unable or fail to make an engagement for a son, the marriageable person endeavors to win a mate. For this purpose he or she goes to the market place on the third day of the third moon, at tuan yang □ on the fifth day of the [Page [facing p. 36]] [Page 36] fifth moon, or at some other convenient time, or attends one of the Miao feasts or festivals, or joins those playing on the mountain-sides at New Year time. Either the boy or the girl can make the first advances. The methods are to look lovingly with the eyes, to squeeze hands and to speak loving words. This is inconvenient if there are many people about. A boy may take a girl's handkerchief or a girl take a boy's. Then the person who gets the handkerchief goes away and the other says, “That person has taken my handkerchief. Stay here and I will go after him (or her).” Then in a quiet secluded place they make love. They say loving words, squeeze each other's hands, and embrace. A very great evidence of love is when one spits and the other swallows the spittal. Copulation often follows after which a handkerchief or a ring may be given by the boy to the girl or vice versa and they make a vow such as, “If you do not marry me and marry another, you must take this engagement present and eat it and then I will make no trouble.” It is believed by the Ch'uan Miao men that copulation is one of the surest ways to a woman's affection.' <sup id="cite_ref-809" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-809">[809]</a></sup>//Graham provides a translation of incantations performed on New Year's: 'When the rice biscuits have been eaten, you must go and remove diseases and remove calamities and remove pains and remove quarrels and remove sins.

When a Miao is seriously ill and it is found through divination that the kuei of the water buffalo is causing the trouble, or when a person is childless by middle age and it is divined that the water buffalo kuei is preventing the Queen of the Nether World at South Heaven Gate to send forth a child, a Miao sorcerer is invited to the house to burn beeswax, to beat gong and drum, and to make a great vow to bludgeon an ox. After the vow is made, if the sickness has been cured or the son sought is born, it is then believed that the kuei of the ox has bestowed it. Then, it becomes necessary to make preparations to fulfil the vow to bludgeon an ox. The selection of the water buffalo to buy is most important. It is necessary to select a water buffalo with the four quarters having four spirals /?/ and the ears, eyes, mouth, nose, horns, and hoofs must be right and complete. Sometimes it is very difficult to buy such an animal, and when found, the price is always prohibitive. If the host succeeds in buying a water buffalo at the market, then someone is sent home ahead to carry the news, so that the members of the family can prepare gongs and drums to meet the ox halfway. When the ox is led into the house, the gongs and drums stop, and [Page 208] 141 cont. incense and paper are burned. They watch the stance of the animal to divine good and bad luck. If the water buffalo, on entering the house, lifts his feet to advance, with its head facing the incense censer, and glances at the ancestral shrine, then it portends good luck. If the water buffalo is stubborn and refuses to move forward or even tries to back out as if frightened, then it portends bad luck. After the water buffalo has been bought, a Miao sorcerer is asked to come to the house to present the ox to the kuei, and also to beseech the kuei. After this presentation, the family has to wait for the first frost after the autumn harvest to make the sacrifice. When the date is decided it is never changed or postponed.' <sup id="cite_ref-812" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-812">[812]</a></sup>//'After the autumn harvest has been completed and the first frost has arrived, an auspicious day is chosen to sacrifice to the kuei. Half a month before, four paternal male cousins are asked to go separately to where the relatives live to notify them. The most important relatives are the families of the hosts mother's brother and the wife's maternal uncle, who are said to be the “leg-bearing relatives.” They are so-called because after sacrificing to the kuei, one leg of the buffalo is given to the maternal uncle's relatives. A buffalo is divided into four legs. The first belongs to the /host's/ mother's brother, the second to the wife's maternal uncle, and the third and fourth are sent to other close relatives. The “leg-bearing relatives on receiving the notification presents the messenger with a strip of red cloth as an expression of gratitude. Moreover, within the 12 days before the sacrifice, one must avoid seeing unclean things, such as a dead cat, a dead dog, or a dead person. If this avoidance is violated, then the person may not be in the company of the buffalo kuei. The “leg-bearing” relatives often go together with the clan brothers /of the host/, making up a number of at least ten or more men up to as many as 60 or 70. Also invited are musicians, trumpeteers /?/, and drummers, to go in formation. Wealthy families imitate the old customs of the former Manchu dynasty, displaying official insignia, playing fine music, and beating gongs and carrying parasols. The maternal uncle's family entitled to the first leg [Page 209] 141 cont. also must provide a sharp spear and a large creeper. The spear is used to stab the ox, and the creeper, to tie its head.' <sup id="cite_ref-813" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-813">[813]</a></sup>//'The Bludgeoning the Ox sacrifice to the kuei is the most lavish affair of the Miao. In addition to the water buffalo, the host also has to buy a common ox, two pigs, two chickens, and incense and paper, firecrackers, sweet wine, and sour fish. The relatives all have to send gifts. Formerly the Miao Bludgeoning-the-Buffalo sacrifice to the kuei lasted for five days, but now it lasts only three days. The first day is to honor the guests. That morning the “leg-bearing” relatives arrive in formation. As they approach the host's house they set, off firecrackers and play music. The host comes out to welcome them by burning incense and paper before them and kowtowing three times. The Miao consider that the water buffalo kuei comes with the mother's brother. By the time the lamps are lit in the evening, most of the guests invited have arrived; and after supper men and women guests begin to sing songs (see the chapter “Folk Songs,” songs Nos. 29 and 30, “Eating Ox Song,” and songs 33, 34, and 35, called “Beating the Flower Drum Song” /not translated/) and dance drum dances. [...] The host first starts the drumming, followed by the “leg-bearing” relatives, then by other guests according to the degree of relationship with the host, and last by the helpers. At the same time the sorcerer-priest begins his performance, using two large tables put together in the main house to make a long table, on which are then spread rice husks, on which are placed wine bowls, meat bowls, an iron tripod holding a tin can, and an upper millstone. The table is surrounded on all four sides with a number of plank benches. The sorcerer-priest and four “leg-bearing” relatives properly dressed in full dress, and sometimes they wear spirit robes /shen p'ao/. The sorcerer-priest sits in the middle and the four men sit next. Those who blow trumpets and beat drums and gongs sit below. The sorcerer-priest, ringing a hand bell with his right hand and holding a chiao-tzu in his left hand, begins uttering an incantation. [Page 210] 142 cont. After each passage the musicians play their instruments a while. When the sorcerer-priest has occasion to stand up, the four “leg-bearing” men who accompanied the kuei also stand up; when the sorcerer-priest sits down, the “leg-bearing” men also sit down; when he presents wine, they must also do so. From first to last it is done nine times until late at night.' <sup id="cite_ref-814" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-814">[814]</a></sup>//'In the morning of the second day the sorcerer-priest orders the helpers to go outside the village to choose an open area to erect Five-Flower pillars. After the pillars are erected they make bamboo rings with bamboo strips and put them around the pillars. A piece of hemp rope is used to tie the nose of the ox to the bamboo ring. The creeper brought by the “leg-bearing” relatives are used to bind up the horns so that the animal cannot hurt anyone with the horns, see Illus. 63. After the arrangements have been finished, the sorcerer-priest is asked to make an inspection, and if he finds everything satisfactorily arranged, then they can proceed. The host then changes into new clothes, and offers wine and meat as sacrifices to the kuei, burns incense and paper, and kneels three times and kowtows nine times facing the ox. At the same time the sorcerer-priest utters an incantation, telling the origin of the ox kuei. After the incantation is finished, the mother's brother takes hold of the spear and acts as if he were chasing the ox to stab it. The spear is then taken by a young man to do the actual stabbing of the animal. At the same time the din from the drums and gongs rends the air and the ox runs around the Five-Flower pillars, /Illus. 63 appears between pp. 142 and 143./ 143 with the man pursuing and repeatedly stabbing, until the animal is dazed and falls to the ground. They note the direction in which the head falls to decide whether the sign is auspicious or not. If the head faces toward the host's house, it is a good omen; if the head faces away, then it is a bad omen. After the animal has been stabbed to death, then the meat is divided up. The head and heart, liver, entrails, and bowels go to the host to be used to sacrifice to the kuei. The left and right hind legs go to the “first- and second-leg-bearing” relatives, [Page 211] between pp. 142 and 143. [Page 212] 143 cont. and the left and right forelegs to the “third- and fourth-leg-bearing” relatives. The breast portion goes to the sorcerer-priest.' <sup id="cite_ref-815" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-815">[815]</a></sup>//'In the morning of the third day, the sorcerer-priest once more performs his ritual in the main house. At the same time the guests are leaving. Besides the “leg-bearing” relatives, who each receives a leg, the other friends and relatives all get portions of the beef from six liang to half a chin, sometimes as much as two chin, depending upon the degree of intimacy they have with the host.' <sup id="cite_ref-816" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-816">[816]</a></sup> While the above descriptions refer to the Republican period, we have assumed them to be true of the Qing period as well.</dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Ideology forbids slavery for co-ethnics ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> Diamond mentions Yi slaves: 'Opium was also an important feature of the economy until the 1920s: the Hua Miao grew it, but they had no control over its sale, and very few were attracted to its use. Most Hua Miao villages were tenant communities on lands held by Han or Hui, or more commonly in this area, by members of the elite strata of the Yi (also called Nosu or Black Yi). In the pacification of the region, large tracts of land were awarded to the Yi nobility by the expanding Chinese state. In return for the right to claim rentals and labor service, the Yi “native officials” (tu si) collected taxes for the state and generally maintained law and order within the boundaries of their estate holdings. This feudal system lasted until the 1920s. The Hua Miao met their obligations to these overlords by the forced growing of the opium poppy, payments in kind or in cash or a specified number of days of labor service (agricultural work, collecting of firewood, household service, transport work). However, as tenants they were free to move residence, to change landlords and to make their own marriage arrangements, rights that were not granted to the slave class within Yi society. Within the ethnic stratification of the area, the Hua Miao ranked below the Yi nobility and freeborn classes, and below the Hui and the Han, but their status was better than that of the Yi slaves-some of whom were Han who had been forced into slavery. Relations between the Hua Miao and their Yi overlords were tense but in general the Yi made no attempt to force the Hua Miao to assimilate to Yi cultural [Page 65] practices, and at times the Miao fled from the Han to the protection of the Yi.' <sup id="cite_ref-817" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-817">[817]</a></sup> But we have found no evidence of slavery among the Hmong.

The following is relevant, but does not indicate anything about supernatural enforcement of kinship obligations. Reliable published material on the kinship system is sparse, and Hmong were pressured to take Chinese surnames, possibly biasing data through a gradual ‘Sinification’ of the kinship system. It appears that both patrilineal and matrilineal patterns existed, with strong bilaterality in practice. Material wealth was transmitted patrilineally and ornaments/family heirlooms were transmitted matrilineally. The monogamous family was the primary socio-economic unit, but ties with the extended family were important. Multiple ‘ethnic’ and surname groups were present, but no clear clan structure. Some sources claim that Hmong could claim hospitality from all families belonging to the same name group. Brothers were expected to support each other when in need. Extended kin played a special role in some sacrificial family feasts, and surname groups occasionally celebrated memorial ceremonies to honour legendary ancestors. Ancestors were important in general, which suggests that supernatural enforcement of kin obligations was present: 'The above diagram gives the names of eight generations of the Ch'uan Miao. The names are those that would be used by the husband, who is called □ε9, when speaking directly to them. When speaking about them he precedes the terms by ko·3, meaning “my”. He adds the word na4, “great”, before each term when speaking about the relatives of another person.

Most Hmong were either tenants or smallholders, and accordingly occupied the lower strata of the 'free' population in the area, but Hmong society itself was not stratified. But respected elders served as informal leaders. Children were expected to defer to and respect their grandparents. Grandfathers instructed grandsons in the performance of rituals. The relationship with parents-in-law was characterized by deference and avoidance. Elders were deferred to in public meetings. While the material collected so far does not include explicit references to supernatural enforcement of kin obligations and respect, this seems likely in this case, given the presence of ancestor beliefs: 'The above diagram gives the names of eight generations of the Ch'uan Miao.

The “Sacrifice to the Ancestors” and “Eating Pigs” of the Miao religion and the “Local Divinity of the Soil” and the “Flying Mountain” ceremonies of the guest religion are all for the purpose of beseeching the kuei not to make trouble and seeking their protection. The special sacrifices for the avoidance of calamities may be divided into four categories: (1) for seeking a cure upon suffering illness; (2) for seeking cleansing after seeing a supernatural phenomenon or after any unlucky matter; (3) for seeking the resolution of a conflict that has arisen; (4) for seeking pardon for sins after death. Those sacrifices for the invocation of blessings may be divided into two categories; (1) to ask for wealth; (2) to ask for children. But there are many ceremonies which on one hand are to avoid calamities, and 130 at the same time are also ones which seek blessings. “Bludgeoning the Ox” of the Miao religion can be performed both for the cure of sickness and can also be performed to ask for children. “Redeeming a Vow to the No” of the guest religion may be performed for the cure of illness or to ask for wealth or children, or can be performed for all of these.' <sup id="cite_ref-843" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-843">[843]</a></sup> 'Among the 16 ceremonies of sacrifice to the kuei of the Miao religion that we were able to investigate, the “Sacrifice” to the “Ancestors” and “Eating Pigs” are routine sacrifices; “Ta Chia Hsien,” “Redeeming the Soul,” “Sacrifice to the Kuei of Pimples,” and “Bludgeoning the Ox” are for seeking cures for sickness; the “Ta Kan Lo,” “Sending Away the Supernatural Forces of the Old Tree,” “washing the cat,” and “washing the house” are for seeking cleansing after seeing a strange phenomenon or something unlucky; “Eating Blood” is for seeking resolution of a conflict that has arisen; and “Releasing the Soul of the Dead from Suffering” is for asking forgiveness of a dead person's sins.

Half a month before, four paternal male cousins are asked to go separately to where the relatives live to notify them. The most important relatives are the families of the hosts mother's brother and the wife's maternal uncle, who are said to be the “leg-bearing relatives.” They are so-called because after sacrificing to the kuei, one leg of the buffalo is given to the maternal uncle's relatives. A buffalo is divided into four legs. The first belongs to the /host's/ mother's brother, the second to the wife's maternal uncle, and the third and fourth are sent to other close relatives. The “leg-bearing relatives on receiving the notification presents the messenger with a strip of red cloth as an expression of gratitude. Moreover, within the 12 days before the sacrifice, one must avoid seeing unclean things, such as a dead cat, a dead dog, or a dead person.

The “leg-bearing” relatives often go together with the clan brothers /of the host/, making up a number of at least ten or more men up to as many as 60 or 70.

Wealthy families imitate the old customs of the former Manchu dynasty, displaying official insignia, playing fine music, and beating gongs and carrying parasols.

Standing in front of a winnowing basket set in front of the Peach Spring cave, he makes a low bow to the No shen with his hands in front, and utters an incantation to ask his patron saint to possess his body and to ask the ancestors of the host's family to come down. On finishing his incantation, he picks up a bowl of water with his left hand and makes his patron saint's esoteric gestures with his right hand, as if writing, facing the bowl of water. At the same time he also utters the incantation for cleansing the sacrificial objects. First he speaks of the origin of water; next he flicks some drops of water on the offerings with his fingers. The Miao think that the Szu Ming shen abstains from meat, wine, garlic, etc., and therefore the things have to be cleansed. After the cleansing, he divines with the chiao-tzu, and stops if [Page 269] Illus. 75. Images of Duke (■)o and Mother No. [Page 270] 179 cont. he gets the sheng chiao. Otherwise, the incantation and the divination are repeated. After cleansing the objects of the sacrifice, the sorcerer-priest then utters the incantation to invite the shen, and when the sheng chiao appears, the shen are considered to have come down. Then he gives the reason for the sacrifice of fulfilling the vow to the No, and asks the shen to accept the offerings. When the sheng chiao again appears, it is considered that the shen have accepted the offerings. Then for the whole family, big and small, one by one, he asks the protection of the shen, and one by one he divines to get the sheng chiao. Then he asks for protection for the six kinds of domestic animals and the five grains, and also asks for good fortune. When all the requests for protection have been made, he then requests the expulsion of pestilence: the pestilence of the sky, of the earth, the year, month, day, and hour, as well as devils and small kuei, also the expulsion of apparitions of the sky, the earth, the year, the month, the day, and the hour, and all other kinds of apparitions. For all it is necessary to get the yin chiao or the sheng chiao. If he gets the yang chiao, it is considered that the apparitions still have not yet gone, and the expelling and divination must continue.

Standing in front of a winnowing basket set in front of the Peach Spring cave, he makes a low bow to the No shen with his hands in front, and utters an incantation to ask his patron saint to possess his body and to ask the ancestors of the host's family to come down. On finishing his incantation, he picks up a bowl of water with his left hand and makes his patron saint's esoteric gestures with his right hand, as if writing, facing the bowl of water. At the same time he also utters the incantation for cleansing the sacrificial objects. First he speaks of the origin of water; next he flicks some drops of water on the offerings with his fingers. The Miao think that the Szu Ming shen abstains from meat, wine, garlic, etc., and therefore the things have to be cleansed. After the cleansing, he divines with the chiao-tzu, and stops if [Page 269] Illus. 75. Images of Duke (■)o and Mother No. [Page 270] 179 cont. he gets the sheng chiao. Otherwise, the incantation and the divination are repeated. After cleansing the objects of the sacrifice, the sorcerer-priest then utters the incantation to invite the shen, and when the sheng chiao appears, the shen are considered to have come down. Then he gives the reason for the sacrifice of fulfilling the vow to the No, and asks the shen to accept the offerings. When the sheng chiao again appears, it is considered that the shen have accepted the offerings. Then for the whole family, big and small, one by one, he asks the protection of the shen, and one by one he divines to get the sheng chiao. Then he asks for protection for the six kinds of domestic animals and the five grains, and also asks for good fortune. When all the requests for protection have been made, he then requests the expulsion of pestilence: the pestilence of the sky, of the earth, the year, month, day, and hour, as well as devils and small kuei, also the expulsion of apparitions of the sky, the earth, the year, the month, the day, and the hour, and all other kinds of apparitions. For all it is necessary to get the yin chiao or the sheng chiao. If he gets the yang chiao, it is considered that the apparitions still have not yet gone, and the expelling and divination must continue. Finally, he requests the shen to release the soul and to pass judgment on the divination. Then he requests the shen to accept the animal offered.' <sup id="cite_ref-854" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-854">[854]</a></sup> We have considered this to be a combination of purity and piety norms.

<dd><b>♠ in-group loyalty ♣ inferred present ♥</b> Reliable published material on the kinship system is sparse: 'Generally, Miao have been pressured to take Chinese surnames, which are transmitted patrilineally. Descent is said to be patrilineal, and in some places the Han patrilineage form has been adopted. However, matrilineal kin are important in some areas. In practice, there is strong evidence that the system is bilateral.' <sup id="cite_ref-855" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-855">[855]</a></sup> 'No serious comparative study of kin terms and lineage organization is yet available, and some of the writings on the subject suggest Miao politeness in telling Han investigators what they want to hear.' <sup id="cite_ref-856" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-856">[856]</a></sup> The monogamous family was the primary socio-economic unit, but ties with the extended family were important: 'The two-generation nuclear family is statistically the most common. Relations between spouses, and between parents and children, are more egalitarian than among the Han. Economic, social, and ritual ties are retained with natal kin. Visiting kinsfolk are welcome guests, and may come for extended visits.' <sup id="cite_ref-857" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-857">[857]</a></sup> 'The basic social organization /sic/ of the Miao is the family, and moreover their family structure is the small family system, which consists of husband, wife, and children under age. This kind of small family system is the original system of the Miao. The Miao Fang Pei Lan, in the chapter on villages, says: “Among the Miao people father and sons and brothers do not live together in one house. When a son grows up he lives apart, erecting a new house and then there is another household.” Because of the small family system their living quarters as a rule consist of two or three rooms. In the house there is only one bed, and the husband, wife, and children all sleep on it together. When a girl grows up, a separate bed may be set up for her. As a rule the Miao practice monogamy. Sometimes they take a concubine, to live together with the wife, or to live separately. In the family economy, men and women share agricultural work, but household chores are mainly the women's responsibility. Family property consists of fields, houses, animals, and furniture, tools, and utensils. When the children grow up, a boy gets married at 17 or 18, and is given a certain amount of property in order to build a separate house and establish a family. A girl marries at fifteen or sixteen. So, the small family system among the Miao can always be maintained, and is not likely to be expanded.' <sup id="cite_ref-858" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-858">[858]</a></sup> 'Because of strict adherence to the small family system, clan organization cannot develop. Among the pure Miao there are the following five surnames: Wu, Lung, Liao, Shih, and Ma. Such surnames as Yang, Shih, P'eng, Chang, and Hung were those of outsiders who married into Miao families and [Page 129] 93 cont. adopted their ways. Among the Shih /“rock”/ and Lung /“dragon”/ there are the Ta /“big”/ Shih and Shao /“small”/ Shih, the Ta Lung and Shao Lung. Shao Shih is also written with the character shih meaning “time,” and Shao Lung, also with the character lung meaning “eminent.” Although they have surnames, they do not have a closely knit organization of family clans, and so formerly they did not object to marriage between people of the same surname. However, no marriage was permitted between close relatives. In recent years they have come under Chinese influence, and know that people of the same surnames must not marry. Shao Shih /“small rock”/ was changed to be written with the character shih meaning “time,” and Shao Lung /“small dragon”/ was changed to be written with the character lung meaning “eminent,” in order to separate them from Ta Shih /“big rock”/ and Ta Lung /“big dragon”/, so that they could intermarry. Today, Miao family life has become more and more like that of the Chinese, and marriage and funeral rites largely follow Chinese customs, barely retaining remnants of some Miao customs.' <sup id="cite_ref-859" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-859">[859]</a></sup> Extended kin played a special role in some sacrifical family feasts: 'After the autumn harvest has been completed and the first frost has arrived, an auspicious day is chosen to sacrifice to the kuei. Half a month before, four paternal male cousins are asked to go separately to where the relatives live to notify them. The most important relatives are the families of the hosts mother's brother and the wife's maternal uncle, who are said to be the “leg-bearing relatives.” They are so-called because after sacrificing to the kuei, one leg of the buffalo is given to the maternal uncle's relatives. A buffalo is divided into four legs. The first belongs to the /host's/ mother's brother, the second to the wife's maternal uncle, and the third and fourth are sent to other close relatives. The “leg-bearing relatives on receiving the notification presents the messenger with a strip of red cloth as an expression of gratitude. Moreover, within the 12 days before the sacrifice, one must avoid seeing unclean things, such as a dead cat, a dead dog, or a dead person. If this avoidance is violated, then the person may not be in the company of the buffalo kuei. The “leg-bearing” relatives often go together with the clan brothers /of the host/, making up a number of at least ten or more men up to as many as 60 or 70. Also invited are musicians, trumpeteers /?/, and drummers, to go in formation. Wealthy families imitate the old customs of the former Manchu dynasty, displaying official insignia, playing fine music, and beating gongs and carrying parasols. The maternal uncle's family entitled to the first leg [Page 209] 141 cont. also must provide a sharp spear and a large creeper. The spear is used to stab the ox, and the creeper, to tie its head.' <sup id="cite_ref-860" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-860">[860]</a></sup> Graham treats family name complexes as clans, but reports no 'tribal' organization: 'There is also the family in the largest sense, which we may call the clan. All male persons of the same name, whether or not they are related to the others by birth, their unmarried daughters, their wives and the wives of their male descendants, are regarded as related. A person can remain indefinitely in the home of a family to which he is not related by birth but having the same family name and he pays nothing for his food and does not easily wear out his welcome. It is considered a crime for two persons having the same family name to marry although there is no known relationship. There are certain memorial ceremonies in which all partipate who have the same family name, for all such are regarded as blood relatives, especially if they can trace their descent to the same legendary ancestor.' <sup id="cite_ref-861" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-861">[861]</a></sup> 'It is noteworthy that all Ch'uan Miao who have the same name can participate in this ceremony, not merely those who are known to be related. It indicates that the clan idea still survives and that all having the same surname are regarded as relatives.' <sup id="cite_ref-862" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-862">[862]</a></sup> 'There is no tribal organization. That is, there is no political organization that extends throughout the entire ethnic group. A locality may elect a headman, called a gy l□u or old club, and the headmen of several different districts may cooperate for the general good, but the headmen are not bound together by an organization affecting the entire Ch'uan Miao region. If the Ch'uan Miao are a tribe, it is because they are physically related and have a common language, common customs, common ideals, and a common culture. These bind the people together more securely than could any political organization.'  <sup id="cite_ref-863" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-863">[863]</a></sup> Mutual aid and labour exchange were practiced within the residential communities and Hmong sub-groups: 'Furthermore, there is a feeling of fellowship, friendship and relatedness among all the Ch'uan Miao that results in a spirit of helpfulness and cooperation. It is said that no Ch'uan Miao need starve to death unless there is a drought or famine. If one family is destitute other Miao families will each contribute some food or other necessity and the poor family will be able to get along.' <sup id="cite_ref-864" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-864">[864]</a></sup> 'Both sexes engage in agriculture, care of livestock, and fishing, and men contribute some labor to domestic chores like cooking, gathering firewood, and child care. Men are expected to do the heaviest work, including plowing. Women sometimes participated on short hunting trips, but trips of several days or several weeks were undertaken by groups of men; hunting trips are now illegal. Labor exchange and cooperation between households was common even before collectivization.' <sup id="cite_ref-865" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-865">[865]</a></sup> Accordingly, there may have been a diffuse in-group on the level of the Hmong sub-group even though clans and tribal organization were absent. More material is needed in order to confirm this. We have assumed that the above descriptions are also applicable to the Qing period, even though they refer to the Republican period.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ respect for authority ♣ present ♥</b> Uprisings against the Chinese administration were common and Chinese authority was resented: 'Chinese scholarship links the present-day Miao to tribal confederations that moved southward some 2,000 years ago from the plain between the Yellow River and the Yangtze toward the Dongting Lake area. These became the San Miao mentioned in Han dynasty texts. Over the next thousand years, between the Han and the Song dynasties, these presumed ancestors of the Miao continued to migrate westward and southward, under pressure from expanding Han populations and the imperial armies. Chinese texts and Miao oral history establish that over those years the ancestors settled in western Hunan and Guizhou, with some moving south into Guangxi or west along the Wu River to southeastern Sichuan and into Yunnan. The period was marked by a number of uprisings and battles between Miao and the Han or local indigenous groups, recalled in the oral histories of local groups. Though the term "Miao" was sometimes used in Tang and Song histories, the more usual term was "Man," meaning "barbarians." Migration continued through the Yuan, Ming, and early Qing, with some groups moving into mainland Southeast Asia. The retreat from Han control brought some into territories controlled by the Yi in northeast Yunnan/northwest Guizhou. The various migrations can also be seen as "vertical" migrations into the undeveloped hillside and mountain areas that were of lesser interest to Han. Depending on the terrain, the settled farming cited in Miao historical myths gave way to shifting slash-and-burn agriculture, facilitated by the introduction of the Irish potato and maize in the sixteenth century, and the adoption of high-altitude/cool-weather crops like barley, buckwheat, and oats. Farming was supplemented by forest hunting, fishing, gathering, and pastoralism. During the Qing, uprisings and military encounters escalated. There were major disturbances in western Hunan (1795-1806) and a continuous series of rebellions in Guizhou (1854-1872). Chinese policies toward the Miao shifted among assimilation, containment in "stockaded villages," dispersal, removal, and extermination. The frequent threat of "Miao rebellion" caused considerable anxiety to the state; in actuality, many of these uprisings included Bouyei, Dong, Hui, and other ethnic groups, including Han settlers and demobilized soldiers. At issue were heavy taxation, rising landlordism, rivalries over local resources, and official corruption. One of the last Miao uprisings occurred in 1936 in western Hunan in opposition to Guomindang (Republican) continuation of the tuntian system, which forced the peasants to open up new lands and grow crops for the state.' <sup id="cite_ref-866" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-866">[866]</a></sup> 'From Song on, in periods of relative peace, government control was exercised through the tusi system of indirect rule by appointed native headmen who collected taxes, organized corvée, and kept the peace. Miao filled this role in Hunan and eastern Guizhou, but farther west the rulers were often drawn from a hereditary Yi nobility, a system that lasted into the twentieth century. In Guizhou, some tusi claimed Han ancestry, but were probably drawn from the ranks of assimilated Bouyei, Dong, and Miao. Government documents refer to the "Sheng Miao" (raw Miao), meaning those living in areas beyond government control and not paying taxes or labor service to the state. In the sixteenth century, in the more pacified areas, the implementation of the policy of gaitu guiliu began the replacement of native rulers with regular civilian and military officials, a few of whom were drawn from assimilated minority families. Land became a commodity, creating both landlords and some freeholding peasants in the areas affected. In the Yunnan-Guizhou border area, the tusi system continued and Miao purchase of land and participation in local markets was restricted by law until the Republican period (1911-1949).' <sup id="cite_ref-867" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-867">[867]</a></sup> Most Hmong were either tenants or smallholders, and accordingly occupied the lower strata of the 'free' population in the area: 'Prior to the 1950s land reform, some Miao were smallholders. Many, if not most, were tenants on lands owned by Han, Yi, Hui, and others. Few were true landlords, and most who rented out land were likely to work part of their holdings themselves with family labor. All land is now owned by the state, including undeveloped mountain and forest lands, thus limiting any expansion beyond lands officially assigned to an individual or village. In the process, pastoralism and forest hunting/gathering have been reduced. Before land reform, some Miao areas followed the practice of lineage or hamlet ownership of mountain and hillside lands even where some private holdings existed. People could open new lands for farming and settlement, share village pastures, or hunt away from their home area.' <sup id="cite_ref-868" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-868">[868]</a></sup> Hmong society was not stratified: 'The various Miao groups are for the most part an unstratified agricultural people found in the uplands of several provinces of China and related to the Hmong of Southeast Asia. They are distinguished by language, dress, historical traditions, and cultural practice from neighboring ethnic groups and the dominant Han Chinese. They are not culturally homogeneous and the differences between local Miao cultures are often as great as between Miao and non-Miao neighbors. The term "Miao" is Chinese, and means "weeds" or "sprouts." Chinese minority policies since the 1950s treat these diverse groups as a single nationality and associate them with the San Miao Kingdom of central China mentioned in histories of the Han dynasty (200 BC-AD 200).' <sup id="cite_ref-869" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-869">[869]</a></sup> 'Given the long period of Chinese rule, it is not possible to reconstruct precontact organization, though some areas still retain older lineage and clan names. Owing to dispersion, population decimation, and frequent migration, the multisurname settlement seems to be the most common. There was little class differentiation in the villages, and no formal political structure. Villages do not seem to have been formally linked by any kind of tribal organization and there was no formal political structure within villages.' <sup id="cite_ref-870" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-870">[870]</a></sup> But respected elders served as informal leaders: 'Respected knowledgeable elders, heads of family groups, and religious experts of both genders served as informal leaders. Among the more Sinicized, landlords and those who had some literacy in Chinese exercised power in the community. Under the present system, those who are members of the Communist party stand as the official leaders of the community.' <sup id="cite_ref-871" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-871">[871]</a></sup> Children were expected to defer to and respect their grandparents: 'Grandparents and grandchildren. The Magpie Miao have one elementary term (12) for paternal grandfather and a second (14) for paternal grandmother. A third term (15) is suffixed to the one or the other to designate maternal grandparents or may stand alone for MoMo. A single elementary term (16) denotes grandson; when prefixed by the term for daughter (4) it denotes a granddaughter.' <sup id="cite_ref-872" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-872">[872]</a></sup> 'The interaction between grandparents and grandchildren is characterized by helpfulness and affection on the part of the former and by deference on the part of the latter. A grandfather often instructs his grandson in ritual observances, and a grandmother assists in the domestic training of her granddaughter. Both manifest a warm interest in their grandchildren and take pleasure in playing with them in their leisure time.' <sup id="cite_ref-873" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-873">[873]</a></sup> The relationship with parents-in-law was characterized by deference and avoidance: 'The relationships between affines are more complex. A son-in-law defers to [Page 155] the opinions of his wife's parents, and his respect for them approaches avoidance in the case of his mother-in-law. Avoidance also prevails between a daughter-in-law and her husband's father, and the former is expected to be obedient toward her mother-in-law. A woman displays reserve in her relationship with her husband's elder brother. She avoids familiar conversation with him and refrains from walking beside him in public.' <sup id="cite_ref-874" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-874">[874]</a></sup> Elders were deferred to in public meetings: 'Whenever there is an emergency that requires a public meeting, the drum tower keeper, also known as messenger (or footman, who receives as remuneration from the village 1,000 catties of grain a year), would climb up the wooden pillar to beat the drum at the top, crying loudly at the same time. The tempo and the number of the beats vary according to a fixed set of rules. The “tum, tum” beats can be heard within a radius of many li. The first drum beat signifies a call for a meeting for some important affair, and upon hearing it, the villagers would abandon their work to listen attentively.192 The second drum beat is an urgent call to gather together at the drum tower, and the third drum beat is a signal for the meeting to start. Ordinarily, after the third beat each family would have without fail a representative at the drum tower. At the meeting the old people would have the [Page 109] 192 cont. floor first to state the facts and express their opinions. Then they huddle up to discuss the matter and reach a decision, after which they turn around to ask the young people whether or not they agree. In general, though policy decision is made by the elders, its execution is undertaken by the young, and therefore the approval of the latter is necessary. At the meeting they squat around helter-skelter, seemingly confused and without any procedure, but the spirit animating the meeting has a special merit. They have complete freedom of speech, anyone being able to express his opinion to his heart's content. The young as a rule have high respects for the old, and recognizing the latter's extensive knowledge, they are willing to leave all the decisions to the elders without offering any opinion of their own. They believe that they are only good for carrying out the decisions. So on all important affairs the old people express their ideas, and when approved by the young, the work is distributed and assigned for action without delay.' <sup id="cite_ref-875" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-875">[875]</a></sup> Due to the respect given to elders, we have coded the variable 'present', even in the absence of internal stratification. We have assumed that the above descriptions, while written in the Republican period, also apply to the Qing period.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ purity ♣ present ♥</b> Some sacrificial ceremonies had purifying aspects: 'Although the routine sacrifice is not held for any particular reason, its object is nevertheless the avoidance of calamities and the seeking of blessings. The “Sacrifice to the Ancestors” and “Eating Pigs” of the Miao religion and the “Local Divinity of the Soil” and the “Flying Mountain” ceremonies of the guest religion are all for the purpose of beseeching the kuei not to make trouble and seeking their protection. The special sacrifices for the avoidance of calamities may be divided into four categories: (1) for seeking a cure upon suffering illness; (2) for seeking cleansing after seeing a supernatural phenomenon or after any unlucky matter; (3) for seeking the resolution of a conflict that has arisen; (4) for seeking pardon for sins after death. Those sacrifices for the invocation of blessings may be divided into two categories; (1) to ask for wealth; (2) to ask for children. But there are many ceremonies which on one hand are to avoid calamities, and 130 at the same time are also ones which seek blessings. “Bludgeoning the Ox” of the Miao religion can be performed both for the cure of sickness and can also be performed to ask for children. “Redeeming a Vow to the No” of the guest religion may be performed for the cure of illness or to ask for wealth or children, or can be performed for all of these.' <sup id="cite_ref-876" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-876">[876]</a></sup> 'Among the 16 ceremonies of sacrifice to the kuei of the Miao religion that we were able to investigate, the “Sacrifice” to the “Ancestors” and “Eating Pigs” are routine sacrifices; “Ta Chia Hsien,” “Redeeming the Soul,” “Sacrifice to the Kuei of Pimples,” and “Bludgeoning the Ox” are for seeking cures for sickness; the “Ta Kan Lo,” “Sending Away the Supernatural Forces of the Old Tree,” “washing the cat,” and “washing the house” are for seeking cleansing after seeing a strange phenomenon or something unlucky; “Eating Blood” is for seeking resolution of a conflict that has arisen; and “Releasing the Soul of the Dead from Suffering” is for asking forgiveness of a dead person's sins. All the above, except for “Bludgeoning the Ox,” which asks for a son at the same time, are ceremonies performed for the avoidance of calamities.' <sup id="cite_ref-877" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-877">[877]</a></sup> Taboos related to polluting substances were observed before the performance of some sacrifices: 'After the autumn harvest has been completed and the first frost has arrived, an auspicious day is chosen to sacrifice to the kuei.

Cleansing the house in Miao is called [ndz(ə)□ p□γλ]. The two kuei invoked are [dei□ noŋγ d□] and [dei□ Iαγ noŋγ qa□]. The time is any time during broad daylight, and the place may be anywhere inside the house, either in the main room or in the side room, facing outside the door.

A piece of green cloth 6 ch'ih long is spread out on the ground under the table. On the cloth are one or two strings of copper yuan: they also use a cock, whose two wings are tied to a leg of the table. They do not use beeswax, but only use three slender sticks of incense stuck up in the mi-pa.

First we invoke the ancestors of the host. When you hear my call, please hurry down and receive the objects of sacrifice. Next we invoke the ancestors of the previous tenant.

After I have cleansed three times, the host may live in it with great prosperity, resources abundant, prosperous harvests of the five grains, and the increase of the six kinds of domestic animals. The trouble-making kuei have now been sent out the door, hereafter peace will be everlasting.” After the incantation has been completed, he then divines with the chiao. If either the yang chiao or the sheng chiao appears, it is auspicious, and paper is burned to send off the kuei. But if the yin chiao appears, then the incantation has to be said again, until he divines and gets either the yang chiao or the sheng chiao, when it is the end. After the sorcerer-priest has completed his performance, he drinks the wine on the table and takes the cock, meat, pa-pa, tofu, green cloth, and copper yuan offered in sacrifice to the kuei, home with him.' <sup id="cite_ref-879" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-879">[879]</a></sup> 'The Miao consider that a cat dying in the house is an ill omen, and it is then necessary to ask a sorcerer-priest to purify the house in order to expel harmful emanations.

Otherwise, the incantation and the divination are repeated. After cleansing the objects of the sacrifice, the sorcerer-priest then utters the incantation to invite the shen, and when the sheng chiao appears, the shen are considered to have come down. Then he gives the reason for the sacrifice of fulfilling the vow to the No, and asks the shen to accept the offerings. When the sheng chiao again appears, it is considered that the shen have accepted the offerings. Then for the whole family, big and small, one by one, he asks the protection of the shen, and one by one he divines to get the sheng chiao. Then he asks for protection for the six kinds of domestic animals and the five grains, and also asks for good fortune. When all the requests for protection have been made, he then requests the expulsion of pestilence: the pestilence of the sky, of the earth, the year, month, day, and hour, as well as devils and small kuei, also the expulsion of apparitions of the sky, the earth, the year, the month, the day, and the hour, and all other kinds of apparitions. For all it is necessary to get the yin chiao or the sheng chiao. If he gets the yang chiao, it is considered that the apparitions still have not yet gone, and the expelling and divination must continue. Finally, he requests the shen to release the soul and to pass judgment on the divination. Then he requests the shen to accept the animal offered.' <sup id="cite_ref-881" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-881">[881]</a></sup> While the above descriptions refer to the Republican period, we have assumed them to be true of the Qing period as well.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ kinship ♣ present ♥</b> Reliable published material on the kinship system is sparse: 'Generally, Miao have been pressured to take Chinese surnames, which are transmitted patrilineally. Descent is said to be patrilineal, and in some places the Han patrilineage form has been adopted. However, matrilineal kin are important in some areas. In practice, there is strong evidence that the system is bilateral.' <sup id="cite_ref-882" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-882">[882]</a></sup> 'No serious comparative study of kin terms and lineage organization is yet available, and some of the writings on the subject suggest Miao politeness in telling Han investigators what they want to hear.' <sup id="cite_ref-883" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-883">[883]</a></sup> eHRAF provides a general description of the marriage system: 'Marriages generally require parental consent but are based on mutual attraction and choice. In the past, many communities had "youth houses" where unmarried young people could gather. Groups of young men traveled around to court girls in other villages. In the absence of parental consent, elopement was an alternative. Festivals and trips to periodic markets still provide an opportunity for young people to meet, engage in antiphonal singing and dancing, and establish new friendships. Since the 1950s, travel restrictions and state disapproval of premarital sexual behavior has increased the parental role in marriage arrangement. Marriages are monogamous. Marriage outside the dialect or language group is rare. Divorce and remarriages are permitted. Postmarital residence is usually in the man's home village but only the youngest son lives with his parents after his marriage, and in instances where there are no sons a family may bring in a son-in-law or an aged widow or widower might join her married daughter's household. In some areas, there is delayed transfer of the bride until after the birth of her first child, or the practice of starting out with residence with the bride's family.' <sup id="cite_ref-884" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-884">[884]</a></sup> The monogamous family was the primary socio-economic unit, but ties with the extended family were important: 'The two-generation nuclear family is statistically the most common. Relations between spouses, and between parents and children, are more egalitarian than among the Han. Economic, social, and ritual ties are retained with natal kin. Visiting kinsfolk are welcome guests, and may come for extended visits.' <sup id="cite_ref-885" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-885">[885]</a></sup> 'The basic social organization /sic/ of the Miao is the family, and moreover their family structure is the small family system, which consists of husband, wife, and children under age. This kind of small family system is the original system of the Miao. The Miao Fang Pei Lan, in the chapter on villages, says: “Among the Miao people father and sons and brothers do not live together in one house. When a son grows up he lives apart, erecting a new house and then there is another household.” Because of the small family system their living quarters as a rule consist of two or three rooms. In the house there is only one bed, and the husband, wife, and children all sleep on it together. When a girl grows up, a separate bed may be set up for her. As a rule the Miao practice monogamy. Sometimes they take a concubine, to live together with the wife, or to live separately. In the family economy, men and women share agricultural work, but household chores are mainly the women's responsibility. Family property consists of fields, houses, animals, and furniture, tools, and utensils. When the children grow up, a boy gets married at 17 or 18, and is given a certain amount of property in order to build a separate house and establish a family. A girl marries at fifteen or sixteen. So, the small family system among the Miao can always be maintained, and is not likely to be expanded.' <sup id="cite_ref-886" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-886">[886]</a></sup> 'Because of strict adherence to the small family system, clan organization cannot develop. Among the pure Miao there are the following five surnames: Wu, Lung, Liao, Shih, and Ma. Such surnames as Yang, Shih, P'eng, Chang, and Hung were those of outsiders who married into Miao families and [Page 129] 93 cont. adopted their ways. Among the Shih /“rock”/ and Lung /“dragon”/ there are the Ta /“big”/ Shih and Shao /“small”/ Shih, the Ta Lung and Shao Lung. Shao Shih is also written with the character shih meaning “time,” and Shao Lung, also with the character lung meaning “eminent.” Although they have surnames, they do not have a closely knit organization of family clans, and so formerly they did not object to marriage between people of the same surname. However, no marriage was permitted between close relatives. In recent years they have come under Chinese influence, and know that people of the same surnames must not marry. Shao Shih /“small rock”/ was changed to be written with the character shih meaning “time,” and Shao Lung /“small dragon”/ was changed to be written with the character lung meaning “eminent,” in order to separate them from Ta Shih /“big rock”/ and Ta Lung /“big dragon”/, so that they could intermarry. Today, Miao family life has become more and more like that of the Chinese, and marriage and funeral rites largely follow Chinese customs, barely retaining remnants of some Miao customs.' <sup id="cite_ref-887" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-887">[887]</a></sup> Extended kin played a special role in some sacrifical family feasts: 'After the autumn harvest has been completed and the first frost has arrived, an auspicious day is chosen to sacrifice to the kuei. Half a month before, four paternal male cousins are asked to go separately to where the relatives live to notify them. The most important relatives are the families of the hosts mother's brother and the wife's maternal uncle, who are said to be the “leg-bearing relatives.” They are so-called because after sacrificing to the kuei, one leg of the buffalo is given to the maternal uncle's relatives. A buffalo is divided into four legs. The first belongs to the /host's/ mother's brother, the second to the wife's maternal uncle, and the third and fourth are sent to other close relatives. The “leg-bearing relatives on receiving the notification presents the messenger with a strip of red cloth as an expression of gratitude. Moreover, within the 12 days before the sacrifice, one must avoid seeing unclean things, such as a dead cat, a dead dog, or a dead person. If this avoidance is violated, then the person may not be in the company of the buffalo kuei. The “leg-bearing” relatives often go together with the clan brothers /of the host/, making up a number of at least ten or more men up to as many as 60 or 70. Also invited are musicians, trumpeteers /?/, and drummers, to go in formation. Wealthy families imitate the old customs of the former Manchu dynasty, displaying official insignia, playing fine music, and beating gongs and carrying parasols. The maternal uncle's family entitled to the first leg [Page 209] 141 cont. also must provide a sharp spear and a large creeper. The spear is used to stab the ox, and the creeper, to tie its head.' <sup id="cite_ref-888" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-888">[888]</a></sup> The consent of parents and maternal uncles was required for marriage: 'Although unmarried men and women are free to fall in love, marriage, however, requires parental consent as well as the approval of the maternal uncle of the girl. The He Miao of Ch'ing Chiang, Kweichow have a marriage custom where they betroth the daughter of a paternal aunt to be the daughter-in-law of a maternal uncle. Should the maternal uncle have no son, the girl's family has to pay a large sum of money to him. Without such a payment the girl all her life may not marry. The Miao, other than close paternal cousins not being suitable mates, they do not object to marriage between people of the same surname. However, maternal cousins may not marry. This is a survival from a matrilineal society, because in a matrilineal society maternal cousins have the same surname whereas cross cousins or male and female first cousins on the father's side have different surnames. That maternal cousins cannot marry is evidence of their advance from a matrilineal society to a patrilineal society. The importance of the maternal uncle's position in sacrificial ceremonies as well as in the society is additional evidence.' <sup id="cite_ref-889" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-889">[889]</a></sup> Graham treats family name complexes as clans, but reports no 'tribal' organization: 'There is also the family in the largest sense, which we may call the clan. All male persons of the same name, whether or not they are related to the others by birth, their unmarried daughters, their wives and the wives of their male descendants, are regarded as related. A person can remain indefinitely in the home of a family to which he is not related by birth but having the same family name and he pays nothing for his food and does not easily wear out his welcome. It is considered a crime for two persons having the same family name to marry although there is no known relationship. There are certain memorial ceremonies in which all partipate who have the same family name, for all such are regarded as blood relatives, especially if they can trace their descent to the same legendary ancestor.' <sup id="cite_ref-890" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-890">[890]</a></sup> 'It is noteworthy that all Ch'uan Miao who have the same name can participate in this ceremony, not merely those who are known to be related. It indicates that the clan idea still survives and that all having the same surname are regarded as relatives.' <sup id="cite_ref-891" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-891">[891]</a></sup> 'There is no tribal organization. That is, there is no political organization that extends throughout the entire ethnic group. A locality may elect a headman, called a gy l□u or old club, and the headmen of several different districts may cooperate for the general good, but the headmen are not bound together by an organization affecting the entire Ch'uan Miao region. If the Ch'uan Miao are a tribe, it is because they are physically related and have a common language, common customs, common ideals, and a common culture. These bind the people together more securely than could any political organization.'  <sup id="cite_ref-892" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-892">[892]</a></sup> Ancestors were important: 'The above diagram gives the names of eight generations of the Ch'uan Miao. The names are those that would be used by the husband, who is called □ε9, when speaking directly to them. When speaking about them he precedes the terms by ko·3, meaning “my”. He adds the word na4, “great”, before each term when speaking about the relatives of another person. On the right are the names of the husband for his own ancestors, on the left his names for his wife's ancestors. The wife uses the same terms for the husband's ancestors that the husband does. If the husband wishes he may call the ancestors of his wife by the same names as he would his own. Both the husband and the wife call the descendants by the same terms or names. The wife calls her own ancestors by the same names or terms that the husband does his ancestors.' <sup id="cite_ref-893" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-893">[893]</a></sup> While the above passages refer to the Republican period, we have assumed them to be applicable to the Qing period as well.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ bravery ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> Schein mentions bravery as being attributed to the Hmong, but it is unclear to which degree bravery was culturally valued at the time: 'Rebellious by Character Many sketches have been made of what might be described a Miao “national character,” pointing to collections of personal traits and emotional dispositions attributed to the group as a whole. In their many characterizations by Westerners, the Miao have been painted as “passionate, easily offended, suspicious, revengeful, brave, and indifferent to hunger and cold” (Edkins 1870:74), as “friendly and hospitable” (Betts 1900-1901:104), as “a very lovable people, quick to recognize right and wrong, kind and gentle in their association with one another, buoyant and joyous, and at times industrious almost beyond belief” (Crisler 1937:51-52), as “much given to litigation” (Clarke 1907:258), and as “warlike, frank, lawless, primitive, openhearted, opposed to trading and city life” (Kemp 1921:177). Miao self-description and recent mainstream Chinese portrayals have emphasized other attributes, equally as reified. In one rendition, they are considered to have common psychological qualities (gongtong xinli suzhi) such as being “warmhearted and forthright” (requing haoshuang), “loving and pursuing freedom” (re'ai he zhuiqiu ziyou), having a strong “pioneer spirit and the ability to live on their own” (kaituo jingshen yu ziwo shengcun negli) (Yang 1989:19). Fei Hsiao-t'ung praised their willingness to labor, calling them “qinlao de Miaozu” (the hardworking Miao) (1988:31) as well as “ke ai de” (likable, lovely) (1988:36).' <sup id="cite_ref-894" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-894">[894]</a></sup> More information is needed.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ respect for property ♣ present ♥</b> Most Hmong were smallholders or tenants: 'Prior to the 1950s land reform, some Miao were smallholders. Many, if not most, were tenants on lands owned by Han, Yi, Hui, and others. Few were true landlords, and most who rented out land were likely to work part of their holdings themselves with family labor. All land is now owned by the state, including undeveloped mountain and forest lands, thus limiting any expansion beyond lands officially assigned to an individual or village. In the process, pastoralism and forest hunting/gathering have been reduced. Before land reform, some Miao areas followed the practice of lineage or hamlet ownership of mountain and hillside lands even where some private holdings existed. People could open new lands for farming and settlement, share village pastures, or hunt away from their home area.' <sup id="cite_ref-895" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-895">[895]</a></sup> 'Miao everywhere, and by all reports, were agriculturalists, often tenants, and rarely landlords, except in Southeast Guizhou where they were more prosperous and more class-differentiated. They typically lived in small villages averaging ten to twenty households on mountain slopes remote from centers of Han settlement. In some places, village orientations were determined by geomancy, or “feng shui.” Their houses were constructed of wood, stone, or mud brick, depending on location. Using either swidden or paddy methods, they grew a variety of grains, including wet and dry rice, maize, buckwheat, millet, barley, gaoliang, and wheat. Their diet was supplemented with the cultivation of potatoes, vegetables, beans, and rape (for oil), with eggs and tofu, with hunting, and with domestic chicken, fish, pork, and occasionally beef. Opium, tobacco, and liquor also were produced, and different regions boasted other trade products such as tung oil, lacquer, herbal medicines, wool, and, most importantly, timber. They manufactured their own clothes with homegrown cotton, hemp, indigo, and other natural dyes and with techniques of weaving, dyeing, embroidery, and batik.' <sup id="cite_ref-896" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-896">[896]</a></sup> The monogamous family was the basic socio-economic unit: 'The basic social organization /sic/ of the Miao is the family, and moreover their family structure is the small family system, which consists of husband, wife, and children under age.

A couple without sons will live with a daughter, who stands as heir.' <sup id="cite_ref-898" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-898">[898]</a></sup> 'Boys were more desired than girls because inheritance is in the male line and sons carry on the worship of ancestors, as among the Chinese, but girls were also loved and desired. They had a greater economic value than among the Chinese because of the work they did even after they were married. They also kept closer contact with their parents after marriage than Chinese girls can do. This was indicated by the fact that they took their maiden name, even though they remained in the home of the deceased husband.' <sup id="cite_ref-899" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-899">[899]</a></sup> Material wealth was transmitted patrilineally and ornaments/family heirlooms were transmitted matrilineally: 'Miao society was predominantly patrilineal and generally organized [Page 53] in terms of exogamous village/lineage units. A patronymic system was widespread with surnames, of which there were no more than ten or twenty in use, borrowed from the Chinese. These surname groups constituted clanlike structures, which for purposes of mutual aid and large-scale rituals occasionally superseded the otherwise local village and patrilineal political organization. In some areas neolocal and/or matrilocal residence was found, but patrilocal residence was the most common. Premarital sex and courtship were characteristic among the Miao in most places, and arranged marriage was primarily according to the right of priority of a girl's maternal uncle to marry her to his son. Courtship took place at markets and festivals in which a special site sometimes was found for mingling, dancing, or antiphonal singing. Bride-price and sometimes dowry were provided by parents, once they approved their children's choices of partners. In some places, delayed transfer marriage was practiced, and divorce was acceptable, especially before the first child. Polygyny was uncommon, but not unknown.

Then, in order to do honor to the family and to their hosts, they made a display of the family wealth. A woman owned the [Page [42b]] ornaments she bought or had given her and the embroidery she made. She gave most of her ornaments to her daughters.' <sup id="cite_ref-901" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-901">[901]</a></sup> Mutual aid among siblings was practiced even after the passing of their parents: 'The possessions of the family as a whole were in land and animals.

<p><b>♠ Moralistic punishment by human religious agents ♣ absent ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. Shamans and diviners performed ritual services for their communities. eHRAF provides the following general summary: 'Religious beliefs and activities vary by locale and subethnic identity. The situation is further complicated by partial adoption of elements of folk Daoism and Buddhism, or by conversion to Christianity (as among segments of the White and Flowery Miao). Traditional religious beliefs concern powerful suprahuman forces associated with sacred groves, stones, caves, and other natural phenomena, as well as with bridges and wells. Other protective spirits guard the household and hamlet. The latter are sometimes thought of as dragons. It is believed that at death, the soul divides into three parts, one of which returns to protect the household as an ancestral spirit. There is also concern with evil spirits and with ghosts of those who died bad deaths and who may cause illness and misfortune. Religious beliefs are supported by a complex series of sung or chanted poetic myths, which treat the creation of the universe, the doings of divine beings and culture heroes, and early Miao history.' <sup id="cite_ref-903" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-903">[903]</a></sup> 'Most religious ritual is performed or guided by various part-time specialists who act as priests, diviners, or shamans for the local community or for kin groups. Most of them are males. They engage in ordinary work, and only the most important religious activities require them to don special items of dress and decoration to mark them from others. There are no written texts for learning the chants, songs, dances, and rituals: they are memorized. If called by a family, specialists receive a small payment (often in foodstuffs) for their assistance. Shamans play a key role at funerals and postburial rites. They are also involved in analysis and healing of illness: some are skilled in herbal medicine as well as ritual procedures. Shamans also provide explanations of the possible causes of misfortune and can provide protective amulets. Ceremonies on behalf of the village community or a gathering of kin from several villages are conducted by skilled male elders who function as priests, following ritual procedures, administering the necessary animal and food sacrifices, and chanting the songs and myths without going into trance or communicating directly with the supernaturals and spirits. Some ceremonies are led by the male head of household on behalf of his immediate family.' <sup id="cite_ref-904" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-904">[904]</a></sup> 'The calendrical year holds a number of set ceremonies that vary from group to group in content, purpose, and timing. For example, as of the 1990s some groups celebrated the lunar New Year along with their Han neighbors, whereas others celebrated the year's start in the tenth lunar month, following the harvest, and marked it with bullfights and cattle sacrifices. Others marked the New Year with cockfights or sacrifice of pigs and chickens, or intervillage assemblages enlivened by antiphonal singing, dancing, and the playing of the lusheng  . Among the important festivals found in many (not all) Miao communities are the Dragon Boat Festival, which is synchronic with the Han festivities to a large extent, and the Mountain Flower festivals, which were an important institution for bringing together marriageable young people from different hamlets. The Drum Society festivals are held by dispersed kin groups to honor their ancestors every seven, ten, or twelve years, and are not strictly tied to the calendar. Most festivals involve the lavish offering of animal sacrifices, and for this reason the state has discouraged them.' <sup id="cite_ref-905" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-905">[905]</a></sup> Schein paints a similar picture: 'Miao religious practices comprised animistic, ancestor worship, and shamanistic elements. Animal sacrifice and other forms of propitiation were key parts of all these practices. For ceremonies and exorcisms, and sometimes depending on the nature of the occasion, ritual experts and shamans could be male or female, and they were skilled in incantations, animal sacrifice, and the manipulation of various objects. They were engaged for a variety of healing purposes as well as for life-cycle rituals. Other sorcerers, particularly women, operated surreptitiously in the practice of so-called gu witchcraft in which they controlled others through harm or the threat of harm inflicted by poisons gleaned from [Page 54] insects.

The names for spiritual media in An-shun are the same in the Miao-I language as in the Chinese. The men are known as Kwei-shin or Tuan-kung; the women, Mi-la or Mi-pu. Their duty is to sacrifice to the spirits to invoke their aid and to provide a medium between the spiritual and the human worlds. As such they are respected by the people. All ancestor worship and funeral events have to be presided over by the Kwei-shih. Every [Page 4] Miao-I center has one or two Kwei-shih, who learned their trade since childhood. Among the Chung-chia people the magic charms used for such spiritual purposes are marked with Chinese characters as phonetic symbols and written down as a scripture to be transmitted from master to disciple. The Kwei-shih, who are farmers by trade, take up mediumship as a side line to supplement their income from remunerations gained from its practice. In case of sickness the Miao-I believe the evil spirits are causing trouble, and it is the duty of the Mi-la to chase them away in order to cure the sick person. Often she is invited to the house to do her work. Sometimes in public gatherings the Mi-la is surrounded by people inquiring from her as to the best method of driving away spirits. Evidently the Mi-la is less able than the Kwei-shih, for in case of very serious illness or in the performance of funeral rites the man medium is always preferred.' <sup id="cite_ref-910" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-910">[910]</a></sup> '(2) Spirits of ailment. The Miao-I's belief in spirits is so strong that in case of ailment they neither think of a doctor nor of medicine, but of the Mi-la alone. She is generally an old woman, and on arriving at the house she is immediately possessed by the divinity she has invoked. The latter would reveal to her the identity of the evil spirit and devise 90 the means to be extricated from it. There are many kinds of evil spirits, and the measures to ward them off also vary.' <sup id="cite_ref-911" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-911">[911]</a></sup> Other specialists performed memorial ceremonies and other kinds of divination: 'The person who conducts the memorial ceremonies is called in Chinese chi shih □ or priest and in Ch'uan Miao mo or to mo.

The “Sacrifice to the Ancestors” and “Eating Pigs” of the Miao religion and the “Local Divinity of the Soil” and the “Flying Mountain” ceremonies of the guest religion are all for the purpose of beseeching the kuei not to make trouble and seeking their protection. The special sacrifices for the avoidance of calamities may be divided into four categories: (1) for seeking a cure upon suffering illness; (2) for seeking cleansing after seeing a supernatural phenomenon or after any unlucky matter; (3) for seeking the resolution of a conflict that has arisen; (4) for seeking pardon for sins after death. Those sacrifices for the invocation of blessings may be divided into two categories; (1) to ask for wealth; (2) to ask for children. But there are many ceremonies which on one hand are to avoid calamities, and 130 at the same time are also ones which seek blessings. “Bludgeoning the Ox” of the Miao religion can be performed both for the cure of sickness and can also be performed to ask for children. “Redeeming a Vow to the No” of the guest religion may be performed for the cure of illness or to ask for wealth or children, or can be performed for all of these.' <sup id="cite_ref-914" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-914">[914]</a></sup> This might suggest some moralistic punishment by omniscient supernatural beings, such as ancestors.

Yung-sui T'ing Chih says: “Miao marriage is just like a purchase. They do not follow the /Chinese/ custom of asking names (as a preliminary to fixing a betrothal) and sending presents to the bride's home to fix the betrothal. They only negotiate about the number of horses and cattle through a broker. The broker is a Miao marriage go-between. It definitely requires five or six horses or heads of cattle to initiate a trade for one wife. When the agreement [Page 131] 94 cont. is reached an inauspicious /sic/ day is chosen to welcome the wife. The bride wears a moon-white gown and walks holding a parasol, half open, half shut, called the shame-hiding parasol. Her father and mother, brothers, and relatives escort her to the husband's house. The dowry consists of everything from cattle and sheep and goats to plows and harrows. They do not enter by the main door but through a hole bored through a wall. Men and women sit together. The bride is not allowed to look left or right, or else the husband would be displeased for fear that shermay be fond of some one else. The couple takes each a bowl of rice, a piece of fish, and a cup of wine dregs. Next they visit the paternal uncles' houses in the same village, at each eating and drinking the same items. On their return home they are husband and wife, but they do not spend the night together.” It also says: “The Miao do not object to marriage between people of the same surname, but relatives do not marry. On the wedding night the bride sleeps with her mother, who leaves only when the groom gives her some silver as a gift 95, called the “mother's money” or “milk money.” It is generally about two or three liang of silver. A wealthy family, seeing a pretty girl, might order their son to drag the girl from behind. This is called “carrying off a woman and marrying her by force.” The girl's family attracted by their wealth, do not engage the girl to anyone else, but get a go-between to discuss betrothal presents. When a virgin has an affair with a man, her parents know about it but do not forbid it. On the contrary, they consider this evidence that the man finds her desirable. But, if one's wife or concubine is seduced, then they raise knives, facing each other, and money is required as compensation. If a husband and wife do not get along, the husband may divorce her and marry again, and the wife may do the same. As to improper sexual conduct, instances were very rare even in former days, and today the Miao have become more aware of ethical and moral obligations.” (What is recorded in the Miao Fang Pei Lan is to the same effect.)' <sup id="cite_ref-916" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-916">[916]</a></sup> Ling et al claim that women accused of ku poisoning or witchcraft were killed in the 18th century and 'sold' in the 19th, but also report executions in the Republican period: '199 Ku poisoning is very ancient. Ch'un-ch'iu Tsochuan /Commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals/, first year of Chao: “To put insects in a vessel to get a ku, in order to cause illness.” It can be seen that more than 2,000 years ago the business of ku poisoning already was in existence. Cheng Ch`iao of the Sung dynasty in the section “Liu Shu Liao” of his T`ung-chih records the method of making ku, saying: “A hundred insects are put in a vessel and allowed to devour each other. The one left is the ku.” It has always been against the law to practice this. The old Criminal Code had an article relating to “the manufacture of ku poison.” But it is still secretly practiced today among the Miao. Volume 7 of Kanchou t'ing-chih states: “Miao women can kill people by ku witchcraft. It is called “letting out the grass kuei.” They let them out when they are at odds with someone. If they are let go on the outside of the body, they eat up the five constituents of the human frame /muscles, veins, flesh, bones, skin and hair/. When they are let out inside the body, they consume the five inward parts, or organs. The victim suffers either agonizing pain, or becomes listless, or his skin will swell, or he will feel suffocated, all means of bringing him to death. A month before his death the victim sees the soul of the person who set the ku on him coming from behind to give him something, which is called “the hastening medicine.” If the sick person cannot be cured within a month he dies. It is said that either a man or a woman can learn this. It is necessary to set up an altar secretly, and to raise a few tiny shrimps in a small earthen jar filled with water. It should be buried in the earth beneath a bed in a dark room, or under a rock in an isolated path in a remote mountain. If this earthen jar is found by someone and burned, then the practitioner of this ku witchcraft will also die. When sending forth the ku one may use one, two, three, or four fingers. The poison from one or two fingers is relatively easy to overcome; [Page 307] 199 cont. that from three is difficult, and that from four fingers is not easy to overcome. The Miao men dread ku and do not learn its use, but the Miao women secretly practice it. Before the Chia Ch'ing reign period /1796/ when the Miao found a woman practicing ku witchcraft, they killed her. After the Chia Ch'ing, the Miao did not dare to kill these women, and therefore sold them to the Chinese. The Chinese gradually acquired the method, and those who had it capitalized on it to make a profit.” Volume 6 of Yung-sui t'ing-chih states: “A genuine ku woman has eyes red like cinnabar, and red, green, blue, and yellow stripes on her stomach, arms, and back, without which she is a fake. A genuine ku woman has not a trace of cobwebs in her home. Every day she must place a basin of water in the main hall, into which she spits out the ku she has collected to drink the water. If she does not do this, she is a fake. A genuine ku woman usually is found in the mountains, where she sends a bamboo pole high up in the clouds which acts like a fighting dragon, or sends a cape up in the sky which dances like a bird. If she can't do this, she is a fake. If a woman can do the above strange things, the worms which will be found in her stomach, opened after she is killed, will be real ku. A person victimized by a genuine ku woman dies within a hundred days. If his sickness lasts a year, then it is not from receiving ku.” The annals and books of successive dynasties contain many references to ku poison, but unfortunately they are not clear. The present writers were most anxious to make a thorough investigation of ku when in the Miao area. But as ku is forbidden by the government, the Miao women able to do ku hid their secrets well, and our investigation had no results. The following notes are some material obtained through interrogation.' <sup id="cite_ref-917" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-917">[917]</a></sup> 'Ku is called [p□iγ] in the Miao language, and a ku woman is called [mp□γ]. Most of the ku women are loved by their husbands,200 which is called /t□ioλ □iγ/, meaning seduced by ku.” The art of ku is handed down from woman to woman. For instance, if a ku woman has three daughters, one [Page 308] 200 cont. of them must learn this art. But the secret is not necessarily handed down to one's own daughter - other girls may also be taught. If a girl is learning sewing or singing from a ku woman, and the latter thinks that she can be taught the art of ku, she inadvertently says to the girl, “You have got it!” This girl will then get sick. In order to get well, she has to learn the art from the woman. The details of the ritual and incantations used in imparting this knowledge could not be found out. The ku woman maintains a ku altar, hidden in the house or in a mountain cave. It is said that once a certain ku woman maintained an altar at home. One day after breakfast when all the villagers had gone up the mountain to work, the woman shut her door and heated warm water to bathe the images. Inadvertently, a little boy saw her. The next day when the ku woman went up the mountain to work, the boy imitated her, heating water to wash the images, scalding the ku images to death. One of them bore the soul of the woman. While working on the mountain, the woman suddenly became conscious of what was happening. She went home to change her clothes, then died. The eyes of a ku woman are red. If she does not send out the ku, she gets sick herself, and her face turns yellow. When the ku victimizes a person, the woman is protected from sickness for three years; when it victimizes an ox she is protected for one year; when it victimizes a tree, she is protected for three months. A pig may be victimized, but not a dog, and so the ku woman is afraid of dogs and does not eat dog meat. The symptoms of a victim of ku are yellow complexion, desire for food but inability to eat it, and a swollen stomach. Immediate medical attention can help recovery. In 1928 there was a case of ku poisoning at Fenghuang, involving a Miao whose two sons died in succession. He suspected that a ku woman in the same village was the cause. The authorities were petitioned to search her house, where there was found hidden an earthen jar containing snakes, tortoises, toads, and so on, as well as cut-out paper images of human forms. The evidence was conclusive, and the ku woman was shot.' <sup id="cite_ref-918" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-918">[918]</a></sup> Violating the decisions taken at communal/inter-village assemblies was punishable by death or confiscation of property: 'If a certain village has a most serious affair, such as banditry, the meeting would then be different from that stated above. The Tung-chia call this meeting “Ch'uan-k'uan” /summoning for conditions/, which means to summon all elders from various villages to discuss conditions. The meeting place is still at the drum tower. The procedure of “Ch'uan-k'uan” consists of the dispatch of a piece of wood (known in the Tung-chia language as ch'a) about one foot long and as large as a staff, on which is written the name of the elder to be summoned and the nature of the business. Those qualified for summoning are all village leaders who can direct the villagers. Ordinarily, such contacts have been established before and so on receipt of the wooden tablet the leaders would come immediately at the specified time. The purpose of such summons is for collective defense against brigandage. Therefore at the time of the summons, each village would send over all its young men. But there are also evil elements who use the summon for ulterior purposes. The decisions reached by the participants at the meeting are final, and no one can oppose them. The wronged [Page 110] 192 cont. party has to swallow the bitter pill: he may become angry but he may not protest. He who violates the decision of the summoned assembly not only subjects his life to danger but also his property to confiscation. 193 Mob psychology is blindfold, and often at such a meeting some cunning and wicked person would accuse a victim, declaring that he should be killed or his house searched and his property confiscated. If the mob should cry out assent, the matter is not further inquired into and the decision is carried out. The original intention of the summoned assembly is good, but it can be easily abused by the cunning and the wicked. Therefore the system is fraught with grave dangers, and has created many conflicts and crimes. It is hoped that the government would step in to outlaw the system.' <sup id="cite_ref-919" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-919">[919]</a></sup> We have provisionally assumed that corporeal punishment was practiced in some form during the Qing period as well, but more material is needed. Chinese authorities also jailed Hmong for criminal and other offenses, at least in the Republican period. Mickey describes some examples: 'Legal Difficulties. When I went back to the village for the second period of residence, the first of February, 1942, I found that the old man's son, Cheng-hsiang, had been in prison in Lung-li for two weeks. He had gone to collect the price of some rice sold to two families in the city. At the second house he had been arrested in an opium raid and held on the charge of opium smoking. On the sixth I went to the hsien magistrate's office on his behalf and found that he had been sent to the local Health Station for observation. The man in charge there was called in. He said Cheng-hsiang would be released and cleared of the charge at the expiration of the required period of observation. On the afternoon of the eighth he was allowed to go home for clean clothing. On the tenth he was released and cleared of the charge.' <sup id="cite_ref-920" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-920">[920]</a></sup> 'On the eighteenth of November I was asked to go to the hsien magistrate for them again. This time a relative by the name of T'ang was being detained on complaint of some Chinese. This man owned a wooded slope. The Chinese, wishing to take advantage of the great demand for charcoal as fuel for motor vehicles, either had or wanted to set up a charcoal depot in Lung-li. They asked this man to make his wood into charcoal for them. No agreement was made, but they had him arrested to be held until he could produce fifty thousand chin, more than sixty-six thousand pounds. What they wanted me to do was to urge the hsien magistrate to investigate the matter quickly so that the man could be released. This I did. But when the hsien magistrate said he could be released if two would go surety for him, and they asked me to be one of his guarantors. I refused, for I had never seen the man and could not find out what it meant to be a guarantor under such circumstances in China.' <sup id="cite_ref-921" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-921">[921]</a></sup> 'Another case was that of a Miao who had become so angry at his wife that he had her jailed. Her relatives wanted to have her released so that her child need not be born in prison. The husband had disappeared and could not be found to ask him to change his mind. I wrote to the magistrate in the next hsien, and after his condition that some merchant in the city go surety for her was met, she was released.' <sup id="cite_ref-922" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-922">[922]</a></sup> Chinese courts were accessed for litigation: 'A family in Shang-sai wished to build a house.

This was paid at the hsien offices on the day set, but the brother did not appear to receive it.

Rice grown in flooded fields is transplanted in April and May and is harvested in August and September. The Miao area is very mountainous and there are very few level areas for rice fields. They are found in small number only in the small basins in the mountains and along the banks of streams and rivers (Illus. 27), the rest being terraced fields (Illus. 28, 29). The land of the basins in the mountains are mainly irrigated by leading water from springs fed by mountain streams. Water wheels (Illus. 30) are used for irrigation in the terraced fields along the streams. [Page 82] 55 cont. The size of the water wheel depends upon the height of the terraced fields. By means of long and short bamboo tubes the water is conducted to near and distant fields. The terraced fields in the Miao area involve considerable labor. On a slope where there is a spring, earth is scooped out to make raised paths between fields, which act as dikes, going up in tiers, or stones are piled up to make embankments on both banks of a stream. These man-made terraced fields require a great deal of time and labor and are susceptible to drought. For they rise from the foot to the waist of the mountain, tier by tier, like a ladder, so that it is very easy for the water in the fields to leak away. But in the event of a shortage of rainfall, when the spring fed by mountain streams dries up, irrigation stops [Page 83] 55 cont. and a drought, ensues, an event which is greatly feared by the Miao. Every second and third month plowing ceases for seven days, and harrowing is avoided in order to ward off a drought. The period of taboo starts from the nineteenth day of the second month to the twenty-third day, and again, from the thirtieth day of the third month to the first and second day of the fourth month. According to Miao superstitution any violation during the period of taboo would bring on the disaster of a drought. Only through prayer and repentance can it be avoided. The violators are required to provide chickens and pigs for the sorcerer who stands at the highest point of the slope to offer prayer and sacrifice (called the “sacrifice to the spirit of the high slope,” see the later chapter, “Magic and Religion”). When terraced fields come up against floods, although it is not like the lack of harvesting of seeds in a drought, still often the sudden rush of mountain streams bursts through the terraced fields and destroys the structure of the fields. Moreover stones and sand often pile up, which is difficult to repair at once. Sometimes, the field is reduced to a steep incline or a deep gulch beyond repair. So, the Miao people toil all year round: in prosperous years they barely miss cold and starvation. In case of disaster, they are unable to look after themselves: the weak sell their children in exchange for a measure of grain; the strong form gangs to plunder the countryside. When the authorities press too hard on these marauders, then widespread unrest often result. Thus goes the saying: “The Miao area has a small disturbance every five years, and a large disturbance every ten years.” The reason is not that the Miao are by nature fond of trouble making, but that they are driven to take dangerous risks by the pressure of poverty /Illus. 27-31 appear on pp. 56-60./ 61 under a condition of overpopulation in a limited area. Hitherto, each suppression of a Miao disturbance by the government brought about peace, but it lasted only a few years before the outbreak of new unrest. Former administrators did not understand that the cause of the Miao disturbances [Page 84] 56 [Page 89] 61 cont. was due not to human nature but to environment. A policy geared to the solution of the basic problem should try to improve the livelihood of the Miao and to remove the pressure of population through migration. Otherwise, Miao disturbances cannot be eliminated and will remain a source of trouble.' <sup id="cite_ref-927" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-927">[927]</a></sup> Indemnities were paid for damage to crops: 'The Sixth Month. The temples of the local gods in all the Chinese and Miao-I villages in the district are scenes of great celebration on the sixth day of this month. The Miao-I build their local temples outside the village gate, and on this day they would hold processions in honor of the Earth God. The day before, the village head prepared in advance a big pig and many varieties of meats and vegetables. On the sixth day all the items of sacrifice are carried to the village gate and deposited there in front of the Earth God temple. After setting off the firecrackers, every family takes turns to perform a ritual before the temple. After the sacrifice the pork is divided up among the families, the quantity being designated by each family to be paid for in grain after the autumn harvest. The remainder of the pork together with the other meats and vegetables are cooked together on the spot in a huge cauldron and eaten by all the people present. After feasting each family brings home a small quantity of pork, from which a piece is cut off for sacrifice on the border of one's field. A string of paper money is also stuck there as a token to [Page 104] 184 cont. invoke a prosperous harvest. In the afternoon every family contributes a few dimes for the purchase of vegetables and sends a representative to the party, at which rules and regulations are discussed regarding indemnities for damages to crops. He who can write is asked to list the rules on a piece of white paper to be affixed at the village gate. Then on the top of a high mound near the village they set up a straw mark and let loose a din of firecrackers to announce to villages far and near that this village has already passed its laws so that none may go there to violate them.' <sup id="cite_ref-928" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-928">[928]</a></sup> We have assumed that some seizure of property (either by the community or by the wronged party) was practiced in the Qing period as well, but confirmation is needed.</dd>

The space between the mountains was sufficient for a walled town of one long street between the east and west gates and one or two on either side. There were fields outside the city walls. Its normal population was between three and four thousand, augmented during the war by the coming of some “companies” for the installation and repair of charcoal burners in motor lorries and the distillation of grain alcohol for fuel, an Army officers' training school, and the engineers' corps of the railway being built through the town from Kwangsi to Kweiyang. To it the people of the surrounding contryside, including at least three groups of Miao and the Chung-chia, went to market. It was also the seat of the hsien government and contained a middle school, postal and telegraph offices, and a cooperative bank, with all of which the non-Chinese, as well as the Chinese, had some dealings. A few of the more well-to-do families sent one of their boys to the middle school. Cases which could not be settled in the village or by the lien pao official, who was also a Chinese, were of necessity brought to the hsien court, as well as cases which involved both Miao and Chinese.' <sup id="cite_ref-929" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-929">[929]</a></sup> It is unclear when the first banks were established in the area.

The Hua Miao were shifting-swidden agriculturalists, growing buckwheat, oats, corn, potatoes, and hemp, and using a simple wooden hand plow or hoe. Sheep and goats were fed on nearby pasture land. Additionally the Hua Miao hunted with crossbow and poisoned arrows and gathered foodstuffs in the forests. In parts of Guizhou, the Miao more closely resembled their Han neighbors in their economic strategies as well as in their technology (the bullock-drawn plow, harrowing, use of animal and human wastes as fertilizer). The Cowrie Shell Miao in central Guizhou were settled farmers growing rice in flooded fields, and also raising millet, wheat, beans, vegetables, and tobacco. Their livestock was limited to barnyard pigs and poultry, with hunting and gathering playing a very minor role. Some of the Black Miao in southeast Guizhou combine intensive irrigated terrace farming of rice with dry-field upland cropping.' <sup id="cite_ref-930" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-930">[930]</a></sup> '3) Occupations. The Miao-I people, being retarded in cultural development, have just entered the stage of agricultural community, and so their chief occupation is farming. 14 Those Miao-I living in the northwest of the province have high [Page 18] 14 cont. mountain terrain with poor soil, in which they can grow only corn, buckwheat and mixed grains. They also rear cattle, horses, pigs, and principally sheep. At Wei-ning and Ta-ting, where the territory is highly mountainous, the climate is cold, and the population is thin; it is unfit for raising crops but best fit for grazing. In the southeast the Miao-I areas are comparatively better and suitable for rice cultivation. Besides agriculture they are also engaged in simple handicraft industries, such as home spinning and weaving. The commercial centers of the Miao-I in all areas are the village fairs held during the day for the bartering of goods. The fairs are located like a network in some convenient spots in the cities, on a vacant lot, or on the slope of a hill. They are named after certain cyclic animals such as chicken, dog, cow and so on. At the time of the fair men and women who come from all places number from several hundred to several thousand. At the fair everyday articles of household use are displayed in rows of adjoining straw sheds. A fair is a scene of activity and gaiety. The villages in which the Miao-I live are often endowed with rich resources, but their belief in the earth as the dwelling place of the dragon spirit forbids them to exploit its wealth, such as felling the trees for timber and digging the mines for minerals. Hence their occupations are limited and their culture is backward.' <sup id="cite_ref-931" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-931">[931]</a></sup> Most were either tenants or smallholders: 'Prior to the 1950s land reform, some Miao were smallholders. Many, if not most, were tenants on lands owned by Han, Yi, Hui, and others. Few were true landlords, and most who rented out land were likely to work part of their holdings themselves with family labor. All land is now owned by the state, including undeveloped mountain and forest lands, thus limiting any expansion beyond lands officially assigned to an individual or village. In the process, pastoralism and forest hunting/gathering have been reduced. Before land reform, some Miao areas followed the practice of lineage or hamlet ownership of mountain and hillside lands even where some private holdings existed. People could open new lands for farming and settlement, share village pastures, or hunt away from their home area.' <sup id="cite_ref-932" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-932">[932]</a></sup> Labour was divided along gender lines: 'Both sexes engage in agriculture, care of livestock, and fishing, and men contribute some labor to domestic chores like cooking, gathering firewood, and child care. Men are expected to do the heaviest work, including plowing. Women sometimes participated on short hunting trips, but trips of several days or several weeks were undertaken by groups of men; hunting trips are now illegal. Labor exchange and cooperation between households was common even before collectivization.' <sup id="cite_ref-933" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-933">[933]</a></sup> There was little occupational specialization: 'Women continue to spin and weave cotton, hemp, ramie, and wool for home use, and to produce garments with elaborate batik and embroidered designs that vary by area and dialect and serve as subethnic markers. Complex silver necklaces, bracelets, earrings, and headdresses are a well-developed craft specialty for men and again are closely associated with ethnicity. They are not usually sold outside the local Miao community. Carpenters, basket makers and blacksmiths can be found among some Miao groups.' <sup id="cite_ref-934" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-934">[934]</a></sup> But trade became important: 'No Miao communities are self-sufficient. All depend on the market for pottery, salt, processed foods, and various daily necessities. In Guizhou there is great demand for silver for making jewelry. What the Miao have to sell varies greatly by area. The Hua Miao market wool, hides, sheep and goats, wild game, firewood, and a variety of forest products. The Cowrie Shell Miao market agricultural produce, poultry and pigs, bamboo shoots, and home-crafted grass raincoats and sandals. Different areas have their specialties, such as cattle, horses, bamboo baskets, and herbal medicines. Before 1949, some Miao sold opium, but more often poppy growing and production of raw opium was the required rent for cropland and the profits went to the landlord and middlemen. Very few Miao were full-time merchants or traders.' <sup id="cite_ref-935" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-935">[935]</a></sup> Accordingly, some of the below variables may not apply to the Hmong.</dd>

<dd> <b>♠ Standardization of weights/measures ♣ ♥</b> According to some sources, the Hmong used Chinese measurements as well as their own variations thereof, especially when trading with merchants. But they appear to refer to the Republican period: 'Trade. - The Miao people do not know how to trade. Formerly, the Chinese brought salt and cloth into the Miao villages to exchange for their local products, but there were many dishonest traders, who cheated the Miao, giving rise to  much confusion at times. Later the Chinese were officially prohibited from entering Miao villages to trade, but certain places were designated for sitting up markets, to be used once every five days, six times a month. The best-known markets among the Miao are the Te-sheng-ying, Kan-tzu-p'ing, Ya-pao-chai, Ya-la-ying, and Hsin-chai (Illus. 40) of Feng-huang; the Ta-hsin-chai of Kan-ch'eng; and the Wei-ch'eng, Lung-t'an, and Ma-li-ch'ang of Yung-sui. The important articles of trade are salt, cloth, animals, /Illus. 39, p. 73/  /Illus. 40 appears here/ and grains. Formerly, in trade between the Chinese and the Miao four small bowls were equal to one sheng. For cloth one measure between two hands was considered four ch'ih. The price of cattle and horses are set by the number of fists, regardless of age. The method of measurement by fist is like this. They take a bamboo splint and wind it around the fore ribs of the cow to set its girth, and then they measure the bamboo splint with their fists. A water buffalo which measures 16 fists is big, and a common yellow cow which measures 13 fists is large. The operation is called “fisting a cow.” In the case of horses age does come into consideration. They measure a horse from the ground to the saddle place by comparing it with a wooden rod. A 13-fist high one is big. A horse with few teeth but of many fists fetches a higher price, and the reverse fetches a lower price. This operation is called “comparing horses.”   In recent times, in the sale of rice, cloth, and other articles, they have adopted the Chinese standards of weight and measurement, but “fisting cows” and “comparing horses” are sometimes still done.' <sup id="cite_ref-936" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-936">[936]</a></sup> 'The Ch'uan Miao are acquainted with and frequently use the Chinese system of measurements by which ten inches make one foot and ten feet are one chang □. But they have a variation of this system which is more commonly used by them. According to this method the distance between the first and the second joints of the middle finger is one inch. The stretch of the hand from the end of the thumb to the end of the middle finger is five inches and two of these are one foot. The arm stretch from the tip of one middle finger to the tip of the opposite middle finger is five feet and two of these are one chang. In some localities bamboo combs are used to measure cloth.' <sup id="cite_ref-937" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-937">[937]</a></sup> Volume was measured in bowls or sheng (see above). Weight was measured in chin: 'Recently, the Miao have adopted the Chinese custom of inviting friends and relatives to a feast and naming ceremony  on the third day after a child's birth. A name is sometimes adopted according to the time of birth. For instance, if a child is born in a certain month, it would be named after the month. The chief of the Miao at the time of the rebellion during the reign of Emperor Ch'ien Lung was called Wu pa-yüeh /Wu, Eighth Month/. Sometimes the name of the season when the birth occurred is adopted. In another case, the weight of the infant may be used as the name, for instance, an infant weighing so many chin at birth will be named for that weight. In still other cases, the name of an animal, a pig, goat, sheep, dog, or cow is used in the belief that the child will be easy to raise.' <sup id="cite_ref-938" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-938">[938]</a></sup> We are unsure to which extent measures were standardized in the Qing period.

<dd> <b>♠ Guarantee stability of coin value ♣ inferred present ♥</b> In the Republican period, Chinese currency was used where markets and cash were accessible, but barter was also present: 'Trade. - The Miao people do not know how to trade.

This is more common in northern Yunnan than in Szechwan where market-places and towns are more accessible. The Ch'uan Miao sell cattle, goats, sheep, horses, pigs, chickens, corn, rice, eggs and vegetables and purchase salt. cloth, silver ornaments, pottery and implements and tools made of iron.' <sup id="cite_ref-940" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-940">[940]</a></sup> While cowrie shells have a long history of being used as tokens of exchange, Mickey only refers to the use of stylized ornamental cowrie shells among the Miao: 'Cowrie Shells. Cowrie shells have played and still do play various roles in China. From very ancient times they have been used as money. With regard to the character “pei” (□) Wieger quotes a Chinese phrase which may be translated, “an animal from the sea, representation, in ancient times money and precious shell; from the Chou until the Ch'in Dynasty they used cowries in trade.” Marco Polo refers to them in this capacity in his description of the journey he took into the southwest of China on behalf of the Great Khan. The I-shu (□) says, “Yünnan people call the pei ‘hai p'a,’ p'a being the shell of the animal.”  There are in the Museum at West China Union University at Ch'engtu metal objects made to represent cowries and once used as money. Hai-p'a (Cowrie Shell) Miao girls also wear ornaments of silver in the form of cowrie shells.' <sup id="cite_ref-941" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-941">[941]</a></sup> Dowry payments were made in silver pieces, at least in the Republican period. The context suggests that those were coins rather than tokens: 'In the old days the gift and dowry were given in terms of the number of cows instead of money. Recently, they have been changed to silver pieces, and the larger the amount, the more magnificent it is for the girl's family. If the amount is small then the girl's status is considered low and it becomes a disgrace to the family. When the question of the bride price is settled (with the Hua Miao the highest gift comes to $100 or more) the go-between appoints a date to convey it to the girl's family. Accepting the gift, the family gives a feast, in which friends and relatives are invited to keep the go-between company and to regale him with meat and wine. This is the engagement. Before the wedding day, the gift donation must be fully paid up through the go-between; but if the girl's family is fond of the future son-in-law, half or all the bride price may be waived. [...] The following day or the third day the bride returns home with her companions, and the host dispenses cash presents to all the members of the bridal party. The other guests stay on to partake of the farewell feast. After her return the bride stays with her parents for a month or fortnight, and has to be welcomed back to her new home by her husband. But the girl's family would keep the son-in-law as a house guest for several days before sending the young couple away. After a short stay the bride goes back again to live with her mother, and only on New Year, at festivals and harvest times, would she accompany her husband home to stay for a few days as a guest of his family. It is only after the children are born that she lives permanently with him. One month after the birth of the first child there would be a feast, and the wife's family  would send along some baby clothes and, in case of a wealthy family, also cows and pigs. Those who have received cash gifts from the husband's family at the wedding would now give in return baby's bedding and clothing as well as chicken and duck eggs. Friends and relatives would each carry with him a sheng /a measure equivalent to 31.6 cubic inches/ of rice and a jug of wine to partake in a feast provided by the host, who would slaughter cattle or buy pork and beef from the market for the occasion.' <sup id="cite_ref-942" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-942">[942]</a></sup> Cash gifts became part of marriage negotiations: 'A considerable time is allowed to elapse between engagement and marriage. Before the wedding ceremony the boy's parents select another lucky day to make a formal call upon the girl's family in company with five to eight relatives to deliver cash and other gifts. This is called “sung p'ing-chin” /sending betrothal money/ or "tsou k'ê /going as guests/. The cash present varies from $30 or $50 up to $400 or $500, depending upon the financial ability of the boy's family. The dowry of the girl is also proportional to the amount of cash. Other gifts include glutinous rice, (rich families giving as many as one or two piculs /a picul is 100 catties or 133.3 1 bs/), puffed  rice /candies/, cakes, brown sugar, a silver necklace, and one or two fat pigs. The gifts are placed on table scaffoldings, each carried by two men. The presents of rich families can be quite lavish and sometimes amount to as many as a dozen tables. [...] The head of the groom's family then picks up the cash and the silver necklace both wrapped in a piece of red paper and places them on the rice. Next he burns incense and lights candles to worship the ancestors. After a few minutes the four representatives at the table each pick up a bowl of wine and empties it in one gulp. These then become the witnesses who are required to testify in the event of marital complications or divorce. At that time, if the bride's family considers the cash gift as not large enough to match the dowry, they may ask their representatives to refrain from drinking the wine to indicate dissatisfaction.' <sup id="cite_ref-943" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-943">[943]</a></sup> We are unsure whether these observations also apply to the Qing period. We have assumed so for the time being, but this is open to review.</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Public markets ♣ absent ♥</b> Hmong families transmitted property and exchanged goods, but much land was in the hands of landlords (generally from other ethnic groups) and the military administration, so Hmong tenants were in no place to participate in the property market. On the other hand, some smallholders were present. Purchase of land by Hmong was restricted until the Republican period: 'From Song on, in periods of relative peace, government control was exercised through the tusi system of indirect rule by appointed native headmen who collected taxes, organized corvée, and kept the peace. Miao filled this role in Hunan and eastern Guizhou, but farther west the rulers were often drawn from a hereditary Yi nobility, a system that lasted into the twentieth century. In Guizhou, some tusi claimed Han ancestry, but were probably drawn from the ranks of assimilated Bouyei, Dong, and Miao. Government documents refer to the "Sheng Miao" (raw Miao), meaning those living in areas beyond government control and not paying taxes or labor service to the state. In the sixteenth century, in the more pacified areas, the implementation of the policy of gaitu guiliu began the replacement of native rulers with regular civilian and military officials, a few of whom were drawn from assimilated minority families. Land became a commodity, creating both landlords and some freeholding peasants in the areas affected. In the Yunnan-Guizhou border area, the tusi system continued and Miao purchase of land and participation in local markets was restricted by law until the Republican period (1911-1949).' <sup id="cite_ref-944" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-944">[944]</a></sup> According to some sources, trade was important: 'No Miao communities are self-sufficient.

<p><b>♠ Famine relief ♣ absent ♥</b> Ling et al describe how the government charged reduced rent payments on t'un lands in response to natural hazards such as flooding and erosion: 'The Miao frontier region is mountainous and lacking in fields. For the most part they develop mountain slopes, building up terraced fields for the cultivation of rice grown in [Page 174] 118 cont. flooded fields. Whenever the terraced fields are damaged by flood and erosion when mountain streams flood, the damage is often beyond repair, resulting in a decrease of rent year by year. Furthermore, the government has several times decreed a reduction of rent, so that the current rent rate is only one-half of the original. Successive rent reductions undergone were as follows: in the nineteenth year of Chia Ch'ing /1814/ a reduction of 5,500 shih was made; in the first year of Tao Kuang /1821/ a reduction of 20,770 shih was made; in the eighteenth year of Tao Kuang /1838/ after an investigation of fields destroyed by flood, a reduction of 282 shih, 7 tou, 7 sheng, 6 shuo was effected; in the twenty-eighth year of Tao Kuang /1848/ a reduction of 649 shih, 1 tou, 8 sheng, 1 ho. After the above reductions there remained a rent of 78,286 shih, 4 tou, 4 sheng, 4 ho, 6 shuo. In the twenty-ninth year of Tao Kuang /1849/ there was a further reduction amounting to 7,828 shih, 6 tou, 4 sheng, 4 ho, 4 shuo, resulting in the collection of 70,457 shih, 8 tou, 1 shuo of rent. It was ruled that no further reductions would be made. It was also ordered that for every 6 ho /of grain/ there would be collected 1 sheng, but below six ho nothing would be collected, thereby causing a loss of 352 shih, 3 tou, 1 sheng, 1 shuo. Since that year the annual rent has totaled 70,105 shih, 4 tou, 9 sheng. From the twenty-ninth year of Tao Kuang /1849/ to the end of the Ch'ing dynasty, after deducting 179 shih, 4 tou, 9 sheng of rent uncollectible due to flood and erosion, the net receipt of rent totaled 69,926 shih. From the first year of the Republic /1912/ to the sixteenth or seventeenth year, the reductions due to floods totaled 2,917 shih, 4 tou, 9 sheng, 2 ho. In the twenty-second year of the Republic /1933/, according to investigations made by the authors in western Hunan, the net rent was 67,008 shih, 5 tou, 8 ho. According to a statement in the Hsiang Hsi Miao Ch'ü T'un Fang Chün T'un T'ien T'u Yen Ke /Successive Changes in Land Allotted to Defensive T'un in the Miao Area West of the Hsiang River/, recently published [Page 175] 118 cont. by Yü Fan-ch'uan: “The decision of the first conference on t'un matters held in the twenty-fifth year of the Republic /1936/ was to reduce the rental on devastated land 1, 592 shih, 3 tou, 8 sheng, 8 ho.

<p><b>♠ Food storage ♣ present ♥</b> Hmong families stored food in the household: 'In the two-room type of house the fire pit is in back of the middle pillar, and the stove is located in the room on the left (Illus. 16). The partition into two or three rooms is done by means of the pillars and not by walls or screens. In the houses of wealthy families side rooms are built on both sides of the main house (Illus. 17). If the side rooms should have two stories, then the top story is for the storage of grain and the ground floor for rearing domestic animals. The toilet space in a Miao house is often in the pig pen or in the cow stall, and used both by men and women. Travelers in the Miao area find the using of the toilet a painful ordeal, because the stench is unbearable. Besides the storage loft the Miao house often has underground storage, dug underground about a chang deep and divided into two or three bins for storing foreign potatoes or sweet potatoes. After the sweet potatoes, etc. are stored underground, they are covered with a bamboo-plaited cover, to allow free circulation of air. If the potatoes spoil, it is necessary to wait for some time after the bamboo covering has been removed before going down. Or, one goes down with a light; if the light goes out, it indicates the presence of carbon dioxide, and one must refrain from entering. There is no difference between the agricultural implements used by the Miao and by the Chinese, but the furniture in a Miao house is much smaller in size than those used by the Chinese (Illus. 17).' <sup id="cite_ref-950" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-950">[950]</a></sup> 'Even the poorest house with one room, stable, and thatch roof had a loft for the storage of faggots, straw, unthreshed grain, baskets of grain and miscellaneous articles, sometimes piles of grain and other foods. None of the houses were weathertight, but this was not an unmixed evil, for there had to be some means of escape for most of the smoke from brushwood fires built in pits in the floor. The granaries were about six feet square and built on piles. The floor inside was of beaten earth on planks.' <sup id="cite_ref-951" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-951">[951]</a></sup> The military administration devised its own food supply and storage system through the t'un administration. Ling et al describe the development of the t'un system: 'During the Ts'ung Cheng reign period /1628/ /the end of the Ming dynasty/, the Miao rebelled, demolishing the guard stations and leveling the border wall. The “Great Wall” to blockade Miao country disappeared. The 7,800 guard troops /shou ping/ in the Miao area of the Ming dynasty were reduced to 1,600 men at the beginning of the Ch'ing dynasty. When the rebellion of Wu San-kwei was pacified and all was peaceful again, there was another reduction of 500 men, leaving 1,100 men. Military strengh was slight and the defense system was relaxed. Further, following the change from native headmen to Chinese officials, and the use of Chinese as the head of every hundred families, intercourse between the Chinese and the Miao was no longer prohibited. In the twenty-ninth year of Ch'ien Lung /i.e. 1764/, in view of the Miao having undergone acculturation for a long time, they were allowed to intermarry with the Chinese. The original idea was to change the Miao by teaching, but with the passing of time evils developed, when rapacious Chinese under the pretext of trade entered the Miao area and seduced crafty Miao to enter into thievery. Unlike soldiers they entered Miao country for personal reasons and mistreated the Miao. The Miao made a pretext of these guest men's exploitations and encroachments on their land and banded together to make trouble, and brought about the great rebellion during the Ch'ien Lung /1736-95/ and Chia Ch'ing /1796-1820/ reign periods. After the rebellion was put down, the Manchu court realized that the time was yet inopportune to change the Miao by teaching, and the blockade policy was once more used. The various hsiens along the Miao border were heavily garrisoned for protection.' <sup id="cite_ref-952" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-952">[952]</a></sup> 'At that time in addition to stationing heavy complements of soldiers in the Miao area, there were also put up a total of 1,121 stone guard houses /tiao ch'ia/ along the ruins of the wall left from the Ming dynasty. In addition to the stationing of government troops at important positions, there were more than 800 of these guard houses where 9,000 soldiers were left to protect the border. Later when the nation became short of money, it was not possible to maintain large forces in this deep interior area for defense. Thus, suddenly, the frontier guards were withdrawn, then the stone guard houses became [Page 170] 115 cont. empty, and there was fear that the fierce Miao would start a rebellion. At this time Fu Nai of Yüan-ch'en tao met with Brigade General Fu Chih-na of Chen-kan Chen and summoned together people of the sub-prefecture to discuss a long-range plan. And so they began the t'un system of defense. Fields were allotted to feed the fighters and to defend the guard houses against the Miao. As for the people's /i.e. Chinese/ land, except for fields for sustenance, a male could retain three tou of grain, a woman one tou. As for the rest of the land seven were allotted while three were retained, for one shih of grain three tou was personally retained, and seven tou given up for allotment, to feed the fighters and guard the frontier. In the Feng-huang area there were more than 830 stone guard houses, requiring 4,000 men to man them in rotation. Further, 1,000 men were trained to be combat ready. The more than 22,000 mu of land allotted were not enough to meet the expense, and so another allotment of more than 12,300 mu at Lu-ch'i and Mo-yang was made. There were also 127 stone petty military stations /tiao pao/ at Kan-chou, manned by 800 soldiers, supported by more than 2,170 mu of allotted land. The original sect of government of Yung-sui, before the Miao rebellion during the reign period of Ch'ien Lung and Chia Ch'ing, was at Wei-ch'eng, which was entirely surrounded by the Miao. In the second year of Chia Ch'ing /1797/, the seat of government was moved to Hua-yüan with a newly built yamen. There were 126 stone guard houses with 2,000 soldiers. The people's land, i.e. Chinese land, usurped by rebels and recovered for public use, totaled more than 17,110 mu. There were over 70 stone military stations /tiao pao/, at Pao-ching, with 300 soldiers and over 2,170 mu of allotted land. There were only 18 stone guard houses at Ku-chang-p'ing with a hundred soldiers and over 120 mu of allotted land.' <sup id="cite_ref-953" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-953">[953]</a></sup> 'The above refers to Chinese t'un /min t'un/. In addition, there were also Miao t'un. After the suppression of the Miao rebellion, the Miao tribes, awed by military might, surrendered all the Chinese land formerly forcefully usurped by them, and [Page 171] 115 cont. also searched into the properties of the rebel Miao and decided to return them for public use. The forcefully usurped land totaling over 30,100 mu and the rebels' properties totaling over 5,400 mu were redistributed among the law-abiding Miao to farm. Granaries were built to collect rent /tsu/ for the maintenance of Miao soldiers. The pressing for rent, the inspecting of fields, the distribution and transportation of grain, and other duties were all the responsibility of Miao officials.' <sup id="cite_ref-954" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-954">[954]</a></sup> 'The total of the above fields and land is 131,640.6 mu. In the thirteenth year of Chia Ch'ing /1808/ a total of 15,219.3 mu of fields and land was surveyed in the three hsien, Feng-huang, Kan-chou, and Yung-sui. In the sixteenth year of Chia Ch'ing /1811/ another total of 5,873.2 mu of fields and land was surveyed, totaling 152,157.1 mu of fields and land. Of this besides the land allocated to the army for horses and farming, land lost through floods and erosion, and also the land used for stone guard houses and surroundings, totaling 11,084.3 mu, and another 37,849 mu distributed among the t'un able-bodied males, leaders, the aged, and the young, there remained 103,223.8 mu. Farmers were recruited to farm this land and rent /in kind/ collected. The annual receipt in grain totaled 105,488 shih, three tou, and nine sheng.' <sup id="cite_ref-955" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-955">[955]</a></sup> 'The t'un fields in the Miao frontier were divided into people's /i.e. Chinese/ t'uns and Miao t'uns, the two being entirely different in nature. The t'un males working on the Chinese t'uns were also divided into t'un men and fighting men. The t'un men received fields to cultivate, and guarded the t'un guard houses. The fighting men, also called home guards, were solely trained for military operations, and did not farm. In the five sub-prefectures and hsiens of the Miao frontier there are 7,000 t'un men, from among whom are appointed hsiao-ch'i, tsung-ch'i, and pe-tsung to facilitate control. The distribution of fields was as follows: the men /san ting/ are each given 4.5 mu; the hsiao-ch'i, 5.5 mu; the tsung-ch'i, 6.5 mu; and the pe-tsung, 7.5 mu. There are 1,000 fighting men, each being given 3 shih, 6 tou of rice per year. The non-fighting men are also each given annually 10.8 liang of silver for salt and vegetables. The hsiao-ch'i receives each year 12 liang of silver; the tsung-ch'i, 13.2 liang of silver; the pe-tsung, 16.8 liang of silver. Therefore, in the Chinese t'un, the fields and land left over after the t'un men have received their fields to plant and care for are leased out for the collection of rent. Granaries (Illus. 57) have been built to store the grain, and general t'un leaders are set up to manage these matters. There are no t'un men in the Miao t'uns, and the t'un fields are allotted to people to cultivate /Illus. 57 and 58 on pages 124 and 125/ 126 for the collection of rent, in order to feed the Miao soldiers, under the control of the Miao officials. The t'un fields in the Miao frontier region, at the inception of the system, totaled 150,000 mu of arable land, of which barely a third was directly cultivated by t'un personnel, the rest being allotted out as rented fields. Today, the t'un army in the Miao frontier region is about 1,000 strong. The maintainance of the Black Flag Battalion of the Miao troops (Illus. 58) largely comes from the rented fields. T'un fields were set up to support troops on the spot as a defense against the Miao. Today, the Miao have been largely acculturated by the Chinese and the boundary line between the Miao and the Chinese is gradually becoming [Page 183] 124 [Page 185] 126 cont. obliterated. There is no longer the need for this kind of system of t'un defense against the Miao. In fact, unrest in the Miao area today is often due to the maladministration of the t'un fields system. The Miao petty officers and the t'un leaders often are oppressive in collecting rent and sometimes are corrupt in their methods, thus causing dissatisfaction and disturbances. In the twenty-sixth year of the Republic /1937/ the Miao rebellion in western Hunan arose because of the t'un land system. It resulted in the burning of t'un granaries and killing of t'un officers. Although the rebellion was pacified only after bloody and expensive campaigns, it is imperative to change the t'un and enter the newly opened or reclaimed land as available for taxation, so as to reach a fundamental solution.' <sup id="cite_ref-956" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-956">[956]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Drinking water ♣ absent ♥</b> Hmong settlements relied on natural freshwater sources: 'Topography. (Illus. 2). - Topographically, the Miao area may be divided into two natural regions. The northwestern section can be called the La-erh plateau region; the southeastern section is the region where the rivers flow down. Although the plateau rises about 700 kung ch'ih above sea level, on it there are a great many small basins, with many springs and ponds good for irrigation. The Miao call such small basins p'ing /a plain/, t'ang /a pond/, or ch'ung. The best known among these is the Pao-mu-ying-p'ing, about 70 li north 30 of Feng-huang-ch'eng /city/. Surrounded by mountains, this level area measures five to six li in length and three to four li in width and has seven or eight spring-fed ponds, supplying ample drinking water. It is the largest basin on the plateau. Ya-pao-chai (Illus. 7), situated in the Ya-pao-shan mountains, about 93 li north of Feng-huang-ch'eng, is very high and cold. It has several fish ponds and produces rough rice and yams. In 1795, when the Miao revolted, the headman, Wu Lung-teng, whose family had lived there for generations, was entrenched there. The above two places are the largest among the basins on the plateau. There are countless small basins /p'ing and ch'ung/. There are numerous wells and springs in the mountains, wells being found even on the peaks. The “Yao K'ao” section of the Miao Fang-pei Lan states: “Fifty li southwest outside the city is Ma-an Shan /“Horse Saddle Mountain”/, which is about eight or nine li in height, is very steep, and resembles a horse saddle in shape. On top of the mountain there is a well that never goes dry. On the mountain there are pockets where there are irrigated rice fields. It is a strategic point for the uncivilized Miao to defend.” The La-erh plateau is dotted with Miao villages and settlements because of its level places /p'ing/ and wells and springs, and there the Miao people thrive.' <sup id="cite_ref-958" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-958">[958]</a></sup> Only some villages benefited from pipe construction schemes by missionaries, and this process did not start until the late 19th and early 20th centuries: 'The mountain community of Shimenkan (Stone Gateway) in northwestern Guizhou served as the headquarters of church activity. In addition to its own large primary school, it offered secondary schooling and teacher training. At least thirty Hua Miao continued on and graduated from university in the decades before 1949. Some of these became ordained Methodist ministers or doctors and one became a well-regarded anthropologist (Yang Hanxian). Generally the local chapels were served by lay preachers who were trained at Shimenkan. Other young people received training as nurses and agricultural extension workers. At various points in time, agricultural and industrial extension programs were held at Shimenkan. New strains of potatoes were introduced, fruit orchards were planted on the hillsides of many villages, vegetable gardens were encouraged, and a number of Miao learned the techniques of carpentry, brickmaking, and masonry. More efficient looms were designed for home production of cloth. During the prerevolutionary decades, some villages benefited from collective endeavors to build bridges and roads, and pipe systems that brought water into the community. Teams of medical workers, from Shimenkan or from the churchaffiliated hospitals in nearby Zhaotong City, traveled around the area periodically. Even those who were not interested in becoming church members participated in the economic innovations, accepted treatment from the medical workers, and sent their children to the schools.' <sup id="cite_ref-959" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-959">[959]</a></sup> Accordingly, we have assumed that most Hmong communities did not rely on drinking water supply systems, especially not before the Republican period.

<p><b>♠ Irrigation works ♣ present ♥</b> According to Ethnographic Atlas variable 28 'Intensity of Agriculture', the Hmong practice 'Intensive irrigated agriculture (J.)' Agricultural technologies and practices varied depending on the prevalence of dry swidden versus wet rice cultivation: 'Economic strategies vary. The Hua Miao were shifting-swidden agriculturalists, growing buckwheat, oats, corn, potatoes, and hemp, and using a simple wooden hand plow or hoe. Sheep and goats were fed on nearby pasture land. Additionally the Hua Miao hunted with crossbow and poisoned arrows and gathered foodstuffs in the forests. In parts of Guizhou, the Miao more closely resembled their Han neighbors in their economic strategies as well as in their technology (the bullock-drawn plow, harrowing, use of animal and human wastes as fertilizer). The Cowrie Shell Miao in central Guizhou were settled farmers growing rice in flooded fields, and also raising millet, wheat, beans, vegetables, and tobacco. Their livestock was limited to barnyard pigs and poultry, with hunting and gathering playing a very minor role. Some of the Black Miao in southeast Guizhou combine intensive irrigated terrace farming of rice with dry-field upland cropping.' <sup id="cite_ref-960" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-960">[960]</a></sup> Wet rice cultivators farmed irrigated fields: 'In the region where the rivers flow down, the hills are less steep than in the plateau area. Both sides of the rivers can be made into terraced fields, and the water from the rivers used for irrigation. Further, the rivers are navigable by small craft, thus making communication relatively easier, and the Chinese have migrated here.' <sup id="cite_ref-961" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-961">[961]</a></sup> 'Besides the yü fields the Miao also plant plots of land which can be flooded for growing rice. Rice grown in flooded fields is transplanted in April and May and is harvested in August and September. The Miao area is very mountainous and there are very few level areas for rice fields. They are found in small number only in the small basins in the mountains and along the banks of streams and rivers (Illus. 27), the rest being terraced fields (Illus. 28, 29). The land of the basins in the mountains are mainly irrigated by leading water from springs fed by mountain streams. Water wheels (Illus. 30) are used for irrigation in the terraced fields along the streams.' <sup id="cite_ref-962" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-962">[962]</a></sup> As indicated above, we have decided to code for the A-Hmao, who were swidden cultivators. We have assumed that swidden farming was practiced without irrigation systems.

<p><b>♠ Health infrastructure ♣ absent ♥</b> Shamanistic healing practices were important even in the Republican period: 'Aside from the shaman's extensive knowledge, ordinary persons also have some knowledge of plants and other materials that have healing properties. The Chinese invert this by claiming that Miao women engage in magical poisoning gu  , but all evidence suggests this is a Han myth rather than Miao practice. Divination and exorcism of ghosts and evil spirits are also a part of healing.' <sup id="cite_ref-963" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-963">[963]</a></sup> 'There are no physicians, although some persons are reputed to know more about medicines and healing than others, and the efficacy of the medicines has not yet been scientifically investigated. The common belief is that all diseases and other calamities are caused by demons, which must be exorcised by the do nun or tuan kung, who is a magician or shaman. He has a formula for every disease, and besides using ceremonies and incantations to exorcise the demons that cause diseases or other calamities, he performs many real wonders, among which are treading with bare feet on a red-hot plowshare and touching his tongue to the same, spitting or spurting hot oil out of his mouth onto a fire to cause a larger blaze, and with bare feet walking over a ladder of sharp swords. It is not strange that the death rate among the Ch'uan Miao is very high.' <sup id="cite_ref-964" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-964">[964]</a></sup> Ling et al describe a healing/recovery ritual: 'When a Miao becomes ill and taking medicine does not make him better, then he must make a vow to “ta chia hsien” /lit. “beat the family ancestors”/, which in the Miao language is called [pa□ mba□ □ior□], which means “beating Miao pigs.” It may be performed during the illness or after the recovery. Before the event takes place, the host must serve notice to members of the mother's brother's family, inviting them to send seven members of the maternal uncle's family (six men and a woman) to be guests. If that family does not have so many people, the maternal uncle may ask other people to make up the number. But the persons invited should not have the same surname as the host. No day needs to be selected as lucky, but the following days must be avoided: if a child is born in the family, it is necessary to wait one month before the ceremony is performed; the birth of kittens also necessitates one month's separation; the birth of pigs, goats, cows, horses, and dogs causes a postponement of 12 days; the hatching of chicks, ducklings, and goslings, three days; a funeral in the family or when the head of the family has witnessed a funeral of another family, 12 days. If the notice should arrive before the time of expiration of any of the above periods, the maternal uncle's family may refuse such an invitation. If the host because he seeks an immediate recovery from a sickness cannot wait any longer, he may invite other guests, but they may not have the same surname as he. The Ta Chia Hsien ceremony is divided into four parts, requiring a whole day from morning till night. There are altogether eight kuei invited: [na□ n□ t□ te□], n□ ma□ bu□ □ie□], tso□ te□ tso□ tie□], [bu□ ie□ tsei□ n□] (it is said that these four are the ordinary names for the kuei of [Page 203] 138 cont. the ancestors). □, (this is the oldest ancestral kuei); [tso□ me□ t□ □io□], [iso□ to□ t□ lie□], (these are the kuei names of the seven invited guests). The place is beside the fire pit inside the house. The Miao sorcerer-priest sits on a low stool behind the fire pit, facing the entrance. In front of him is a bamboo tube and a bowl of wax. In front of the fire pit is set up a square table, on which are placed ten square pieces of fancy /flower/ paper divided in two rows. On each square of paper in the back row is placed a bowl of wine, and behind the back row are stuck up four paper kuei. In the two far corners of the table are stuck up two paper flags. Two chickens are tied to the legs of the table with fine cord through their beaks. Two pigs with their feet tied up with rope are placed in front of the chickens, heads facing the stove. To the right of the Miao sorcerer-priest, on the floor, there is a bamboo mat, on which is a /cooked/ rice bucket /Illus. 62 appears here/ 139 with the lid off, and a bit in front is a jar, in which is put a piece of fancy paper with a bowl of wine on it. In front of the mat to the right of the fire pit is a winnowing basket. Above it three pieces of bamboo form a semicircular top, on the outside of which paper is pasted, and then cloth. Inside are stuck three paper kuei, in the middle four pieces of fancy paper, and on each of the two pieces of paper in the rear is placed a bowl of wine, see Illus. 62.' <sup id="cite_ref-965" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-965">[965]</a></sup>//'For the first part, which concerns inviting the shen, the Miao sorcerer sits on the stool, without using any of his magic implements, and only uttering an incantation, whose general purport is as follows: "All you older and younger relatives of the host! The host has recently run into bad luck. When he walked on the road, he saw strange happenings among the grass and trees. When he ate, there were inexplicable fragments and pieces of a broken saucepan in his rice. When the host looked quickly, then he saw these strange phenomena. The (here the name of the ancestral kuei of the family is mentioned) kuei, wanting food to eat, first came and did these things, then made the host fall sick. The host, not getting well, made a vow, and after this, his sickness left him. [Page 204] 139 cont. The vow has extricated him from the clutches of the kuei, and the sickness has not come back, but is forever uprooted. The host has saved money and bought a fat pig from the market as well as paper money. Having waited for the passing of the days to be avoided, then he comes to the sacrifice to the kuei. Sorcerer-priests are very few in this world, and he came to my home to invoke my help. So, here I am. I ask all the kuei to come here. I burn a bowl of beeswax. The bamboo tube and the bell are beside the fire pit. The two winnowing baskets filled with meat, the gold and silver cans, the gold and silver chair cushions, all are set at the sides of the pit. The table for the sacrifice to the kuei, the paper money for the redemption of the soul, the fancy /flowr/ bowl to hold the wine, the fat pigs, big and small, two large chickens-these [Page 205] 139 cont. are all placed beside the table. We request the kuei to come to take them. And after taking them, please eat quickly." (He utters the name of the ancestral kuei of the family.)'  <sup id="cite_ref-966" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-966">[966]</a></sup>//'The second part consists of beating the bamboo tube. While beating the bamboo tube, the Miao sorcerer utters an incantation, generally describing many supernatural phenomena, such as the mischievous behavior of the 12 large trees; strange happenings after eating fish, meat, bamboo shoots, and smoking tobacco; strange happenings with the water at the time of using water, in a bath or sitting in a boat; strange happenings with clothes; strange happenings with ants and snails; with wooden rods and bamboo poles, etc. The third part is the handing over of the animals. After the incantation for the second part is finished, there is a short respite. The Miao sorcerer then picks up the bamboo tube and the bowl of beeswax is moved onto the table. Afterward he asks a man and a woman from among the seven guests from the maternal uncle's family to sit opposite each other, the man inside next to the bamboo mat facing outward, the woman outside next to the winnowing basket facing inward. The rest of the five men sit at the table on a bench next to the fire pit, without making a movement. The Miao sorcerer, holding a bamboo chiao in his right hand and ringing the hand bell with his left, begins once more to utter an incantation:140 “The wine for ta chia hsien is now ready. There are altogether seven empty wine bowls, two beside the fire pit and five beside the entrance. Please come and take them! After taking them, please do not drink right away. As for the pigs and chickens, if not sent they will not arrive. Once we send them they will arrive. I invoke my patron saint's soldiers and horses; I order my own 1,000 men and 10,000 horses to help deliver the large pig, to help send the small pig and the two chickens. The chickens are sent to the coop, the small pig is sent to the pig sty, and the large pig is sent to the tower.”' <sup id="cite_ref-967" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-967">[967]</a></sup>//'At this point the sorcerer-priest makes the gesture of forcibly sending off the pig. While sending off the pig he says three phrases of a magic formula in a low tone. The bystanders can only see his lips moving but cannot hear anything. According to the Miao sorcerer, at the time his teacher taught him this formula, he repeatedly warned him that after that day he must not teach it to any insincere disciple and must not teach them indiscriminatingly to anyone, or else, the person who teaches it may lose his life or his methods would not be effective. After having finished the three phrases of the magic formula to send off the pig, once more in a loud voice he intones: “Helpers take the wooden rod and hit the pig in the chest and kill it. Roast it with fire and wash it with water! Do it quickly! The kuei have been waiting here for fully half a day already.” After the incantation is over, the host and the helpers kill the animal with the rod and carry it inside the house. They roast it over the fire, then wash it with water, lay bare the stomach, and cut the pig into two halves: one half is taken by the host, with one leg cut off for the sorcerer-priest, and the other half is received by the seven guests. The other pig is similarly distributed, but after the host's share is put aside, the guests' share is cut into small chunks, and seven bowls are filled with meat. Two bowls are placed on fancy paper in the winnowing basket, and five bowls, on fancy paper at the table. Then, a few other chunks of meat are put into a tin can on the mat. After the meat has been set up, each person returns to his original seat. The fourth part is to send the kuei away. The sorcerer-priest, ringing the hand bell with his left hand and holding the chiao with his right hand, utters an incantation to the following effect: “The pork has been cooked in the saucepan. Seven fine bowls of meat and seven fine bowls of wien have been placed beside the stove. Another ten bowls of meat have been put beside the entrance. This sorcerer-priest takes this wine and meat and offers them to the ancestral kuei. So, please receive them.”' <sup id="cite_ref-968" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-968">[968]</a></sup> 'After the incantation, divination with chiao is performed for every member of the family. Next, divination is performed to see whether the kuei have gone. If the kuei have gone, then the guests taste a little of the pork, and then return home, carrying with them their share of the meat. At this time the sorcerer-priest and the host both cannot eat the pork. The sorcerer-priest has to collect all the paper kuei, paper flags, and paper money, and burn them up on the main road. Meanwhile, the host kills the two chickens and cooks them, and waits for the sorcerer-priest to come back so that they may eat it together.' <sup id="cite_ref-969" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-969">[969]</a></sup> Some authors attribute the high morbidity and mortality rates among the Miao to the absence of a public health infrastructure: 'With such meager and inadequate provision for the healing of the sick it is not at all strange that the death-rate among the Ch'uan Miao is very high. A Ch'uan Miao friend told me that eleven children had been born to him and that only two were still living, both of whom were less than ten years old. He said that he believed that many deaths were caused by the use of the wrong medicines. It is evident that if the birthrate were not correspondingly high the Ch'uan Miao would gradually disappear. Malaria, typhoid, and tuberculosis probably cause more deaths than other diseases.' <sup id="cite_ref-970" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-970">[970]</a></sup> '5) Disease. Due to the difficulties of livelihood the Miao-I cannot afford the facilities of health and sanitation. Their hardihood enables them to survive the cold seasons of winter and spring when little disease prevails. But summer and autumn are the seasons of ill health. In case of sickness there are no medical facilities in the Miao-I areas, and the patient is left to the mercy of nature of magic. Sometimes a mi-la /diviner/ or a kuei-shih /shaman priest/ is asked to propitiate the ghost. Mi-la is also known as “mi-p'o,” and kuei-shih as “tuan-kung.” The patient's family first asks the diviner to ascertain the kind of evil spirit that is causing the trouble and the kind of animal most appropriate for sacrifice. Then the wizard priest is asked [Page 10] 8 cont. to perform the ritual. Collusion between the two is common, and the ignorant people are made victims. These ghost affairs, however, often have a psychological effect and little ailments are sometimes healed this way. But in nine out of ten serious cases death is the only outcome. Their superstition is so deep-rooted that they think all diseases are caused by spirits who have to be appeased. Death is considered a destiny, and the living resign themselves to fate. Every year when diseases are prevalent in all hsien areas in Kweichow, the diviners and the priests do a thriving trade that unfortunately causes innumerable deaths. What a pity!' <sup id="cite_ref-971" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-971">[971]</a></sup> Given the poor access to public health even in the Republican period, we have assumed that no such infrastructure was available in the Qing period either.

These are located on mountain slopes, usually far enough away from main transportation routes to be inaccessible and readily defensible. The Miao lack any political organization of their own, and are thoroughly integrated into the Chinese administrative system. The basic political, as well as economic and social unit, is the village. Villages are grouped into townships and divided into hamlets of about ten to twenty households each. The headmen of both the village and the hamlet are appointed by the chief of the township. The members of different villages or hamlets are bound principally by affinal ties. They may cooperate for the common good, but they lack any formal organization of an indigenous character. Disputes between members of the same hamlet are settled, if possible, within the hamlet. Those between members of different hamlets of the same village are adjudicated by a council composed of the village headman and the heads of the hamlets involved. If this council cannot effect a settlement, the litigants have a right to carry their dispute to the chief of the township or even to the Chinese court of the county.' <sup id="cite_ref-973" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-973">[973]</a></sup> The Hmong population was subject to Chinese administrative integration during the Qing period already: 'From Song on, in periods of relative peace, government control was exercised through the tusi system of indirect rule by appointed native headmen who collected taxes, organized corvée, and kept the peace. Miao filled this role in Hunan and eastern Guizhou, but farther west the rulers were often drawn from a hereditary Yi nobility, a system that lasted into the twentieth century. In Guizhou, some tusi claimed Han ancestry, but were probably drawn from the ranks of assimilated Bouyei, Dong, and Miao. Government documents refer to the "Sheng Miao" (raw Miao), meaning those living in areas beyond government control and not paying taxes or labor service to the state. In the sixteenth century, in the more pacified areas, the implementation of the policy of gaitu guiliu began the replacement of native rulers with regular civilian and military officials, a few of whom were drawn from assimilated minority families. Land became a commodity, creating both landlords and some freeholding peasants in the areas affected. In the Yunnan-Guizhou border area, the tusi system continued and Miao purchase of land and participation in local markets was restricted by law until the Republican period (1911-1949).' <sup id="cite_ref-974" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-974">[974]</a></sup> Imperial control shiftend from indirect rule to government by appointed Chinese officials before a mixed system was established after a Hmong rebellion: 'After the five hsien in the Miao frontier region were opened, from the Yuan and Ming dynasties to the beginning of the Ch'ing dynasty, they were under the control of native headmen. During the K'ang Hsi reign period of the early Ch'ing /1662-1722/, a gradual change was begun from native headmen to regular government officials. In the forty-sixth year of K'ang Hsi /1707/, the senior official /ch'ang kuan szu/ at Wu-chai, T'ien Hung-t'ien, being harsh and cruel, the provincial governor, Chao Shen-ch'iao, sent up a memorial [Page 151] 105 cont. to the Emperor requesting that he be dismissed from office and that no hereditary substitute be allowed. In the forty-eighth year /1709/, because the Miao at Liu-li of the Chen-ch'i Office did not wish to be under the control of the native headman at Pao-ching, they repeatedly requested the change from native headman to government official, and the provincial governor, Chao Shen-ch'iao, again sent up a memorial requesting transference of control to the government. In the fourth year of Yung Cheng /1726/, the headman at Pao-ching, P'eng, Yü-pin, was removed from office for being avaricious and cruel, and in the fifth year the change was made from native headman to government official. Yü-pin was peacefully settled at Liao-yang. In the fifth year of Yung Cheng, the headman at Yung-shun, P'eng Chao-huai, personally applied for the change from native headman to government official. He returned to his native place in Chi-shui, Kiangsi. San-t'u-chou /“three local chou”/ and Wu-ch'ang-kuan-szu /“five senior officials”/ under the jurisdiction of the headman of Yung-shun were also changed from native to government officials.' <sup id="cite_ref-975" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-975">[975]</a></sup> 'After the voluntary change from the native headmen in the Miao frontier region, in each Miao village there was set up a local village chief over 100 families /i.e., a pe hu chai ch'ang, “100 families village chief”/, in order to govern the Miao and bring them under the administration of government officials. But the chiefs of the 100 families were not always Miao, sometimes Chinese being appointed to these positions. As time passed, gradually, there were rapacious, unscrupulous rogues, whose mistreatment caused disturbances, so that the unprecedented Miao rebellion took place during the sixtieth year of Ch'ien Lung /1795/. When the Miao rebellion was put down in the first year of Chia Ch'ing /1796/, it was found that the policy of governing the Miao with Chinese was wrong. The then governor-general of Hunan and Kwangtung, Pi Yüan, submitted a plan to govern the Miao with Miao. (6) The ministry's response to the memorial setting up regulations for Miao officials, Miao Chiang Chin-106 Yao Shan-Hou Shih I /Important Remedial Measures for the Miao Frontier Region/, has a passage, “Miao Chiang Pe Hu Chai Ch'ang Ming-Mu Ying Cho Liang Keng Ting /The Names of the Village Leaders of 100 Families Should be Decided after Due Deliberation/,” stating: “According to the memorial, in the three provinces of Szechwan, Kweichow, and Hupeh, such areas as Yu-yang and T'ung-jen were all previously governed by headmen, but following their application to be put under government officials, the administrative areas of chou, hsien, and ying [Page 153] 106 cont. were established, subject to the jurisdiction of civil and military authorities. In the Miao villages, there were established only village chiefs to govern a unit of 100 families. However, since Chinese were also permitted to fill these posts, gradually there were rapacious, unscrupulous rogues, whose mistreatment caused disturbances. It is requested that from among the Miao who have submitted, and on whom were conferred the peacock feather decoration /for merit, in early Ch'ing times/, there be selected some intelligent, aware persons, to be appointed at each ying /military station/ as native second captain /shoupei/, lieutenant /ch'ien-tsung/, and sergeant or corporal /wai-wei/, such positions to be filled through the governor-general and governor's /tu-wu/ yamen /tu-wu ya-men/ and to be subject to the control of the civil and military authorities. When the various t'ang hsin in the Miao area have official despatches to send, they can order the said native petty officers to select Miao to question and send, and also to give them some cash and rations. When officials traveling on official business require servants, they may also recruit them from the Miao, and pay them wages according to the Chinese scales. It would appear that the 100-families village chief was originally inaugurated to discipline the Miao, but these men were unimportant and their powers limited, as that the Miao did not heed them. Moreover, among the Chinese holding such positions there were rapacious, unscrupulous rogues, whose mistreatment led to disturbances. This should naturally be explained, deliberated, and changed, so as to fix responsibility. During the recent campaign those submissive Miao who accompanied the army and won peacock feather awards are numerous, therefore from these select those who are intelligent and aware, and who have the support of the rest, and according to the customary set-up of t'u-kuan /officials governing aboriginal tribes in West China/, every Ying should have one or two men to be native second captains, under whom there should be native lieutenants and sergeants, for better control of [Page 154] 106 cont. the Miao. Their number will depend upon the number of villages put under control, and they shall be appointed by the governor-general and governor's yamen and also be under the control of regional officials. If there are fights, robberies and thefts among the Miao these native officers will be asked to make the arrests. On their inspection tours, the governor-general and governor and military officials should examine the merits and demerits of these officers and reward or punish them accordingly to demonstrate justice, following the recommendations memorialized by Governor-general Ho Lin. When the t'ang-hsin system of communication in the Miao area has been abolished, official communications should be despatched according to old methods so as to avoid delay. In the regions where the t'ang-hsin system exists as before, the local officials /t'u kuan/ should be asked to pick out honest Miao to be given the responsibility of delivering messages after being questioned, to be paid wages and rations from unallotted funds, according to the scale for t'un soldiers. When officials traveling on official business need servants, then order the said Miao to serve, and pay them wages according to recommendations memorialized.” ' <sup id="cite_ref-976" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-976">[976]</a></sup> 'According to the despatch quoted above the Miao officials, although they were military officers such as the native shou-pei and ch'ien-tsung, aside from their jurisdiction over the Miao soldiers, were also given considerable authority in Miao civilian affairs. In the tenth year of Chia Ch'ing /1805/ 107 the t'un land within the Miao area were placed under the control of Miao officials. Article 8 of Pu Fu T'un t'ien Chang-ch'eng /The Ministry's Reply concerning Regulations about the T'un Land/ states: “It would seem that after the Miao rebels were pacified in the present year in the various localities of Yung-sui, [Page 155] 107 cont. the Miao were greatly impressed by the strength of the Imperial army and surrendered land previously forcefully occupied by them. Also it would seem that if there was property of refractory Miao; it was confiscated. The fields were distributed among the law-abiding Miao to plant and pay rent, so that a Miao army could be raised and supported. Now the usurped land surrendered in the various villages totals more than 30,100 mu, and the land confiscated from the property of the rebel Miao totals more than 5,040 mu. These are now being separately registered, distributed for tilling for rent, and the revenues derived therefrom should be able to support 5,000 Miao soldiers. Among the 9,900 native Miao soldiers discharged over time and remaining, those able to bring up a plan to make a living have been sent back to their villages, and those who are old, weak, and poor have been given fields to till. Now 5,000 strong and healthy Miao soldiers have been selected, 2,000 of whom come from Feng-huang sub-prefecture; 800, from Kan-chou sub-prefecture; 1,800 from Yung-sui sub-prefecture; 100, from Ku-chang-p'ing sub-prefecture; and 300, from Pao-ching hsien. To collect the grain given over as rent, the Miao petty officers have selected in the various villages spots for building granaries to store away the public grain. Two or three honest Miao officers are chosen for each granary to supervise receipts and disbursements of the grain. The said 35,000 mu of arable land is estimated to be capable of yielding more than 22,000 shih of seeds of grain. It is estimated that there remain in various Miao granaries about 40 shih of seeds of grain, which will be used to fill the need for rations for the Miao soldiers in the intercalary month. The Miao officers are still ordered to report the actual receipts of rent grain every year.” ' <sup id="cite_ref-977" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-977">[977]</a></sup> Ling et al describe the appointment of Hmong petty officials in that time period: 'Thus a Miao official was a military official having concurrent judicial and financial duties, whose power actually was equivalent to that of a t'u-szu /headman/. The only difference was that the position was not hereditary. As for the procedure of appointment, according to a reply from the Board of War in the twenty-eighth year of Tao Kuang /1848/, Miao Pei P'ieh Chi Ta /?/ Chang-ch'eng /Regulations concerning the Commissioning of Petty Officers of Miao Defense/, it is stated: “The 486 Miao officers in the five sub-prefectures and hsien of Ku-chang-p'ing, consisting of shou-pei, ch'ien-tsung, pa-tsung, and wai-wei, were recommended by the sub-prefectures and hsien to Ch'en-yüan tao for approval, and then commissioned with official seals by the governor-general, governor, and provincial commander-in-chief. According to the regulations for the promotion of Miao t'un officers, a pa-tsung is considered by the tao and then appointed by the Board; the wai-wei is appointed directly by the tao, and when the pa-tsung becomes due for promotion to ch'ien-tsung, his commission must be confirmed by the governor-general and governor, and when the ch'ien-tsung is promoted to shou-pei, his record must be examined by the commander-in-chief. Today, in the appointment of Miao petty officers, even wai-wei have to be commissioned by the governor-general and governor, hence there is a great deal of red tape involved. It is recommended that the Miao defense petty officers can be selected according to the regulations governing the t'un petty officers of the tao troups /piao, “banner”/. Hereafter the Miao wai-wei and pa-tsung are to be changed to be appointed by the tao, the Miao ch'ien-tsung to be appointed by the provincial governor with official seal, and the shou-pei to be appointed by the governor-general. The Board of War has found that the previous procedure of appointing Miao officials, through joint deliberation of the provincial governorgeneral, governor, and commander-in-chief is 108 too involved, [Page 157] 108 cont. and in order to simplify it the recommendations in the memorial of the said governor-general should be followed.” From this it may be seen that in the beginning, the appointment of a Miao official was regarded as a serious matter. A petty officer such as a wai wei had to be commissioned by the governor-general and governor.' <sup id="cite_ref-978" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-978">[978]</a></sup> Administrative organization differed somewhat between the individual districts: 'With regard to the organization of Miao officials at that time, it differed somewhat in the five hsien and sub-prefectures of the Miao region.

Furthermore, since the Miao dreaded seeing Chinese officials, then the Miao shou-pei, ch'ien-tsung, pa-tsung, and wai-wei were set up with the responsibility of controlling the Miao. In cases when the Miao were involved in such affairs as fights or theft, these petty officers were charged with the responsibility of apprehending the offenders. For the official despatches to be sent it was necessary to rely on them to get the messengers, and the pressing for rents and grain were also under the Miao officials' control. Moreover, the Miao petty officials were asked to submit seasonal affidavits as to whether there were Chinese entering the Miao villages.' <sup id="cite_ref-985" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-985">[985]</a></sup> 'The policy of having Miao officials to govern the Miao has been in practice now for 140 years. At the time of the original separation of the execution and administrative functions between the Chinese and the Miao, the idea of Miao regulating the Miao could be said to have been aimed at the abuses of the time. But now after a hundred and some tens of years, the Miao have gradually been sinicized. Formerly, there was the difference between the civilized and uncivilized Miao, but today they have all become civilized. The policy of separate administration for the Miao and the Chinese has been informally discarded. Consequently, the regulations for Miao officials should be abolished. But, since the Republic, the Miao officials are still able to exist, largely because Chinese officials have been profiting by taking brides for filling official posts. On the other hand, since the Miao officials get their positions through paying bribes, they go to great lengths to make extortions from the Miao people. The Miao people detest the Miao petty officials more than they do the Chinese officials. Moreover, today, the various hsien in the Miao area have been changed to the system of hsiang /villages/ and chen /towns/, each governed by a head, known as hsiang chang or chen chang, respectively. In view of this change, Miao officials have become superfluous. It is hoped that the authorities in the region will be able to do away with them soon.' <sup id="cite_ref-986" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-986">[986]</a></sup> Ling et al describe the development of the t'un system: 'During the Ts'ung Cheng reign period /1628/ /the end of the Ming dynasty/, the Miao rebelled, demolishing the guard stations and leveling the border wall. The “Great Wall” to blockade Miao country disappeared. The 7,800 guard troops /shou ping/ in the Miao area of the Ming dynasty were reduced to 1,600 men at the beginning of the Ch'ing dynasty. When the rebellion of Wu San-kwei was pacified and all was peaceful again, there was another reduction of 500 men, leaving 1,100 men. Military strengh was slight and the defense system was relaxed. Further, following the change from native headmen to Chinese officials, and the use of Chinese as the head of every hundred families, intercourse between the Chinese and the Miao was no longer prohibited. In the twenty-ninth year of Ch'ien Lung /i.e. 1764/, in view of the Miao having undergone acculturation for a long time, they were allowed to intermarry with the Chinese. The original idea was to change the Miao by teaching, but with the passing of time evils developed, when rapacious Chinese under the pretext of trade entered the Miao area and seduced crafty Miao to enter into thievery. Unlike soldiers they entered Miao country for personal reasons and mistreated the Miao. The Miao made a pretext of these guest men's exploitations and encroachments on their land and banded together to make trouble, and brought about the great rebellion during the Ch'ien Lung /1736-95/ and Chia Ch'ing /1796-1820/ reign periods. After the rebellion was put down, the Manchu court realized that the time was yet inopportune to change the Miao by teaching, and the blockade policy was once more used. The various hsiens along the Miao border were heavily garrisoned for protection.' <sup id="cite_ref-987" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-987">[987]</a></sup> 'At that time in addition to stationing heavy complements of soldiers in the Miao area, there were also put up a total of 1,121 stone guard houses /tiao ch'ia/ along the ruins of the wall left from the Ming dynasty. In addition to the stationing of government troops at important positions, there were more than 800 of these guard houses where 9,000 soldiers were left to protect the border. Later when the nation became short of money, it was not possible to maintain large forces in this deep interior area for defense. Thus, suddenly, the frontier guards were withdrawn, then the stone guard houses became [Page 170] 115 cont. empty, and there was fear that the fierce Miao would start a rebellion. At this time Fu Nai of Yüan-ch'en tao met with Brigade General Fu Chih-na of Chen-kan Chen and summoned together people of the sub-prefecture to discuss a long-range plan. And so they began the t'un system of defense. Fields were allotted to feed the fighters and to defend the guard houses against the Miao. As for the people's /i.e. Chinese/ land, except for fields for sustenance, a male could retain three tou of grain, a woman one tou. As for the rest of the land seven were allotted while three were retained, for one shih of grain three tou was personally retained, and seven tou given up for allotment, to feed the fighters and guard the frontier. In the Feng-huang area there were more than 830 stone guard houses, requiring 4,000 men to man them in rotation. Further, 1,000 men were trained to be combat ready. The more than 22,000 mu of land allotted were not enough to meet the expense, and so another allotment of more than 12,300 mu at Lu-ch'i and Mo-yang was made. There were also 127 stone petty military stations /tiao pao/ at Kan-chou, manned by 800 soldiers, supported by more than 2,170 mu of allotted land. The original sect of government of Yung-sui, before the Miao rebellion during the reign period of Ch'ien Lung and Chia Ch'ing, was at Wei-ch'eng, which was entirely surrounded by the Miao. In the second year of Chia Ch'ing /1797/, the seat of government was moved to Hua-yüan with a newly built yamen. There were 126 stone guard houses with 2,000 soldiers. The people's land, i.e. Chinese land, usurped by rebels and recovered for public use, totaled more than 17,110 mu. There were over 70 stone military stations /tiao pao/, at Pao-ching, with 300 soldiers and over 2,170 mu of allotted land.

The forcefully usurped land totaling over 30,100 mu and the rebels' properties totaling over 5,400 mu were redistributed among the law-abiding Miao to farm. Granaries were built to collect rent /tsu/ for the maintenance of Miao soldiers.

The t'un males working on the Chinese t'uns were also divided into t'un men and fighting men. The t'un men received fields to cultivate, and guarded the t'un guard houses. The fighting men, also called home guards, were solely trained for military operations, and did not farm. In the five sub-prefectures and hsiens of the Miao frontier there are 7,000 t'un men, from among whom are appointed hsiao-ch'i, tsung-ch'i, and pe-tsung to facilitate control. The distribution of fields was as follows: the men /san ting/ are each given 4.5 mu; the hsiao-ch'i, 5.5 mu; the tsung-ch'i, 6.5 mu; and the pe-tsung, 7.5 mu. There are 1,000 fighting men, each being given 3 shih, 6 tou of rice per year. The non-fighting men are also each given annually 10.8 liang of silver for salt and vegetables. The hsiao-ch'i receives each year 12 liang of silver; the tsung-ch'i, 13.2 liang of silver; the pe-tsung, 16.8 liang of silver. Therefore, in the Chinese t'un, the fields and land left over after the t'un men have received their fields to plant and care for are leased out for the collection of rent. Granaries (Illus. 57) have been built to store the grain, and general t'un leaders are set up to manage these matters. There are no t'un men in the Miao t'uns, and the t'un fields are allotted to people to cultivate /Illus. 57 and 58 on pages 124 and 125/ 126 for the collection of rent, in order to feed the Miao soldiers, under the control of the Miao officials. The t'un fields in the Miao frontier region, at the inception of the system, totaled 150,000 mu of arable land, of which barely a third was directly cultivated by t'un personnel, the rest being allotted out as rented fields. Today, the t'un army in the Miao frontier region is about 1,000 strong. The maintainance of the Black Flag Battalion of the Miao troops (Illus. 58) largely comes from the rented fields. T'un fields were set up to support troops on the spot as a defense against the Miao. Today, the Miao have been largely acculturated by the Chinese and the boundary line between the Miao and the Chinese is gradually becoming [Page 183] 124 [Page 185] 126 cont. obliterated. There is no longer the need for this kind of system of t'un defense against the Miao. In fact, unrest in the Miao area today is often due to the maladministration of the t'un fields system. The Miao petty officers and the t'un leaders often are oppressive in collecting rent and sometimes are corrupt in their methods, thus causing dissatisfaction and disturbances. In the twenty-sixth year of the Republic /1937/ the Miao rebellion in western Hunan arose because of the t'un land system. It resulted in the burning of t'un granaries and killing of t'un officers. Although the rebellion was pacified only after bloody and expensive campaigns, it is imperative to change the t'un and enter the newly opened or reclaimed land as available for taxation, so as to reach a fundamental solution.' <sup id="cite_ref-991" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-991">[991]</a></sup> We are unsure whether these officials also received a pension after retirement.

<p><b>♠ Funding for festivals ♣ absent ♥</b> eHRAF provides a general description of Hmong festivals: 'The calendrical year holds a number of set ceremonies that vary from group to group in content, purpose, and timing. For example, as of the 1990s some groups celebrated the lunar New Year along with their Han neighbors, whereas others celebrated the year's start in the tenth lunar month, following the harvest, and marked it with bullfights and cattle sacrifices. Others marked the New Year with cockfights or sacrifice of pigs and chickens, or intervillage assemblages enlivened by antiphonal singing, dancing, and the playing of the lusheng  . Among the important festivals found in many (not all) Miao communities are the Dragon Boat Festival, which is synchronic with the Han festivities to a large extent, and the Mountain Flower festivals, which were an important institution for bringing together marriageable young people from different hamlets. The Drum Society festivals are held by dispersed kin groups to honor their ancestors every seven, ten, or twelve years, and are not strictly tied to the calendar. Most festivals involve the lavish offering of animal sacrifices, and for this reason the state has discouraged them.' <sup id="cite_ref-992" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-992">[992]</a></sup> The sources describe the New Year's Festival: 'Festivals were abundant and differed widely by region, although the New Year was commonly of central importance. Everywhere the Miao lusheng or bamboo reed pipe organ was a key musical instrument along with drums, different horns and flutes, a kind of jew's harp, and a long tubular instrument called the mantong. Blowing through leaves also was widespread. Multiple genres of song were accompanied by numerous conventions for their social usages. Other activities at festivals included processional dancing, bullfights, horse races, cock and other bird fights, mountain climbing, ball tossing, and dragon boat races.' <sup id="cite_ref-993" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-993">[993]</a></sup>//The Chinese material provides a general description of some Hmong New Year's Festivals: 'The First Month. The first day of the first month is the beginning of the year. The Miao -I in this district would stick up paper money on the door of the house, which is also decorated with red peppers strung together with scented rice straw. Some of the Chung-chia people imitate the Chinese by asking calligraphers to pen symmetrical New Year verses for the door, [Page 99] 180 cont. and then hang out knots of scented rice straw, but no red peppers. These decorations are in expectation of a prosperous year.' <sup id="cite_ref-994" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-994">[994]</a></sup>//'After having celebrated “The Big Year” on the thirtieth day of the twelfth month and having decorated the door on the New Year's day, the Hua Miao and the Ch'ing Miao would remain at home to rest without doing any work. The food for the New Year was prepared in advance on a lucky day (dragon and dog days are lucky), and it is not cooked again until another lucky day comes around. So on New Year's day there is no kitchen drudgery as only pre-cooked meals are eaten. The New Year's day being the first of the year, everything has to be auspicious and inhibitions are many. For instance, 1) no sewing is done by women at home; 2) nothing is taken into the house from outside; 3) no water is carried; 4) no knife is used; 5) no one is allowed to go barefooted and shoes must be worn; 6) no cursing is allowed; 7) no rapping on the wall is allowed; 8) the floor must not be swept; 9) no collection of debt is permitted. Besides, there are the proverbial “three days of liberty” when parents would allow their sons and daughters unrestrained freedom in the pursuit of recreation and happiness on the first, second and third days of the year. After this period the children once more submit themselves to parental restraint. On the first day of the year the old and young are clothed in new garments and have fun all day long. Only the Hsiung and Yang families among the Ch'ing Miao have the custom of worshipping ancestors in the evening. At the time of the sacrifice, the head of the family would spread a straw mat on the floor of the middle room or the side room and place on it incense and candles as well as three bowls of rice. In each bowl is pitched a piece of pork on a bamboo stick with three straw knots to represent the ancestors. In addition there are three bowls of beancurd and three pieces of tz'u-pa /glutinous rice balls/. They call out aloud to ask their ancestors to pass the New Year with them. Then the male members of the family begin to kowtow in the order of their age. After the paper money is completely burned, they gather up the things on the straw mat. The rice straw and the bamboo [Page 100] 181 cont. sticks are thrown into the temple of the Earth God outside the village.' <sup id="cite_ref-995" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-995">[995]</a></sup>//'The New Year activities of the Chung-chia are slightly different from those of the Hua Miao and Ch'ing- Miao. On the first day of the year they also wear new clothes and decorate their doorway. At about seven o'clock in the morning they make sacrifices to their ancestors in the hall with several bowls of rice and meat while incense and candles are burned and fire-crackers are set off. The whole family, old and young, male and female, all participate in the ceremony as they perform the ritual of “three kneelings and nine kowtows.” After the sacrifice, the family settles down to a New Year feast in the hall, after which they stop working and laugh and joke all day. Their restrictions are similar to those of the Hua Miao and Ch'ing Miao. [...] On the second day of the New Year, the Hua Miao and the Ch'ing Miao would gather their family members after breakfast and with spades on their shoulders and wearing straw hats they would march off to their farms to do a little ploughing and digging, the idea being that this first “earth-removing” inaugurates a year's agricultural activities. With the Chung-chia, there is no definite day for the beginning of farm work, but it is generally around the tenth day of the first month. During the first three days of the year the Hua Miao, the Ch'ing Miao and the Chung-Chia would all stay home without going out for fear of meeting with unlucky events. On the fourth day the villages become astir with New Year visits between [Page 101] 182 cont. friends and relatives, and the younger generations pay respects to their elders (The New Year gifts for the children vary from ten to twenty cents.) When they exchange visits and greetings they bring with them a couple of home-made tz'u pa (each about 1 sheng of rice), candies and refreshments as gifts. The host and hostesses must entertain the visitors with tea and wine. The tenant farmers also present similar New Year gifts to their landlords, who in return would give them pieces of cloth or other household articles. As a rule such New Year greetings do not extend beyond the twelfth day though intimate relatives may offer theirs until the fifteenth. If a relative who has kept up these New Year visits throughout the past years fails to turn up, the family will be greatly offended. The Miao -I take the New Year greetings very seriously, and hence they should not be neglected.' <sup id="cite_ref-996" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-996">[996]</a></sup>//'The fifteenth day of the first month is the “Small New Year” with the Hua Miao and the Ch'ing Miao. That evening they put in front of the doorway a small table, on which are placed as sacrificial offerings a bowl of rice, a piece of meat and a cup of rice wine. Burning incense and lighting candles, they would kneel down and pray: “We pray to the Buddha tonight to guide us this year smoothly to wealth and prosperity.” After the prayer, the old and young, except the womenfolk, worship in turn. Then they sit down together for a feast in the hall. After dinner they have fun for the rest of the evening. The Chung-chia celebrate the “Small New Year” on the thirtieth day of the first month. Besides other delicacies at the table, every family makes tz'u-pa balls fried in oil, known as “eating oil balls.” They make sacrifices to their ancestors in great piety.' <sup id="cite_ref-997" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-997">[997]</a></sup>//New Year's festivities were celebrated with games and other amusements as well as gift exchange: 'Among the Miao there is a swing game, which is quite interesting. On farm holidays when there are fairs or during the New Year festival, they put up frameworks for swings on a vacant lot. Each framework supports two swings, and every swing has four compartments, each fastened with ropes and a board. Each swing seats four men or women, going around with the wheel (Illus. 120). Men and women sing back and forth as they swing along (see chapter, “Folk Songs” /not translated/). The following song is about the origin of the swing: Songs and singing are as old as time,   Found in all books everywhere. A son of a unicorn was born in the   Sung dynasty. The young man with a clever mind sought   a mate. He searched for a beauty but was   ashamed of his own ugliness. He loved beauty but beauty was   hard to meet. He asked someone for a plan. And was told to make a swing for people   to enjoy. [Page 353] 236 Page 356] 239 cont. Shouting, he made known his invitation.   A maid from the Sleeping Tiger Mountain, Came to ride on the eight-men swing.   She was loved by all present. Soon, a go-between was found - Man and wife were joined together for a   hundred years.' <sup id="cite_ref-998" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-998">[998]</a></sup>//'Besides weddings and funerals, friends and relatives may exchange presents on New Year festivals or other happy occasions. Ordinarily when friends and relatives visit a family, the host, no matter whether he is rich or poor, must serve wine and food, if he did not the guests would view it as a sign of contempt. Intimate friends and relatives making the first call are not treated with goose or duck for fear that there might be quarrels between them later to hurt each other's feelings, as the beaks of the goose and duck are flat and large and therefore portend querulousness. If a chicken is used it must be cooked whole to see if the two eyes are completely closed. If one or two eyes are half open, then it is an evil portent.' <sup id="cite_ref-999" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-999">[999]</a></sup>//Some authors claim sexual licence among young people as part of the festivities, but this has been contested: 'When the parents are unwilling to marry off a daughter, or nobody seeks her hand in marriage, or when the parents are unable or fail to make an engagement for a son, the marriageable person endeavors to win a mate. For this purpose he or she goes to the market place on the third day of the third moon, at tuan yang □ on the fifth day of the [Page [facing p. 36]] [Page 36] fifth moon, or at some other convenient time, or attends one of the Miao feasts or festivals, or joins those playing on the mountain-sides at New Year time. Either the boy or the girl can make the first advances. The methods are to look lovingly with the eyes, to squeeze hands and to speak loving words. This is inconvenient if there are many people about. A boy may take a girl's handkerchief or a girl take a boy's. Then the person who gets the handkerchief goes away and the other says, “That person has taken my handkerchief. Stay here and I will go after him (or her).” Then in a quiet secluded place they make love. They say loving words, squeeze each other's hands, and embrace. A very great evidence of love is when one spits and the other swallows the spittal. Copulation often follows after which a handkerchief or a ring may be given by the boy to the girl or vice versa and they make a vow such as, “If you do not marry me and marry another, you must take this engagement present and eat it and then I will make no trouble.” It is believed by the Ch'uan Miao men that copulation is one of the surest ways to a woman's affection.' <sup id="cite_ref-1000" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1000">[1,000]</a></sup>//Graham provides a translation of incantations performed on New Year's: 'When the rice biscuits have been eaten, you must go and remove diseases and remove calamities and remove pains and remove quarrels and remove sins.

When a Miao is seriously ill and it is found through divination that the kuei of the water buffalo is causing the trouble, or when a person is childless by middle age and it is divined that the water buffalo kuei is preventing the Queen of the Nether World at South Heaven Gate to send forth a child, a Miao sorcerer is invited to the house to burn beeswax, to beat gong and drum, and to make a great vow to bludgeon an ox. After the vow is made, if the sickness has been cured or the son sought is born, it is then believed that the kuei of the ox has bestowed it. Then, it becomes necessary to make preparations to fulfil the vow to bludgeon an ox. The selection of the water buffalo to buy is most important. It is necessary to select a water buffalo with the four quarters having four spirals /?/ and the ears, eyes, mouth, nose, horns, and hoofs must be right and complete. Sometimes it is very difficult to buy such an animal, and when found, the price is always prohibitive. If the host succeeds in buying a water buffalo at the market, then someone is sent home ahead to carry the news, so that the members of the family can prepare gongs and drums to meet the ox halfway. When the ox is led into the house, the gongs and drums stop, and [Page 208] 141 cont. incense and paper are burned. They watch the stance of the animal to divine good and bad luck. If the water buffalo, on entering the house, lifts his feet to advance, with its head facing the incense censer, and glances at the ancestral shrine, then it portends good luck. If the water buffalo is stubborn and refuses to move forward or even tries to back out as if frightened, then it portends bad luck. After the water buffalo has been bought, a Miao sorcerer is asked to come to the house to present the ox to the kuei, and also to beseech the kuei. After this presentation, the family has to wait for the first frost after the autumn harvest to make the sacrifice. When the date is decided it is never changed or postponed.' <sup id="cite_ref-1003" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1003">[1,003]</a></sup>//'After the autumn harvest has been completed and the first frost has arrived, an auspicious day is chosen to sacrifice to the kuei. Half a month before, four paternal male cousins are asked to go separately to where the relatives live to notify them. The most important relatives are the families of the hosts mother's brother and the wife's maternal uncle, who are said to be the “leg-bearing relatives.” They are so-called because after sacrificing to the kuei, one leg of the buffalo is given to the maternal uncle's relatives. A buffalo is divided into four legs. The first belongs to the /host's/ mother's brother, the second to the wife's maternal uncle, and the third and fourth are sent to other close relatives. The “leg-bearing relatives on receiving the notification presents the messenger with a strip of red cloth as an expression of gratitude. Moreover, within the 12 days before the sacrifice, one must avoid seeing unclean things, such as a dead cat, a dead dog, or a dead person. If this avoidance is violated, then the person may not be in the company of the buffalo kuei. The “leg-bearing” relatives often go together with the clan brothers /of the host/, making up a number of at least ten or more men up to as many as 60 or 70. Also invited are musicians, trumpeteers /?/, and drummers, to go in formation. Wealthy families imitate the old customs of the former Manchu dynasty, displaying official insignia, playing fine music, and beating gongs and carrying parasols. The maternal uncle's family entitled to the first leg [Page 209] 141 cont. also must provide a sharp spear and a large creeper. The spear is used to stab the ox, and the creeper, to tie its head.' <sup id="cite_ref-1004" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1004">[1,004]</a></sup>//'The Bludgeoning the Ox sacrifice to the kuei is the most lavish affair of the Miao. In addition to the water buffalo, the host also has to buy a common ox, two pigs, two chickens, and incense and paper, firecrackers, sweet wine, and sour fish. The relatives all have to send gifts. Formerly the Miao Bludgeoning-the-Buffalo sacrifice to the kuei lasted for five days, but now it lasts only three days. The first day is to honor the guests. That morning the “leg-bearing” relatives arrive in formation. As they approach the host's house they set, off firecrackers and play music. The host comes out to welcome them by burning incense and paper before them and kowtowing three times. The Miao consider that the water buffalo kuei comes with the mother's brother. By the time the lamps are lit in the evening, most of the guests invited have arrived; and after supper men and women guests begin to sing songs (see the chapter “Folk Songs,” songs Nos. 29 and 30, “Eating Ox Song,” and songs 33, 34, and 35, called “Beating the Flower Drum Song” /not translated/) and dance drum dances. [...] The host first starts the drumming, followed by the “leg-bearing” relatives, then by other guests according to the degree of relationship with the host, and last by the helpers. At the same time the sorcerer-priest begins his performance, using two large tables put together in the main house to make a long table, on which are then spread rice husks, on which are placed wine bowls, meat bowls, an iron tripod holding a tin can, and an upper millstone. The table is surrounded on all four sides with a number of plank benches. The sorcerer-priest and four “leg-bearing” relatives properly dressed in full dress, and sometimes they wear spirit robes /shen p'ao/. The sorcerer-priest sits in the middle and the four men sit next. Those who blow trumpets and beat drums and gongs sit below. The sorcerer-priest, ringing a hand bell with his right hand and holding a chiao-tzu in his left hand, begins uttering an incantation. [Page 210] 142 cont. After each passage the musicians play their instruments a while. When the sorcerer-priest has occasion to stand up, the four “leg-bearing” men who accompanied the kuei also stand up; when the sorcerer-priest sits down, the “leg-bearing” men also sit down; when he presents wine, they must also do so. From first to last it is done nine times until late at night.' <sup id="cite_ref-1005" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1005">[1,005]</a></sup>//'In the morning of the second day the sorcerer-priest orders the helpers to go outside the village to choose an open area to erect Five-Flower pillars. After the pillars are erected they make bamboo rings with bamboo strips and put them around the pillars. A piece of hemp rope is used to tie the nose of the ox to the bamboo ring. The creeper brought by the “leg-bearing” relatives are used to bind up the horns so that the animal cannot hurt anyone with the horns, see Illus. 63. After the arrangements have been finished, the sorcerer-priest is asked to make an inspection, and if he finds everything satisfactorily arranged, then they can proceed. The host then changes into new clothes, and offers wine and meat as sacrifices to the kuei, burns incense and paper, and kneels three times and kowtows nine times facing the ox. At the same time the sorcerer-priest utters an incantation, telling the origin of the ox kuei. After the incantation is finished, the mother's brother takes hold of the spear and acts as if he were chasing the ox to stab it. The spear is then taken by a young man to do the actual stabbing of the animal. At the same time the din from the drums and gongs rends the air and the ox runs around the Five-Flower pillars, /Illus. 63 appears between pp. 142 and 143./ 143 with the man pursuing and repeatedly stabbing, until the animal is dazed and falls to the ground. They note the direction in which the head falls to decide whether the sign is auspicious or not. If the head faces toward the host's house, it is a good omen; if the head faces away, then it is a bad omen. After the animal has been stabbed to death, then the meat is divided up. The head and heart, liver, entrails, and bowels go to the host to be used to sacrifice to the kuei. The left and right hind legs go to the “first- and second-leg-bearing” relatives, [Page 211] between pp. 142 and 143.

Miss Li said that at one time the people here had a temple which was destroyed by soldiers - perhaps in the fighting between imperial forces and those who resisted them, hundreds of years ago. While I was there they had only three T'u Ti Miao (shrines to the local deity) containing coneshaped stones, like part of a white stalagmite, not images such as one finds in comparable Chinese shrines. I saw similar shrines at the entrances to other Miao villages, along the highway, and near the buffalo bullfighting meadow at Yang-niu-ts'un. In every house there was a shrine to ancestors and the gods of the household.' <sup id="cite_ref-1008" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1008">[1,008]</a></sup> Other authors mention temples, although their differentiation from shrines remains ambiguous: 'The Sixth Month. The temples of the local gods in all the Chinese and Miao-I villages in the district are scenes of great celebration on the sixth day of this month. The Miao-I build their local temples outside the village gate, and on this day they would hold processions in honor of the Earth God. The day before, the village head prepared in advance a big pig and many varieties of meats and vegetables. On the sixth day all the items of sacrifice are carried to the village gate and deposited there in front of the Earth God temple. After setting off the firecrackers, every family takes turns to perform a ritual before the temple. After the sacrifice the pork is divided up among the families, the quantity being designated by each family to be paid for in grain after the autumn harvest. The remainder of the pork together with the other meats and vegetables are cooked together on the spot in a huge cauldron and eaten by all the people present. After feasting each family brings home a small quantity of pork, from which a piece is cut off for sacrifice on the border of one's field. A string of paper money is also stuck there as a token to  invoke a prosperous harvest. In the afternoon every family contributes a few dimes for the purchase of vegetables and sends a representative to the party, at which rules and regulations are discussed regarding indemnities for damages to crops. He who can write is asked to list the rules on a piece of white paper to be affixed at the village gate. Then on the top of a high mound near the village they set up a straw mark and let loose a din of firecrackers to announce to villages far and near that this village has already passed its laws so that none may go there to violate them.' <sup id="cite_ref-1009" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1009">[1,009]</a></sup> Christian missionaries established churches, but it appears that this process did not start until the late 19th and early 20th centuries: 'The first missionaries among the Hua Miao belonged to the Bible Christian Church, a dissenting Methodist sect, that placed great importance on the ability to read the Bible for oneself. With missionary assistance and encouragement, a simple phonetic script was developed in 1905 and in the following years the New Testament was translated in full into Dian Dongbei. Hymnals and study guides were also produced, and a series of school primers. In the 1930s and 1940s a small newspaper was published. Village chapels, built with communal effort, functioned also as one-room primary schools and centers for adult education. The mountain community of Shimenkan (Stone Gateway) in northwestern Guizhou served as the headquarters of church activity. In addition to its own large primary school, it offered secondary schooling and teacher training. At least thirty Hua Miao continued on and graduated from university in the decades before 1949. Some of these became ordained Methodist ministers or doctors and one became a well-regarded anthropologist (Yang Hanxian). Generally the local chapels were served by lay preachers who were trained at Shimenkan. Other young people received training as nurses and agricultural extension workers. At various points in time, agricultural and industrial extension programs were held at Shimenkan. New strains of potatoes were introduced, fruit orchards were planted on the hillsides of many villages, vegetable gardens were encouraged, and a number of Miao learned the techniques of carpentry, brickmaking, and masonry. More efficient looms were designed for home production of cloth. During the prerevolutionary decades, some villages benefited from collective endeavors to build bridges and roads, and pipe systems that brought water into the community. Teams of medical workers, from Shimenkan or from the churchaffiliated hospitals in nearby Zhaotong City, traveled around the area periodically. Even those who were not interested in becoming church members participated in the economic innovations, accepted treatment from the medical workers, and sent their children to the schools.' <sup id="cite_ref-1010" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1010">[1,010]</a></sup> More material on shrines and temples is needed.</dd>

The ability to play the lusheng   or other instruments and to sing and improvise songs is highly prized.

There is no written language and much of the history and legends or folklore of the group have been made into songs and are passed on from generation to generation.

Sometimes, but rarely, men sing one verse and women sing in response alternating until the song is finished. The songs sung on such occasions are love songs. At engagement ceremonies the middle men of the bride and the middle men of the groom sing alternately, sometimes ridiculing and sometimes praising each other. These songs and their tunes have been composed and handed down to subsequent generations for hundreds and perhaps thousands of years and they [Page 31] are still being made. There are sometimes contests to see who can sing the largest number of them. When anything important happens, a song may be composed and it is sung and taught to others. If some good deed is done, the person that is benefitted may write a song and thus spread the knowledge of it abroad and to future generations. If an injustice is done, this is an efficient way of punishing the offender and of securing revenge.' <sup id="cite_ref-1013" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1013">[1,013]</a></sup> 'The Ch'uan Miao distinguish at least the following different kinds of songs with appropriate tunes:- 1. Songs sung by go-betweens when making engagements. 2. Songs sung when sending the bride away from her home on her wedding day. 3. Songs sung when welcoming a bride at her wedding and at other times during a wedding. 4. Love songs, of which there are two kinds, those sung more loudly when the lovers are apart and those sung in very low tones when lovers are sitting close together. 5. War songs.m6. Hunting songs. 7. Fishing songs. 8. Songs sung by tuan kung □, while exorcising demons. 9. Songs sung at deaths and at funerals. 10. Songs sung during memorial ceremonies. The music of the liu shêng is distinguished as follows:- 1. That used when sweeping the house preparatory to a memorial festival. 2. When welcoming back home the souls of the dead. 3. When presenting the sacrificial animal to the ancestor. 4. When making a sacrificial offering of food or wine to the ancestor. 5. To distinguish time limits in the memorial ceremonies. 6. Thanking the filial son after feasts in the memorial ceremonies. 7. When sending or escorting the soul of the dead to heaven. 8. Tunes played just for amusement.' <sup id="cite_ref-1014" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1014">[1,014]</a></sup> 'The mouth harp is played only in low, soothing tones when making love and audible words are spoken.' <sup id="cite_ref-1015" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1015">[1,015]</a></sup> 'Only love songs are played with tree leaves.

Women who are popular with men are pretty or ready of speech or well dressed or good singers or have bright minds or have money. These are the qualities that attract the men. Men who are popular with the women are handsome, or mentally bright or good singers or good at playing the liu shêng and dancing, or have money.

Indeed, most Chinese admit that Tang poetry rhymes better when read by a Yue speaker than by someone from the north.

Due to the difficulties of livelihood the Miao-I cannot afford the facilities of health and sanitation. Their hardihood enables them to survive the cold seasons of winter and spring when little disease prevails. But summer and autumn are the seasons of ill health. In case of sickness there are no medical facilities in the Miao-I areas, and the patient is left to the mercy of nature of magic. Sometimes a mi-la /diviner/ or a kuei-shih /shaman priest/ is asked to propitiate the ghost. Mi-la is also known as “mi-p'o,” and kuei-shih as “tuan-kung.” The patient's family first asks the diviner to ascertain the kind of evil spirit that is causing the trouble and the kind of animal most appropriate for sacrifice. Then the wizard priest is asked [Page 10] 8 cont. to perform the ritual. Collusion between the two is common, and the ignorant people are made victims. These ghost affairs, however, often have a psychological effect and little ailments are sometimes healed this way. But in nine out of ten serious cases death is the only outcome. Their superstition is so deep-rooted that they think all diseases are caused by spirits who have to be appeased. Death is considered a destiny, and the living resign themselves to fate. Every year when diseases are prevalent in all hsien areas in Kweichow, the diviners and the priests do a thriving trade that unfortunately causes innumerable deaths.

The women too have to attend to house chores, being especially strong and fit, they regard childbirth as a common occurrence. When a married woman is pregnant she has to be confined in her husband's house. At the time of childbirth she is attended by her mother-in-law or sister-in-law or sometimes she is just by herself. The umbilical cord is broken by means of a piece of stone, and the sac is placed in an earthen jar and buried underground or hung up high in the room. The baby is then washed with cold water. The mother remains at home for a week, after which she goes up the hill to gather firewood or down the field to cultivate the land without further inhibition or recuperation. They are afraid to have too many children and often get rid of them by drowning or simply killing them. It is said that when children are numerous there will be disputes over inheritance and litigations. 8 Moreover, if the parents have no property, the acquisition of many children means so much hard work to bring them up. So whether there is money or not in the family, to have children means added suffering and privation to the parents, who are therefore reluctant to have too many. Because of the prevalence of infanticide the rate of childbirth is decreasing. This and the high mortality rate combine to endanger the growth of their population.' <sup id="cite_ref-1035" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1035">[1,035]</a></sup> While these descriptions refer to the Chinese period, we have assumed they are valid for the Qing period as well.</dd></dl>

The most prevalent diseases were those of the skin - boils, eczema, ringworm, infection from scratched insect bites; intestinal disease due to parasites; conjunctivitis and trachoma; malaria; colds and coughs. In the summer there was a great deal of dysentery. Many had pyorrhea and bad teeth. Several times I saw a woman of the village pull another woman's tooth, which came out very easily. I also saw them wash their eyes with an infusion of leaves, after which another woman picked at the eyelids with a needle.

The previous summer the first son and a girl baby in a nearby household had died of it, also. It once developed into meningitis and death resulted in a day or two.

Men are often invited out as guests, and meat is served at parties together with wine. Women, however, have fewer occasions to be guests, and even when they are invited they are considered unimportant guests and poorly received. They are often offered sour soup with noodles as a special dish. If there are male guests in the house, only male members of the family sit at the table, the women taking no part at all.

<dd> <b>♠ voluntary religious associations ♣ absent ♥</b> Traditionally, animism was important, but some Hmong converted to Christianity: 'Religious beliefs and activities vary by locale and subethnic identity. The situation is further complicated by partial adoption of elements of folk Daoism and Buddhism, or by conversion to Christianity (as among segments of the White and Flowery Miao). Traditional religious beliefs concern powerful suprahuman forces associated with sacred groves, stones, caves, and other natural phenomena, as well as with bridges and wells. Other protective spirits guard the household and hamlet. The latter are sometimes thought of as dragons. It is believed that at death, the soul divides into three parts, one of which returns to protect the household as an ancestral spirit. There is also concern with evil spirits and with ghosts of those who died bad deaths and who may cause illness and misfortune. Religious beliefs are supported by a complex series of sung or chanted poetic myths, which treat the creation of the universe, the doings of divine beings and culture heroes, and early Miao history.' <sup id="cite_ref-1050" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1050">[1,050]</a></sup> Christian missionaries established churches and other religious institutions. But this process only started in the late 19th and early 20th centuries: 'The Catholic church in the city of An-shun is known as Shan-tsung T'ang /hall of goodness/ with four branch halls at Kung-pu, Mo-wan-tung, Shui-tang-chai and Ch'iu-chow. They all hold properties which are yearly on the increase. It is said that the Catholic Church at An-shun was established by a certain French priest some fifty years ago. Today, it is administered by Lengkuohsien /transliterated/ and Chailiszu /transliterated/, both French, and the expenses for maintaining it comes from the Catholic headquarters in Kweiyang. The church maintains an elementary school, studying chiefly the Bible, and the enrollment is about from 30 to 40 boys from Catholic families. Within the hsien district there are about 2000 Catholics, one-half of them being the Chung-chia people. [Page 2] They are mostly converted to the faith because they are tenant farmers on the land owned by the church. This land, also known as the “biblehall land”, is scattered over a number of localities that border on the Chung-chia villages. The profits from the land are equally divided. The advantages for tenant farmers being more than elsewhere, many Chung-chia people become believers in order to cultivate the church land. Every Sunday the farmers attend mass in nearby churches. During harvest time in October the church would send out priests to the villages to supervise harvests, where they also conduct religious services morning and night, requiring all believers to attend (some of the villages have small churches). The priest remains in each village for about a week, putting up with the richest family, but the expenses on food are borne by all the tenant farmers in the village. In recent years this relationship is undergoing a change as it is said that the priests have indulged in extortions which have greatly shaken the faith of the Miao-I believers.' <sup id="cite_ref-1051" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1051">[1,051]</a></sup> 'Besides Catholics there are Protestants within the district. The China Inland Mission maintains a Gospel Church in An-shun. It was established in 1897 by an American missionary, Tanchushin /transliterated/, who went deep into the Miao villages in many areas. His friendliness and sincerity won him many converts. At present there are in this hsien area from 5000 to 6000 Christians, both Chinese and Miao-I. The missionary was especially successful among the Hua Miao, and there are more Christians among this tribe than among others. The leader of the Hua Miao in An-shun was Yang Ching-an, who was trained by Tanchüshih. In the early years of the Chinese Republic, Yang had followed the American missionary to Shanghai and Nanking. With his extensive experience he was considered [Page 3] an enlightened person among the Miao. His religious fervor, however, was a little too excessive, and it disqualified him as a true leader of his people. He preached among them for more than twenty years with great success, but since he and his foreign associates had left the church, no one succeeded them as a full time preacher. The church school has been closed down. There are only two American doctors in the hospital, having charge at the same time of the church, but they have no time for preaching. So the faith of the Miao and I in Protestant Christianity is also on the decline.' <sup id="cite_ref-1052" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1052">[1,052]</a></sup> 'Besides the Catholic Church and the China Inland Mission, the Seventh Day Adventists have recently established a church in An-shun to spread the Christian principles but rather on a small scale. At present the work is carried on by a young man of the Hua Miao tribe, named Tang Chen-ying, with about thirty members equally divided among the Chinese and Miao-I, and a church school of over ten Miao children.' <sup id="cite_ref-1053" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1053">[1,053]</a></sup> Diamond provides a historical overview: 'Accusations of backwardness, conservatism, and primitive survivals cut cruelly in this case since one of the internal markers of their ethnicity is their widespread conversion at the turn of the century to the evangelical Protestantism brought by the China Inland Mission and the English Methodist Church. They were one of the most dramatic success stories of the missionary effort in southwest China, or China generally, with tens of thousands of converts and adherants. This was more than token Christianity. [Page 68] Along with the conversions and baptisms came literacy, on a fairly wide scale and a strong sense of unity and local pride.' <sup id="cite_ref-1054" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1054">[1,054]</a></sup> 'The first missionaries among the Hua Miao belonged to the Bible Christian Church, a dissenting Methodist sect, that placed great importance on the ability to read the Bible for oneself. With missionary assistance and encouragement, a simple phonetic script was developed in 1905 and in the following years the New Testament was translated in full into Dian Dongbei. Hymnals and study guides were also produced, and a series of school primers. In the 1930s and 1940s a small newspaper was published. Village chapels, built with communal effort, functioned also as one-room primary schools and centers for adult education. The mountain community of Shimenkan (Stone Gateway) in northwestern Guizhou served as the headquarters of church activity. In addition to its own large primary school, it offered secondary schooling and teacher training. At least thirty Hua Miao continued on and graduated from university in the decades before 1949. Some of these became ordained Methodist ministers or doctors and one became a well-regarded anthropologist (Yang Hanxian). Generally the local chapels were served by lay preachers who were trained at Shimenkan. Other young people received training as nurses and agricultural extension workers. At various points in time, agricultural and industrial extension programs were held at Shimenkan. New strains of potatoes were introduced, fruit orchards were planted on the hillsides of many villages, vegetable gardens were encouraged, and a number of Miao learned the techniques of carpentry, brickmaking, and masonry. More efficient looms were designed for home production of cloth. During the prerevolutionary decades, some villages benefited from collective endeavors to build bridges and roads, and pipe systems that brought water into the community. Teams of medical workers, from Shimenkan or from the churchaffiliated hospitals in nearby Zhaotong City, traveled around the area periodically. Even those who were not interested in becoming church members participated in the economic innovations, accepted treatment from the medical workers, and sent their children to the schools.' <sup id="cite_ref-1055" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1055">[1,055]</a></sup> 'State policy on religion held that minority religions could continue in practice, save for those aspects that were physically harmful or in some way wasteful of economic resources. Christianity was recognized as one of the indigenous religions of the Miao, as well as some other ethnic groups. Even so, the churches in the Hua Miao area were closed and the practice of Christianity forbidden at some point in the late 1950s. The Hua Miao continued to hold Christian worship services, meeting in private houses or in forest clearings and caves in the hills, under lay leadership. Reportedly, these were not much different from village chapel meetings, except that they were now illegal and participants could be punished. But there were other differences, of course. Prior to 1949, intervillage services were common, and at Shimenkan there were several days of religious activity around major church festival days. Some 10,000 or more people might travel in from the surrounding area to attend. These large meetings could no longer take place. Indeed, given the restrictions on travel outside of ones own commune, the local churches groups operated in isolation. A few moved toward a more millenarian stand than what had been taught by the Methodist Church and the China Inland Mission. Picking up on doctrines brought by the Seventh Day Adventists, who had sought converts in the late 1930 and 1940s, they began actively preaching and preparing for the Second Coming and the end of the world. Yet others developed services that centered on long hours of singing and dancing.' <sup id="cite_ref-1056" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1056">[1,056]</a></sup> 'Elsewhere in China, the churches operated openly until the start of the Cultural Revolution in 1966. Then they too were closed, not reopening until the late 1970s and early 1980s. The reopenings occured at the same time in the Hua Miao areas, under the guidance [Page 71] of the Three-Self Church (the state-approved religious body). However, there were very few surviving ordained ministers in the Hua Miao communities by then, and few youth educated sufficiently to be accepted to seminary. House churches continued, the local Miao village cadres tending to look the other way on such activities. Where there were reopend churches, congregants were willing to walk five or six hours to attend, often starting off at dawn, sleeping over and returning the following day. But this could not be done too often; the township cadres I talked with pointed out that such activities interfered with production and should not be encouraged.' <sup id="cite_ref-1057" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1057">[1,057]</a></sup> See also the Chinese-period data sheet.

<p><b>♠ Tribute ♣ absent ♥</b> Note: eHRAF provides a general description of the history of the region: 'Chinese scholarship links the present-day Miao to tribal confederations that moved southward some 2,000 years ago from the plain between the Yellow River and the Yangtze toward the Dongting Lake area. These became the San Miao mentioned in Han dynasty texts. Over the next thousand years, between the Han and the Song dynasties, these presumed ancestors of the Miao continued to migrate westward and southward, under pressure from expanding Han populations and the imperial armies. Chinese texts and Miao oral history establish that over those years the ancestors settled in western Hunan and Guizhou, with some moving south into Guangxi or west along the Wu River to southeastern Sichuan and into Yunnan. The period was marked by a number of uprisings and battles between Miao and the Han or local indigenous groups, recalled in the oral histories of local groups. Though the term "Miao" was sometimes used in Tang and Song histories, the more usual term was "Man," meaning "barbarians." Migration continued through the Yuan, Ming, and early Qing, with some groups moving into mainland Southeast Asia. The retreat from Han control brought some into territories controlled by the Yi in northeast Yunnan/northwest Guizhou. The various migrations can also be seen as "vertical" migrations into the undeveloped hillside and mountain areas that were of lesser interest to Han. Depending on the terrain, the settled farming cited in Miao historical myths gave way to shifting slash-and-burn agriculture, facilitated by the introduction of the Irish potato and maize in the sixteenth century, and the adoption of high-altitude/cool-weather crops like barley, buckwheat, and oats. Farming was supplemented by forest hunting, fishing, gathering, and pastoralism. During the Qing, uprisings and military encounters escalated. There were major disturbances in western Hunan (1795-1806) and a continuous series of rebellions in Guizhou (1854-1872). Chinese policies toward the Miao shifted among assimilation, containment in "stockaded villages," dispersal, removal, and extermination. The frequent threat of "Miao rebellion" caused considerable anxiety to the state; in actuality, many of these uprisings included Bouyei, Dong, Hui, and other ethnic groups, including Han settlers and demobilized soldiers. At issue were heavy taxation, rising landlordism, rivalries over local resources, and official corruption. One of the last Miao uprisings occurred in 1936 in western Hunan in opposition to Guomindang (Republican) continuation of the tuntian   system, which forced the peasants to open up new lands and grow crops for the state.' <sup id="cite_ref-1058" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1058">[1,058]</a></sup> 'From Song on, in periods of relative peace, government control was exercised through the tusi   system of indirect rule by appointed native headmen who collected taxes, organized corvée, and kept the peace. Miao filled this role in Hunan and eastern Guizhou, but farther west the rulers were often drawn from a hereditary Yi nobility, a system that lasted into the twentieth century. In Guizhou, some tusi   claimed Han ancestry, but were probably drawn from the ranks of assimilated Bouyei, Dong, and Miao. Government documents refer to the "Sheng Miao" (raw Miao), meaning those living in areas beyond government control and not paying taxes or labor service to the state. In the sixteenth century, in the more pacified areas, the implementation of the policy of gaitu guiliu   began the replacement of native rulers with regular civilian and military officials, a few of whom were drawn from assimilated minority families. Land became a commodity, creating both landlords and some freeholding peasants in the areas affected. In the Yunnan-Guizhou border area, the tusi   system continued and Miao purchase of land and participation in local markets was restricted by law until the Republican period (1911-1949).' <sup id="cite_ref-1059" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1059">[1,059]</a></sup> The region has a long history of Chinese military intervention: 'The two regions referred to above can be demarcated by the ruins of the boundary wall erected under the Ming dynasty. Miao Fang-pei Lan, Shu Wang Lu /Detailed Old Records from the M.F.L./, states: “In the forty-third year of the Wan Li reign period (1615 A.D.) the Ping-pei Ts'an-cheng /Administrative Officer of Military Preparedness/ at Ch'en and Yüan rivers, Ts'ai Fu-i, reported that because the garrison outposts were so scattered and the Miao roads so rugged, it was difficult to defend against Miao incursions. He requested the appropriation of some 40,000 in gold currency for the erection of an earth wall, from T'ung-jen down to Pao-ch'ing, winding along the mountains and the streams for more than 300 li. Thus the border was made relatively secure. Again, during the second year of T'ien Chi (1622 A.D.), the assistant commissioner of the circuit of the garrison at Ch'en and Yüan rivers, Hu I-hung ordered Teng Tsuyü, a guerrila commander, to add another 60 li of wall from Chen-ch'i-so to Hsi-ch'üeh-ying.” The ruins of this wall start from Wang-hui-ying and T'ing-tzu-kuan in the southeast corner of the Miao area and proceeds northeast, ending at Hsi-ch'üeh-ying, dividing the Miao area into the southeast and the northwest regions. The building of the boundary wall under the Ming dynasty was not intentionally based on the topography but rather in accordance with the limits of Chinese colonization in the Miao area. The Chinese first occupied the region where the rivers flowed down in the southeast, and the Miao retreated to the La-erh plateau, defending themselves behind its natural advantages. The Chinese and the Miao were already divided according to topography (Illus. 2, 8) some 300 years ago. The frontier wall of that time, although serving as a boundary line between the Chinese and the Miao, became at the same time a [Page 54] 30 cont. line of demarcation between the two natural regions. So today the actual area of the Miao is northwest of the boundary wall, limited to the La-erh plateau. Although the Miao area is not a barren wilderness, the area is small and densely populated, with a high birth rate leading to population pressure, which has led the Miao to invade the southeastern region. Therefore, whenever there is a Miao rebellion, the whole area /Illus. 7 on p. 31/ 32 is occupied by them. The territorial limits designated by Yen Ju-yü as the Miao area is not entirely without reason. The Miao regard this area as their native land, and they seldom exceed its limits even in time of strife.' <sup id="cite_ref-1060" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1060">[1,060]</a></sup> 'The development of the Miao area began during the time of the juncture of the Yuan dynasty and the Ming. The geographical section of the Ming Shih /History of the Ming Dynasty/ states: “A ch'ang kuan szu /a native leader set up by the Chinese government to head the district/ was established at Wu-chai during the Yuan dynasty, and in the sixth month of the seventh year of Hung Wu /1374, during the first reign period of the Ming dynasty/ the office was continued. A ch'ang kuan szu was set up at Kan-tzu-p'ing in the sixth month of the year chia ch'en of the first Ming emperor /1359/, at the headquarters of the commander-in-chief at Kan-tzu-p'ing. Later it was abolished. In the seventh month of the third year of the Yung Lo /1405/, it was reestablished.” Furthermore, the entry for Headman Hu Kuang in the “T'u szu Lieh Chuan” /Biographies of Headmen/ states: “In the third year of Yung Lo, Kung Neng and others at the Ch'en-chou military station summoned Liao Piao and others of the uncivilized Miao /i. e. those not under Chinese control/ from 35 villages of Kan-tzu-p'ing to send sons to pay tribute, and for this reason a ch'ang kuan szu was set up for Kan-tzu-p'ing, with Piao to be the official, under the jurisdiction of Pao-ching.” The city of the ch'ang kuan szu of Wu-chai was the present chief city of Feng-huang hsien, but that of Kan-tzu-p'ing was also within Feng-huang, situated 70 li northeast of the chief town of the hsien. In Vol. 3 of the revised edition of Feng-huang T'ing Chih, published in the fourth year of Tao Kuang /1824/, it says: “The old city of the ch'ang kuan szu of Kan-tzu-p'ing was situated 70 li northeast of the T'ing. In the first year of the first Ming emperor /1368/, a yüan-shuai-fu /commander-in-chief's post/ was set up. In the third year of Yung Lo /i. e. [Page 149] 104 cont. 1405/ it was changed to ch'ang kuan szu, with two city seats, one on the mountain top and another at the foot of the mountain. Today they have been abolished. The old city of the Wu-chai ch'ang kuan szu is the present seat of the T'ing /i.e. Feng-huang sub-prefecture/ administration, but it has been greatly expanded. During the Ming period all was under the jurisdiction of the Pacification Commissioner at Pao-ching.”' <sup id="cite_ref-1061" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1061">[1,061]</a></sup> 'Kan Ch'eng was opened somewhat later, when at the end of the Hung Wu reign period /1368-98/ a ch'ien hu suo /a ch'ien hu was an official at a military station, in charge of 1,000 soldiers; suo = office or bureau/ was established. The “Shu Wang P'ien” /historical section/ of the Miao Fang Pei Lan states: “In the second month of the thirtieth year of Hung Wu /1397/ there was set up at Chen-ch'i a military and civilian ch'ien hu bureau. Sun Ying-lung, who was then keeper of the records at Lu-ch'i, proclaimed that the tribal people of the upper five tu /hsien subdivisions/ should be divided into ten li /neighborhoods/, to be under the jurisdiction of Ch'en-chou. Ying-lung was promoted by imperial mandate to be in charge of the pacification. He selected the head ch'ien hu in charge of the ch'ien hu bureau at Chien-ch'ang, Kiangsi, to go to the capital to be given a bronze seal and given the hereditary office of ch'ien hu of Chen-ch'i. When the emperor went to the pavilion to send him on his way, he proclaimed: ‘I have a single pellet of Miao territory, and I ask you to go ahead to open up headquarters for bringing the barbarians under our administration. Do what is good for them, and your descendants will enjoy the use /of the office/ without limit.’ Moreover, he ordered the Board of War to select Ch'en Ya of Wu-sa military station in Kweichow and Sung Kuei of Lu-chou military station in Szechwan to be assistnat ch'ien hu to go with him to assist him. He ordered the Board of Civil Office to select a head constable, and the provincial treasurer to allot for district police officers, who were granted, wrapped up an ivory tablet, paper money, and a silver belt, and entertained ceremoniously, and sent on their way. In the fifth [Page 150] 104 cont. month Tuan Wen reached Chen-ch'i, established the Military Station Office, and inaugurated the system, dividing 124 native villages into ten li, making Yang Erh, the main leader, a pe fu ch'ang /head of hundred men/. The other 132 villages 105 became a local army ‘to protect the city moats.’ When there were uprisings then they would be called to service; when conditions were peaceful then they would disperse as civilians.

But because of using an administrative policy of blockade against Miao country, the 270 years under the Ming [Page 166] 113 cont. did not witness serious trouble. The method of this blockade consisted of setting up stone guard posts /tiao-pao/, establishing guard stations /ying shao/, and building border walls, strictly demarcating the boundary between the Chinese and Miao areas, without allowing any infringement by one on the other. The section on government in the historical section of Miao Fang Pei Lan, recording the system of defense against the Miao during the Ming dynasty, has this to say: “During the fifth year of Hsüan Te i.e. 1430, the senior official /chang kuan/ at Kan-tzu-p'ing, Wu Pi-lang, and the Miao of Tung-jen, Kweichow, started a rebellion. The brigadier general /tsung ping kuan/, Hsiao Shou, built 24 guard posts /pao/ around the area to protect it. In the thirty-first year of Chia Ching i.e. 1552, the Miao in Hupeh-Hunan and Kweichow were pacified. The Court sent Governor General Chang Yo to hold down Yüanchou. Yo in consultation with Assistant Commissioner /fu shih/ Kao Hsien, and Lieutenant Colonel /ts'an chiang/ Sun Hsien drew up a plan to abolish the guard posts at Wan-chi. Then he built 12 outposts /shao/ called: Wu-chai, Yung-an, Ch'ing-ch'i, Ho-k'ou, Kan-tzu, Kan-chou, Ch'iang-hu, Shih-yang, Shao-p'o, Tung-hsin, Shui-t'ang-yao, Shui-t'ien-ying, which with that at Chen-ch'i-so came to 13 in all. Every guard station had a wall, a tower, a drill yard, a narrow gate, an office, and a community storehouse /she ts'ang/. The officer corps included a tu-pei /“head of senior soldiers”/, ling-pan /“section leader”/, ling-tui /“company leader”/, ling-cheng /“recruitment and arms officer?”/, kuan-piao /“keeper of banners”/, kuan-ts'ang /“keeper of the storehouse”/, and li-mu /“head constable and keeper of the jail”/. The local official had under him t'ou-mu /“headmen”/, she-jen /“official secretaries”/, shih-tzu /“readers”/, chien-pu /“strong walkers”/, ta-shou /?lit., “move the hands”/ hsiang-t'u /?lit., geographers”/, po-k'ai /heralds/, and the Ch'i Miao soldiers. In all the officers and men totaled 6, 000 or more, commanded by a lieutenant colonel /ts'an-chiang piao ying/, with a second [Page 167] 113 cont. captain /shou-pei/ assisting him. Moreover, at the two military stations /wei/ of Ch'en and Yüan, the frontier guard officers and men, amounted to 6,600 or more, and the annual disbursement to the Yüan-chou treasury for paying the troops was more than 30,089 /sic/ liang of silver, that to the Ma-yang, Ch'ienyang, and Kan-chou military rations granaries and the autumn government rations at Chen-ch'i-so were 31,890 or more. At this time, the lieutenant colonel /tsan-chiang Tu-ling/ directed matters at the top, the majors /yu-chi/ and second captains /shou-pei/ attended to things at the middle level, and the guard stations /ying-shao/ carried out defense duties at the lower level. Furthermore, fearing the difficulty of communications in times of trouble, it was arranged for the sake of convenience as follows: ‘For operations involving under 3,000 men, decisions may be made on the spot, but for operations involving more than 3,000 men, the decision must be made after consultation with the military defense officials. As the number of soldiers increased and generals became more strong, the border regions became more quiet and peaceful. In the forty-third year Wan Li /i.e. 1615/, the Military Defense Ts'an Cheng, Ts'ai Fu-i, because the guard stations being spread out and the Miao roads rugged, it was difficult to prevent spying, applied for an appropriation of 40,000 or more gold for the construction of a frontier earth wall, starting from T'ung-jen and going down to Pao-ching guard station, along mountains and extending in all more than 300 li, so that frontier defense could be made somewhat more 114 secure. In the second year of T'ien Ch'i /i.e. 1622/, a provincial governor was set up at P'ien-yüan…. The then pei tao fu shih /assistant commissioner of defense?/ Hu I-hung at Ch'en Yüan despatched Major Teng Tsu-yü from Chen-ch'i-so to Hsi-ch'üeh-ying to build an additional 60 more li of frontier wall.”' <sup id="cite_ref-1066" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1066">[1,066]</a></sup> In the Qing period, Hmong migrations occurred after a number of failed rebellions, affecting the geographical distribution of individual Hmong sub-groups: 'The pure Miao tribe in Kweichow is further divided into five subgroups, the Hung Miao, the He Miao, the Pe Miao, the Ch'ing Miao, and the Hua Miao. The geographical distribution of the Hung Miao is along the eastern part of Kweichow bordering Hunan and the vicinity of T'ung-jen is the center. The He Miao are spread over a wide area in southeastern Kweichow, including such hisen as Tu-yün, Pa-chai, Tan-chiang, Yung-chiang, Yung-ts'ung, Li-p'ing, Chien-ho, T'ai-kung, Chen-yüan, Shih-ping, Huang-p'ing, Lu-shan, etc. It lies in the region south of the Hunan-Kweichow highway and east of the Kwangsi-Kweichow highway. The Pe Miao are found in the central part of Kweichow, starting in the east at Kwei-ting and Lung-li, passing through Kwei-chu, Hsiu-wen, and Ch'ien-hsi, and reaching Chih-chin and Lang-tai in the west. The Ch'ing Miao are also found in central Kweichow, principally in the vicinity of Kuei-yang, but also at Hsiu-wen, Ch'ing-chen, Ch'ien-hsi, and Chen-ning. The distribution of Hua Miao is the most extensive, starting from the vicinity of Kuei-yang, scattering over the northern and northwestern parts of Kweichow province in K'ai-yang, Jen-huai, Chih-chin, Lang-tai, Shui-ch'eng, and An-shun hsiens.' <sup id="cite_ref-1067" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1067">[1,067]</a></sup> 'Owing to repeated military attacks during the Yüan and Ming periods, many of the Miao tribes in Kweichow moved outward. The Hung Miao who lived in the vicinity of Tung-jen in eastern Kweichow moved eastward to the three sub-prefectures /t'ing/ of western Hunan. During the four rebellions in the Ch'ing dynasty, in 1698, 1732, 1794, and 1855, when armies were used to put them down, the Miao fled in all [Page 34] 18 cont. directions, which led to the mass migration of Miao tribes in modern times. The He Miao gradually migrated to Hunan and Kwangsi. The Pe Miao moved from the northwest to Szechwan and Yunnan. The Hua Miao moved through An-shun in the west to the eastern part of Yunnan and north to Wu-ting and along the banks of the Chin-sha-chiang River, and again through the southeastern part of Yunnan to the north of Tonkin in Indochina. The Ch'ing Miao dispersed in all directions in the three provinces of Hunan, Kwangsi, and Yunnan. The foregoing relates to the major migratory trends of the Miao, but actually in the interior of Hunan, Kwangsi, Szechwan, and Yunnan several Miao subgroups are often found in one area. The writers found three subgroups at Meng-tzu, Yunnan, the Pe Miao, the Hua Miao, and the Ch'ing Miao, but the last two were not easily distinguishable from their dress. Furthermore, several groups inhabiting the same area are likely to intermarry so that after a considerable length of time has passed, it is difficult to distinguish between them.' <sup id="cite_ref-1068" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1068">[1,068]</a></sup> 'Topography. (Illus. 2). - Topographically, the Miao area may be divided into two natural regions. The northwestern section can be called the La-erh plateau region; the southeastern section is the region where the rivers flow down. Although the plateau rises about 700 kung ch'ih above sea level, on it there are a great many small basins, with many springs and ponds good for irrigation. The Miao call such small basins p'ing /a plain/, t'ang /a pond/, or ch'ung. The best known among these is the Pao-mu-ying-p'ing, about 70 li north 30 of Feng-huang-ch'eng /city/. Surrounded by mountains, this level area measures five to six li in length and three to four li in width and has seven or eight spring-fed ponds, supplying ample drinking water. It is the largest basin on the plateau. Ya-pao-chai (Illus. 7), situated in the Ya-pao-shan mountains, about 93 li north of Feng-huang-ch'eng, is very high and cold. It has several fish ponds and produces rough rice and yams. In 1795, when the Miao revolted, the headman, Wu Lung-teng, whose family had lived there for generations, was entrenched there. The above two places are the largest among the basins on the plateau. There are countless small basins /p'ing and ch'ung/. There are numerous wells and springs in the mountains, wells being found even on the peaks. The “Yao K'ao” section of the Miao Fang-pei Lan states: “Fifty li southwest outside the city is Ma-an Shan /“Horse Saddle Mountain”/, which is about eight or nine li in height, is very steep, and resembles a horse saddle in shape. On top of the mountain there is a well that never goes dry. On the mountain there are pockets where there are irrigated rice fields. It is a strategic point for the uncivilized Miao to defend.” The La-erh plateau is dotted with Miao villages and settlements because of its level places /p'ing/ and wells and springs, and there the Miao people thrive.' <sup id="cite_ref-1069" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1069">[1,069]</a></sup> Imperial control shiftend from indirect rule to government by appointed Chinese officials before a mixed system was established after a Miao rebellion: 'After the five hsien in the Miao frontier region were opened, from the Yuan and Ming dynasties to the beginning of the Ch'ing dynasty, they were under the control of native headmen. During the K'ang Hsi reign period of the early Ch'ing /1662-1722/, a gradual change was begun from native headmen to regular government officials. In the forty-sixth year of K'ang Hsi /1707/, the senior official /ch'ang kuan szu/ at Wu-chai, T'ien Hung-t'ien, being harsh and cruel, the provincial governor, Chao Shen-ch'iao, sent up a memorial [Page 151] 105 cont. to the Emperor requesting that he be dismissed from office and that no hereditary substitute be allowed. In the forty-eighth year /1709/, because the Miao at Liu-li of the Chen-ch'i Office did not wish to be under the control of the native headman at Pao-ching, they repeatedly requested the change from native headman to government official, and the provincial governor, Chao Shen-ch'iao, again sent up a memorial requesting transference of control to the government. In the fourth year of Yung Cheng /1726/, the headman at Pao-ching, P'eng, Yü-pin, was removed from office for being avaricious and cruel, and in the fifth year the change was made from native headman to government official. Yü-pin was peacefully settled at Liao-yang. In the fifth year of Yung Cheng, the headman at Yung-shun, P'eng Chao-huai, personally applied for the change from native headman to government official. He returned to his native place in Chi-shui, Kiangsi. San-t'u-chou /“three local chou”/ and Wu-ch'ang-kuan-szu /“five senior officials”/ under the jurisdiction of the headman of Yung-shun were also changed from native to government officials.' <sup id="cite_ref-1070" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1070">[1,070]</a></sup> 'After the voluntary change from the native headmen in the Miao frontier region, in each Miao village there was set up a local village chief over 100 families /i.e., a pe hu chai ch'ang, “100 families village chief”/, in order to govern the Miao and bring them under the administration of government officials. But the chiefs of the 100 families were not always Miao, sometimes Chinese being appointed to these positions. As time passed, gradually, there were rapacious, unscrupulous rogues, whose mistreatment caused disturbances, so that the unprecedented Miao rebellion took place during the sixtieth year of Ch'ien Lung /1795/. When the Miao rebellion was put down in the first year of Chia Ch'ing /1796/, it was found that the policy of governing the Miao with Chinese was wrong. The then governor-general of Hunan and Kwangtung, Pi Yüan, submitted a plan to govern the Miao with Miao. (6) The ministry's response to the memorial setting up regulations for Miao officials, Miao Chiang Chin-106 Yao Shan-Hou Shih I /Important Remedial Measures for the Miao Frontier Region/, has a passage, “Miao Chiang Pe Hu Chai Ch'ang Ming-Mu Ying Cho Liang Keng Ting /The Names of the Village Leaders of 100 Families Should be Decided after Due Deliberation/,” stating: “According to the memorial, in the three provinces of Szechwan, Kweichow, and Hupeh, such areas as Yu-yang and T'ung-jen were all previously governed by headmen, but following their application to be put under government officials, the administrative areas of chou, hsien, and ying [Page 153] 106 cont. were established, subject to the jurisdiction of civil and military authorities. In the Miao villages, there were established only village chiefs to govern a unit of 100 families. However, since Chinese were also permitted to fill these posts, gradually there were rapacious, unscrupulous rogues, whose mistreatment caused disturbances. It is requested that from among the Miao who have submitted, and on whom were conferred the peacock feather decoration /for merit, in early Ch'ing times/, there be selected some intelligent, aware persons, to be appointed at each ying /military station/ as native second captain /shoupei/, lieutenant /ch'ien-tsung/, and sergeant or corporal /wai-wei/, such positions to be filled through the governor-general and governor's /tu-wu/ yamen /tu-wu ya-men/ and to be subject to the control of the civil and military authorities. When the various t'ang hsin in the Miao area have official despatches to send, they can order the said native petty officers to select Miao to question and send, and also to give them some cash and rations. When officials traveling on official business require servants, they may also recruit them from the Miao, and pay them wages according to the Chinese scales. It would appear that the 100-families village chief was originally inaugurated to discipline the Miao, but these men were unimportant and their powers limited, as that the Miao did not heed them. Moreover, among the Chinese holding such positions there were rapacious, unscrupulous rogues, whose mistreatment led to disturbances. This should naturally be explained, deliberated, and changed, so as to fix responsibility. During the recent campaign those submissive Miao who accompanied the army and won peacock feather awards are numerous, therefore from these select those who are intelligent and aware, and who have the support of the rest, and according to the customary set-up of t'u-kuan /officials governing aboriginal tribes in West China/, every Ying should have one or two men to be native second captains, under whom there should be native lieutenants and sergeants, for better control of [Page 154] 106 cont. the Miao. Their number will depend upon the number of villages put under control, and they shall be appointed by the governor-general and governor's yamen and also be under the control of regional officials. If there are fights, robberies and thefts among the Miao these native officers will be asked to make the arrests. On their inspection tours, the governor-general and governor and military officials should examine the merits and demerits of these officers and reward or punish them accordingly to demonstrate justice, following the recommendations memorialized by Governor-general Ho Lin. When the t'ang-hsin system of communication in the Miao area has been abolished, official communications should be despatched according to old methods so as to avoid delay. In the regions where the t'ang-hsin system exists as before, the local officials /t'u kuan/ should be asked to pick out honest Miao to be given the responsibility of delivering messages after being questioned, to be paid wages and rations from unallotted funds, according to the scale for t'un soldiers. When officials traveling on official business need servants, then order the said Miao to serve, and pay them wages according to recommendations memorialized.” ' <sup id="cite_ref-1071" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1071">[1,071]</a></sup> 'According to the despatch quoted above the Miao officials, although they were military officers such as the native shou-pei and ch'ien-tsung, aside from their jurisdiction over the Miao soldiers, were also given considerable authority in Miao civilian affairs. In the tenth year of Chia Ch'ing /1805/ 107 the t'un land within the Miao area were placed under the control of Miao officials. Article 8 of Pu Fu T'un t'ien Chang-ch'eng /The Ministry's Reply concerning Regulations about the T'un Land/ states: “It would seem that after the Miao rebels were pacified in the present year in the various localities of Yung-sui, [Page 155] 107 cont. the Miao were greatly impressed by the strength of the Imperial army and surrendered land previously forcefully occupied by them. Also it would seem that if there was property of refractory Miao; it was confiscated. The fields were distributed among the law-abiding Miao to plant and pay rent, so that a Miao army could be raised and supported. Now the usurped land surrendered in the various villages totals more than 30,100 mu, and the land confiscated from the property of the rebel Miao totals more than 5,040 mu. These are now being separately registered, distributed for tilling for rent, and the revenues derived therefrom should be able to support 5,000 Miao soldiers. Among the 9,900 native Miao soldiers discharged over time and remaining, those able to bring up a plan to make a living have been sent back to their villages, and those who are old, weak, and poor have been given fields to till. Now 5,000 strong and healthy Miao soldiers have been selected, 2,000 of whom come from Feng-huang sub-prefecture; 800, from Kan-chou sub-prefecture; 1,800 from Yung-sui sub-prefecture; 100, from Ku-chang-p'ing sub-prefecture; and 300, from Pao-ching hsien. To collect the grain given over as rent, the Miao petty officers have selected in the various villages spots for building granaries to store away the public grain. Two or three honest Miao officers are chosen for each granary to supervise receipts and disbursements of the grain. The said 35,000 mu of arable land is estimated to be capable of yielding more than 22,000 shih of seeds of grain. It is estimated that there remain in various Miao granaries about 40 shih of seeds of grain, which will be used to fill the need for rations for the Miao soldiers in the intercalary month. The Miao officers are still ordered to report the actual receipts of rent grain every year.” ' <sup id="cite_ref-1072" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1072">[1,072]</a></sup> Ling et al describe the appointment of Hmong petty officials in that time period: 'Thus a Miao official was a military official having concurrent judicial and financial duties, whose power actually was equivalent to that of a t'u-szu /headman/. The only difference was that the position was not hereditary. As for the procedure of appointment, according to a reply from the Board of War in the twenty-eighth year of Tao Kuang /1848/, Miao Pei P'ieh Chi Ta /?/ Chang-ch'eng /Regulations concerning the Commissioning of Petty Officers of Miao Defense/, it is stated: “The 486 Miao officers in the five sub-prefectures and hsien of Ku-chang-p'ing, consisting of shou-pei, ch'ien-tsung, pa-tsung, and wai-wei, were recommended by the sub-prefectures and hsien to Ch'en-yüan tao for approval, and then commissioned with official seals by the governor-general, governor, and provincial commander-in-chief. According to the regulations for the promotion of Miao t'un officers, a pa-tsung is considered by the tao and then appointed by the Board; the wai-wei is appointed directly by the tao, and when the pa-tsung becomes due for promotion to ch'ien-tsung, his commission must be confirmed by the governor-general and governor, and when the ch'ien-tsung is promoted to shou-pei, his record must be examined by the commander-in-chief. Today, in the appointment of Miao petty officers, even wai-wei have to be commissioned by the governor-general and governor, hence there is a great deal of red tape involved. It is recommended that the Miao defense petty officers can be selected according to the regulations governing the t'un petty officers of the tao troups /piao, “banner”/. Hereafter the Miao wai-wei and pa-tsung are to be changed to be appointed by the tao, the Miao ch'ien-tsung to be appointed by the provincial governor with official seal, and the shou-pei to be appointed by the governor-general. The Board of War has found that the previous procedure of appointing Miao officials, through joint deliberation of the provincial governor general, governor, and commander-in-chief is 108 too involved, [Page 157] 108 cont. and in order to simplify it the recommendations in the memorial of the said governor-general should be followed.” From this it may be seen that in the beginning, the appointment of a Miao official was regarded as a serious matter. A petty officer such as a wai wei had to be commissioned by the governor-general and governor.' <sup id="cite_ref-1073" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1073">[1,073]</a></sup> Administrative organization differed somewhat between the individual districts: 'With regard to the organization of Miao officials at that time, it differed somewhat in the five hsien and sub-prefectures of the Miao region. Feng-huang sub-prefecture had four ying /battalions/: the middle ying's two Miao shou-pei /second captains/, four ch'ien-tsung /lieutenants/, six pa-tsung /sergeants/, and 20 wai wei /corporals/ were in charge of 96 villagers, totaling 2,680 families, consisting of 6,230 men and 3,479 women.

Furthermore, since the Miao dreaded seeing Chinese officials, then the Miao shou-pei, ch'ien-tsung, pa-tsung, and wai-wei were set up with the responsibility of controlling the Miao. In cases when the Miao were involved in such affairs as fights or theft, these petty officers were charged with the responsibility of apprehending the offenders. For the official despatches to be sent it was necessary to rely on them to get the messengers, and the pressing for rents and grain were also under the Miao officials' control. Moreover, the Miao petty officials were asked to submit seasonal affidavits as to whether there were Chinese entering the Miao villages.' <sup id="cite_ref-1080" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1080">[1,080]</a></sup> 'The policy of having Miao officials to govern the Miao has been in practice now for 140 years. At the time of the original separation of the execution and administrative functions between the Chinese and the Miao, the idea of Miao regulating the Miao could be said to have been aimed at the abuses of the time. But now after a hundred and some tens of years, the Miao have gradually been sinicized. Formerly, there was the difference between the civilized and uncivilized Miao, but today they have all become civilized. The policy of separate administration for the Miao and the Chinese has been informally discarded. Consequently, the regulations for Miao officials should be abolished. But, since the Republic, the Miao officials are still able to exist, largely because Chinese officials have been profiting by taking brides for filling official posts. On the other hand, since the Miao officials get their positions through paying bribes, they go to great lengths to make extortions from the Miao people. The Miao people detest the Miao petty officials more than they do the Chinese officials. Moreover, today, the various hsien in the Miao area have been changed to the system of hsiang /villages/ and chen /towns/, each governed by a head, known as hsiang chang or chen chang, respectively. In view of this change, Miao officials have become superfluous. It is hoped that the authorities in the region will be able to do away with them soon.' <sup id="cite_ref-1081" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1081">[1,081]</a></sup> Ling et al describe the development of the t'un system: 'During the Ts'ung Cheng reign period /1628/ /the end of the Ming dynasty/, the Miao rebelled, demolishing the guard stations and leveling the border wall. The “Great Wall” to blockade Miao country disappeared. The 7,800 guard troops /shou ping/ in the Miao area of the Ming dynasty were reduced to 1,600 men at the beginning of the Ch'ing dynasty. When the rebellion of Wu San-kwei was pacified and all was peaceful again, there was another reduction of 500 men, leaving 1,100 men. Military strengh was slight and the defense system was relaxed. Further, following the change from native headmen to Chinese officials, and the use of Chinese as the head of every hundred families, intercourse between the Chinese and the Miao was no longer prohibited. In the twenty-ninth year of Ch'ien Lung /i.e. 1764/, in view of the Miao having undergone acculturation for a long time, they were allowed to intermarry with the Chinese. The original idea was to change the Miao by teaching, but with the passing of time evils developed, when rapacious Chinese under the pretext of trade entered the Miao area and seduced crafty Miao to enter into thievery. Unlike soldiers they entered Miao country for personal reasons and mistreated the Miao. The Miao made a pretext of these guest men's exploitations and encroachments on their land and banded together to make trouble, and brought about the great rebellion during the Ch'ien Lung /1736-95/ and Chia Ch'ing /1796-1820/ reign periods. After the rebellion was put down, the Manchu court realized that the time was yet inopportune to change the Miao by teaching, and the blockade policy was once more used. The various hsiens along the Miao border were heavily garrisoned for protection.' <sup id="cite_ref-1082" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1082">[1,082]</a></sup> 'At that time in addition to stationing heavy complements of soldiers in the Miao area, there were also put up a total of 1,121 stone guard houses /tiao ch'ia/ along the ruins of the wall left from the Ming dynasty. In addition to the stationing of government troops at important positions, there were more than 800 of these guard houses where 9,000 soldiers were left to protect the border. Later when the nation became short of money, it was not possible to maintain large forces in this deep interior area for defense. Thus, suddenly, the frontier guards were withdrawn, then the stone guard houses became [Page 170] 115 cont. empty, and there was fear that the fierce Miao would start a rebellion. At this time Fu Nai of Yüan-ch'en tao met with Brigade General Fu Chih-na of Chen-kan Chen and summoned together people of the sub-prefecture to discuss a long-range plan. And so they began the t'un system of defense. Fields were allotted to feed the fighters and to defend the guard houses against the Miao. As for the people's /i.e. Chinese/ land, except for fields for sustenance, a male could retain three tou of grain, a woman one tou. As for the rest of the land seven were allotted while three were retained, for one shih of grain three tou was personally retained, and seven tou given up for allotment, to feed the fighters and guard the frontier. In the Feng-huang area there were more than 830 stone guard houses, requiring 4,000 men to man them in rotation. Further, 1,000 men were trained to be combat ready. The more than 22,000 mu of land allotted were not enough to meet the expense, and so another allotment of more than 12,300 mu at Lu-ch'i and Mo-yang was made. There were also 127 stone petty military stations /tiao pao/ at Kan-chou, manned by 800 soldiers, supported by more than 2,170 mu of allotted land. The original sect of government of Yung-sui, before the Miao rebellion during the reign period of Ch'ien Lung and Chia Ch'ing, was at Wei-ch'eng, which was entirely surrounded by the Miao. In the second year of Chia Ch'ing /1797/, the seat of government was moved to Hua-yüan with a newly built yamen. There were 126 stone guard houses with 2,000 soldiers. The people's land, i.e. Chinese land, usurped by rebels and recovered for public use, totaled more than 17,110 mu. There were over 70 stone military stations /tiao pao/, at Pao-ching, with 300 soldiers and over 2,170 mu of allotted land. There were only 18 stone guard houses at Ku-chang-p'ing with a hundred soldiers and over 120 mu of allotted land.' <sup id="cite_ref-1083" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1083">[1,083]</a></sup> 'The above refers to Chinese t'un /min t'un/. In addition, there were also Miao t'un. After the suppression of the Miao rebellion, the Miao tribes, awed by military might, surrendered all the Chinese land formerly forcefully usurped by them, and [Page 171] 115 cont. also searched into the properties of the rebel Miao and decided to return them for public use. The forcefully usurped land totaling over 30,100 mu and the rebels' properties totaling over 5,400 mu were redistributed among the law-abiding Miao to farm. Granaries were built to collect rent /tsu/ for the maintenance of Miao soldiers. The pressing for rent, the inspecting of fields, the distribution and transportation of grain, and other duties were all the responsibility of Miao officials.' <sup id="cite_ref-1084" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1084">[1,084]</a></sup> 'The total of the above fields and land is 131,640.6 mu. In the thirteenth year of Chia Ch'ing /1808/ a total of 15,219.3 mu of fields and land was surveyed in the three hsien, Feng-huang, Kan-chou, and Yung-sui. In the sixteenth year of Chia Ch'ing /1811/ another total of 5,873.2 mu of fields and land was surveyed, totaling 152,157.1 mu of fields and land. Of this besides the land allocated to the army for horses and farming, land lost through floods and erosion, and also the land used for stone guard houses and surroundings, totaling 11,084.3 mu, and another 37,849 mu distributed among the t'un able-bodied males, leaders, the aged, and the young, there remained 103,223.8 mu. Farmers were recruited to farm this land and rent /in kind/ collected. The annual receipt in grain totaled 105,488 shih, three tou, and nine sheng.' <sup id="cite_ref-1085" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1085">[1,085]</a></sup> 'The t'un fields in the Miao frontier were divided into people's /i.e. Chinese/ t'uns and Miao t'uns, the two being entirely different in nature. The t'un males working on the Chinese t'uns were also divided into t'un men and fighting men. The t'un men received fields to cultivate, and guarded the t'un guard houses. The fighting men, also called home guards, were solely trained for military operations, and did not farm. In the five sub-prefectures and hsiens of the Miao frontier there are 7,000 t'un men, from among whom are appointed hsiao-ch'i, tsung-ch'i, and pe-tsung to facilitate control. The distribution of fields was as follows: the men /san ting/ are each given 4.5 mu; the hsiao-ch'i, 5.5 mu; the tsung-ch'i, 6.5 mu; and the pe-tsung, 7.5 mu. There are 1,000 fighting men, each being given 3 shih, 6 tou of rice per year. The non-fighting men are also each given annually 10.8 liang of silver for salt and vegetables. The hsiao-ch'i receives each year 12 liang of silver; the tsung-ch'i, 13.2 liang of silver; the pe-tsung, 16.8 liang of silver. Therefore, in the Chinese t'un, the fields and land left over after the t'un men have received their fields to plant and care for are leased out for the collection of rent. Granaries (Illus. 57) have been built to store the grain, and general t'un leaders are set up to manage these matters. There are no t'un men in the Miao t'uns, and the t'un fields are allotted to people to cultivate /Illus. 57 and 58 on pages 124 and 125/ 126 for the collection of rent, in order to feed the Miao soldiers, under the control of the Miao officials. The t'un fields in the Miao frontier region, at the inception of the system, totaled 150,000 mu of arable land, of which barely a third was directly cultivated by t'un personnel, the rest being allotted out as rented fields. Today, the t'un army in the Miao frontier region is about 1,000 strong. The maintainance of the Black Flag Battalion of the Miao troops (Illus. 58) largely comes from the rented fields. T'un fields were set up to support troops on the spot as a defense against the Miao. Today, the Miao have been largely acculturated by the Chinese and the boundary line between the Miao and the Chinese is gradually becoming [Page 183] 124 [Page 185] 126 cont. obliterated. There is no longer the need for this kind of system of t'un defense against the Miao. In fact, unrest in the Miao area today is often due to the maladministration of the t'un fields system. The Miao petty officers and the t'un leaders often are oppressive in collecting rent and sometimes are corrupt in their methods, thus causing dissatisfaction and disturbances. In the twenty-sixth year of the Republic /1937/ the Miao rebellion in western Hunan arose because of the t'un land system. It resulted in the burning of t'un granaries and killing of t'un officers. Although the rebellion was pacified only after bloody and expensive campaigns, it is imperative to change the t'un and enter the newly opened or reclaimed land as available for taxation, so as to reach a fundamental solution.' <sup id="cite_ref-1086" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1086">[1,086]</a></sup> Rents/tax payments were reduced in response to natural desasters. Ling et al describe the amounts due: 'The Miao frontier region is mountainous and lacking in fields. For the most part they develop mountain slopes, building up terraced fields for the cultivation of rice grown in [Page 174] 118 cont. flooded fields. Whenever the terraced fields are damaged by flood and erosion when mountain streams flood, the damage is often beyond repair, resulting in a decrease of rent year by year. Furthermore, the government has several times decreed a reduction of rent, so that the current rent rate is only one-half of the original. Successive rent reductions undergone were as follows: in the nineteenth year of Chia Ch'ing /1814/ a reduction of 5,500 shih was made; in the first year of Tao Kuang /1821/ a reduction of 20,770 shih was made; in the eighteenth year of Tao Kuang /1838/ after an investigation of fields destroyed by flood, a reduction of 282 shih, 7 tou, 7 sheng, 6 shuo was effected; in the twenty-eighth year of Tao Kuang /1848/ a reduction of 649 shih, 1 tou, 8 sheng, 1 ho. After the above reductions there remained a rent of 78,286 shih, 4 tou, 4 sheng, 4 ho, 6 shuo. In the twenty-ninth year of Tao Kuang /1849/ there was a further reduction amounting to 7,828 shih, 6 tou, 4 sheng, 4 ho, 4 shuo, resulting in the collection of 70,457 shih, 8 tou, 1 shuo of rent. It was ruled that no further reductions would be made. It was also ordered that for every 6 ho /of grain/ there would be collected 1 sheng, but below six ho nothing would be collected, thereby causing a loss of 352 shih, 3 tou, 1 sheng, 1 shuo. Since that year the annual rent has totaled 70,105 shih, 4 tou, 9 sheng. From the twenty-ninth year of Tao Kuang /1849/ to the end of the Ch'ing dynasty, after deducting 179 shih, 4 tou, 9 sheng of rent uncollectible due to flood and erosion, the net receipt of rent totaled 69,926 shih. From the first year of the Republic /1912/ to the sixteenth or seventeenth year, the reductions due to floods totaled 2,917 shih, 4 tou, 9 sheng, 2 ho. In the twenty-second year of the Republic /1933/, according to investigations made by the authors in western Hunan, the net rent was 67,008 shih, 5 tou, 8 ho. According to a statement in the Hsiang Hsi Miao Ch'ü T'un Fang Chün T'un T'ien T'u Yen Ke /Successive Changes in Land Allotted to Defensive T'un in the Miao Area West of the Hsiang River/, recently published [Page 175] 118 cont. by Yü Fan-ch'uan: “The decision of the first conference on t'un matters held in the twenty-fifth year of the Republic /1936/ was to reduce the rental on devastated land 1, 592 shih, 3 tou, 8 sheng, 8 ho. Currently, the actual receipt of rent is 65, 416 shih, 1 tou, 2 sheng.” ' <sup id="cite_ref-1087" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1087">[1,087]</a></sup> Given the presence of Hmong petty officials, the rents paid to the Chinese administration should be considered taxes rather than tribute.

<p><b>♠ Degree of taxation ♣ present ♥</b> eHRAF provides a general description of the history of the region: 'Chinese scholarship links the present-day Miao to tribal confederations that moved southward some 2,000 years ago from the plain between the Yellow River and the Yangtze toward the Dongting Lake area. These became the San Miao mentioned in Han dynasty texts. Over the next thousand years, between the Han and the Song dynasties, these presumed ancestors of the Miao continued to migrate westward and southward, under pressure from expanding Han populations and the imperial armies. Chinese texts and Miao oral history establish that over those years the ancestors settled in western Hunan and Guizhou, with some moving south into Guangxi or west along the Wu River to southeastern Sichuan and into Yunnan. The period was marked by a number of uprisings and battles between Miao and the Han or local indigenous groups, recalled in the oral histories of local groups. Though the term "Miao" was sometimes used in Tang and Song histories, the more usual term was "Man," meaning "barbarians." Migration continued through the Yuan, Ming, and early Qing, with some groups moving into mainland Southeast Asia. The retreat from Han control brought some into territories controlled by the Yi in northeast Yunnan/northwest Guizhou. The various migrations can also be seen as "vertical" migrations into the undeveloped hillside and mountain areas that were of lesser interest to Han. Depending on the terrain, the settled farming cited in Miao historical myths gave way to shifting slash-and-burn agriculture, facilitated by the introduction of the Irish potato and maize in the sixteenth century, and the adoption of high-altitude/cool-weather crops like barley, buckwheat, and oats. Farming was supplemented by forest hunting, fishing, gathering, and pastoralism. During the Qing, uprisings and military encounters escalated. There were major disturbances in western Hunan (1795-1806) and a continuous series of rebellions in Guizhou (1854-1872). Chinese policies toward the Miao shifted among assimilation, containment in "stockaded villages," dispersal, removal, and extermination. The frequent threat of "Miao rebellion" caused considerable anxiety to the state; in actuality, many of these uprisings included Bouyei, Dong, Hui, and other ethnic groups, including Han settlers and demobilized soldiers. At issue were heavy taxation, rising landlordism, rivalries over local resources, and official corruption. One of the last Miao uprisings occurred in 1936 in western Hunan in opposition to Guomindang (Republican) continuation of the tuntian   system, which forced the peasants to open up new lands and grow crops for the state.' <sup id="cite_ref-1088" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1088">[1,088]</a></sup> 'From Song on, in periods of relative peace, government control was exercised through the tusi   system of indirect rule by appointed native headmen who collected taxes, organized corvée, and kept the peace. Miao filled this role in Hunan and eastern Guizhou, but farther west the rulers were often drawn from a hereditary Yi nobility, a system that lasted into the twentieth century. In Guizhou, some tusi   claimed Han ancestry, but were probably drawn from the ranks of assimilated Bouyei, Dong, and Miao. Government documents refer to the "Sheng Miao" (raw Miao), meaning those living in areas beyond government control and not paying taxes or labor service to the state. In the sixteenth century, in the more pacified areas, the implementation of the policy of gaitu guiliu   began the replacement of native rulers with regular civilian and military officials, a few of whom were drawn from assimilated minority families. Land became a commodity, creating both landlords and some freeholding peasants in the areas affected. In the Yunnan-Guizhou border area, the tusi   system continued and Miao purchase of land and participation in local markets was restricted by law until the Republican period (1911-1949).' <sup id="cite_ref-1089" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1089">[1,089]</a></sup> The region has a long history of Chinese military intervention: 'The two regions referred to above can be demarcated by the ruins of the boundary wall erected under the Ming dynasty. Miao Fang-pei Lan, Shu Wang Lu /Detailed Old Records from the M.F.L./, states: “In the forty-third year of the Wan Li reign period (1615 A.D.) the Ping-pei Ts'an-cheng /Administrative Officer of Military Preparedness/ at Ch'en and Yüan rivers, Ts'ai Fu-i, reported that because the garrison outposts were so scattered and the Miao roads so rugged, it was difficult to defend against Miao incursions. He requested the appropriation of some 40,000 in gold currency for the erection of an earth wall, from T'ung-jen down to Pao-ch'ing, winding along the mountains and the streams for more than 300 li. Thus the border was made relatively secure. Again, during the second year of T'ien Chi (1622 A.D.), the assistant commissioner of the circuit of the garrison at Ch'en and Yüan rivers, Hu I-hung ordered Teng Tsuyü, a guerrila commander, to add another 60 li of wall from Chen-ch'i-so to Hsi-ch'üeh-ying.” The ruins of this wall start from Wang-hui-ying and T'ing-tzu-kuan in the southeast corner of the Miao area and proceeds northeast, ending at Hsi-ch'üeh-ying, dividing the Miao area into the southeast and the northwest regions. The building of the boundary wall under the Ming dynasty was not intentionally based on the topography but rather in accordance with the limits of Chinese colonization in the Miao area. The Chinese first occupied the region where the rivers flowed down in the southeast, and the Miao retreated to the La-erh plateau, defending themselves behind its natural advantages. The Chinese and the Miao were already divided according to topography (Illus. 2, 8) some 300 years ago. The frontier wall of that time, although serving as a boundary line between the Chinese and the Miao, became at the same time a [Page 54] 30 cont. line of demarcation between the two natural regions. So today the actual area of the Miao is northwest of the boundary wall, limited to the La-erh plateau. Although the Miao area is not a barren wilderness, the area is small and densely populated, with a high birth rate leading to population pressure, which has led the Miao to invade the southeastern region. Therefore, whenever there is a Miao rebellion, the whole area /Illus. 7 on p. 31/ 32 is occupied by them. The territorial limits designated by Yen Ju-yü as the Miao area is not entirely without reason. The Miao regard this area as their native land, and they seldom exceed its limits even in time of strife.' <sup id="cite_ref-1090" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1090">[1,090]</a></sup> 'The development of the Miao area began during the time of the juncture of the Yuan dynasty and the Ming. The geographical section of the Ming Shih /History of the Ming Dynasty/ states: “A ch'ang kuan szu /a native leader set up by the Chinese government to head the district/ was established at Wu-chai during the Yuan dynasty, and in the sixth month of the seventh year of Hung Wu /1374, during the first reign period of the Ming dynasty/ the office was continued. A ch'ang kuan szu was set up at Kan-tzu-p'ing in the sixth month of the year chia ch'en of the first Ming emperor /1359/, at the headquarters of the commander-in-chief at Kan-tzu-p'ing. Later it was abolished. In the seventh month of the third year of the Yung Lo /1405/, it was reestablished.” Furthermore, the entry for Headman Hu Kuang in the “T'u szu Lieh Chuan” /Biographies of Headmen/ states: “In the third year of Yung Lo, Kung Neng and others at the Ch'en-chou military station summoned Liao Piao and others of the uncivilized Miao /i. e. those not under Chinese control/ from 35 villages of Kan-tzu-p'ing to send sons to pay tribute, and for this reason a ch'ang kuan szu was set up for Kan-tzu-p'ing, with Piao to be the official, under the jurisdiction of Pao-ching.” The city of the ch'ang kuan szu of Wu-chai was the present chief city of Feng-huang hsien, but that of Kan-tzu-p'ing was also within Feng-huang, situated 70 li northeast of the chief town of the hsien. In Vol. 3 of the revised edition of Feng-huang T'ing Chih, published in the fourth year of Tao Kuang /1824/, it says: “The old city of the ch'ang kuan szu of Kan-tzu-p'ing was situated 70 li northeast of the T'ing. In the first year of the first Ming emperor /1368/, a yüan-shuai-fu /commander-in-chief's post/ was set up. In the third year of Yung Lo /i. e.

The old city of the Wu-chai ch'ang kuan szu is the present seat of the T'ing /i.e. Feng-huang sub-prefecture/ administration, but it has been greatly expanded.

The “Shu Wang P'ien” /historical section/ of the Miao Fang Pei Lan states: “In the second month of the thirtieth year of Hung Wu /1397/ there was set up at Chen-ch'i a military and civilian ch'ien hu bureau. Sun Ying-lung, who was then keeper of the records at Lu-ch'i, proclaimed that the tribal people of the upper five tu /hsien subdivisions/ should be divided into ten li /neighborhoods/, to be under the jurisdiction of Ch'en-chou. Ying-lung was promoted by imperial mandate to be in charge of the pacification. He selected the head ch'ien hu in charge of the ch'ien hu bureau at Chien-ch'ang, Kiangsi, to go to the capital to be given a bronze seal and given the hereditary office of ch'ien hu of Chen-ch'i. When the emperor went to the pavilion to send him on his way, he proclaimed: ‘I have a single pellet of Miao territory, and I ask you to go ahead to open up headquarters for bringing the barbarians under our administration. Do what is good for them, and your descendants will enjoy the use /of the office/ without limit.’ Moreover, he ordered the Board of War to select Ch'en Ya of Wu-sa military station in Kweichow and Sung Kuei of Lu-chou military station in Szechwan to be assistnat ch'ien hu to go with him to assist him. He ordered the Board of Civil Office to select a head constable, and the provincial treasurer to allot for district police officers, who were granted, wrapped up an ivory tablet, paper money, and a silver belt, and entertained ceremoniously, and sent on their way. In the fifth [Page 150] 104 cont. month Tuan Wen reached Chen-ch'i, established the Military Station Office, and inaugurated the system, dividing 124 native villages into ten li, making Yang Erh, the main leader, a pe fu ch'ang /head of hundred men/. The other 132 villages 105 became a local army ‘to protect the city moats.’ When there were uprisings then they would be called to service; when conditions were peaceful then they would disperse as civilians.

But because of using an administrative policy of blockade against Miao country, the 270 years under the Ming [Page 166] 113 cont. did not witness serious trouble. The method of this blockade consisted of setting up stone guard posts /tiao-pao/, establishing guard stations /ying shao/, and building border walls, strictly demarcating the boundary between the Chinese and Miao areas, without allowing any infringement by one on the other. The section on government in the historical section of Miao Fang Pei Lan, recording the system of defense against the Miao during the Ming dynasty, has this to say: “During the fifth year of Hsüan Te i.e. 1430, the senior official /chang kuan/ at Kan-tzu-p'ing, Wu Pi-lang, and the Miao of Tung-jen, Kweichow, started a rebellion. The brigadier general /tsung ping kuan/, Hsiao Shou, built 24 guard posts /pao/ around the area to protect it. In the thirty-first year of Chia Ching i.e. 1552, the Miao in Hupeh-Hunan and Kweichow were pacified. The Court sent Governor General Chang Yo to hold down Yüanchou. Yo in consultation with Assistant Commissioner /fu shih/ Kao Hsien, and Lieutenant Colonel /ts'an chiang/ Sun Hsien drew up a plan to abolish the guard posts at Wan-chi. Then he built 12 outposts /shao/ called: Wu-chai, Yung-an, Ch'ing-ch'i, Ho-k'ou, Kan-tzu, Kan-chou, Ch'iang-hu, Shih-yang, Shao-p'o, Tung-hsin, Shui-t'ang-yao, Shui-t'ien-ying, which with that at Chen-ch'i-so came to 13 in all. Every guard station had a wall, a tower, a drill yard, a narrow gate, an office, and a community storehouse /she ts'ang/. The officer corps included a tu-pei /“head of senior soldiers”/, ling-pan /“section leader”/, ling-tui /“company leader”/, ling-cheng /“recruitment and arms officer?”/, kuan-piao /“keeper of banners”/, kuan-ts'ang /“keeper of the storehouse”/, and li-mu /“head constable and keeper of the jail”/. The local official had under him t'ou-mu /“headmen”/, she-jen /“official secretaries”/, shih-tzu /“readers”/, chien-pu /“strong walkers”/, ta-shou /?lit., “move the hands”/ hsiang-t'u /?lit., geographers”/, po-k'ai /heralds/, and the Ch'i Miao soldiers. In all the officers and men totaled 6, 000 or more, commanded by a lieutenant colonel /ts'an-chiang piao ying/, with a second [Page 167] 113 cont. captain /shou-pei/ assisting him. Moreover, at the two military stations /wei/ of Ch'en and Yüan, the frontier guard officers and men, amounted to 6,600 or more, and the annual disbursement to the Yüan-chou treasury for paying the troops was more than 30,089 /sic/ liang of silver, that to the Ma-yang, Ch'ienyang, and Kan-chou military rations granaries and the autumn government rations at Chen-ch'i-so were 31,890 or more. At this time, the lieutenant colonel /tsan-chiang Tu-ling/ directed matters at the top, the majors /yu-chi/ and second captains /shou-pei/ attended to things at the middle level, and the guard stations /ying-shao/ carried out defense duties at the lower level. Furthermore, fearing the difficulty of communications in times of trouble, it was arranged for the sake of convenience as follows: ‘For operations involving under 3,000 men, decisions may be made on the spot, but for operations involving more than 3,000 men, the decision must be made after consultation with the military defense officials. As the number of soldiers increased and generals became more strong, the border regions became more quiet and peaceful. In the forty-third year Wan Li /i.e. 1615/, the Military Defense Ts'an Cheng, Ts'ai Fu-i, because the guard stations being spread out and the Miao roads rugged, it was difficult to prevent spying, applied for an appropriation of 40,000 or more gold for the construction of a frontier earth wall, starting from T'ung-jen and going down to Pao-ching guard station, along mountains and extending in all more than 300 li, so that frontier defense could be made somewhat more 114 secure. In the second year of T'ien Ch'i /i.e. 1622/, a provincial governor was set up at P'ien-yüan…. The then pei tao fu shih /assistant commissioner of defense?/ Hu I-hung at Ch'en Yüan despatched Major Teng Tsu-yü from Chen-ch'i-so to Hsi-ch'üeh-ying to build an additional 60 more li of frontier wall.”' <sup id="cite_ref-1096" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1096">[1,096]</a></sup> In the Qing period, Hmong migrations occurred after a number of failed rebellions, affecting the geographical distribution of individual Hmong sub-groups: 'The pure Miao tribe in Kweichow is further divided into five subgroups, the Hung Miao, the He Miao, the Pe Miao, the Ch'ing Miao, and the Hua Miao. The geographical distribution of the Hung Miao is along the eastern part of Kweichow bordering Hunan and the vicinity of T'ung-jen is the center. The He Miao are spread over a wide area in southeastern Kweichow, including such hisen as Tu-yün, Pa-chai, Tan-chiang, Yung-chiang, Yung-ts'ung, Li-p'ing, Chien-ho, T'ai-kung, Chen-yüan, Shih-ping, Huang-p'ing, Lu-shan, etc. It lies in the region south of the Hunan-Kweichow highway and east of the Kwangsi-Kweichow highway. The Pe Miao are found in the central part of Kweichow, starting in the east at Kwei-ting and Lung-li, passing through Kwei-chu, Hsiu-wen, and Ch'ien-hsi, and reaching Chih-chin and Lang-tai in the west. The Ch'ing Miao are also found in central Kweichow, principally in the vicinity of Kuei-yang, but also at Hsiu-wen, Ch'ing-chen, Ch'ien-hsi, and Chen-ning. The distribution of Hua Miao is the most extensive, starting from the vicinity of Kuei-yang, scattering over the northern and northwestern parts of Kweichow province in K'ai-yang, Jen-huai, Chih-chin, Lang-tai, Shui-ch'eng, and An-shun hsiens.' <sup id="cite_ref-1097" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1097">[1,097]</a></sup> 'Owing to repeated military attacks during the Yüan and Ming periods, many of the Miao tribes in Kweichow moved outward. The Hung Miao who lived in the vicinity of Tung-jen in eastern Kweichow moved eastward to the three sub-prefectures /t'ing/ of western Hunan. During the four rebellions in the Ch'ing dynasty, in 1698, 1732, 1794, and 1855, when armies were used to put them down, the Miao fled in all [Page 34] 18 cont. directions, which led to the mass migration of Miao tribes in modern times. The He Miao gradually migrated to Hunan and Kwangsi. The Pe Miao moved from the northwest to Szechwan and Yunnan. The Hua Miao moved through An-shun in the west to the eastern part of Yunnan and north to Wu-ting and along the banks of the Chin-sha-chiang River, and again through the southeastern part of Yunnan to the north of Tonkin in Indochina. The Ch'ing Miao dispersed in all directions in the three provinces of Hunan, Kwangsi, and Yunnan. The foregoing relates to the major migratory trends of the Miao, but actually in the interior of Hunan, Kwangsi, Szechwan, and Yunnan several Miao subgroups are often found in one area. The writers found three subgroups at Meng-tzu, Yunnan, the Pe Miao, the Hua Miao, and the Ch'ing Miao, but the last two were not easily distinguishable from their dress. Furthermore, several groups inhabiting the same area are likely to intermarry so that after a considerable length of time has passed, it is difficult to distinguish between them.' <sup id="cite_ref-1098" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1098">[1,098]</a></sup> 'Topography. (Illus. 2). - Topographically, the Miao area may be divided into two natural regions. The northwestern section can be called the La-erh plateau region; the southeastern section is the region where the rivers flow down. Although the plateau rises about 700 kung ch'ih above sea level, on it there are a great many small basins, with many springs and ponds good for irrigation. The Miao call such small basins p'ing /a plain/, t'ang /a pond/, or ch'ung. The best known among these is the Pao-mu-ying-p'ing, about 70 li north 30 of Feng-huang-ch'eng /city/. Surrounded by mountains, this level area measures five to six li in length and three to four li in width and has seven or eight spring-fed ponds, supplying ample drinking water. It is the largest basin on the plateau. Ya-pao-chai (Illus. 7), situated in the Ya-pao-shan mountains, about 93 li north of Feng-huang-ch'eng, is very high and cold. It has several fish ponds and produces rough rice and yams. In 1795, when the Miao revolted, the headman, Wu Lung-teng, whose family had lived there for generations, was entrenched there. The above two places are the largest among the basins on the plateau. There are countless small basins /p'ing and ch'ung/. There are numerous wells and springs in the mountains, wells being found even on the peaks. The “Yao K'ao” section of the Miao Fang-pei Lan states: “Fifty li southwest outside the city is Ma-an Shan /“Horse Saddle Mountain”/, which is about eight or nine li in height, is very steep, and resembles a horse saddle in shape. On top of the mountain there is a well that never goes dry. On the mountain there are pockets where there are irrigated rice fields. It is a strategic point for the uncivilized Miao to defend.” The La-erh plateau is dotted with Miao villages and settlements because of its level places /p'ing/ and wells and springs, and there the Miao people thrive.' <sup id="cite_ref-1099" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1099">[1,099]</a></sup> Imperial control shiftend from indirect rule to government by appointed Chinese officials before a mixed system was established after a Hmong rebellion: 'After the five hsien in the Miao frontier region were opened, from the Yuan and Ming dynasties to the beginning of the Ch'ing dynasty, they were under the control of native headmen. During the K'ang Hsi reign period of the early Ch'ing /1662-1722/, a gradual change was begun from native headmen to regular government officials. In the forty-sixth year of K'ang Hsi /1707/, the senior official /ch'ang kuan szu/ at Wu-chai, T'ien Hung-t'ien, being harsh and cruel, the provincial governor, Chao Shen-ch'iao, sent up a memorial [Page 151] 105 cont. to the Emperor requesting that he be dismissed from office and that no hereditary substitute be allowed. In the forty-eighth year /1709/, because the Miao at Liu-li of the Chen-ch'i Office did not wish to be under the control of the native headman at Pao-ching, they repeatedly requested the change from native headman to government official, and the provincial governor, Chao Shen-ch'iao, again sent up a memorial requesting transference of control to the government. In the fourth year of Yung Cheng /1726/, the headman at Pao-ching, P'eng, Yü-pin, was removed from office for being avaricious and cruel, and in the fifth year the change was made from native headman to government official. Yü-pin was peacefully settled at Liao-yang. In the fifth year of Yung Cheng, the headman at Yung-shun, P'eng Chao-huai, personally applied for the change from native headman to government official. He returned to his native place in Chi-shui, Kiangsi. San-t'u-chou /“three local chou”/ and Wu-ch'ang-kuan-szu /“five senior officials”/ under the jurisdiction of the headman of Yung-shun were also changed from native to government officials.' <sup id="cite_ref-1100" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1100">[1,100]</a></sup> 'After the voluntary change from the native headmen in the Miao frontier region, in each Miao village there was set up a local village chief over 100 families /i.e., a pe hu chai ch'ang, “100 families village chief”/, in order to govern the Miao and bring them under the administration of government officials. But the chiefs of the 100 families were not always Miao, sometimes Chinese being appointed to these positions. As time passed, gradually, there were rapacious, unscrupulous rogues, whose mistreatment caused disturbances, so that the unprecedented Miao rebellion took place during the sixtieth year of Ch'ien Lung /1795/. When the Miao rebellion was put down in the first year of Chia Ch'ing /1796/, it was found that the policy of governing the Miao with Chinese was wrong. The then governor-general of Hunan and Kwangtung, Pi Yüan, submitted a plan to govern the Miao with Miao. (6) The ministry's response to the memorial setting up regulations for Miao officials, Miao Chiang Chin-106 Yao Shan-Hou Shih I /Important Remedial Measures for the Miao Frontier Region/, has a passage, “Miao Chiang Pe Hu Chai Ch'ang Ming-Mu Ying Cho Liang Keng Ting /The Names of the Village Leaders of 100 Families Should be Decided after Due Deliberation/,” stating: “According to the memorial, in the three provinces of Szechwan, Kweichow, and Hupeh, such areas as Yu-yang and T'ung-jen were all previously governed by headmen, but following their application to be put under government officials, the administrative areas of chou, hsien, and ying [Page 153] 106 cont. were established, subject to the jurisdiction of civil and military authorities. In the Miao villages, there were established only village chiefs to govern a unit of 100 families. However, since Chinese were also permitted to fill these posts, gradually there were rapacious, unscrupulous rogues, whose mistreatment caused disturbances. It is requested that from among the Miao who have submitted, and on whom were conferred the peacock feather decoration /for merit, in early Ch'ing times/, there be selected some intelligent, aware persons, to be appointed at each ying /military station/ as native second captain /shoupei/, lieutenant /ch'ien-tsung/, and sergeant or corporal /wai-wei/, such positions to be filled through the governor-general and governor's /tu-wu/ yamen /tu-wu ya-men/ and to be subject to the control of the civil and military authorities. When the various t'ang hsin in the Miao area have official despatches to send, they can order the said native petty officers to select Miao to question and send, and also to give them some cash and rations. When officials traveling on official business require servants, they may also recruit them from the Miao, and pay them wages according to the Chinese scales. It would appear that the 100-families village chief was originally inaugurated to discipline the Miao, but these men were unimportant and their powers limited, as that the Miao did not heed them. Moreover, among the Chinese holding such positions there were rapacious, unscrupulous rogues, whose mistreatment led to disturbances. This should naturally be explained, deliberated, and changed, so as to fix responsibility. During the recent campaign those submissive Miao who accompanied the army and won peacock feather awards are numerous, therefore from these select those who are intelligent and aware, and who have the support of the rest, and according to the customary set-up of t'u-kuan /officials governing aboriginal tribes in West China/, every Ying should have one or two men to be native second captains, under whom there should be native lieutenants and sergeants, for better control of [Page 154] 106 cont. the Miao. Their number will depend upon the number of villages put under control, and they shall be appointed by the governor-general and governor's yamen and also be under the control of regional officials. If there are fights, robberies and thefts among the Miao these native officers will be asked to make the arrests. On their inspection tours, the governor-general and governor and military officials should examine the merits and demerits of these officers and reward or punish them accordingly to demonstrate justice, following the recommendations memorialized by Governor-general Ho Lin. When the t'ang-hsin system of communication in the Miao area has been abolished, official communications should be despatched according to old methods so as to avoid delay. In the regions where the t'ang-hsin system exists as before, the local officials /t'u kuan/ should be asked to pick out honest Miao to be given the responsibility of delivering messages after being questioned, to be paid wages and rations from unallotted funds, according to the scale for t'un soldiers. When officials traveling on official business need servants, then order the said Miao to serve, and pay them wages according to recommendations memorialized.” ' <sup id="cite_ref-1101" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1101">[1,101]</a></sup> 'According to the despatch quoted above the Miao officials, although they were military officers such as the native shou-pei and ch'ien-tsung, aside from their jurisdiction over the Miao soldiers, were also given considerable authority in Miao civilian affairs. In the tenth year of Chia Ch'ing /1805/ 107 the t'un land within the Miao area were placed under the control of Miao officials. Article 8 of Pu Fu T'un t'ien Chang-ch'eng /The Ministry's Reply concerning Regulations about the T'un Land/ states: “It would seem that after the Miao rebels were pacified in the present year in the various localities of Yung-sui, [Page 155] 107 cont. the Miao were greatly impressed by the strength of the Imperial army and surrendered land previously forcefully occupied by them. Also it would seem that if there was property of refractory Miao; it was confiscated. The fields were distributed among the law-abiding Miao to plant and pay rent, so that a Miao army could be raised and supported. Now the usurped land surrendered in the various villages totals more than 30,100 mu, and the land confiscated from the property of the rebel Miao totals more than 5,040 mu. These are now being separately registered, distributed for tilling for rent, and the revenues derived therefrom should be able to support 5,000 Miao soldiers. Among the 9,900 native Miao soldiers discharged over time and remaining, those able to bring up a plan to make a living have been sent back to their villages, and those who are old, weak, and poor have been given fields to till. Now 5,000 strong and healthy Miao soldiers have been selected, 2,000 of whom come from Feng-huang sub-prefecture; 800, from Kan-chou sub-prefecture; 1,800 from Yung-sui sub-prefecture; 100, from Ku-chang-p'ing sub-prefecture; and 300, from Pao-ching hsien. To collect the grain given over as rent, the Miao petty officers have selected in the various villages spots for building granaries to store away the public grain. Two or three honest Miao officers are chosen for each granary to supervise receipts and disbursements of the grain. The said 35,000 mu of arable land is estimated to be capable of yielding more than 22,000 shih of seeds of grain. It is estimated that there remain in various Miao granaries about 40 shih of seeds of grain, which will be used to fill the need for rations for the Miao soldiers in the intercalary month. The Miao officers are still ordered to report the actual receipts of rent grain every year.” ' <sup id="cite_ref-1102" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1102">[1,102]</a></sup> Ling et al describe the appointment of Hmong petty officials in that time period: 'Thus a Miao official was a military official having concurrent judicial and financial duties, whose power actually was equivalent to that of a t'u-szu /headman/. The only difference was that the position was not hereditary. As for the procedure of appointment, according to a reply from the Board of War in the twenty-eighth year of Tao Kuang /1848/, Miao Pei P'ieh Chi Ta /?/ Chang-ch'eng /Regulations concerning the Commissioning of Petty Officers of Miao Defense/, it is stated: “The 486 Miao officers in the five sub-prefectures and hsien of Ku-chang-p'ing, consisting of shou-pei, ch'ien-tsung, pa-tsung, and wai-wei, were recommended by the sub-prefectures and hsien to Ch'en-yüan tao for approval, and then commissioned with official seals by the governor-general, governor, and provincial commander-in-chief. According to the regulations for the promotion of Miao t'un officers, a pa-tsung is considered by the tao and then appointed by the Board; the wai-wei is appointed directly by the tao, and when the pa-tsung becomes due for promotion to ch'ien-tsung, his commission must be confirmed by the governor-general and governor, and when the ch'ien-tsung is promoted to shou-pei, his record must be examined by the commander-in-chief. Today, in the appointment of Miao petty officers, even wai-wei have to be commissioned by the governor-general and governor, hence there is a great deal of red tape involved. It is recommended that the Miao defense petty officers can be selected according to the regulations governing the t'un petty officers of the tao troups /piao, “banner”/. Hereafter the Miao wai-wei and pa-tsung are to be changed to be appointed by the tao, the Miao ch'ien-tsung to be appointed by the provincial governor with official seal, and the shou-pei to be appointed by the governor-general. The Board of War has found that the previous procedure of appointing Miao officials, through joint deliberation of the provincial governorgeneral, governor, and commander-in-chief is 108 too involved, [Page 157] 108 cont. and in order to simplify it the recommendations in the memorial of the said governor-general should be followed.” From this it may be seen that in the beginning, the appointment of a Miao official was regarded as a serious matter. A petty officer such as a wai wei had to be commissioned by the governor-general and governor.' <sup id="cite_ref-1103" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1103">[1,103]</a></sup> Administrative organization differed somewhat between the individual districts: 'With regard to the organization of Miao officials at that time, it differed somewhat in the five hsien and sub-prefectures of the Miao region.

The Upper Ninth Li 110 had one Miao shou-pei, three ch'ien-tsung, eight pa-tsung, 14 wai-wei, 32 fighting men, and a guard force of 138 men, governing 2, 337 families with 9, 413 men and women.

The Lower Tenth Li had one Miao shou-pei, three ch'ien-tsung, five pa-tsung, ten wai-wei, 18 fighting soldiers, and a guard force of 82 men, governing 843 families with 3, 600 men and women. The above 12 Miao shou-pei, 28 ch'ien-tsung, 57 pa-tsung, and 115 wai-wei were set up in the second year of Chia Ch'ing /1797/ when the 100-family system was abolished. These lower officials went back and forth, controlling the scattered Miao in the various li. The guard force of 1, 800 men was set up in the tenth year /1805/ and its men were retained from the Miao soldiers of the disbanded t'u t'ang /?/. The 384 fighting men were appointed in 1805 and picked from among the guard soldiers.' <sup id="cite_ref-1106" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1106">[1,106]</a></sup> 'The fourth, sixth, seventh, and eighth tu /subdivision of a hsien/ in Pao-ching each had a Miao shou-pei, nine ch'ien-tsung, 12 pa-tsung, 31 wai-wei, and 300 Miao soldiers.' <sup id="cite_ref-1107" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1107">[1,107]</a></sup> 'The Miao officials appointed a(■) Ku-chang-p'ing included one shou-pei, two ch'ien-tsung, four pa-tsung, 12 wai-wei, and 100 Miao soldiers, controlling 58 Miao villages.' <sup id="cite_ref-1108" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1108">[1,108]</a></sup> 'Regulations concerning Miao officials were set up in the second year of Chia Ch'ing (1797), and were still in existence when the authors were carrying out their investigations in the Miao area in 1933.

Furthermore, since the Miao dreaded seeing Chinese officials, then the Miao shou-pei, ch'ien-tsung, pa-tsung, and wai-wei were set up with the responsibility of controlling the Miao. In cases when the Miao were involved in such affairs as fights or theft, these petty officers were charged with the responsibility of apprehending the offenders. For the official despatches to be sent it was necessary to rely on them to get the messengers, and the pressing for rents and grain were also under the Miao officials' control. Moreover, the Miao petty officials were asked to submit seasonal affidavits as to whether there were Chinese entering the Miao villages.' <sup id="cite_ref-1110" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1110">[1,110]</a></sup> 'The policy of having Miao officials to govern the Miao has been in practice now for 140 years. At the time of the original separation of the execution and administrative functions between the Chinese and the Miao, the idea of Miao regulating the Miao could be said to have been aimed at the abuses of the time. But now after a hundred and some tens of years, the Miao have gradually been sinicized. Formerly, there was the difference between the civilized and uncivilized Miao, but today they have all become civilized. The policy of separate administration for the Miao and the Chinese has been informally discarded. Consequently, the regulations for Miao officials should be abolished. But, since the Republic, the Miao officials are still able to exist, largely because Chinese officials have been profiting by taking brides for filling official posts. On the other hand, since the Miao officials get their positions through paying bribes, they go to great lengths to make extortions from the Miao people. The Miao people detest the Miao petty officials more than they do the Chinese officials. Moreover, today, the various hsien in the Miao area have been changed to the system of hsiang /villages/ and chen /towns/, each governed by a head, known as hsiang chang or chen chang, respectively. In view of this change, Miao officials have become superfluous. It is hoped that the authorities in the region will be able to do away with them soon.' <sup id="cite_ref-1111" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1111">[1,111]</a></sup> Ling et al describe the development of the t'un system: 'During the Ts'ung Cheng reign period /1628/ /the end of the Ming dynasty/, the Miao rebelled, demolishing the guard stations and leveling the border wall. The “Great Wall” to blockade Miao country disappeared. The 7,800 guard troops /shou ping/ in the Miao area of the Ming dynasty were reduced to 1,600 men at the beginning of the Ch'ing dynasty. When the rebellion of Wu San-kwei was pacified and all was peaceful again, there was another reduction of 500 men, leaving 1,100 men. Military strength was slight and the defence system was relaxed. Further, following the change from native headmen to Chinese officials, and the use of Chinese as the head of every hundred families, intercourse between the Chinese and the Miao was no longer prohibited. In the twenty-ninth year of Ch'ien Lung /i.e. 1764/, in view of the Miao having undergone acculturation for a long time, they were allowed to intermarry with the Chinese. The original idea was to change the Miao by teaching, but with the passing of time evils developed, when rapacious Chinese under the pretext of trade entered the Miao area and seduced crafty Miao to enter into thievery. Unlike soldiers they entered Miao country for personal reasons and mistreated the Miao. The Miao made a pretext of these guest men's exploitations and encroachments on their land and banded together to make trouble, and brought about the great rebellion during the Ch'ien Lung /1736-95/ and Chia Ch'ing /1796-1820/ reign periods. After the rebellion was put down, the Manchu court realized that the time was yet inopportune to change the Miao by teaching, and the blockade policy was once more used. The various hsiens along the Miao border were heavily garrisoned for protection.' <sup id="cite_ref-1112" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1112">[1,112]</a></sup> 'At that time in addition to stationing heavy complements of soldiers in the Miao area, there were also put up a total of 1,121 stone guard houses /tiao ch'ia/ along the ruins of the wall left from the Ming dynasty. In addition to the stationing of government troops at important positions, there were more than 800 of these guard houses where 9,000 soldiers were left to protect the border. Later when the nation became short of money, it was not possible to maintain large forces in this deep interior area for defense. Thus, suddenly, the frontier guards were withdrawn, then the stone guard houses became [Page 170] 115 cont. empty, and there was fear that the fierce Miao would start a rebellion. At this time Fu Nai of Yüan-ch'en tao met with Brigade General Fu Chih-na of Chen-kan Chen and summoned together people of the sub-prefecture to discuss a long-range plan. And so they began the t'un system of defense. Fields were allotted to feed the fighters and to defend the guard houses against the Miao. As for the people's /i.e. Chinese/ land, except for fields for sustenance, a male could retain three tou of grain, a woman one tou. As for the rest of the land seven were allotted while three were retained, for one shih of grain three tou was personally retained, and seven tou given up for allotment, to feed the fighters and guard the frontier. In the Feng-huang area there were more than 830 stone guard houses, requiring 4,000 men to man them in rotation. Further, 1,000 men were trained to be combat ready. The more than 22,000 mu of land allotted were not enough to meet the expense, and so another allotment of more than 12,300 mu at Lu-ch'i and Mo-yang was made. There were also 127 stone petty military stations /tiao pao/ at Kan-chou, manned by 800 soldiers, supported by more than 2,170 mu of allotted land. The original sect of government of Yung-sui, before the Miao rebellion during the reign period of Ch'ien Lung and Chia Ch'ing, was at Wei-ch'eng, which was entirely surrounded by the Miao. In the second year of Chia Ch'ing /1797/, the seat of government was moved to Hua-yüan with a newly built yamen. There were 126 stone guard houses with 2,000 soldiers. The people's land, i.e. Chinese land, usurped by rebels and recovered for public use, totaled more than 17,110 mu. There were over 70 stone military stations /tiao pao/, at Pao-ching, with 300 soldiers and over 2,170 mu of allotted land. There were only 18 stone guard houses at Ku-chang-p'ing with a hundred soldiers and over 120 mu of allotted land.' <sup id="cite_ref-1113" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1113">[1,113]</a></sup> 'The above refers to Chinese t'un /min t'un/. In addition, there were also Miao t'un. After the suppression of the Miao rebellion, the Miao tribes, awed by military might, surrendered all the Chinese land formerly forcefully usurped by them, and [Page 171] 115 cont. also searched into the properties of the rebel Miao and decided to return them for public use. The forcefully usurped land totaling over 30,100 mu and the rebels' properties totaling over 5,400 mu were redistributed among the law-abiding Miao to farm. Granaries were built to collect rent /tsu/ for the maintenance of Miao soldiers. The pressing for rent, the inspecting of fields, the distribution and transportation of grain, and other duties were all the responsibility of Miao officials.' <sup id="cite_ref-1114" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1114">[1,114]</a></sup> 'The total of the above fields and land is 131,640.6 mu. In the thirteenth year of Chia Ch'ing /1808/ a total of 15,219.3 mu of fields and land was surveyed in the three hsien, Feng-huang, Kan-chou, and Yung-sui. In the sixteenth year of Chia Ch'ing /1811/ another total of 5,873.2 mu of fields and land was surveyed, totaling 152,157.1 mu of fields and land. Of this besides the land allocated to the army for horses and farming, land lost through floods and erosion, and also the land used for stone guard houses and surroundings, totaling 11,084.3 mu, and another 37,849 mu distributed among the t'un able-bodied males, leaders, the aged, and the young, there remained 103,223.8 mu. Farmers were recruited to farm this land and rent /in kind/ collected. The annual receipt in grain totaled 105,488 shih, three tou, and nine sheng.' <sup id="cite_ref-1115" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1115">[1,115]</a></sup> 'The t'un fields in the Miao frontier were divided into people's /i.e. Chinese/ t'uns and Miao t'uns, the two being entirely different in nature. The t'un males working on the Chinese t'uns were also divided into t'un men and fighting men. The t'un men received fields to cultivate, and guarded the t'un guard houses. The fighting men, also called home guards, were solely trained for military operations, and did not farm. In the five sub-prefectures and hsiens of the Miao frontier there are 7,000 t'un men, from among whom are appointed hsiao-ch'i, tsung-ch'i, and pe-tsung to facilitate control. The distribution of fields was as follows: the men /san ting/ are each given 4.5 mu; the hsiao-ch'i, 5.5 mu; the tsung-ch'i, 6.5 mu; and the pe-tsung, 7.5 mu. There are 1,000 fighting men, each being given 3 shih, 6 tou of rice per year. The non-fighting men are also each given annually 10.8 liang of silver for salt and vegetables. The hsiao-ch'i receives each year 12 liang of silver; the tsung-ch'i, 13.2 liang of silver; the pe-tsung, 16.8 liang of silver. Therefore, in the Chinese t'un, the fields and land left over after the t'un men have received their fields to plant and care for are leased out for the collection of rent. Granaries (Illus. 57) have been built to store the grain, and general t'un leaders are set up to manage these matters. There are no t'un men in the Miao t'uns, and the t'un fields are allotted to people to cultivate /Illus. 57 and 58 on pages 124 and 125/ 126 for the collection of rent, in order to feed the Miao soldiers, under the control of the Miao officials. The t'un fields in the Miao frontier region, at the inception of the system, totaled 150,000 mu of arable land, of which barely a third was directly cultivated by t'un personnel, the rest being allotted out as rented fields. Today, the t'un army in the Miao frontier region is about 1,000 strong. The maintainance of the Black Flag Battalion of the Miao troops (Illus. 58) largely comes from the rented fields. T'un fields were set up to support troops on the spot as a defense against the Miao. Today, the Miao have been largely acculturated by the Chinese and the boundary line between the Miao and the Chinese is gradually becoming [Page 183] 124 [Page 185] 126 cont. obliterated. There is no longer the need for this kind of system of t'un defense against the Miao. In fact, unrest in the Miao area today is often due to the maladministration of the t'un fields system. The Miao petty officers and the t'un leaders often are oppressive in collecting rent and sometimes are corrupt in their methods, thus causing dissatisfaction and disturbances. In the twenty-sixth year of the Republic /1937/ the Miao rebellion in western Hunan arose because of the t'un land system. It resulted in the burning of t'un granaries and killing of t'un officers. Although the rebellion was pacified only after bloody and expensive campaigns, it is imperative to change the t'un and enter the newly opened or reclaimed land as available for taxation, so as to reach a fundamental solution.' <sup id="cite_ref-1116" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1116">[1,116]</a></sup> Rents/tax payments were reduced in response to natural desasters. Ling et al describe the amounts due: 'The Miao frontier region is mountainous and lacking in fields. For the most part they develop mountain slopes, building up terraced fields for the cultivation of rice grown in [Page 174] 118 cont. flooded fields. Whenever the terraced fields are damaged by flood and erosion when mountain streams flood, the damage is often beyond repair, resulting in a decrease of rent year by year. Furthermore, the government has several times decreed a reduction of rent, so that the current rent rate is only one-half of the original. Successive rent reductions undergone were as follows: in the nineteenth year of Chia Ch'ing /1814/ a reduction of 5,500 shih was made; in the first year of Tao Kuang /1821/ a reduction of 20,770 shih was made; in the eighteenth year of Tao Kuang /1838/ after an investigation of fields destroyed by flood, a reduction of 282 shih, 7 tou, 7 sheng, 6 shuo was effected; in the twenty-eighth year of Tao Kuang /1848/ a reduction of 649 shih, 1 tou, 8 sheng, 1 ho. After the above reductions there remained a rent of 78,286 shih, 4 tou, 4 sheng, 4 ho, 6 shuo. In the twenty-ninth year of Tao Kuang /1849/ there was a further reduction amounting to 7,828 shih, 6 tou, 4 sheng, 4 ho, 4 shuo, resulting in the collection of 70,457 shih, 8 tou, 1 shuo of rent. It was ruled that no further reductions would be made. It was also ordered that for every 6 ho /of grain/ there would be collected 1 sheng, but below six ho nothing would be collected, thereby causing a loss of 352 shih, 3 tou, 1 sheng, 1 shuo. Since that year the annual rent has totaled 70,105 shih, 4 tou, 9 sheng. From the twenty-ninth year of Tao Kuang /1849/ to the end of the Ch'ing dynasty, after deducting 179 shih, 4 tou, 9 sheng of rent uncollectible due to flood and erosion, the net receipt of rent totaled 69,926 shih. From the first year of the Republic /1912/ to the sixteenth or seventeenth year, the reductions due to floods totaled 2,917 shih, 4 tou, 9 sheng, 2 ho. In the twenty-second year of the Republic /1933/, according to investigations made by the authors in western Hunan, the net rent was 67,008 shih, 5 tou, 8 ho. According to a statement in the Hsiang Hsi Miao Ch'ü T'un Fang Chün T'un T'ien T'u Yen Ke /Successive Changes in Land Allotted to Defensive T'un in the Miao Area West of the Hsiang River/, recently published [Page 175] 118 cont. by Yü Fan-ch'uan: “The decision of the first conference on t'un matters held in the twenty-fifth year of the Republic /1936/ was to reduce the rental on devastated land 1, 592 shih, 3 tou, 8 sheng, 8 ho. Currently, the actual receipt of rent is 65, 416 shih, 1 tou, 2 sheng.” ' <sup id="cite_ref-1117" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1117">[1,117]</a></sup> Given the presence of Hmong petty officials, the rents paid to the Chinese administration should be considered taxes rather than tribute.

<p><b>♠ Wages ♣ ♥</b> Petty officials received a salary and possibly a small pension, but most Hmong were subsistence producers. Accordingly, we cannot reconstruct a 'typical' wage. Note: Most Hmong were subsistence producers: 'Economic strategies vary. The Hua Miao were shifting-swidden agriculturalists, growing buckwheat, oats, corn, potatoes, and hemp, and using a simple wooden hand plow or hoe. Sheep and goats were fed on nearby pasture land. Additionally the Hua Miao hunted with crossbow and poisoned arrows and gathered foodstuffs in the forests. In parts of Guizhou, the Miao more closely resembled their Han neighbors in their economic strategies as well as in their technology (the bullock-drawn plow, harrowing, use of animal and human wastes as fertilizer). The Cowrie Shell Miao in central Guizhou were settled farmers growing rice in flooded fields, and also raising millet, wheat, beans, vegetables, and tobacco. Their livestock was limited to barnyard pigs and poultry, with hunting and gathering playing a very minor role. Some of the Black Miao in southeast Guizhou combine intensive irrigated terrace farming of rice with dry-field upland cropping.' <sup id="cite_ref-1122" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1122">[1,122]</a></sup> '3) Occupations. The Miao-I people, being retarded in cultural development, have just entered the stage of agricultural community, and so their chief occupation is farming. 14 Those Miao-I living in the northwest of the province have high [Page 18] 14 cont. mountain terrain with poor soil, in which they can grow only corn, buckwheat and mixed grains. They also rear cattle, horses, pigs, and principally sheep. At Wei-ning and Ta-ting, where the territory is highly mountainous, the climate is cold, and the population is thin; it is unfit for raising crops but best fit for grazing. In the southeast the Miao-I areas are comparatively better and suitable for rice cultivation. Besides agriculture they are also engaged in simple handicraft industries, such as home spinning and weaving. The commercial centers of the Miao-I in all areas are the village fairs held during the day for the bartering of goods. The fairs are located like a network in some convenient spots in the cities, on a vacant lot, or on the slope of a hill. They are named after certain cyclic animals such as chicken, dog, cow and so on. At the time of the fair men and women who come from all places number from several hundred to several thousand. At the fair everyday articles of household use are displayed in rows of adjoining straw sheds. A fair is a scene of activity and gaiety. The villages in which the Miao-I live are often endowed with rich resources, but their belief in the earth as the dwelling place of the dragon spirit forbids them to exploit its wealth, such as felling the trees for timber and digging the mines for minerals. Hence their occupations are limited and their culture is backward.' <sup id="cite_ref-1123" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1123">[1,123]</a></sup> Most were either tenants or smallholders: 'Prior to the 1950s land reform, some Miao were smallholders. Many, if not most, were tenants on lands owned by Han, Yi, Hui, and others. Few were true landlords, and most who rented out land were likely to work part of their holdings themselves with family labor. All land is now owned by the state, including undeveloped mountain and forest lands, thus limiting any expansion beyond lands officially assigned to an individual or village. In the process, pastoralism and forest hunting/gathering have been reduced. Before land reform, some Miao areas followed the practice of lineage or hamlet ownership of mountain and hillside lands even where some private holdings existed. People could open new lands for farming and settlement, share village pastures, or hunt away from their home area.' <sup id="cite_ref-1124" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1124">[1,124]</a></sup> Labour was divided along gender lines: 'Both sexes engage in agriculture, care of livestock, and fishing, and men contribute some labor to domestic chores like cooking, gathering firewood, and child care. Men are expected to do the heaviest work, including plowing. Women sometimes participated on short hunting trips, but trips of several days or several weeks were undertaken by groups of men; hunting trips are now illegal. Labor exchange and cooperation between households was common even before collectivization.' <sup id="cite_ref-1125" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1125">[1,125]</a></sup> There was little occupational specialization: 'Women continue to spin and weave cotton, hemp, ramie, and wool for home use, and to produce garments with elaborate batik and embroidered designs that vary by area and dialect and serve as subethnic markers. Complex silver necklaces, bracelets, earrings, and headdresses are a well-developed craft specialty for men and again are closely associated with ethnicity. They are not usually sold outside the local Miao community. Carpenters, basket makers and blacksmiths can be found among some Miao groups.' <sup id="cite_ref-1126" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1126">[1,126]</a></sup> But trade became important: 'No Miao communities are self-sufficient. All depend on the market for pottery, salt, processed foods, and various daily necessities. In Guizhou there is great demand for silver for making jewelry. What the Miao have to sell varies greatly by area. The Hua Miao market wool, hides, sheep and goats, wild game, firewood, and a variety of forest products. The Cowrie Shell Miao market agricultural produce, poultry and pigs, bamboo shoots, and home-crafted grass raincoats and sandals. Different areas have their specialties, such as cattle, horses, bamboo baskets, and herbal medicines. Before 1949, some Miao sold opium, but more often poppy growing and production of raw opium was the required rent for cropland and the profits went to the landlord and middlemen. Very few Miao were full-time merchants or traders.' <sup id="cite_ref-1127" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1127">[1,127]</a></sup> Accordingly, the below variables may not be applicable to the Qing-period Hmong.
