"Southern Levant" is a retrospective term for the region used by many modern scholars, though there is disagreement over the exact geographical area so defined.
</p><p><b> ♠ Peak Date  ♣ 1550 BCE ♥ </b> The end of the Middle Bronze Age, and the last point at which the Canaanite "Hyksos" controlled the Egyptian Delta. Shortly thereafter, Egypt reunified under Ahmose, who expelled the Hyksos from the Delta. Following this, Egypt launched a devastating series of invasions of Canaan, notably under Thutmose III; the effect of these was to reduce the Canaanite city-states to vassal status, and (judging from Egyptian records) to drain a great deal of wealth away to Egypt.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

</p><p>1550 BCE is the approximate point at which Thutmose I expelled the Hyksos from the Nile Delta, following which the Egyptians invaded Canaan and imposed tribute. For the next several decades, Egyptian control was relatively light, and sometime around 1470 BCE (plus or minus a decade) several Canaanite cities joined a confederation led by Durusha, king of Kadesh, in rebellion against Egypt. Thutmose III then invaded Canaan, leading to the Battle of Megiddo in which the Egyptians won decisively. Following their victory, Egyptian rule become much more involved and oppressive; military garrisons and administrative centers were built across Canaan, and heavy tribute was exacted. (However, Egyptian control was not uniform across Canaan, for example: "At the start of the Late Bronze Age (LB IA), Jaffa remained beyond the reach of the ad hoc campaigns of early 18th-Dynasty pharaohs, which appear to have been concentrated in the coastal plain to the south of Jaffa, with occasional raids made into the northern Levant from the Syrian coast. Jaffa’s first historical mention, as Yapu, occurs among a list of towns that were conquered in connection with the first campaign of Thutmose III…"<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>) Egyptian control periodically stimulated violent Canaanite resistance, sometimes to the extent of destroying whole Egyptian settlements (as with the 12th-century destruction of Jaffa).<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> This continued until the fall of Bronze Age Canaan.

<p>_Short description_
</p><p>Very little is known about the ancient Canaanites and what is known is often through references given by other cultures (such as the Egyptians). Even combined with what is known and not known from archaeological work the overall picture of Canannite society should be taken as a very provisional one.
</p><p>Canaanites seem to have lived between 2000-1175 BCE, from a time contemporary to the Middle Kingdom of Ancient Egypt, the Canaanite Hyksos Period of Egypt and their expulsion, through the New Kingdom of Egypt, to the invasion of the Sea Peoples (which have often been associated with the destruction of Canaanite cities).
</p><p>Outside of the city-state organization the Canaanites did not achieve any territorial centralization in the Levant. The Canaanites lived in hierarchical city-states that would form alliances and fight opposing coalitions of Canaanites. The region as a whole was under Egyptian control after the invasion of Thutmose III.
</p><p>One tentative archaeological interpretation of Canaanite government holds that Canaanite regimes were more similar to an household <i>oikos</i> economy than a Mesopotamian-style redistributive state: "in sharp contrast to both the Aegean and the entire ancient Near East, there is not a single indication that literate administration ever played any significant role in the [Middle Bronze Age] Canaanite economy."<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup>
</p><p>However, it appears at least some Canaanites did use writing to record laws. Two fragments of a larger clay tablet (designated Hazor 18) were discovered in 2010 at Tel Hazor, that would possibly have contained as many as 20 or 30 laws (which in turn could have been part of a larger collection of law tablets) in a format similar to the Code of Hammurabi. An earlier tablet, Hazor 5, contains part of the description of a lawsuit, judged by the king personally.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> It is likely that at least some Canaanite polities would have had formal law codes.
</p><p>The population of the Canaanites probably never exceeded much beyond 50,000 people in a single polity, though more were likely present towards the end of the period than at the beginning.
</p><p><br>
_Oren's long description_
</p><p>During the Bronze Age, Canaan was composed of dozens of "city-states," some strong enough to lead regional confederations against each other or against outside invaders. These city-states appear to have been significantly institutionalized, featuring standing armies, bureaucracies and public works, and official cults. The social structure was highly unequal; most of the land was concentrated in the hands of the small ruling class, with the vast majority of inhabitants being serfs, slaves, or landless vagabonds or nomads. The economy depended heavily on trade, with intensive agriculture of staples such as wine and oil meant for export in exchange for prestige goods such as imported pottery, and tin for making bronze.
</p><p>Canaan of the Middle and Late Bronze was by no means a unified entity, even as its polities shared significant cultural elements. The varying landscape carried with it different geopolitical conditions for each local polity, strongly conditioning the development of each one and its various political/strategic needs. "The Coastal Plain, the setting for the region's largest political and economic centers, conventionally seen as the hearth of Canaanite civilization, emerges as a hodge-podge of polities with highly variable structures and their attendant political connotations. The Jordan Rift, normally seen as a smaller-scale backwater off the Mediterranean littoral, features settlement patterns most consistent with a series of highly integrated peer polities or city-states, and subregional political coherence. In contrast to both of these lowland areas, the settlement clusters of the Hill Country are more dispersed, with consistent evidence of less settlement integration. When considered structurally, these results suggest three fundamentally different bases for political development in a region normally viewed as a single, albeit fractious, social and cultural entity during the Late Bronze Age. These distinctions help illuminate the foundations of the particularly volatile political dynamics of the southern Levant."<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>
</p><p>During the Middle Bronze, Canaanite polities were wealthy and powerful enough to extend their influence into the Egyptian Delta (via the so-called "Hyksos). However, the end of the Middle Bronze is marked by the campaign of Thutmose I, who expelled the Hyksos and then campaigned into Canaan proper, imposing Egyptian overlordship over many of the Canaanite cities. As the Late Bronze progressed, Canaanite cities were marked with increasing social turmoil, wracked by repeated uprisings against Egyptian officials or against local elites, and facing periodic invasions from the sea or pressure from the Hittite Empire. The politics of this period are somewhat better understood thanks to the finding of the Amarna Letters, some 350 clay tablets of Egyptian diplomatic correspondence that date to about the middle of the 14th Century BCE. Many of them are from Canaanite "mayors," sending groveling obeisances to the Pharaoh and pleading for military assistance in the face of urgent threats. Finally, during the 12th Century BCE, a series of poorly-understood calamities and city destructions brought the Bronze Age Canaanite civilization to a close; it would be succeeded by the Phoenicians to the north, and the Israelites in the Judean highlands.
</p><p>(A word of caution is in order about coding methodology. Much of the evidence we have about this polity comes from archaeological finds. However, the brute fact of an archaeological artifact is often used as the basis for considerable interpretation and conjecture. Methods have been improving over time, but still some archaeologists tend to leap far ahead of what the evidence will support. Additionally, the meaning of many finds is hotly disputed by archaeologists, each faction insisting for its point of view: "When any scholar defends the correctness or appropriateness of a singular point of view, or set of data, everything else tends to be analyzed accordingly - alternative views are intensely criticized, dismissed, or ignored entirely, while complementary views or evidence are presented with little critical reflection. Whether the evidence is archaeological or scientific, often it is only partial or ambiguous and so becomes easy to interpret or manipulate in a manner that serves to perpetuate a preconceived idea or point of view. The outcome is often a selective filtering of data and related information and an unwillingness to contemplate or envisage a counter position."<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>
</p><p>This is a particular problem with regard to establishing chronologies. While on a given archaeological site researchers are (usually) able to determine the boundaries of relative temporal layers, tying those layers to an absolute timeline, or even fitting them into a relative relationship with the layers of other sites, is a fraught business; and when the time period in question is as far back as the Middle Bronze, the available evidence becomes correspondingly scarcer and more difficult to correlate with each other. Unfortunately, many researchers are too quick to claim certainty where none exists.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>
</p><p>In short, every data point that is backed up with archaeology must be considered provisional, and new discoveries can totally upend our picture of what happened—as can new interpretations that correct erroneous early interpretations, a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~fisher/hst140/MotelOfMysteries.html">constant danger</a> with motivated archaeologists.)

Finkelstein estimates his populations based on ground surveys of pottery remains and an assumed population density of 250 people per built-up hectare. However, the suitability of this assumption is not a given. "Some of the densities recently put forward for area coefficients have been based on unwalled, premodern villages…. How similar is such a village to a walled Bronze or Iron Age town or city? Although this is not a case of comparing apples and oranges (more like oranges and grapefruit), it seems probable that the economic constraints of building a defensive system put a permanent physical limit on the settlement area," leading to higher population densities.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> "…the density coefficients employed by various population estimates of the Bronze Age, Iron Age, and Byzantine Period in the southern Levant using a figure of about 200-250 persons per hectare have been based upon data from observations in the old quarters of various Middle Eastern cities, towns, and villages in Iraq, Iran, and Syria (Finkelstein 1996; Broshi and Gophna 1986; Broshi 1979; Hassan 1981:66). Rather than assign an arbitrary density coefficient derived from a vastly different time period and culture, then simply applied to the overall measure of a settlement, more precise means should be used when seeking an accurate population estimate.… Basing a population estimate on the number houses, size of houses, members per household, and residential area of a site is essential for an accurate estimate because these figures can vary widely between sites, regions, and time periods."<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup>
</p><p>The upper bound in the Late Bronze Age is taken from Kennedy's estimate of Hazor (2013:328), increased by c. 20% to account for the built-up settlements within Hazor's territory but outside of Hazor proper.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> There are several other population estimates that are significantly smaller, but I judge them to be less convincing. "In northern Canaan, there was an apparent trend of urbanization in the region of southern Lebanon between the Middle Bronze Age and the Late Bronze Age—the larger sites stayed occupied while some of the smaller sites became unoccupied in Late Bronze I (Marfoe 1998: 170).4 This may indicate an urbanization of the region rather than depopulation, and could be reflective of Canaan as a whole. The rise of city-states, known definitively from the Amarna Letters, could account for this demographic trend of urbanization.5 Yet, broad conclusions about the Late Bronze Age from limited archaeological data and studies have been drawn that claim the Late Bronze Age was a period of demographic decline and even increased nomadism."<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ [20,000-40,000]: 2000-1551 BCE; [45,000-50,000]: 1550-1175 BCE ♥ </b> Inhabitants. Middle Bronze Age is taken from Finkelstein's (1992:211) estimate of the population of Shechem (with the upper bound inflated as above), which is judged to have been the largest settlement at the time.

It seems clear that the kings were expected to take the field, and often in the front lines. There would be a "commander of the chariots," and potentially subordinate commanders as well, above the actual charioteers and their shield-bearers. The infantry would be made up of elite soldiers, as well as peasant levies; the command structure is unknown. From the evidence of the Amarna Letters, we might infer that units of 100 men were extant—potentially as subdivisions of larger units of 400 men. Ugaritic sources also reference "commanders of a thousand," though Ugarit's army was relatively large.
</p><p>Additionally, in Ugarit there were several specialized units outside of the normal command structure, such as "friends of the king."

(The fragments themselves concern torts having to do with injury to a slave that has been rented from his master.) An earlier tablet, Hazor 5, contains part of the description of a lawsuit, judged by the king personally. "…the Laws of Hazor, inscribed on Hazor clay, may be viewed as further evidence of the position of Hazor as a kind of Babylon/Hattuša of the cuneiform far west — in other words, a city of the first and most important rank ruled by a great king."<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup> It is likely that at least some other Canaanite polities would have had formal law codes, but whether such codes were standard is impossible to know.

Climactic conditions in areas such as the Huleh Valley were probably not sufficient for dry-farming, and feeding the growing population living in and around Hazor required the use of irrigation technology. Sealed, stone-built channels that diverted runoff water to exterior channels and moats were in use in cities such as Dan, Tel el-Ajjul, Tel Beit Mirsim, and Gezer.

Furthermore, the quantity and conditions of the remains, because they showed no evidence of having been crushed, indicate that they were located in the gateway before the gate’s destruction, in either sacks or baskets of which no traces could be identified. The patterns of deposition were also not random but rather consisted of collections of types (e.g., olive pits, wheat, chickpeas). Seeds and artifacts recovered within the gate indicate that the Egyptian gate was not an exclusively defensive structure but that it also likely served as an administrative center (second story), a storage space (second story), and possibly a market (passageway)."<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup></dd>

<p>Note that since Canaan was composed of dozens of smaller polities, which often competed violently, coding army sizes is slightly awkward. Based on the Amarna letters, it seems that most reasonably-sized cities had a garrison of several hundred warriors; threatened cities often requested reinforcements from their neighbors or from Egypt of 100-400 men, plus horses. It is estimated that the armed force of Ugarit, just outside of Canaan, was well over 2,000 men.<sup id="cite_ref-104" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-104">[104]</a></sup> Coding could either be based off of the army of a single average city, or on the combined forces of all the Canaanite cities. Since data on the latter is lacking, "total army" and "professional army" will be based on the inferred size of a single large city's force.

According to Davis, in the midst of a layer dating to 10,000 years ago, archaeologists found a tomb from 4,000 years ago. “In this tomb are two individuals - warriors - who were buried together with a dagger and a spear head,” she said. “There’s also an amazing find,” said Davis, “which is a whole donkey, domesticated, that was buried in front of the tomb probably when they sealed it.” Added Vardi, the donkey was apparently meant to serve the warriors in the world to come." <sup id="cite_ref-112" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-112">[112]</a></sup> <i>ET: 4,000 years ago would be this period.</i>

<p>A collective ritual is a ritual in which two or more people participate. With the official cult we refer to the set of collective ritual practices that are most closely associated with legitimation of the power structure (including elites, if any).
</p><p>This section is impossible to code for this polity, simply because we do not have any records for specific rituals at all.<sup id="cite_ref-113" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-113">[113]</a></sup> However, archaeologists have found a rich assortment of cultic objects and cultic buildings across the region. One type of temple that was quite common during the Middle Bronze Age is currently called a <i>migdal</i>: "large, massively walled, rectangular structures with a single entryway in the short wall, opposite an altar and/or niche in the back".<sup id="cite_ref-114" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-114">[114]</a></sup> However, none of the cultic figurines found there allow for the deity or deities to be identified. Katz (2000) attempts to reconstruct the likely ritual that took place at the <i>migdal</i> temple of Tel Haror, based on the archaeological findings there and elsewhere. She speculates that within the temple, a functionary would enter, walking in a circular fashion around the central hearth until facing the deity which was placed in the rear niche, where he would make an offering or burn incense, along with other details of ritual that are necessarily lost to us. He would then exit by circling out the other side of the hearth. The outer courtyard featured animal sacrifice, which certainly had elements of communal feasting and possibly included aspects of divination as well. Animals sacrificed included puppies, which were not eaten; they may have been meant for some magical or purificatory purpose. Additionally, one of the sealed rooms of the temple complex held a tomb containing two complete donkeys and the jaw of a third. It is probable, based on textual evidence, that this was the consummation of a nonaggression pact between two rival polities.<sup id="cite_ref-115" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-115">[115]</a></sup>
</p><p>Ceremonial masks (or fragments of same) have been found in or near cultic buildings in several digs, including at Hazor, Gezer, Dan, and Burna.<sup id="cite_ref-116" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-116">[116]</a></sup> These were made of clay; interestingly, the masks at Hazor seem to have been meant to adorn an idol, rather than being worn by a person. The role of these masks is obscure. Also frequently found are ornamental drinking vessels, suggesting ritualized pouring of libations (known to be a common ritual in nearby Ugarit).
</p><p>"Religious practice also seems more uniform, with only two main types of temples dating to [the Middle Bronze Age] have been discovered (Mazar 1990, 211; 1992). The dispersal of figurines also suggests that religious activity was uniform. In the Late Bronze Age it seems many people kept figurines at home, while in the Middle Bronze Age, figurine dispersal seems to have been less common. This seems to indicate a difference in religious practice between the periods. In the Late Bronze Age, plurality is common and there are various options for worship, both in the temple, and in the home. In the Middle Bronze Age, unity seems to have dictated the place of worship (Uziel 2008). Similarities in burial customs during this period have also been noted, with the definition of “burial kits” used (Hallote 1995; Ilan 1995; Horwitz 1999; Baker 2006)."<sup id="cite_ref-117" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-117">[117]</a></sup>

<p>Very little is known about land rights in Canaan specifically. Land ownership was highly concentrated, but the specific rights of landholders are not attested to. However, we can draw parallels with the legal systems of Egypt and (to a lesser degree) Mesopotamia.<sup id="cite_ref-120" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-120">[120]</a></sup> In particular, as Egypt was unusually centralized and state-dominated, we can speculate that where landholders had specific rights in Egypt, they would have <i>a fortiori</i> had those rights in Canaan.

</p><p><b>Description of the Normative Ideology</b>
</p><p><br>
"The picture of Canaanite religion is often drawn from the texts found at ancient Ugarit (in spheres outside religion, however, most scholars do not include Ugarit within the scope of Canaan). While the Ugaritians distinguished themselves from Canaanites, Ugaritic religious literature has enough links with later biblical literature to place Ugarit on a cultural continuum with Canaan.… A large number of male and female deities was worshiped throughout the area, known from Ugarit, the Bible, various Canaanite personal names, and inscriptions. The high god 'El, the father-god, head of the council of gods, lived on top of a mountain at the foot of which was the source of fresh water. Of the same 'generation' was Asherah, a marine goddess ('atiratu yammi at Ugarit); the gods at Ugarit are called her children and she is called creator of creatures.… These deities demonstrate continuity with those of the national religions of the Iron Age: Yahweh in Israel, for instance, is a storm god as well as an 'El figure (patriarch, head of the council). There is no evidence that Chemosh in Moab, Milkom in Ammon, and Qaws in Edom were any different. In fact, there is some slight evidence that they were similar; they were also national gods from the same time period, and the onomastica are similar; and the Mesha stela shows Chemosh leading Mesha in war and requiring a kind of 'holy war' destruction."<sup id="cite_ref-133" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-133">[133]</a></sup>
</p><p>"The four ranks in [Canaanite] society - royal, noble, peasant, and slave - were mirrored by four tiers of gods (Handy 1994; M. S. Smith 2004, pp. 101-5). At the top stood the divine patron and sometimes his spouse. In the second rank were the cosmic gods, who ruled aspects of the natural realm such as the storms that fertilized the land, the lights in the sky, the endlessly chaotic sea, the vast earth, and the eternal underworld. On the third level were the gods who assisted with practical aspects of daily life, such as gods of craftsmanship, gods of childbearing, and the family ancestors who had become gods after death. The lowest rank of the gods, corresponding to slaves in human society, were the messengers." <sup id="cite_ref-134" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-134">[134]</a></sup>
</p><p>It is quite likely that the religious mythology would have been used to legitimate the rule of the elite class, which otherwise would have been quite precarious. On the other hand, even with the concentrated landownership and prevalence of slavery, Canaanite rulers seem to have not been as prone to self-glorification as in surrounding cultures: "There are other differences between the Canaanite political system and those of Syria and the rest of the ancient Near East. The Syrian palaces, as well as their decoration and palatial figurative art in the MBA, reflect the power ideology of the rulers with a focus on depictions of the rulers (Margueron 1995: 898). Thus, we see in MBA II Ebla block statues of rulers as well as elaborate scenes carved on the limestone and basalt basins depicting royal banquets (Matthiae et al. 1995: 410-411, 421-422, 432). Apart from at Tel Hazor, the iconographical evidence for Canaanite rulers who supposedly resided in the palaces is very scarce, recalling the Minoan “missing ruler” (Cline and Yasur-Landau 2007). As noted above, the absence of all features of a redistributive or command economy, from sealings to large scale storage in most Canaanite palaces (save perhaps at Tel Hazor), and the absence of iconography portraying rulership strongly suggest that the Canaanite palatial economy may have differed from palatial economies elsewhere in the ancient Near East as well as in the Aegean."<sup id="cite_ref-135" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-135">[135]</a></sup>
</p><p>Perhaps there was a sort of latent egalitarianism lurking at the fringes of society, expressed in such ways as the spread of alphabetic writing as against the cuneiform of the elites<sup id="cite_ref-136" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-136">[136]</a></sup>, and in the periodic popular rebellions of the Apiru. Such a claim is highly speculative, and there is little hard evidence for it; but religious practice also seems to have been more popularized than elsewhere. "Religious practice also seems more uniform, with only two main types of temples dating to [the Middle Bronze Age] have been discovered (Mazar 1990, 211; 1992). The dispersal of figurines also suggests that religious activity was uniform. In the Late Bronze Age it seems many people kept figurines at home, while in the Middle Bronze Age, figurine dispersal seems to have been less common. This seems to indicate a difference in religious practice between the periods. In the Late Bronze Age, plurality is common and there are various options for worship, both in the temple, and in the home. In the Middle Bronze Age, unity seems to have dictated the place of worship (Uziel 2008). Similarities in burial customs during this period have also been noted, with the definition of “burial kits” used (Hallote 1995; Ilan 1995; Horwitz 1999; Baker 2006)."<sup id="cite_ref-137" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-137">[137]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Human sacrifice ♣ [4-5] ♥</b> "Human sacrifice took place in Canaanite religion on certain occasions. Egyptian relief sculptures, the Bible (e.g., 2 Kings 3), and other sources suggest that, under the duress of military crisis, human sacrifice was offered to the divine patron of the besieged city (Spalinger 1978). Likewise, inscriptions and the Bible agree that a practice called herem took place in some wars. This was the slaughter of all prisoners of war as a sacrifice to the victorious god (see, for example, 1 Samuel 15; cf. Lloyd 1996). These sacrifices took place only during times of war."<sup id="cite_ref-140" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-140">[140]</a></sup> The best archaeological attestation to human sacrifice in Canaan is a large altar near Amman, Jordan, dating from about the 13th century BCE,<sup id="cite_ref-141" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-141">[141]</a></sup>, near which were found thousands of human bones, mostly of infants.
