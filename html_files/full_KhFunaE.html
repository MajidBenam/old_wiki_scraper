<p><b> ♠ Duration  ♣ 225-540 CE ♥ </b> Chinese records dating from the 3rd century C.E., beginning with the Sānguó zhì (Records of the Three Kingdoms) completed in AD 289 by Chén Shòu (233-297), record the arrival of two Funanese embassies at the court of Lǚ Dài, governor in the southern Chinese kingdom of Wú: the first embassy arrived between 225 and 230 AD, the second in the year 243.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> The last Funan king was historically attested in 539 CE. 'According to the Chinese accounts, the last king of Funan was called Rudravarman and he was chiefly distinguished in their eyes because he offered the gift of a live rhinoceros to the Emperor at Beijing in 539 AD. After this, the historical record becomes somewhat blurred. For many years, it was believed that Funan declined or disappeared because it was threatened by the rise of another, more powerful state called Chenla or Zhenla to the north.'<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> Note: 'Chenla' is the old spelling, the modern romanization of the Chinese character is 'Zhenla'. <sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> 'Late in sixth century, 'Fu-nan' disappears from the Chinese record, and its place is taken by the Khmer city-states further north where minor rajas competed for hegemony.'<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> 'In the 6th century Southeast Asian shipping to China linking China, Southeast Asia, and India began to shift from coastal sailing along the shores of Vietnam, Cambodia, and the peninsula, to a direct route across the South China Sea from Indonesia to southern China and northern Vietnam. Funan, the coastal polity dependent on maritime trade, apparently collapsed and was replaced in Cambodia by an entity known to the Chinese as 'Chenla', a state, or group of states, or pon-led communities based on the control of land and people, and extracting wealth from agriculture, and possibly inter-community trade, with little involvement in maritime activities.'<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> 'In the lower reaches of the Mekong River in Vietnam, between the delta area and the Gulf of Thailand (Siam), lies OC ÈO, an archaeological site generally believed to be FUNAN, a kingdom that flourished in the third through seventh centuries C.E., hitherto known only through written source materials.'<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> 'The CHINESE TRIBUTE SYSTEM was imposed on FU-NAN from the fourth century until its demise in the latter half of the sixth century.'<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> 'Following the decline of Funan sea power by about the sixth century, the Khmers turned inland, to the country’s agricultural regions.'(<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> 'It is clear, however, that in the third century the great expansion of Funan towards the Malay peninsula during which it subdued, or rather relegated to vassal status, a number of small states, gave way in the succeeding centuries to a reduction in the extent of its territory, ending around the fourth or fifth centuries in an area restricted to the southern parts of today's Cambodia and Vietnam.' [...] Thus Funan at the beginning of the sixth century would appear to have shrunk to what must have been its original core, the Mekong delta areas of today's Cambodia and Vietnam.'<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> 'In 550 CE Chitrasena, borther of king Bhavarma, royal descendant of Hun Tian [Skt.

</p><p><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ confederated state ♥ </b>
</p>
<dl><dd>'This passage gives the impression of Fu-nan as an empire, but modern scholars are distrustful of such a portrayal. It is likely that the communities involved were all relatively small city-states scattered along the coast; they could conduct raids upon one another, but there were no great tracts of territory settled by agriculturalist, and it is not likely that centralized control could extend over a large area. [...] Fu-nan, then, was less likely a dominant empire than the largest and most aggressive of a number of principalities.'<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>'We do not know if Funan was a unitary state, as the Chinese descriptions seem to suggest, or a series of competing centers. Whichever was the case, certain trends are found which were to contribute to the character of later complex polities in Southeast Asia. The handful of surviving inscriptions, for example, indicates that the local rulers adopted Sanskrit language and took Sanskrit names. Indian religious and legal systems were adopted as well.'<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup> 'There was a taxation system involving payment in gold, silver, perfumes, and pearls, and a script which originated in India.'<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>'Some historians suspect that the Chinese assumed that Funan’s political structure was more centralized than was really the case. No territorially based polities can be found in Southeast Asia before the imperial era of Angkor in the 11th and 12th centuries. It is unlikely that Funan was such a kingdom. More likely it was a typical early Southeast Asian mandala, in which political power manifested itself in the form of ability to extract tribute and occasional other tokens of subservience, but not direct rule of distant provinces. It is impossible to tell whether Funan could be defined as a unified state or as a cluster of small polities in the delta. Evidence in favor of territorial organization covering at least the lower Mekong includes extensive remains of a canal network and signs of the emergence of an elite stimulated by trade involving resources brought downriver from the hinterland.'<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>'We should think of Funan, therefore, not as a centralised kingdom extending from southern Vietnam all the way around to the Kra Isthmus, but rather as a mandala, the power of whose capital in southeastern Cambodia waxed and waned, and whose armed merchant ships succeeded in enforcing its temporary suzerainty over small coastal trading ports around the Gulf of Thailand. What gave Funan the edge over other such centres of power was clearly its position astride the India-China trade route. Its power, however, is unlikely to have spread far inland. Further north, on the middle Mekong and on the lower Chao Phraya River, other power centres were establishing themselves that in time would challenge and replace Funan.'<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>'The pre-Angkor scholar Michael Vickery has warned against assuming that Funan was a unified state—it is possible that it was a loose alliance of port towns in the lower Mekong delta. However, the existence of large canals suggests a strong state power capable of planning and managing the large numbers of labourers required for such projects. Such workforces would have depended on regular food supplies, produced by efficient agriculture and with an efficient tax collection system. On the other hand, we know that the city-states of Ancient Greece and Renaissance Italy were capable of building public works and large monuments without direction by overarching ‘national’ or supra-national polities, so Vickery is probably right about pre-Angkorean Cambodia.'<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup> 'The area was occupied in the prehistoric period, and the inhabitants prospered with the control of the international maritime trade to create a vigorous and powerful state.'<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup> 'Chinese sources awarded this area, known as “Funan,” an exaggerated political solidity, for in truth what Chinese writers, eager to flatter their emperor, described as a substantial tributary kingdom seems to have been no more than an unstable network of superficially Indianized ports and small principalities'<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>'Combining the assumptions of Chinese sources with their own bias in favor of consolidated states, early European scholars portrayed Champa as a unified kingdom, with a hierarchy of provincial functionaries and a centralized administration.19 Recent research has substantially modi- fied that view, preferring to see Champa (like neighboring Funan) even at its height as a loose confederation of local polities which might com- bine for longer or shorter periods under powerful leaders, but which retained a basic autonomy grounded in the self-sufficiency of small east-west river valleys and isolated coastal plains, and perhaps in an irreducibly polycentric world view. Not infrequently, Cham principali- ties fought one another. A hegemon became merely “king of the kings (raja di raja) of Champa,” and the location of the preeminent center - when such a center existed - shifted: in the 8th century, which may have seen the first sustained coalescence, Panduranga dominated, in the late 9th century Indrapura, after c. 1000 Vijaya, and in the 16th century Kauthara and Panduranga.20 It would be foolish to assume that Cham political structures remained frozen for centuries.'<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup> 'The elements of a social overlay to the archaeological record are found in the surviving texts: we read of kings, a legal system, taxation, warfare and sujugation of rivals. Yet important issues remain unresolved. Was there, for example, a unitary state which straddled the delta, or were there a series of competing polities?'<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>'At any given time dozens of lesser kings would have been paying tribute to Funan; the loss of much of that revenue and the peace it signaled led to the eventual re- placement of Funan by Chenla as the dominant force in the mandala system of Southeast Asia.'<sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38">[38]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>'Through connections to India that remain somewhat unclear the Funanese practiced Hinduism, used a script adapted from Sanskrit, and utilized a god-king model of state organization similar to that of ancient India.'<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup></dd></dl>

The accompanying ceremonial established status hierarchy, but not vassalage in the Southeast Asian sense. It was acceptable for envoys to show proper respect to the Chinese emperor, just as Chinese envoys paid their respects to Southeast Asian kings; but with the exception of Vietnam, no ruler of a major Southeast Asian kingdom ever voyaged to Beijing to pay homage in person.'<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup> 'Both sought to maximise power through manipulation of ideologies of legitimation and world order.

<dl><dd>'Funan' is the name the Chinese gave to the polity (or cluster of polities) that, between the 3rd and the 7th centuries CE, ruled over much of the southern portion of mainland Southeast Asia ‒ including territory that is today southern Vietnam, Thailand, and Myanmar, as well as all of Cambodia.<sup id="cite_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-77">[77]</a></sup> Most likely, what we now know as Funan emerged from Iron Age settlements around the Mekong Delta and the banks of the Mekong river.<sup id="cite_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-78">[78]</a></sup> The best known of these settlements is the archaeological site of Oc Èo ‒ hence the name 'culture of Oc Èo' to describe mainland Southeast Asian culture at this time.<sup id="cite_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-79">[79]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Because it is difficult to pinpoint precisely when Funan was founded, here we use 225 CE as our start date. According to written records, this was the year in which the first Funanese embassy visited the Southern Chinese kingdom of Wu.<sup id="cite_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-80">[80]</a></sup> We selected 539 CE as our end date, corresponding to the year King Rudravarman offered the gift of a live rhinoceros to the emperor at Beijing. This is the last time a Funanese ruler is mentioned in any existing records, and indeed it seems that Funan entered a period of gradual decline around this time, until it was supplanted by the Northern Cambodian state of Chenla or Zhenla in the 7th century.<sup id="cite_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-81">[81]</a></sup> Chenla is the older spelling, the modern romanization of the Chinese character is Zhenla. <sup id="cite_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-82">[82]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Funan was rather prosperous, due to its privileged position at the crossroads of important trade routes that linked with India and China. Sources suggest that it reached its peak either in the mid-3rd century (when it extended its influence into Malaysia)<sup id="cite_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-83">[83]</a></sup> or between the end of the 5th and the beginning of the 6th century (when it was ruled by King Kaundinya Jayavarman and reached its maximum territorial extent, as well as the zenith of its political and economic power).<sup id="cite_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-84">[84]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p><i>Population and political organization</i>
</p>
<dl><dd>It is not entirely clear whether Funan was a unitary state, as suggested by Chinese records, or a cluster of competing centres, or indeed the most powerful out of many such polities.<sup id="cite_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-85">[85]</a></sup> The highest political authority was probably something like a Mon-Khmer <i>poñ</i>, that is, a settlement chief.

<dl><dd>No population estimates for Funan could be found in the literature, as work continues to locate and study settlements from this period.

There was a progressive change in religious cults in the area of Funan, the most radical one being the abandonment of inhumation practices in favour of cremation.

Indian gods were incorporated into the Funanese pantheon, particularly Siva, Visnu, and Buddha.

Similarly, it is unclear if what the chinese identified as army was a real professional army or villagers who were conscripted to fight for their chiefs.

Jacq-Hergoualc’h (2007: 85) states that ‘perhaps these animal figures corresponded to the desire of the warriors to place themselves under the protection of this or that revered animal’. It may be that these animals are regional or clan signifiers. At Phum Snay buffalo iconography was very common, especially in the form of finger rings, on bronze bells and on epaulettes.

There was no standing army - in times of war, the patron was expected to muster a force of his clients, and place himself or an officer designated by the king at the head. The arms that they bore were substantially like those wielded by Classic warriors, with the addition of firearms and canon (after 1600). Again the principle of five ruled, as there were five corps: the vanguard, the rear guard, the right flank, the left flank, and the central corps or main body of the army, where the king kept himself with his war elephants. These animals were strengthened magically from time to time by bring sprayed with water mixed with human bile (or so say our sources); magical ideas also led the warriors to cover themselves with protective amulets. The king would be surrounded by Brahmins who conducted ritual ablutions, and by soothsayers who were consulted on the placement of military camps and for auspicious days for military operations.'<sup id="cite_ref-338" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-338">[338]</a></sup>

Even the report of Funan’s envoy Nagasena accepted that by this time it was Linyi, and not Funan, that was considered responsible for curtailing acts of piracy on the lower Vietnam coast.'<sup id="cite_ref-386" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-386">[386]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>'The Chinese histories contain notes on the names of successive rulers and their predatory wars against their neighbors. One early ruler named Hun Panhuang conquered chiefs on the edge of his kingdom and installed his sons and grandsons to rule there under his command. His son, called Pan Pan, was followed by a ruler known as Fan Shiman. The title pan or FAN might well be a Chinese rendition of the Khmer title PON, widely documented in later inscriptions. Fan Shiman is said to have launched expeditions against his neighbors.'<sup id="cite_ref-387" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-387">[387]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>'Fanzhan's predecessor was Fanshiman, again an enigmatic name. He seems to have been a great conquerer, enlarging his empire by seizing Dunxun which, the account says, was a country "on a steeply rising shoe and not more than 1,000 li in length. The town is 10 li from the sea. There are five kings, all vassals of Funan. The eastern territory of Dunxun puts it in contact with Jiaozhu (meaning Tonkin), and its western territory borders India, Parthia, and the kingdoms extremely far away [.....] This market is the meeting-place between east and west" (Pelliot, ibid, p. 263).'<sup id="cite_ref-388" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-388">[388]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>'Funan seems to have originated in the Mekong delta area, and around 200 AD under Fanzhan's uncle, Fanshiman, through successive campaigns along the Gulf of Siam, it occupied belts of land of varying length which allowed goods to be transported by road or porterage to the ports on the Indian Ocean side of the peninsula.'<sup id="cite_ref-389" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-389">[389]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>'It is clear, however, that in the third century the great expansion of Funan towards the Malay peninsula during which it subdued, or rather relegated to vassal status, a number of small states, gave way in the succeeding centuries to a reduction in the extent of its territory, ending around the fourth or fifth centuries in an area restricted to the southern parts of today's Cambodia and Vietnam.'<sup id="cite_ref-390" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-390">[390]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>'There is no narrative, and it is certainly not historic evenementielle, history of events, or king-and-battle history, for there are hardly any events recorded in the comtemporary record. We do not know what any particular individual did at any particular time. There is not even a dated installation of a ruler, nor a dated construction of an edifice. In the 7th-8th century inscriptions, no battles are recorded, nor decisions about justice, or foreign relations. What is recorded are assignments of land, animals, and categories of people at specific times and places, or interactions between persons of rank and the foundations; and these taken together and studied in sequence reveal not events, but processes. They lend themselves to macro-history; in fact, that is all they are suitable for.'<sup id="cite_ref-391" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-391">[391]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>'The importance of Funan as a maritime power is attributed to the king Fan Man or Fan Shi Man, whose reign has been dated to around 200 C.E. He is said to have constructed a fleet of ships and to have attacked more than ten kingdoms. Only three kingdoms were individually named, but all have been identified with the Malay Peninsula. These raids appear to have been an attempt to take control of the maritime trade flowing from India through the Malay Peninsula to China.'<sup id="cite_ref-392" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-392">[392]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>'The most notable ruler holding the title fan was known to the Chinese as Fan Shih-man. He was recorded as a great military leader who defeated rivals and replaced then with his kinsmen to rule under him. He also led maritime expeditions against his enemies, but the extent of these campaigns is not known. The History of the Liang Dynasty describes how the ruler of Funan in the early third century C.E. “used troops to attack and subdue the neighboring kingdoms, which all acknowledged themselves his vassals. He himself adopted the style of Great King of Funan. Then he ordered the construction of great ships and, crossing right over the Gulf of Siam, attacked more than ten states.”'<sup id="cite_ref-393" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-393">[393]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><dl><dd>"In 1998, Angkor Borei villagers began removing earth from the southern slope of the Wat Komnou mound to flatten this area for additional house lots. During the process, workmen accidentally uncovered human bones and associated artifacts. District officers halted these efforts, but not before the workmen had exposed at least eleven skeletons (and quite possibly more). Workmen described extended and flexed burials; some agglomerations of ash and bone fragments that might represent cremations were also recovered. It was immediately upslope of this area that LOMAP crew members began to excavate a 2 x 3 meter unit in January 1999. By early March, they reached a depth of ca. 4 meters below the mounds's surface, and recovered partial remains of at least 18 individuals (fig. III-5). Because this collection awaits technical study at the University of Hawai'i, their interpretation is provisional at present.</dd>
<dd>"Most burials recovered through the 1999 excavations were inhumations (fig. III-6), with some possible secondary burials that comprised discrete bundles of human bones. Mortuary goods generally included either pig crania, globular red earthenware jars, or both. Radiocarbon samples from the cemetery have not yet been submitted, but this cemetery includes at least two of the four Fu Nan mortuary practices that the Chinese described in the fifth and sixth centuries CE: "burial by fire" (presumably cremation) and "burial by earth" (presumably inhumation) (Pelliot 1903: 270). The remaining two techniques (disposal in the river and disposal in the fields) are not easily archaeologically visible.

Monumental architecture that predates the seventh century was unknown in the Mekong Delta until recently (Briggs, 1951, p. 34). Parmentier (1933) recorded brick structures at the seventh century site of Sambor Prei Kuk (Kampong Thorn province); sites in Vietnam's Mekong Delta also contain brick architecture (Le Xuan Diem et al., 1995) but few chronometric data are available for these structures. The abundance of such structures at Angkor Borei and glimpses of their construction [revealed through deep (2- to 5-m), illicit shafts that villagers have sunk in nearly every mapped structure on the site] prompted us to explore these brick monuments. The reason for these illicit soundings became clear through interviews with villagers, who described caches of gold leaf, amulets, and other precious materials from the bases of these structures.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>"From Angkor Borei come three vessel forms that may have served ritual roles: Fine orangeware cups, pedestaled vases, and <i>kendi</i>-spouted vessels. Vast numbers of fine orangeware cups were made and discarded at Angkor Borei; caste-related and/or ritual activities in India that use drinking containers only once to ensure purity, described by Malleret (1960: 95), present an intriguing analogue. Pedestaled vases and ring-based globular jars were recovered from human burials during the 1999 excavations at a cemetery in the center of Angkor borei, and clearly played some sort of mortuary role. Historically, the <i>kendi</i> is a ritual vessel used to sprinkle lustral water in Brahmanic or Buddhistic ceremonies, to serve wine, and to administer medicine (Khoo Joo Ee 1991: 3-4)." <sup id="cite_ref-401" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-401">[401]</a></sup></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><dl><dd>"Present levels of knowledge make it impossible to be certain about when Buddhism first arrived in Cambodia. The evidence is “at best sketchy” (Skilling 1997, 93), but around forty carved buddha images from the Mekong Delta region and from areas of Thailand associated with Funan have been found in a variety of materials, including stone, wood, glass, clay, bone, and metal. Their iconography is varied. Given the concentration of finds around Wat Romlok, near Phnom Da, this area has been regarded as a focus of Buddhist cult activity, although both Angkor Borei and Tra Vinh Province in Vietnam must also have been important (Bhattacharya 1961, 18). Dating must remain tentative, but other significant discoveries include a fine standing buddha in varamudrà, probably dating from the seventh century, discovered at Tuol Tahoy, Kompong Speu Province; two images of buddhas in parinirvà¢a, dating from the fifth-sixth centuries, one from Oc Eo and the other from Angkor Borei; and a roughly contemporary image of the Buddha seated under a multiheaded nàga, also from Angkor Borei.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>"Just as the Vishnu-oriented inscriptions are among the oldest extant epigraphy in Southeast Asia, the same deity accounts for the earliest known anthropomorphic images from the region. These four-armed mitred Vishnu images, most of which probably date from between the fifth and seventh (or perhaps eighth) centuries, have been found throughout coastal Southeast Asia: in peninsular Thailand, in western Java, at the site of Kota Kapur in the province of South Sumatra (island of Bangka), and in the Mekong River valley of present-day southern Cambodia and Vietnam. It is the latter group, consisting of over thirty sculptures, that is most relevant to this paper. In contrast, only one pre-ninth-century image of Vishnu, the Vishnu of Kompong Cham Kau (Stung Treng Province), is known to have come from northern Cambodia.</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p><i>Ritual objects</i>

<dl><dd><dl><dd>Gold leaves decorated "with deities, turtles representing Vishnu and his mount the eagle Garuda, water buffaloes, elephants, snakes, conch shells, the sun, a house on piles and plants; many of these symbols relate to Hindi gods." <sup id="cite_ref-407" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-407">[407]</a></sup></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>"On the other hand, it is interesting to note that several ancient Sanskrit texts on architecture and ritual mention a number of consecration ceremonies that involve depositing several objects in the foundation of a building (usually a temple) and under the pedestal of an image of a deity (for an overview of these texts, see Ślączka 2007). These objects are just like those discovered at Go Thap: they include images of lotus flowers, turtles, bulls, elephants, weapons, and so forth; the guardians of the directions and their symbolism play an important role here; the items are often made of gold or gold leaf; and they are frequently deposited together with precious stones, seeds and plants. It is also interesting to add that during a consecration ceremony known as prathameshthaka- nyasa--the placing of the first bricks--the aforementioned items are deposited in the middle of four bricks, forming a square. The texts describing this ceremony date from a later period than the finds of Go Thap, for which various dates are given, but never later than 600 AD (Dao Linh Côn 1997:116: 380-430 CE; Higham 2001:29-31: 400-600 CE; Lê Thị Liên 2005:153: before 5th century CE)1. Yet, the tradition of depositing precious items among four bricks is probably more ancient than the available texts, and the connection with the Sanskrit texts is, in my opinion, certainly worth attention. [...]</dd>
<dd>"On the basis of these arguments, I propose the hypothesis that the brick structures excavated in Go Thap are not tombs, but foundations of wooden (now deteriorated) Hindu shrines, and the gold leaves found there are remains of consecration deposits, whose installation was directly or indirectly inspired by the Indian ritual tradition as described in the Sanskrit manuals. As such, they belong to the larger Hindu-Buddhist tradition of temple building and temple consecration that prevailed in Southeast Asia until roughly the 16th century AD." <sup id="cite_ref-408" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-408">[408]</a></sup></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>"There is no doubting that Indian gods were adopted with enthusiasm by the leaders, who also assumed resounding Sanskrit names, such as Jayavarman, protégé of victory, or Rudravarman, protégé of Siva. [...] When these very sites were identified by archaeologists, they uncovered brick foundations for temples and cremation cemeteries containing golden plaques bearing Buddhist religious texts. On occasion, wooden statues of the Buddha have been dredged from the delta mud. A burial mound at Go Thap, which was occupied during the sixth century ad, contained brick‐lined pits containing human cremations. Three hundred and twenty‐two gold leaves were found, decorated with images of Hindu gods. A turtle represents Visnu; an eagle, his mount, Garuda. A second such cemetery at Nen Chua incorporated a large brick and stone building that housed a stone linga or phallus, symbolizing potency and regeneration as well as a trinity of Hindu gods (Le Xuan Diem et al. 1995)".<sup id="cite_ref-409" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-409">[409]</a></sup> Inhumation traditions are changed at this time to cremation. <sup id="cite_ref-410" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-410">[410]</a></sup>  NOTE: data from ethnographic studies suggest that there was a pre-Indian religious stratum that was eventually merged with Indian religions to become what today comprises the Khmer world view. In Khmer culture the world is divided into two landscapes that are marked by physical and psychological borders: the landscape of the village (srok) and the landscape of the wilderness (prei). The srok is the domesticated space of humans; the village, the paddy rice fields, a space of social organization <sup id="cite_ref-411" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-411">[411]</a></sup> that is under the control of a Buddhist king  <sup id="cite_ref-412" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-412">[412]</a></sup>. The prei, on the other hand, is the forest, a place of uncertainty dominated by wild and dangerous spirits <sup id="cite_ref-413" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-413">[413]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-414" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-414">[414]</a></sup> beyond the control of Buddhism. This division is not immutable: forests can be cleared to create new srok, and a village may be overtaken by the forest and regain its position as prei. This perception of the world has been identified as the pre-Indian stratum of Khmer culture <sup id="cite_ref-415" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-415">[415]</a></sup>. The term srok is recorded in the inscriptions as sruk, and defines a geographical/administrative entity. <sup id="cite_ref-416" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-416">[416]</a></sup> Currently, the person in charge of establishing dialogues and interactions with the spirits is known as rup <sup id="cite_ref-417" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-417">[417]</a></sup>. It is therefore possible to suggest that before merging Indian and local religions, the early Funanese people may have had a structured religious world view with levels, that is, with the presence of particular people who could act as intermediaries with the spirits. These hierarchical levels increased as the cult to Indian gods were incorporated. (VW's guess). Vickery concluded, in his 1998 analysis, that the pre-Angkor religious thought and practice could not be reconstructed at all: "it must be emphasized that the intention of this chapter is not to describe the 'religion' of pre-Angkor Cambodia, or Khmer religion, a task which may be impossible on the extant evidence." Apparently, the inscriptions available are not concerned with the description of the cults, as they deal with practical matters. <sup id="cite_ref-418" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-418">[418]</a></sup>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ dental modification ♥</b> Evidence for intentional dental modification at the sites of Phum Snay and Phum Sophy, Cambodia, c. 2500-1500 BP. Both ablation and filing would have been painful: the former, in particular, would likely have involved knocking out teeth, as opposed to pulling them out (which, of course, would also have been painful), since the roots are sometimes still present in the sockets. It is not very clear why people had their teeth removed or filed—the sample is a bit too small to discern statistically sturdy patterns. However, the following (weak) patterns were found: men were more likely to have gone through the ritual than women; at one site, adults were more likely to have gone through the ritual than individuals under 18, while at the other people under 18 had different dental modification pattern to people over 18; the ritual appears to have no links with status. Moreover, because the two sites have somewhat different patterns of dental modification, the latter may have been part of rituals meant to mark people as belonging to a specific ethnic group or community. Another possibility is that tooth filing was part of marriage rituals—this would be supported by regional ethnography. And, finally, it is possible that many, if not all of these were reasons why people had their teeth removed or filed—to mark different stages or events in their life. <sup id="cite_ref-495" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-495">[495]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Frequency per participant ♣ once per generation ♥</b> 3-4 times in a lifetime  "Evidence from both sites could perhaps suggest that there is an age‐related factor behind this ritual. This may include practising ablation at significant periods of life such as early adulthood, marriage or death of a relative. Harunari (1973 cited in Han &amp; Nakahashi, 1996) suggest that premolars were extracted as a sign of mourning in Japan, the upper canines to mark adulthood and the mandibular teeth as a sign of marriage. The asymmetrical patterns at Phum Snay and Sophy may also represent a stage in the process of ablation that would eventually lead to removal of teeth in a symmetrical pattern. However, the final result had not been attained as death came first. Alternatively, the individual may not have been entitled to the removal of particular teeth until they had met the requirements such as marriage, birth of a child or death of a particular relative. The patterns of filing in the maxilla also support this idea, with a possible progression pattern of filing (from patterns A through to C, Table 3) although this is not related to age, it may be related to eligibility. The change from pattern A to B and B to C involve the filing of only one or two additional surfaces, all moving to involve more distal teeth.</dd>
<dd>"Eligibility may also have been dependent on status or position within the community. The status of an individual dictated how many times a person had their teeth modified in the Dyak people of Borneo. For example, the headman may have up to three treatments coinciding with various life events, while a priest‐doctor may only have two (Jones, 2001). This group used a combination of teeth filing and blackening, creating a similar appearance to the Cambodian samples, with the additional involvement of central incisors and pre- molars (Jones, 2001). The severity of the filing varied amongst tribes, and in some only women had their teeth filed whereas men underwent other types of dental modification (Jones, 2001)." <sup id="cite_ref-496" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-496">[496]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b>♠ Typical size of participating group ♣ 2 ♥</b> Two seems like a reasonable guess for the <i>minimum</i> number of participants--the one having their teeth removed and/or filed, and the one in charge of the operation. However, it may well be that a number of people subjected themselves to this ritual at the same time, as in Du Bois' 1944 account of adolescent initiation rituals on Alor</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Inclusiveness (ritual specialist) ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Inclusiveness (participants) ♣ whole polity ♥</b> "All adult age groups were affected by ablation (Table 1). In the Phum Snay sample there was a general increase of ablation with advancing age in both the maxilla and mandible. In the mandibular sample from Phum Sophy, only older adults showed ablation, while the maxilla was affected more in younger and older adults. Overall, with both samples combined, there was a general increase of the prevalence of ablation with advancing age but not to a statistically significant level (Table 1)." <sup id="cite_ref-497" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-497">[497]</a></sup> "The association between dental modification and grave goods as a tenuous proxy measure of status can only be investigated for six individuals from the Phum Snay excavations; all six had ablation. There were, in general, two patterns of ablation in these individuals (patterns 1 and 9 together and pattern 2 only). In regards to status, no link could be made between dental modification pattern and grave goods. There were a number of distinctive grave goods such as a large sunbear canine contained in the graves of two men, ceramic epaulettes with one man and one woman, long iron swords in three male graves and iron torques in two female graves (O’Reilly et al., 2006). However, no patterns between these grave goods and their patterns of ablation could be discerned. Such links with grave goods were also not evident at the Thai sites of Khok Phanom Di (Tayles, 1996) or Noen U‐Loke (Nelsen et al., 2001). There was one unique individual from Phum Snay who had filing and ablation (PS03 B2). This was one of the two men with a sunbear canine and quite a large range and quantity of grave goods including a long iron sword, other weaponry and many whole pots suggesting high status within the community (O’Reilly et al., 2006)." <sup id="cite_ref-498" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-498">[498]</a></sup></dd>

This refers to the Angkorian period, but it seems to be applicable to earlier periods. (RA's guess).

<p><b>♠ Rulers are legitimated by gods ♣ present ♥</b> 'Thus, after consolidating his position, whether by force or by offering access to new economic and culturally meaningful resources, the successful Southeast Asian chief would begin to practice Hindu asceticism to further enhance the local perception of his spiritual superiority. The local ruler’s ascetic achievements and ritual performances demonstrated his close relationship not only with the indigenous ancestors and spirits, but also with the celestial and universal Indic deities. In the early Southeast Asian polities the most significant of these deities was the god Siva, whom early mainland inscriptions depict as not only the source of fertility but also the patron of ascetic meditation and the supreme lord of the universe. Rulers of ascetic achievement were characterized in their inscriptions as Siva’s spiritual authorities on earth, and since Siva’s authority over all that exists was absolute, in theory the rulers’ own powers on earth had no limit (Tingley: 2009, 132, 144). The ruler’s claims to partake of divinity took his followers beyond their existing relationships with ancestors and local chthonic spirits, holding out the potential rewards of a relationship with an omnipotent Indian divine. Due to the political attractiveness of these notions, Southeast Asia’s early rulers focused not on the development of state institutions of secular scholarship, but rather on the institution of religious cults that allowed followers to draw inspiration on the leader’s spiritual relationships. Local populations responded by rallying behind these spiritually endowed leaders, who were supported by a blend of local and Indian cultural symbols and values. Successful leaders were therefore able to use these symbols and values to mobilize local populations for various intraregional adventures.'<sup id="cite_ref-656" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-656">[656]</a></sup> 'Most early Southeast Asian rulers borrowed from Hinduism the idea that the king was the representative on earth of the great god Shiva (or more rarely Vishnu). Prosperity depended on the extent to which an earthly kingdom reflected the heavenly realm of the gods. The more nearly this was achieved, the closer the identity between king and god, and the greater the power of the king. Kings thus set out to recreate in microcosm the macrocosmic geography of the divine realm, with the palace at the centre representing the abode of the gods on Mount Meru, the world axis. The impressive rituals at which they officiated only added to their aura of cosmic power. Belief in karma and reincarnation provided further legitimisation. Karma as an inexorable natural law of moral cause and effect provided an explanation for both individual fortune and social status. The king ruled as king because through previous lifetimes he had accumulated the necessary karma to do so. In this way karma powerfully reinforced social hierarchy, for everyone was born into the social situation they deserved.'<sup id="cite_ref-657" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-657">[657]</a></sup> 'Both sought to maximise power through manipulation of ideologies of legitimation and world order.

Before the wedding ceremony, Kaundinya gave the dragon-princess clothes to wear and in exchange her father, a mighty dragon-lord, enlarged her dowry by drinking up the water that covered the land. He also built them a fine capital and changed the name of the country to Kambuja. It is tempting to see in the story of a blessing from an existing overlord the origin of the water-control schemes that were needed to sustain cultivation at Angkor, in the drier interior. The dragon-lord’s lowering of the flood waters patently recalls the annual rise and fall of the Tonle Sap, an agricultural lifeline that was supplemented by the digging of massive reservoirs around the Khmer capital." <sup id="cite_ref-661" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-661">[661]</a></sup>

As we will also see it differs, in some degree, from region to region. However, the concepts of varna and, more importantly, jati lie at the heart of the caste system and they form an ideal core around which the complexity of detail and difference can then be erected. [...] Thus the four varnas are the Brahmins who represent priesthood and learning, the Kshatriyas who represent the warriors and kings, who protect the people, the Vaishyas who represent the people who engage in agriculture, farming and trade, and the Shudras who represent the servants who look after and serve the others. The Brahmins fulfil the function of the mouth, the Kshatriyas fulfil the function of the arms, the Vaishyas fulfil the function of the thighs, and the Shudras fulfil the function of the feet. The model is clearly a hierarchy but it is a complementary hierarchy and unity, wherein the different elements sustain one another. [...]In practice the key to the caste system are the sub-castes, or jatis. There are a great number of these in each varna, and in practice there is a hierarchy within each set so that only certain jatis can marry and eat with each other. Not all Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas or Shudras can marry or eat together. Those privileges are confined to a limited number of jatis within each varna. [...] Clearly there have been changes in the system over long centuries. Particular jatis have elevated themselves through economic means, through disputing status, through propaganda, through moving, through changing religion, and so on. But on the whole, over such a long period of time, the system has remained strong, especially in the villages. [...] The strength of the caste system has been enhanced by another principle emphasised by Dumont (1980) in his classical work entitled ‘’Homo Hierarchicus: The Caste System and its Implications’’. According to Dumont, in addition to the distinctions already outlined that fit varnas and jatis into hierarchies, another must be added. This distinction takes caste hierarchical divides beyond the kind of class distinctions found in eighteenth-century Britain or in the Ancien Regime in Europe, by stressing the opposition between purity and pollution. Caste difference, according to this classification, goes beyond class differences into this other realm of ritual purity and pollution. The Brahmins are the highest and purest varna, and the Dalits are the lowest, in that they are outside varna and are impure altogether. The other varnas rank in between. Pollution occurs in different ways. It occurs through bodily contact of one sort or another, with menstrual cycles, through birth and death, through emissions such as faeces, urine and saliva, and through contact with night-soil, dirty clothes, unswept rooms and so on. Thus marriage and sex have to function within the correct set of jatis in the correct varna. Polluting jobs such as laundering and sweeping are done by people of lower castes so that the blood of people of higher castes can remain ‘pure’. Equally menstrual activity among older women makes them more ‘impure’ than men or pre-menstrual virgins, and therefore women are more polluting than men. They will thus often live semi-separately while menstruating, during which time they will also avoid going to the temple and therefore ‘polluting’ the gods. Furthermore, untouchable Dalits were prohibited from entering many temples before the post-Independence freedom-of-temple-entry legislation and even now they are kept out of some temples in many villages. [...] It is also true to say that Dumont’s thesis suffers from exaggeration and other matters are important in discussing caste. Nevertheless, there is at least an element of truth in the notion that purity and pollution has relevance in any discussion of caste.” <sup id="cite_ref-671" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-671">[671]</a></sup></dd>

At the religious level of deity the Goddess is very important, even though she is served mainly by male priests, but at the worldly level of the caste system women are subordinate to men. [...] In the system of Hindu law known as the Manusmriti, divine sanction was given to the caste system. According to it, women are not within the orbit of the Veda which applies to men only. Women are not allowed to be initiated or to receive the sacred thread. They pollute through menstruation, they are dependent on men and their job is to bear children, especially sons. A woman’s husband is her ‘god’.

<dd> <b>♠ Ideological thought distinguishes elites and commoners ♣ present ♥</b> "The Hinduism that flourished in Southeast Asia emphasized reincarnation, the accumulation of a balance sheet weighing the consequences of an individual’s actions through the procession of lives (karma), the impermanent nature of reality, ritual practices, hereditary social classes (called in India the caste system by later observers), and the powerful role of the priestly caste, known as brahmans." <sup id="cite_ref-674" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-674">[674]</a></sup> "There have been a number of attempts to underplay, to question, and to lampoon the hierarchical inequality and even the existence of the caste system. As we will also see it differs, in some degree, from region to region. However, the concepts of varna and, more importantly, jati lie at the heart of the caste system and they form an ideal core around which the complexity of detail and difference can then be erected. [...] Thus the four varnas are the Brahmins who represent priesthood and learning, the Kshatriyas who represent the warriors and kings, who protect the people, the Vaishyas who represent the people who engage in agriculture, farming and trade, and the Shudras who represent the servants who look after and serve the others. The Brahmins fulfil the function of the mouth, the Kshatriyas fulfil the function of the arms, the Vaishyas fulfil the function of the thighs, and the Shudras fulfil the function of the feet. The model is clearly a hierarchy but it is a complementary hierarchy and unity, wherein the different elements sustain one another. [...]In practice the key to the caste system are the sub-castes, or jatis. There are a great number of these in each varna, and in practice there is a hierarchy within each set so that only certain jatis can marry and eat with each other. Not all Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas or Shudras can marry or eat together. Those privileges are confined to a limited number of jatis within each varna. [...] Clearly there have been changes in the system over long centuries. Particular jatis have elevated themselves through economic means, through disputing status, through propaganda, through moving, through changing religion, and so on. But on the whole, over such a long period of time, the system has remained strong, especially in the villages. [...] The strength of the caste system has been enhanced by another principle emphasised by Dumont (1980) in his classical work entitled ‘’Homo Hierarchicus: The Caste System and its Implications’’. According to Dumont, in addition to the distinctions already outlined that fit varnas and jatis into hierarchies, another must be added. This distinction takes caste hierarchical divides beyond the kind of class distinctions found in eighteenth-century Britain or in the Ancien Regime in Europe, by stressing the opposition between purity and pollution. Caste difference, according to this classification, goes beyond class differences into this other realm of ritual purity and pollution. The Brahmins are the highest and purest varna, and the Dalits are the lowest, in that they are outside varna and are impure altogether. The other varnas rank in between. Pollution occurs in different ways. It occurs through bodily contact of one sort or another, with menstrual cycles, through birth and death, through emissions such as faeces, urine and saliva, and through contact with night-soil, dirty clothes, unswept rooms and so on. Thus marriage and sex have to function within the correct set of jatis in the correct varna. Polluting jobs such as laundering and sweeping are done by people of lower castes so that the blood of people of higher castes can remain ‘pure’. Equally menstrual activity among older women makes them more ‘impure’ than men or pre-menstrual virgins, and therefore women are more polluting than men. They will thus often live semi-separately while menstruating, during which time they will also avoid going to the temple and therefore ‘polluting’ the gods. Furthermore, untouchable Dalits were prohibited from entering many temples before the post-Independence freedom-of-temple-entry legislation and even now they are kept out of some temples in many villages. [...] It is also true to say that Dumont’s thesis suffers from exaggeration and other matters are important in discussing caste. Nevertheless, there is at least an element of truth in the notion that purity and pollution has relevance in any discussion of caste.” <sup id="cite_ref-675" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-675">[675]</a></sup></dd>

At the religious level of deity the Goddess is very important, even though she is served mainly by male priests, but at the worldly level of the caste system women are subordinate to men. [...] In the system of Hindu law known as the Manusmriti, divine sanction was given to the caste system. According to it, women are not within the orbit of the Veda which applies to men only. Women are not allowed to be initiated or to receive the sacred thread. They pollute through menstruation, they are dependent on men and their job is to bear children, especially sons.

In this, Hindu law is similar to Islamic law in approach, as well as to Chinese law and African laws, all of which tolerate polygamy to some extent. Meyer (1952: 108) wrote that (p.378) polygamy in India is ‘as old as the hills and does not form the slightest offence in the Brahmanic system’, although since Vedic times monogamy is seen as the ideal. This is confirmed by Mitra (1965: 49) with quotes from earlier sources, to the effect that ‘the fundamental conception of marriage was monogamous and not polygamous’. M. Basu (2001: 28)summarizes the traditional position: ‘Vedic literature generally endorsed monogamy and [it] was considered the best practice of the highest virtue. However, polygamy was also in practice, especially among the nobles. A number of such instances of polygamy are available not only in later Vedic literature, but also in the Rig Veda.’” <sup id="cite_ref-680" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-680">[680]</a></sup>

For example, the Law of Manu (X:63) argues that non-injury, truth, not stealing, purity and control of the senses summarise dharma for the four castes. Elsewhere Manu (VI:91- 2) asserts that avoiding backbiting, hypocrisy, greed, infatuation, anger and discontent is approved dharma for all the stages of life. The problem is that there are different views as to what the actuality of universal dharma is. Radhakrishnan, for example, argues for a sanatana dharma, based upon Advaita Vedanta thought, that is said to be present in all religious traditions. It is a kind of perennial philosophy that is at the heart of every religious tradition not just at the heart of the Hindu tradition. Others concentrate upon a universal dharma within the Hindu tradition itself but there is no absolute consensus as to what it is.

[...] The three gods most commonly worshipped as the ultimate in Hindu traditions are Viṣṇu, Śiva, and the Goddess, variously called Devī, “Goddess,” and Śakti, “Power.” This triad of deities must be distinguished from an overlapping group of three deities who are conceived in the Purāṇas and other authoritative traditions to perform particular cosmic functions-Brahmā, who creates the universe anew in each vast cosmic cycle, and also, in some accounts, bestows the Veda upon humanity; Viṣṇu, who preserves the universe by intervening to rectify problems through his avatāras, “descents” or “incarnations”; and Śiva, who destroys the universe at the end of each cosmic cycle. [...] [W]hichever deity is conceived as the ultimate is understood to be the source who emanates the others, both the triad who perform the aforementioned cosmic functions and lower supernatural beings, and thus to be the ultimate agent in their actions. [...] There are numerous other important deities besides those frequently conceived as a monotheistic ultimate. One of the most important of these is Ganeṣa, a son of Śiva with the head of an elephant, believed to be a protective figure that removes obstacles. Another is Hanumān, the monkey-god who helped Rāma in his battle against Rāvaṇa, idealized for his devotion to Rāma and Sītā.

They are, in theory if not always in fact, the key scholars in the Hindu tradition. The Kshatriyas have traditionally been seen, again in theory if not always in practice, as the rulers who maintain society, uphold dharma and protect the householder system. They built and sponsored temples, protected their subjects and their deities and, to that extent, the Brahmins recognised a ruler’s overlordship. However, the kingly role in ruling and guardianship duties involved more ‘polluting tendencies’ than were usual in a Brahmin’s life. The Brahmins have had a dual role in society. Those who are active priests in temples have engaged in functions that involve being given gifts by worshippers and such temple priests are more involved with lower castes. Paradoxically Brahmins who are versed in promoting scholarship and in advancing religious learning but who do not act as serving priests are, in general, more widely admired because they have less contact with the public. Thus Brahmins who are not priests can be more akin to those renouncers engaged in lifelong learning and spirituality, rather than in the hurly-burly of householder life.

According to Dumont, in addition to the distinctions already outlined that fit varnas and jatis into hierarchies, another must be added. This distinction takes caste hierarchical divides beyond the kind of class distinctions found in eighteenth-century Britain or in the Ancien Regime in Europe, by stressing the opposition between purity and pollution. Caste difference, according to this classification, goes beyond class differences into this other realm of ritual purity and pollution. The Brahmins are the highest and purest varna, and the Dalits are the lowest, in that they are outside varna and are impure altogether. The other varnas rank in between. Pollution occurs in different ways. It occurs through bodily contact of one sort or another, with menstrual cycles, through birth and death, through emissions such as faeces, urine and saliva, and through contact with night-soil, dirty clothes, unswept rooms and so on. Thus marriage and sex have to function within the correct set of jatis in the correct varna. Polluting jobs such as laundering and sweeping are done by people of lower castes so that the blood of people of higher castes can remain ‘pure’. Equally menstrual activity among older women makes them more ‘impure’ than men or pre-menstrual virgins, and therefore women are more polluting than men. They will thus often live semi-separately while menstruating, during which time they will also avoid going to the temple and therefore ‘polluting’ the gods. Furthermore, untouchable Dalits were prohibited from entering many temples before the post-Independence freedom-of-temple-entry legislation and even now they are kept out of some temples in many villages. [...] It is also true to say that Dumont’s thesis suffers from exaggeration and other matters are important in discussing caste. Nevertheless, there is at least an element of truth in the notion that purity and pollution has relevance in any discussion of caste.” <sup id="cite_ref-721" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-721">[721]</a></sup></dd>

The householder’s business is the maintenance and support of those in the other three stages of life: the students who have not yet entered into the world of work, the retirees who have seen the birth of grandchildren and spotted their first gray hairs, and the renunciants, those who have left behind not only the world of work and material possession but who have also left behind family and self-interest for a life focused on spiritual freedom. Householders are the ones with material wealth, and their responsibility, their dharma, is to share it with others. [...] The link between the world of the householder and the world of the renunciant is gift giving - dana. The classic image is of the renouncer with the begging bowl, making the rounds for alms. On a daily basis, in Hindu society, food is given to sannyasins and sadhus, the world renouncers who have "cast off" from the settled world of "this shore."<sup id="cite_ref-724" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-724">[724]</a></sup> However, no evidence could be found for actual enforcement of this behaviour--e.g. punishment for not giving food to renouncers.

<dd><b>♠ Ritual buildings/spaces ♣ present ♥</b> A mandapa -Indian pillared outdoor hall or pavilion for public rituals- was identified at Oc Eo. Malleret describes the structure, of unknown height, based on an analysis of its foundations. The structure is enclosed within another, and a few other examples are found in pre-angkorian Cambodia, in Sambúr-Prei Kuk, in Hàn Cei, in Trapan Kuk and near Aiikor Bcîrei, in Phnom Dà and in Asram Mahà Rosëi.  "Un essai d'anastylose en miniature nous a permis de reconstituer sur maquette le schéma du monument. Les dalles s'assemblent par tenons et mortaises. Celles qui présentent des moulures s'associent de façon à constituer une sorte de coupole sur plan carré comportant deux pignons avec des versants à profil convexe antérieurement portés par des pannes dont on discerne au moins deux logements. La surface couverte par cet ensemble correspondait à une dalle servant de plafond à une cellule dont la base reposait sur le massif de briques. La hauteur de celle-ci nous est inconnue, aucune des dalles périphériques ne nous étant parvenue complète. Elle enfermait probablement la cuve de faible dépression et se trouvait en retrait vers le fond, ce qui permettrait d'y avoir accès. Les parois de cette cellule reposaient directement sur la partie la plus épaisse des murailles de briques ce qui assurait une répartition judicieuse de la pression, mais leur association par un assemblage inspiré directement de la menuiserie ne leur assurait qu'une solidité précaire et là encore, il semble que l'on se trouve en présence d'une expérience malhabile. Quoi qu'il en soit, il n'y a guère à hésiter sur l'identification de la cellule avec un mandapa, type de construction enclose dans une autre dont on connaît quelques exemples dans le Cambodge pré-angkorien, notamment à Sambúr-Prei Kuk, à Hàn Cei, Trapan Kuk et tout près d'Aiikor Bcîrei, au Phnom Dà et à l'Asram Mahà Rosëi." <sup id="cite_ref-775" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-775">[775]</a></sup></dd>

<p>NOTE ON THE DATA USED IN THIS SECTION (RA): The changing social and environmental structure during this time may have influenced the level of violence in the area. The occupation at Phum Snay coincides with time the Funan polity was beginning to decline in the south, while the northern Chenla period was gaining power (O'Reilly, 2007). The unstable environment during the late Iron Age (Boyd &amp; McGrath, 2001b), probably increased stressors for people as availability of food and water resources would have been limited and unpredictable. Evidence from the increased amount of violence at Phum Snay suggests a significant change to the social structure at the site during this period. The Phum Snay community may have been forced to fight against elements of the Chenla period since the eventual Chenla model encompassed the geographical location of Phum Snay.<sup id="cite_ref-784" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-784">[784]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>Mortality</b>
</p>
<dl><dd> <b>♠ Life expectancy ♣ unknown ♥</b></dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Infant mortality ♣ high ♥</b> Neolithic populations witnessed an increasing fertility rate coinciding with an increase on agricultural reliance. Fertility rates can be determined using the juvenile - adult ratio and mean child mortality rates (e.g. Domett &amp; Tayles, 2006a). There was an increase of fertility in prehistoric Vietnam (Domett &amp; Oxenham, 2011; McDonell &amp; Oxenham, 2012; Oxenham et al., 2008), specifically during Neolithic Vietnam (Willis &amp; Oxenham, 2013), which consequently appears to correspond to a decline of health. Oxenham et al. (2006, p. 283) suggests a decline of oral health with the intensification of agriculture. Evidence of increased fertility is noted at such sites as Khok Phanom Di (Tayles, 1999) and Man Bac (McDonell &amp; Oxenham, 2012; Oxenham et al., 2008), and rates of increased child mortality during this period also suggest an increasing population (Jackes, 1994), also evident in Ban Non Wat’s population. [...] In addition, Halcrow et al. (2008) suggest a large number of infant deaths take place at or around the time of birth at the Neolithic site of Khok Phanom Di. These maternal complications might be linked with the decline of oral health and corresponding poor health, especially by younger females during the Neolithic.<sup id="cite_ref-785" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-785">[785]</a></sup></dd></dl>

She had one of the shortest statures ever recorded for prehistoric Southeast Asia at only 143.5cm; the shortest being a female from Khok Phanom Di at 141cm (Tayles, 1999). Analysis of her dental health showed the highest amount of linear enamel hypoplasia of all the Ban Non Wat women examined, which would have affected her around 2.5-3 years of age. Perhaps unfavourable conditions within her original community led to her departure, such as malnutrition or disease, as she displays evidence of poor health. Her ill health might have continued into young adulthood, as she died at a young age. Alternatively, she may have been forced to relocate communities, or left the area for marriage purposes. However, it appears she may have integrated well into the Ban Non Wat community based on her mortuary goods and treatment." <sup id="cite_ref-788" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-788">[788]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<p><b>♠ Wages ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> it is more likely that work was exchanged for products, since there was no apparent coinage system. RA's guess. See below.
</p><p><b>♠ staple cost of principal source of carbohydrates ♣ 5 ounces of silver and 1 yau of double cloth ♥</b> "the exchange goods given for the land and other gifts is paddy but its value is expressed in terms of silver and cloth which thus appear to have almost monetary value. [...] 'A rice field near the tank of Devacila. The barter for it is paddy. The value of this is 5 ounces of silver and a yau of double cloth'. <sup id="cite_ref-826" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-826">[826]</a></sup>. Although this references are from the late Funanese period, it suggests that there was a developed exchange system that equated the value of items in reference to cloth and silver. In this case we know that an undetermined amount of paddy (unmilled rice) given in exchange for a piece of land had the equivalent value of 5 ounces of silver and 1 yau of double cloth. (RA's guess). Further more, inscriptions inform that honey was used to buy oil, cloth to buy syrup, and cotton to buy ginger conserve. <sup id="cite_ref-827" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-827">[827]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Top fortune ♣ unknown ♥</b>
</p><p><b>♠ Other wealth distribution ♣ inferred present ♥</b>The absence of coins in later polities, such as Pagan and Angkor, is attributed to the redistribution of surplus wealth through the temples and monasteries, rather than the royal courts (Gutman 1978: 8-10)'<sup id="cite_ref-828" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-828">[828]</a></sup>
