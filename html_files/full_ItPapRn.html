In addition, the almost completely secular orientation of the late fifteenth and early sixteenth-century popes was directly responsible for the Protestant Reformation, which would mark one of the greatest challenges to papal power the Church had ever faced.

Goldthwaite has argued that the papacy's return to Rome in 1378 inaugurated a phase of economic growth for the Rome and its hinterland, reflecting Rome's dependence on the papacy, and not Lazio's productivity, to stimulate the economy.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> Before the sack of Rome in 1527 CE<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> the population had finally begun to grow again, from about 30,000 early in the 14th century to 55,000.
</p><p>The Renaissance Popes attempted to systematize and unify the financial administration of the Papal State. This meant ending financial and judicial immunities, and rolling back the power of locally powerful bishops and abbots.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> However, the vast bureaucracy the Pope oversaw was a fundamentally corrupt one, by the late 14th century founded on bribery, the sale of offices, and patronage politics.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> During the fifteenth century, the sale of offices within the <i>curia</i> became routinized; and Peterson has estimated that under Pope Leo X (1513-1521), two thousand offices were for sale in the city of Rome alone.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup>
</p><p>The papacy's ability to control the regions of the Papal States fluctuated dramatically during this period, especially during the Great Schism (1378-1417 CE).

</p><p>Papal palace complexes: The papal palaces in Rome-especially the Lateran and the Vatican-contained increasingly large bureaucracies, especially after the end of the Schism in 1417 and the return of a single, unitary papacy to Rome.
</p><p>1. Rome: Rome contained between 30,000 and 55,000 people during this period, and was unquestionably the largest city of the papal states.
</p>
<dl><dd>2. Large provincial cities: Bologna was the second city of the papal states in every way; next to Rome, it was the largest town, contained a venerable university, and was the socio-economic center of the Romagna region.<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>3. towns: Towns such as Ancona, Orvieto, or Terracina contained between 10,000 and 20,000 people, and often served as administrative centers for provincial government.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>4. villages: Market towns or small towns such as Iesi in the Marche region; these often were little more than a population center with a market, parish church, and the local lord's castle. An example of a small village of this nature which grew into a larger town is Loreto, also in le Marche: because of the shrine to the Holy House of the Virgin, it grew into a pilgrimage site during the 16th century.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

</p><p>1. Pope: The pope remained the head of a vast bureaucracy and leader of the papal state, despite ongoing weakness on the ground during the fifteenth century. Some popes, however, such as John XXIII and Julius II, were effective administrators and military leaders.
</p>
<dl><dd>2. Cardinals and legates: The cardinalate had increased in number from 24 (the limit set by the Council of Constance, 1414-1418) to 35 by 1500 or so.<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> By this period, the cardinals were a fundamental part of papal elections and crucial to the politics of the papal states. Legates-often, themselves, cardinals-handled diplomatic business outside of the papal states. The cardinals' palaces in Rome were in effect sub-headquarters of the papal bureaucracy.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>3. The <i>curia</i>: By the late 14th century, the papal bureaucracy had become a massive, complex machine founded on bribery, the sale of offices, and patronage politics.<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup> Papal officials operated in Avignon until 1378, returning with the papacy to Rome. During the fifteenth century, the sale of offices within the <i>curia</i> became routinized; Peterson has estimated that under Pope Leo X (1513-1521), two thousand offices were for sale in the city of Rome alone.<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>3.

<dl><dd> Partner has characterized the situation in the Papal State during the fifteenth century thus: "It remained true [in the mid-15th century] that the Papal State was divided into war-like little <i>signorie</i> to an extent unknown in any other region of Italy."<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup> These lordships relied on utilizing their male subjects as mercenary troops, as the Malatesta of Urbino. The popes could occasionally intervene against these petty lords, but the Papal State would not attain internal cohesion and administration (to a limited extent) until the sixteenth century. Despite this internal weakness, the papacy was strong enough that the Papal State was one of the five guarantor powers of the Peace of Lodi (1454), which established an unprecedented era of peace and cooperation between the Italian powers (the papacy, Florence, Milan, Venice, and the Kingdom of Naples).<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup></dd></dl></dd></dl>

</p><p><b> ♠ Religious levels ♣ 5 ♥ </b> Pope; Cardinals and legates; archbishops; bishops and abbots; parish priests and members of the religious orders; deacons.
</p><p>1. Pope: The pope was, of course, the universally-acknowledged leader of Latin Christendom. This does not contradict the fact that who exactly was the legitimate pope was often contested during the period 1378-1418, during the Great Schism. During this period the papacy arrogated to itself the right to appoint bishops, negating the tradition of bishops being elected by their flock in conjunction with the priesthood.<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup>
</p>
<dl><dd>2. Cardinals and legates: The cardinalate was crucial in theological decision-making and the religious aspects of papal government; legates, similarly, handled religious matters abroad on occasion.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>3. Archbishops: To a certain extent, archbishops were equivalent to cardinals, but there were more of them, distributed throughout Christendom. They supervised their suffragan bishops and bishoprics, while also overseeing their own (a good example is the Archbishop of Milan).</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>4. Bishops and abbots: Bishops were the crucial link between local religion and the papacy. There were 263 bishoprics in  14th century Italy.<sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup> Abbots sometimes played a role beyond the walls of their monasteries, although by this point once-powerful regional centers such as Farfa were in decline in Lazio.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>5. Parish priests and members of the religious orders: These constituted the mundane religious level. Parish priests embodied Christianity for their flock, for the most part, since they said Mass, heard confession and, in general, were (supposed to) serve as the quotidian face of the organized Church. Members of the religious orders (Franciscans, Dominicans, and so forth) also were a common part of the Church's presence, especially in the towns.<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p><b> ♠ Military levels ♣ 5 ♥ </b> Pope; legates and rectors; counts and <i>signori</i>; mercenary leaders; rank and file.
</p><p>1. Pope. The pope was the nominally supreme leader of all military efforts in the Papal States. Usually military campaigns were carried out by papally-appointed vicars or rectors such as Cardinal Albornoz, who was brutally effective in subduing le Marche and the Romagna in the 1350s and 1360s.<sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup>
</p>
<dl><dd>2. Legates, rectors:: These were usually the leaders of papal levies and conducted sieges, planned battles, and so forth. Functionally there was little difference between them and mercenary leaders employed by the papacy, although the legates were usually more loyal to the Church.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>3. counts, <i>signori</i>: There's a bit of fuzziness between this level and the "mercenary leader" level, since many ex-mercenaries set themselves up as petty lords within the Papal State.<sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>4. Mercenary leaders: The <i>condottieri</i>-men such as John Hawkwood-were notoriously unreliable. The Florentines were able to buy Hawkwood away from the Papacy in 1375 for 130,000 florins.<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup> Although standing armies were emerging by the mid-15th century,<sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup> mercenary bands were the most frequent military units in Italian warfare. The papacy, in fact, was the main employer of these mercenaries.<sup id="cite_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>5. Individual soldiers. Rank and file: These usually consisted of mercenaries with, perhaps, additions from local levies such as the Roman militia.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p><b> ♠ Occupational complexity ♣  ♥ </b>
</p><p><b> ♠ Professional military officers ♣ present ♥ </b> Although the papal armies during this period were usually under the overall command of papal rectors or legates, battlefield command was usually done by professionals, the <i>condottieri</i>: "...the Papal State [in 1378-80] was ruled by French officials and bishops and served largely by German mercenaries...."<sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup> Scions of the Roman baronial families were active on both sides in the Italian Wars.<sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Professional soldiers ♣ present ♥ </b> Although the papal armies contained feudal levies from allies, mercenaries comprised the greater part of most papal armies. These mercenaries, the <i>condottieri</i>, were notorious for changing sides, sometimes on the battlefield. During the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, papal armies were supplemented by French and Spanish troops, following the 1494 invasion of Italy.
</p><p>From 1378 until the end of the Great Schism in 1417, mercenary warbands, the <i>condottieri</i>, were often in control of the papal states.<sup id="cite_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup> Composed of foreign and Italian mercenaries, these companies refined extortion and betrayal to an art form.<sup id="cite_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup> Some of the most successful of these mercenaries set themselves up as lords (<i>signori</i>) in the Papal State, in particular in the Romagna.<sup id="cite_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup>

<p><b> ♠ Full-time bureaucrats ♣ present ♥ </b> The bureaucracy was composed largely of men who had purchased their offices, or procured them through nepotism and cronyism, but they served full time.
</p><p><b> ♠ Source of support ♣ state salary ♥ </b> The papal bureaucracy was supported by a mixture of taxation, bribery, and semi-feudal land grants, making it hard to make a hard and fast distinction between the possible codes. Furthermore, cronyism and nepotism ensured that papal officials rarely subsisted entirely on state-paid wages.
</p><p><b> ♠ Examination system ♣ absent ♥ </b>
</p><p><b> ♠ Merit promotion ♣ present ♥ </b> Patron-clientele networks, nepotism, and political considerations played a major role in advancement, yet merit was still a factor in the government of the Papal States; this was usually the determining criterion in the case of non-Italian bureaucrats and administrators, such as Cardinal Albornoz.<sup id="cite_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup> The code should be bracketed in the future, to reflect the existence of merit promotion within a general system in which nepotism and cronyism were the norm.

<dl><dd><b> ♠ irrigation systems ♣ present ♥ </b> Commercialization of rural hinterland began 1050-1100 CE. "This was the date of similar signs of agrarian development in eastern Lombardy, too, the hinterlands of Bergamo, Brescia, and Cremona. Here, François Menant points to the late eleventh and twelfth centuries as the moment of take-off for systematic irrigation, the development of vineyards on cleared land, the development of transhumant pastoralism, and, later in the twelfth century in the Cremonese, linen." <sup id="cite_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-60">[60]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b> ♠ drinking water supply systems ♣ inferred present ♥ </b>  The papacy restored and maintained aqueducts (from c800), among other buildings, which at the time "certainly attest to the very great wealth of the papacy in the early Carolingian period, and to the preparedness of popes to spend that wealth very ambitiously." <sup id="cite_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-61">[61]</a></sup> Inferred present on basis some Roman aqueducts maintained until early modern period.</dd>
<dd><b> ♠ markets ♣ present ♥ </b> Italy in general was, during this period, probably the most economically sophisticated part of Europe, and markets were to be found in all major cities of the Papal States and most of the towns, villages, and even small hamlets.<sup id="cite_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-62">[62]</a></sup></dd>

<p><b> ♠ Symbolic buildings ♣ present ♥ </b> The popes frequently refurbished, rebuilt, or expanded Roman-era monuments, in addition to setting up statuary in the subject towns of the Papal States. Furthermore, papal palaces were important symbols of papal power, as well as being central to papal coronation rituals.<sup id="cite_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup>
</p><p>Sistine Chapel and the construction of the new St. Peter's Basilica. <sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup>
</p><p>In the period immediately preceding the Sack, Rome was a major center of the Renaissance. Following the end of the Schism, successive popes attracted humanists to the Eternal City, notable among them Lorenzo Valla and Lapo da Castiglionchio.<sup id="cite_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup> The mid-15th century popes (especially Nicholas V and Pius II) were responsible for consolidating and opening the Vatican Library and large-scale cultural patronage. During Nicholas V's pontificate, Rome became the focus for more systematic building projects. These generally centered on the following areas:<sup id="cite_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-68">[68]</a></sup> Re-fortifying and strengthening the city's wall circuit; improvement and expansion of the city's water supplies; the administrative reorganization of the Borgo (a <i>rione</i> near the Vatican); refurbishment of the urban churches; and reconstruction of the various papal palaces. Sixtus IV ordered the construction of the Sistine Chapel, built between 1475-1481, one of the all-time most important Catholic buildings. Julius II (1503-1513) began St. Peter's Basilica, and his pontificate was one of the high points of the Roman Renaissance, which would definitively end with the 1527 Sack of Rome.
</p><p><b> ♠ Entertainment buildings ♣ {present; absent} ♥ </b>  "Desecularization" in late ancient and early medieval Christianity: "Christian churches multiplied in the towns; baths, theaters, and circuses disappeared."<sup id="cite_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-69">[69]</a></sup>  For example, by 10th Century the Roman Colosseum had been partially turned into a housing block.<sup id="cite_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-70">[70]</a></sup>
</p><p>However, "In the thirteenth century, plays developed that effectively recapitulated key moments of salvation history as recorded in the Bible; they must have functioned, therefore, as a major source of biblical knowledge for the illiterate playgoer. ... We can say with a high degree of confidence that even given the inevitable civic element involved (plays could be staged to bring in tourists and funds and so had to have a component of "entertainment"), these plays functioned primarily to communicate or underline the historical and religious message of the churches."<sup id="cite_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup>

</p><p><b> ♠ Army size ♣ 8,700 ♥ </b> This needs a question mark. The figure comes from a low estimate of the forces that Pope Julius II had under his personal control, with no additional mercenary levies or allied contingents, in the summer of 1510, at the beginning of the War of the League of Cambrai. The force consisted of 700 men-at-arms (pikemen and perhaps some arquebusiers) and 8,000 infantrymen.

</p><p><b> ♠ Sources of recruits ♣ mercenaries ♥ </b> This code is problematic, since the papacy was often protected by the strongest contender for hegemony over Italy (France or Spain during this period etc.). Yet these troops were usually recruited into mercenary bands that either operated alone (the <i>condottieri</i>) or were incorporated into semi-professional armies (as was the case later in the period, with the Spanish <i>tercios</i>). In the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, the most common way to organize an army was through a <i>condotta</i>, a contract between a state and a nobleman to raise a specified number of troops by a given time.<sup id="cite_ref-127" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-127">[127]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Inter-polity wars ♣ present ♥</b>  War of the Eight Saints vs central Italian cities e.g. Florence. Visconti of Milan. Neapolitans.  Milanese condottieri. Alfonso of Aragon. Ottomans (Turkish raids). France. Spain. Venice. Holy Roman Empire.
</p><p>During the later 14th century, the Visconti of Milan had succeeded in conquering much of northern and central Italy, and the struggle between the Visconti and Florence was a main feature of the period ca. 1390-1402, with the papacy involved as an intermediary and the feudatories of the Papal State taking sides as the fortunes of war dictated. Perugia submitted to Gian Galeazzo Visconti in 1400, and the lords of the Romagna were under Visconti suzerainty until the death of Gian Galeazzo in September 1402.<sup id="cite_ref-128" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-128">[128]</a></sup>
</p><p>The Italian situation changed forever with the French King Charles VIII's descent into Italy in 1494. This invasion and the war it began were the opening of decades of foreign intervention and chaotic warfare between the French, Spanish, and all the principalities of the peninsula. The papacy was involved in most of these wars, and under Pope Julius II (r. 1503-1513) was a primary force in organizing a coalition against the Venetians before switching sides. In the 1499-1504 war, the Spanish decisively defeated the French and established control over the kingdom of Naples, creating a powerful Spanish presence on the peninsula that would last into the 18th century. Julius II, who became pope in 1503, organized the League of Cambrai against Venice, beginning the War of the League of Cambrai (1508-1516). The Venetians were crushed at Agnadello (1509) but managed to hold out against the League. The French switched sides and began fighting the papacy in 1510. Much of the fighting now moved to the Romagna, in papal territory. The French scored a crushing victory over the papally-led League at Ravenna in April 1512, but within a few months massive rebellions across northern Italy had forced the French out of Italy again.<sup id="cite_ref-129" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-129">[129]</a></sup> Following Julius' death in 1513, the war ended in an agreement between France and Venice to partition Italy north of the Po River Valley. In 1512-1513, Florence and with it Tuscany passed under <i>de facto</i> papal overlordship, especially under the two Medici popes, Leo X and Clement VII.<sup id="cite_ref-130" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-130">[130]</a></sup> Pope Clement VII's indecisive refusal to commit to either the French or the Empire, combined with the bad discipline and lack of pay of the imperial army, led to the sack of Rome in 1527.<sup id="cite_ref-131" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-131">[131]</a></sup> This was an unmitigated disaster for the city; when Clement refused to quarter the imperial mercenaries in the city and pay their arrears, they viciously sacked the city, murdering thousands.

</p><p>The 1380s and 1390s were characterized by a long and futile struggle between the Roman and Avignon popes for control of territory and finances in central and southern Italy, with the long-term result being the destabilization of central Italy and the intensified decentralization of power in the Papal State, especially in the Romagna and <i>le Marche</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-133" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-133">[133]</a></sup>  Both sides employed the <i>condottieri</i>, with the Avignon papacy also employing French troops and relying on French financing. The mercenaries of the Papal State varied between vassals of the papacy and <i>de facto</i> independence. In the struggle between the Avignon and Roman popes, the city of Rome and the Tuscan patrimony occasionally conspired with the French against the Roman popes.<sup id="cite_ref-134" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-134">[134]</a></sup> The Great Schism, came to an end with the Council of Constance in 1418.
</p><p>Between 1513 and 1559, warfare raged up and down the peninsula. There were comparatively few set-piece battles (and these mostly far away from the Papal State, in Lombardy or the Kingdom of Naples), but the wars engendered widespread devastation and combined with famines, plague, and economic destablization to seriously harm Italian society and its economy.<sup id="cite_ref-135" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-135">[135]</a></sup>

Bentivoglio, who was exiled, having been dealt with, new capitoli of submission were redacted, by means of which direct control by Rome was made stronger – the direct appointment of financial magistrates and a more decisive role for the papal legate were added to the already existing selection of the podestà by the pope. [...] In 1428 [Antongaleazzo and his followers] led a new rebellion against ecclesiastic dominion, driving out the legate and creating a balìa (the Otto di pace), to whom were delegated the fullest powers.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Jubilee ♥</b> Pope Boniface VIII held a Jubilee in 1300, which may have been based on the 1220 Canterbury Jubilee.<sup id="cite_ref-159" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-159">[159]</a></sup> The Jubilee offered plenary pardon for sins for pilgrims visiting Rome's cult centers. It was a smashing success: the Florentine chronicler Giovanni Villani estimated that 200,000 pilgrims in Rome for the Jubilee.<sup id="cite_ref-160" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-160">[160]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-161" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-161">[161]</a></sup> While Villani's number, like those of all medieval chroniclers, is a estimate, it indicates the widespread popularity of the ritual. There were enough pilgrims in the city that we have several accounts of people being crushed and trampled to death at particularly popular sites.<sup id="cite_ref-162" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-162">[162]</a></sup> Pilgrims visited the major cult centers around the city, offering gifts; there is a notorious scene in an anonymous chronicler's account in which two clerks stood outside St. Peter's Beyond the Walls with large rakes, gathering up the coins offered by pilgrims.<sup id="cite_ref-163" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-163">[163]</a></sup>"The medieval Roman Jubilee was a year-long celebration of penitence during which pilgrims visited Rome's most important churches and gained plenary indulgences. From its inauguration in 1300, the Holy Year developed through the combined interests of late medieval popes, Roman citizens, and pilgrims. Popes sought to amplify Rome's importance in an era of over-confident kings and emperors; Romans battled for their economic welfare and for ownership of the papacy itself; and pilgrims beset by war and pestilence searched for the complete spiritual cleansing that the Jubilee's plenary indulgence offered. "According to the legend recorded by Cardinal Jacopo Stefaneschi, the Holy Year initially drew its inspiration from a Hebrew tradition recorded in Leviticus in which every fifty years the Jews remitted each others' debts. Stefaneschi wrote of how in 1300 a multitude of millenarian-inspired pilgrims thronged to Rome. In response, Boniface VIII's advisors devised a Christian version of the biblical jubilee. On February 22, the pope declared that each one-hundredth year (centesimo) Rome would host a year of penitential pilgrimage. During this solemn celebration, Christians who visited the Roman shrines dedicated to the church's foremost Apostles, Saints Peter and Paul, would be awarded a plenary indulgence. This 'grand pardon' was a thorough remission of the temporal debt a Christian acquired through sinning. The general understanding was that it promised immediate admission into heaven upon death provided that the pilgrim sinned no further. As with all indulgences, the plenary depended upon the Treasury of Merits earned by Christ and the saints, made visible in Rome's multiple relics. Previously, the plenary had been available only to crusaders. At the time, Boniface was embroiled in conflict with the aggressive King Philip IV of France. Offering Jubilee pilgrims the plenary indulgence highlighted the penitential significance of Rome's relics of Peter and Paul, as well as the pope's central authority in spiritual matters. "To gain the Jubilee plenary, a pilgrim was required to have sincere contrition, perform the sacrament of confession, and visit St Peter's basilica and the basilica of St Paul Outside the Walls for a specified term of days -- fifteen for foreigners, thirty for Romans. The Florentine chronicler Giovanni Villani attested to seeing the peaceful throngs of pilgrims from all over Christendom, 'with much patience, and without noises or quarrels,' crowding Rome's streets, all intent on penitential devotion. The biggest attraction was the Veronica Veil, or Sudarium, an ancient cloth imprinted with the 'true likeness' (vera icona) of Christ and housed at St Peter's." <sup id="cite_ref-164" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-164">[164]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Corruption ♣ ♥</b> The sale of offices reached an all-time high during fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. As the papacy lost control of revenues for other areas of Christendom, it increasingly came to rely on income from the Papal State to stay afloat, and turned to the sale of offices and massive public credit projects to stay afloat.<sup id="cite_ref-372" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-372">[372]</a></sup> In exchange for furnishing the Papacy with a lump sum of capital, office-holders were given interest in the form of an ongoing, fixed salary through various colleges established for the purpose in the early sixteenth century.<sup id="cite_ref-373" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-373">[373]</a></sup> Thus it is almost impossible to distinguish between the Papal State's financial and administrative machinery: the administration provided the finances for its own activities. Braudel estimates that between 1526 and 1601, the Papacy borrowed a total of 13 million crowns.</dd>

<dd> <b>♠ Ideological thought distinguishes men and women ♣ present ♥</b> “Every era has its own beliefs about what constitutes “women,” “men,” and their proper interrelationship; in the Middle Ages these assumptions accorded rather more authority to religion and less, for example, to science. Thinking on gender was rooted in the three religions of the time, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam; in scientific teachings; and in political traditions. Each constituted an authoritative literate discourse, and together they spoke about women and gender in a remarkably coherent chorus. Women were understood as less than men, female attributes as less good than male ones, and gender relations as properly characterized by womanly submission and manly governance. Theology had pride of place in these discussions not only because so much medieval learning was produced in religious contexts but also because religious inquiry then included almost all knowledge.” <sup id="cite_ref-444" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-444">[444]</a></sup></dd>

</p><p><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of monogamy ♣ present ♥</b> “The heart of the sacramental argument against real polygamy was that it betrayed the model of marriage between Christ and his church as an exclusive and enduring dyadic union. [...] [Polygamy] was a violation not only of the natural form of marriage, but even more of the supernatural norm which it embodied. For a Christian to pretend to add a second spouse while the rst was still living (with him or her) and to call that new union a marriage was a deliberate insult to Christ’s example and instruction. For a Christian believer or of cial to extend the de nition of marriage to include a second or third concurrent marriage was a deliberate insult to the sacramental symbolism of Christian marriage. It was tantamount to downing a beer and a sandwich and calling that the eucharist, or diving into a pond several times and calling that baptism writ large. This simply could not be. It was not only a “legal impossibility,” as Raymond of Penyafort had put it, echoing Roman law,130 but a grave spiritual offense, too. Medieval writers labeled such misuses of the concept and institution of marriage by Christians as “heresy,” “blasphemy,” and “desecration” - an insult to God and his sacraments. The Council of Trent later called it “heresy” deserving of the church’s “anathema.” “ <sup id="cite_ref-450" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-450">[450]</a></sup>

<dd><b>♠ respect for authority ♣ present ♥</b> “Medieval society was hierarchical, not merely in social reality but as a matter of principle. Its hierarchical character was understood in cosmological terms. It was taken for granted that the universe was designed in such a way that some of God’s creatures were intended to be at the topand some below them. Human beings were a ‘higher’ form of being than cattle. Cattle were ‘higher’ than the grass they ate. The grass was ‘higher’ than the earth it grew in. So thoroughgoing was the sense that this was how the universe worked that the nine orders of angels identified by the fifth-century Greek authors Pseudo-Dionysus began to be lined up alongside their human ‘counterparts’ on the understanding that each person’s place in heaven would be related to that of the equivalent angel. So the seraphim and cherubim, the contemplatives among the angels, would be accompanied for eternity by members of the contemplative orders, their human equivalents. In modern terms, this was like suggesting that post-men and motorcycle messengers would spend eternity in the company of ordinary angels, while diplomats and emissaries could expect to find themselves among archangels.//Within human society itself no premium was put upon equality. Until late in the Middle Ages, few appear to have seen anything wrong with the idea that there should be rulers and ruled, for hierarchical arrangements of parts within wholes were a normal way of making an organism ‘work’. A body needs a head but it also needs feet (I Corinthians 12.20). In fragmentary survivals of the teaching which was given in the cathedral school at Laon at the end of the eleventh and the beginning of the twelfth centuries, there is a discussion of the passage in Ephesians 6.5 where servants are told to obey their masters. ‘It is no sin to have a servant or to be a servant.’ It was argued at Laon that there are two reasons why ‘servitude is given by God.’ It may be a punishment for the sins of those who are slaves or servants. Or it may have a purpose of proving or testing them, so that, humbled, they may be better people.” <sup id="cite_ref-492" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-492">[492]</a></sup></dd>

Since marriage was a sacrament, the church claimed exclusive jurisdiction over it, appropriating and expanding the laws of nature (Natural Law) and Scripture as well as some of the rules in the early church constitutions and Christianized Roman law. Comprehensive new laws, called canon laws, were promulgated by the papacy and the church councils and enforced by church courts throughout Western Christendom.//”Consistent with the naturalist perspective on marriage, the church’s canon law punished contraception, abortion, and child abuse as violations of the created functions of propagation and child rearing. It also proscribed unnatural sexual acts, such as sodomy and bestiality. Consistent with the contractual perspective, canon law ensured free consnsual unions by dissolving marriages contracted by mistake or under duress, fraud, or coercion. It also granted husband and wife equal rights to enforce conjugal debts that had been voluntarily assumed and emphasized the importance of mutual love among the couple, their children, and their parents.//”Consistent with the sacramental perspective canon law protcted the sanctity and sanctifying purpose of marriage by declaring valid marital bonds to be indissoluble and by annulling invalid unions between Christians and non-Christians or between parties related by various legal, spiritual, blood, or family ties. It supported celibacy by annulling unconsummated vows of marriage if one party made a vow of chastity and by prohibiting clerics on monastics from marriage and concubinage.//”Earlier Christianized Roman and Germanic laws governing the relationships between husband and wife, and parent and child, were liberally appropriated by the canonists and now enforced in the church courts as well as in the confessional (Confession of Sins). Traditional rules and customs of arranged marriages, patriarchal restrictions on the marital estate, male-dominated inheritance laws and primogeniture, protection of the status of the paterfamilias, and restrictions on the wife’s capacity to sue or be sued, to enter into contracts, to give or receive property of her own—all remained firmly in place in canon law.” <sup id="cite_ref-495" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-495">[495]</a></sup></dd>

Yet he also understood the reality of evil in the ‘earthly city’ and the role of the state to confront such evil and render protection (including, in his day, protection of the church). Augustine spoke eloquently of the rueful and necessary duty of statesmen to wage just wars against forces that threatened life and resorted to violence. For augustine, war is always tragic, undertaken out of sorrowful recognition of the injustice that necessitates it and the horrors and cruelty that often attend it (‘’De civ. Dei’’ 19.7).//”What was prohibited for the private individual was permitted for the soldier, who acted in a public capacity; Augustine presumed that a legitimate political authority stood a better chance of restraining inordinate, willful desires, in part by channeling them toward a collectively just civic cause. Augustine contended that God uses political authority in general to achieve minimal levels of order, justice, and peace in the earthly realm. That war could serve as an acceptable means of achieving a peaceful or tranquil order (‘’tranquilitatis ordinis’’) attests to the always limited and imperfect measure of peace and justice one finds on earth; perfect peace and true justice, however, await in the Heavenly City.//”Throughout the Middle Ages, as a further occasions arose for the use of force, theologians, canon lawyers, and political thinkers returned to Augustine, in some cases to deepen, in others to expand, Christian tenets of just war.” <sup id="cite_ref-496" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-496">[496]</a></sup></dd>
