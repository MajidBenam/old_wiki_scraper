"In a study of Sonoran Indians, Erasmus found that one man using a digging stick excavated 2.6 m3 of soil in five hours (1965). For Cahokia calculations, Erasmus's figures for two carriers were averaged to obtain 1.675 m3 and 0.838 m3 moved in fiver hours over 100 m and 200 m, respectively. Productivity dropped after five hours, so this workday length was retained in the estimates provided here. The American Bottom excavators had to work with clays that were more difficult to dig than sandy Sonoran soils; however their stone hoes were more efficient than mere sticks. ...The distance over which soil was carried has a major effect of the Cahokia labor estimates. Certainly much of the mound fill was derived from borrow pits that dotted the site, several of which were quite large (Fowler 1989). In addition, an unknown, but certainly large, fraction of mound fill consisted of upper soil horizons that had been scraped from broad areas. ... In general, it seems appropriate to use a distance of 100 m when calculating the labor needed to construct 102 of the mounds. A distance of 200 m was used for Monks Mound, following Reed and coworkers (1968). ... Using these figures, the mounds could have been built in 470,000, 490,000, 155,000, and 86,000 five hour days, distributed across the Lohmann, Stirling, Moorehead, and Sand Prairie phases."

<p>A collective ritual is a ritual in which two or more people participate. With the official cult we refer to the set of collective ritual practices that are most closely associated with legitimation of the power structure (including elites, if any).

<p><i>Gatherings/ritual space</i>
</p>
<dl><dd>Cahokia has large rectangular plazas that would have accommodated thousands of visitors, as well as woodhenges and large mounds that were re-built and repaired regularly, probably on the occasion of large collective rituals--the assumption being that construction and repair were themselves important rituals. Evidence for chunkey ball game (cosmologically significant game, it also included high-stakes gambling in historical times).</dd></dl>
<p><i>Feasting</i>
</p>
<dl><dd>A lot of evidence for annual feasts at the site of Cahokia itself, probably between summer and early autumn. Large amounts of food consumed (including rare or special food like deer, swan, and fruit), many stimulants used (e.g. tobacco, caffeine-rich "black drink"). Thousands of guests likely, mostly commoners judging by vessels used/discarded.</dd></dl>
<p><i>Art</i>
</p>
<dl><dd>Long-nosed masks suggest early versions of ethnographically recorded "adoption" rituals meant to create kinship ties between unrelated groups.</dd>
<dd>Ramey Incised vessels engraved with symbols (mostly geometrical) that have been interpreted as reinforcing socio-political bonds between commoners and elites, and also expressing notions of fertility and life-force to do with agricultural ceremonies.</dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ warrior purification ritual ♥</b> Chemical traces of caffeine-rich emetic known as the “Black Drink” in the ethnohistoric literature found on Mississippian beaker vessels dating as far back as 1050-1250 CE <sup id="cite_ref-317" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-317">[317]</a></sup>, some of which are decorated with images of warriors and warfare <sup id="cite_ref-318" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-318">[318]</a></sup>. According to Crown et al <sup id="cite_ref-319" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-319">[319]</a></sup>, Buchanan <sup id="cite_ref-320" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-320">[320]</a></sup>, and Dye <sup id="cite_ref-321" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-321">[321]</a></sup>, these are sufficient grounds to infer that, like Native American cultures encountered by European colonialists in the Eastern half of North America in later centuries, prehistoric Mississippian warriors purified themselves before and after battles or raids by consuming this substance. Again, based on both ethnographic parallels and the recovery of serving vessels alongside the Black Drink beakers, these purification rituals probably also involved feasting and/or fasting, and they almost certainly strengthened group solidarity (Buchanan 2014, 274). The idea we have of this ritual may be further fleshed out thanks to the following passage summarising ethnohistorical accounts concerning the indigenous peoples of Southeastern North America: "In addition to being a stimulant, the beverage also acts as a diuretic, causing increased perspiration. And the Indians sometimes used it as an emetic. On these occasions they would drink it in large quantities, and in a quarter to half an hour they would vomit. Sometimes they would hold their arms across their chests and expell [sic] the contents of their stomachs six or eight feet. The Timucuans would drink repeatedly, vomiting it up each time (fig. 56). [...] Caffeine stimulates the central nervous system, exciting it at all levels. [...] It enables a person to have a more rapid and clearer flow of thought, makes him capable of more sustained intellectual effort, and sharpens his reaction. It also increases his capacity for muscular work and lessens fatigue. Moreover, some evidence suggests that large doses of caffeine speed up blood clotting. These effects are pronounced with doses of 0.5 to 1.0 grams--the equivalent of three to six cups of strong coffee. When consumed in large quantities, black drink could have delivered at least this much caffeine, and perhaps as much as 3.0 to 4.0 grams. These effects from large quantities of black drink could have been important and even decisive factors in activities such as the ballgame or warfare." <sup id="cite_ref-322" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-322">[322]</a></sup> In addition to this, Dye <sup id="cite_ref-323" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-323">[323]</a></sup> writes that "Warfare rituals changed through time, but the basic ritual structure may have remained essentially the same from late prehistory into the Colonial period. Based on the above description, warfare rituals would have included the creation of sacred space; elite involvement and sponsorship of rituals, especially feasting; use of sacred paraphernalia and props such as horns and feathers of supernaturals, plants, crystals, pipes, paints, and consecrated vessels; emphasis on symbolism in food, behavior, and color; consumption of medicines, including the black drink and the war medicine, for ritual cleansing and purification; acquisition, display, and ritual manipulation of war trophies; and ritual performance, including dancing with raptor tails or wings."</dd>

<p><b>♠ Human sacrifice ♣ [4-5] ♥</b> At Mound 72, there seems to be a clear distinction between elite burials and those of the sacrificial victims that accompanied them: "The deeper interment, F229-lower, contained a mass grave of an estimated 39 individuals of both sexes who ranged in age from  15 to 45 years (Fowler et al., 1999:70). Several of these individuals displayed skeletal evidence suggestive of violent death, including signs of decapitation, perimortem fractures and embedded projectile points. The bodies of individuals in F229-lower were carelessly positioned in a way that suggested to Fowler et al. (1999:70) that they were executed and then thrown into the open burial pit. These individuals were then covered with several layers of matting that separated this mortuary event from the burial group (F229-upper) interred directly above them. F229-upper contained 15 individuals of both sexes with a diverse age distribution ranging from children to adults. Cedar poles found associated with six of the ten burial units have been interpreted as litters that were used to transport the remains. Varying degrees of articulation and evidence for binding or bundling of remains suggest curation of some bodies prior to burial (Fowler et al., 1999:70-72)." <sup id="cite_ref-628" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-628">[628]</a></sup>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>♠ human sacrifice of an out-group member ♣ {present; absent} ♥</b> Unknown. Unknown. The following quote says that, of 5 mass burials suggestive of human sacrifice, 4 included victims who had been born and had lived in Cahokia, and 1 included victims that <i>may</i> have been outsiders, but may also have been Cahokians. "Mound 72 is one of the smaller mounds at Cahokia, yet it has received considerable attention.
