<p>The kingdom of Kediri ruled over a territory roughly corresponding to the modern-day province of East Java, at least based on the locations where its rulers' inscriptions have been found.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> Midway through the eleventh century CE, the Javanese monarch Airlangga split his realm into two smaller kingdoms, each to be ruled by one of his sons: one of these kingdoms was likely Kediri<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>. The latter rapidly overshadowed its "twin": it was the first Indonesian kingdom to develop stratified territorial administration, it became known for the organization of its armed forces, and it even introduced bureaucratic officials specifically tasked with the management of the polity's water resources.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>  Kediri does not appear to have collapsed: rather, in the early thirteenth century, the cente of power shifted to Singhasari, with the foundation of a new dynasty.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>
</p><p><i>Population and political organization</i>
</p><p>Kediri was ruled by a king, who was assisted by bureaucratic officials. Moreover, as already mentioned, Kediri was the first known Indonesian state to develop stratified territorial administration: more specifically, the polity was organized into three levels, the village, the cluster of villages, and the state.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> This suggests that there were officials in charge of administrating both village clusters and individual villages.
</p><p>According to McEvedy and Jones,<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> Indonesia had a population of four million in 1100 CE. Given the fact that Kediri occupied a small portion of the archipelago, it seems reasonable to infer a population size of a few hundred thousands.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ temple founding ceremony ♥</b> "The crowd was rather small, but they represented a broad spectrum of Javanese society. The most exalted were hereditary noblemen. There were several elders from nearby villages, a sculptor from the distant Dieng Plateau (who had probably been invited to the lowlands of what is now the province of Central Java to render professional services), and at least eighteen children. All had gathered to take part in a ceremony sponsored by a local noble, who was present with his wife and three sons. The occasion was the founding of a new temple.//Such gatherings were relatively common in ancient Java. [...]//These ceremonies normally followed a standard format, and that of December 27, 902 C.E., did not deviate from it. The ritual did not take long to complete. First, the noble sponsoring the building of the temple, who is referred to in the account by his tide, Rakai Panggumulan, distributed presents to all the people who had come. The distribution of gifts was an important symbolic act; ancient Indonesians nobility spent much of their energy endeavoring to acquire precious items that they could then redistribute to loyal followers as tokens of spiritual merit. The scribe recorded the noble's bounty in detail. Next, all participants decorated themselves with flowers and paint; we can only try to imagine the colors and patterns they would have drawn upon their bodies. A sacred stone was set in the center of the space where the temple would be built. Offerings were then laid upon it. The people next sat in a circle around the stone; a priest intoned curses against anyone who would dare disturb the peace of their village. With that, the brief ceremony was concluded.//Thereupon began a celebration that probably took longer than the ritual itself. The nobles, elders, sculptor, and others, many of whom were probably commoners from the village, indulged in feasting enlivened by supplies of palm wine, probably drunk from bamboo cups. The repast was succeeded by music and dancing, possibly of a solemn nature; but the Javanese sense of humor was perhaps already as well developed as it is today, for as usual there was also a performance by a buffoon. No doubt he made mild fun of the nobles in attendance. The musicians and clown were entertaining, and they were rewarded for their efforts.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ temple founding ceremony ♥</b> "The crowd was rather small, but they represented a broad spectrum of Javanese society. The most exalted were hereditary noblemen. There were several elders from nearby villages, a sculptor from the distant Dieng Plateau (who had probably been invited to the lowlands of what is now the province of Central Java to render professional services), and at least eighteen children. All had gathered to take part in a ceremony sponsored by a local noble, who was present with his wife and three sons. The occasion was the founding of a new temple.//Such gatherings were relatively common in ancient Java. [...]//These ceremonies normally followed a standard format, and that of December 27, 902 C.E., did not deviate from it. The ritual did not take long to complete. First, the noble sponsoring the building of the temple, who is referred to in the account by his tide, Rakai Panggumulan, distributed presents to all the people who had come. The distribution of gifts was an important symbolic act; ancient Indonesians nobility spent much of their energy endeavoring to acquire precious items that they could then redistribute to loyal followers as tokens of spiritual merit. The scribe recorded the noble's bounty in detail. Next, all participants decorated themselves with flowers and paint; we can only try to imagine the colors and patterns they would have drawn upon their bodies. A sacred stone was set in the center of the space where the temple would be built. Offerings were then laid upon it. The people next sat in a circle around the stone; a priest intoned curses against anyone who would dare disturb the peace of their village. With that, the brief ceremony was concluded.//Thereupon began a celebration that probably took longer than the ritual itself. The nobles, elders, sculptor, and others, many of whom were probably commoners from the village, indulged in feasting enlivened by supplies of palm wine, probably drunk from bamboo cups. The repast was succeeded by music and dancing, possibly of a solemn nature; but the Javanese sense of humor was perhaps already as well developed as it is today, for as usual there was also a performance by a buffoon.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ temple founding ceremony ♥</b> "The crowd was rather small, but they represented a broad spectrum of Javanese society. The most exalted were hereditary noblemen. There were several elders from nearby villages, a sculptor from the distant Dieng Plateau (who had probably been invited to the lowlands of what is now the province of Central Java to render professional services), and at least eighteen children. All had gathered to take part in a ceremony sponsored by a local noble, who was present with his wife and three sons. The occasion was the founding of a new temple.//Such gatherings were relatively common in ancient Java. [...]//These ceremonies normally followed a standard format, and that of December 27, 902 C.E., did not deviate from it. The ritual did not take long to complete. First, the noble sponsoring the building of the temple, who is referred to in the account by his tide, Rakai Panggumulan, distributed presents to all the people who had come. The distribution of gifts was an important symbolic act; ancient Indonesians nobility spent much of their energy endeavoring to acquire precious items that they could then redistribute to loyal followers as tokens of spiritual merit. The scribe recorded the noble's bounty in detail. Next, all participants decorated themselves with flowers and paint; we can only try to imagine the colors and patterns they would have drawn upon their bodies. A sacred stone was set in the center of the space where the temple would be built. Offerings were then laid upon it. The people next sat in a circle around the stone; a priest intoned curses against anyone who would dare disturb the peace of their village. With that, the brief ceremony was concluded.//Thereupon began a celebration that probably took longer than the ritual itself. The nobles, elders, sculptor, and others, many of whom were probably commoners from the village, indulged in feasting enlivened by supplies of palm wine, probably drunk from bamboo cups. The repast was succeeded by music and dancing, possibly of a solemn nature; but the Javanese sense of humor was perhaps already as well developed as it is today, for as usual there was also a performance by a buffoon. No doubt he made mild fun of the nobles in attendance. The musicians and clown were entertaining, and they were rewarded for their efforts.

<p><b>Discrimination on the basis of gender (include de facto discrimination even when there are no explicit legal restrictions)</b>
In 1540, Pinto explained that the rulers of Java had always been accustomed to treat of the most important matters of their state by mediation of women, especially where it concerns peace, as God has given more gentleness, courtesy, and authority to women than to men, who are severe and thus as a consequence less agreeable to those who are sent. Women frequently appear as negotiators on early Javanese inscriptions.<sup id="cite_ref-511" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-511">[511]</a></sup>

Supomo also describes how from at least the early 10th century, Sanskrit literary culture was spreading from the <i>kraton</i> into rural areas. 'The earliest evidence of the penetration of the Sanskrit epics into rural areas is found in the Sangsang copper plate inscription issued in the name of King Balitung in AD 907 to confirm the granting of freehold to the monastery of Dalinan ... To celebrate what must have been the most important event of the year, if not of decades, for the whole region, a variety of performances was given on that occasion ... the inscription also mentions a <i>wayang</i> performance (<i>mawayang</i>) of the story of "Bhīmaya-kumara", and a recital (<i>macarita</i>) of the "Bhīma-kumara" and "Rāmāyaṇa" stories. Both "Kicaka" [a type of dance mentioned in the inscription] and the "Bhīma-kumara" obviously refer to a certain episode from the Wirā taparwa, the fourth book of the Mahābhārata ... Since there is no evidence that a Javanese translation or adaptation of the Mahābhārata already existed at that time, it seems likely that the narrator of the Bhīma-kumara episode recited a Sanskrit text, and then, as in a <i>harikatha</i> [a public reading of the Sanskrit epics in India], explained it to his audience in Javanese.'<sup id="cite_ref-518" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-518">[518]</a></sup> We know from the <i>sima</i> inscriptions that both men and women were present at ceremonies such as this, so I have coded present in recognition of the didactic function of literary performance for ordinary Javanese villagers after the 10th century.</dd>

<dd><b>♠ Education is available to people from all social classes ♣ present ♥</b> Supomo describes how from at least the early 10th century, Sanskrit literary culture was spreading from the <i>kraton</i> into rural areas. 'The earliest evidence of the penetration of the Sanskrit epics into rural areas is found in the Sangsang copper plate inscription issued in the name of King Balitung in AD 907 to confirm the granting of freehold to the monastery of Dalinan ... To celebrate what must have been the most important event of the year, if not of decades, for the whole region, a variety of performances was given on that occasion ... the inscription also mentions a <i>wayang</i> performance (<i>mawayang</i>) of the story of "Bhīmaya-kumara", and a recital (<i>macarita</i>) of the "Bhīma-kumara" and "Rāmāyaṇa" stories. Both "Kicaka" [a type of dance mentioned in the inscription] and the "Bhīma-kumara" obviously refer to a certain episode from the Wirā taparwa, the fourth book of the Mahābhārata ... Since there is no evidence that a Javanese translation or adaptation of the Mahābhārata already existed at that time, it seems likely that the narrator of the Bhīma-kumara episode recited a Sanskrit text, and then, as in a <i>harikatha</i> [a public reading of the Sanskrit epics in India], explained it to his audience in Javanese.'<sup id="cite_ref-523" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-523">[523]</a></sup> We know from the <i>sima</i> inscriptions that a wide variety of people from different status categories were present at the ceremonies, so I have coded present in recognition of the didactic function of literary performance for ordinary Javanese villagers after the 10th century.</dd>

My general impression is that there were no rigid laws about eligibility for various bureaucratic roles: titles, and their attendant administrative responsibilities, could be granted by the king (or a <i>rakai</i>) to anyone who had in some way earned his favour, and we know that foreigners were also employed as tax-collectors in the East Javanese period.<sup id="cite_ref-528" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-528">[528]</a></sup></dd>

There has been much discussion about the status of slavery. We need to consider that temple 'slavery' could be something of an honour or a purely ritual slavery although those who toiled on temple land could also be seized captives.

</p><p>We asked John Miksic about slavery and bonded labour in the ancient Javanese kingdoms, and he explained that 'there were obviously different levels of servitude [...] People captured in war were the worst off, because then they could be forced, they were under some compulsion, we can say that, but then other people sought to attach themselves to a noble ... we have evidence only for the 14th century for this, we don't have evidence earlier on, but it seems like most of the settlement patterns of this period were like a nobleman and his court and then a bunch of their adherents living around them for protection, because there is a lot of banditry, we can be pretty sure of this based on later sources, there's a lot of banditry [...] there were roving bands of robbers and you needed some nobleman to protect you from that. And, villages were probably fortified [...] so there were levels of servitude and it's all very indistinct in linguistic terms [...] so, you know, "bondsmen", "royal bondsmen", yes, there were such things but most of it was voluntary'.<sup id="cite_ref-553" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-553">[553]</a></sup>

[...] Elsewhere Manu (VI:91- 2) asserts that avoiding backbiting, hypocrisy, greed, infatuation, anger and discontent is approved dharma for all the stages of life. The problem is that there are different views as to what the actuality of universal dharma is. Radhakrishnan, for example, argues for a sanatana dharma, based upon Advaita Vedanta thought, that is said to be present in all religious traditions. It is a kind of perennial philosophy that is at the heart of every religious tradition not just at the heart of the Hindu tradition. Others concentrate upon a universal dharma within the Hindu tradition itself but there is no absolute consensus as to what it is. Nevertheless, in theory, the ethical virtues of compassion, generosity, gratitude, and non-violence are universally regarded by most Hindus." <sup id="cite_ref-620" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-620">[620]</a></sup></dd></dl>

</p>
<dl><dd><b>♠ Number of officially sanctioned supernatural beings ♣ polytheistic ♥</b> "According to one popular formula, there are 330 million gods in Hinduism. Nevertheless, most Hindus have believed that there is ultimately one deity, and that the diversity of other gods are his or her emanations or manifestations, representing his or her agency in particular contexts. [...] The three gods most commonly worshipped as the ultimate in Hindu traditions are Visnu, Siva, and the Goddess, variously called Devi, "Goddess," and Sakti, "Power." This triad of deities must be distinguished from an overlapping group of three deities who are conceived in the Puranas and other authoritative traditions to perform particular cosmic functions-Brahma, who creates the universe anew in each vast cosmic cycle, and also, in some accounts, bestows the Veda upon humanity; Visnu, who preserves the universe by intervening to rectify problems through his avataras, "descents" or "incarnations"; and Siva, who destroys the universe at the end of each cosmic cycle. [...] [W]hichever deity is conceived as the ultimate is understood to be the source who emanates the others, both the triad who perform the aforementioned cosmic functions and lower supernatural beings, and thus to be the ultimate agent in their actions. [...] There are numerous other important deities besides those frequently conceived as a monotheistic ultimate. One of the most important of these is Ganesa, a son of Siva with the head of an elephant, believed to be a protective figure that removes obstacles. Another is Hanuman, the monkey-god who helped Rama in his battle against Ravana, idealized for his devotion to Rama and Sita. Other deities important in particular regions include the South Indian Ayappa, regarded as the son of Siva and a female avatara of Visnu; and smallpox goddesses such as the North Indian Sitala." <sup id="cite_ref-646" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-646">[646]</a></sup></dd>

The Kshatriyas have traditionally been seen, again in theory if not always in practice, as the rulers who maintain society, uphold dharma and protect the householder system. They built and sponsored temples, protected their subjects and their deities and, to that extent, the Brahmins recognised a ruler's overlordship. However, the kingly role in ruling and guardianship duties involved more 'polluting tendencies' than were usual in a Brahmin's life. The Brahmins have had a dual role in society. Those who are active priests in temples have engaged in functions that involve being given gifts by worshippers and such temple priests are more involved with lower castes. Paradoxically Brahmins who are versed in promoting scholarship and in advancing religious learning but who do not act as serving priests are, in general, more widely admired because they have less contact with the public. Thus Brahmins who are not priests can be more akin to those renouncers engaged in lifelong learning and spirituality, rather than in the hurly-burly of householder life.

According to Dumont, in addition to the distinctions already outlined that fit varnas and jatis into hierarchies, another must be added. This distinction takes caste hierarchical divides beyond the kind of class distinctions found in eighteenth-century Britain or in the Ancien Regime in Europe, by stressing the opposition between purity and pollution. Caste difference, according to this classification, goes beyond class differences into this other realm of ritual purity and pollution. The Brahmins are the highest and purest varna, and the Dalits are the lowest, in that they are outside varna and are impure altogether. The other varnas rank in between. Pollution occurs in different ways. It occurs through bodily contact of one sort or another, with menstrual cycles, through birth and death, through emissions such as faeces, urine and saliva, and through contact with night-soil, dirty clothes, unswept rooms and so on. Thus marriage and sex have to function within the correct set of jatis in the correct varna. Polluting jobs such as laundering and sweeping are done by people of lower castes so that the blood of people of higher castes can remain 'pure'. Equally menstrual activity among older women makes them more 'impure' than men or pre-menstrual virgins, and therefore women are more polluting than men. They will thus often live semi-separately while menstruating, during which time they will also avoid going to the temple and therefore 'polluting' the gods. Furthermore, untouchable Dalits were prohibited from entering many temples before the post-Independence freedom-of-temple-entry legislation and even now they are kept out of some temples in many villages. [...] It is also true to say that Dumont's thesis suffers from exaggeration and other matters are important in discussing caste. Nevertheless, there is at least an element of truth in the notion that purity and pollution has relevance in any discussion of caste." <sup id="cite_ref-664" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-664">[664]</a></sup></dd>

The householder’s business is the maintenance and support of those in the other three stages of life: the students who have not yet entered into the world of work, the retirees who have seen the birth of grandchildren and spotted their first gray hairs, and the renunciants, those who have left behind not only the world of work and material possession but who have also left behind family and self-interest for a life focused on spiritual freedom. Householders are the ones with material wealth, and their responsibility, their dharma, is to share it with others. [...] The link between the world of the householder and the world of the renunciant is gift giving - dana. The classic image is of the renouncer with the begging bowl, making the rounds for alms.

Either way, I think we can infer an absence of systems for providing drinking water to the general population.

Miksic comments that 'Irrigation can ... be associated with water-borne diseases. A particularly important example is urinary schistosomiasis, which is spread by contact with water where there live snails which form the intermediate host. A study in Madagascar found that urinary schistosomiasis spread rapidly to new areas along with the expansion of an irrigation system ... It is not known whether such problems occurred in ancient Java, but one must remember that the expansion of the irrigation system may well have caused new health problems while eliminating others'.<sup id="cite_ref-728" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-728">[728]</a></sup> However, Miksic also told us that although we don't have enough skeletal evidence to draw conclusions on people's health in the ancient Javanese kingdoms, scholars suspect that it was quite good.<sup id="cite_ref-729" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-729">[729]</a></sup> He believes that the rarity and late appearance of cities in Indonesia may have been a way of avoiding the higher disease burden and other 'dangers and inconveniences' associated with urban settlement patterns.<sup id="cite_ref-730" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-730">[730]</a></sup></dd>

On the other hand, Jákl thinks we can infer from the descriptions of food in the <i>kakawin</i> epics that the peasant diet was relatively rich and varied. He comments: 'It may be wrong to extrapolate modern dietary patterns of Javanese peasants, with their heavy reliance on rice and vegetables, back on the conditions of pre-Islamic Java. In relatively sparsely populated premodern Java, with abundant resources and few documented dietary taboos, peasants may have generally enjoyed a much more varied diet then their modern descendants.

It may seem strange that a <i>ŗși</i> [an ascetic or court brahmin], however wise and powerful he may have been, should be represented on a par with deities like Durgā and Ganesa, but it is known that Agastya, for whom a temple and an image were made in east Java in 760, enjoyed special veneration in Java. Whichever is the correct interpretation, there is no doubt that the Guru was one of the most popular representations in ancient Java. This may well reflect the particular awe felt for a teacher in Java till recent times'.<sup id="cite_ref-744" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-744">[744]</a></sup> For this reason, I have coded 'equal': those who joined these communities seem to have been equal in status to the top nobility.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
