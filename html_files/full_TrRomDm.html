It should be noted, however, that Latin was phased out as the language of governance and law in the east under Justinian.

<dl><dd>The Roman Principate is generally regarded as ending during or just after the crisis of the 3rd century CE (235-284 CE). The date of 284 CE marks the accession of Diocletian<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> and the period includes the Constantinian Dynasty (305-363 CE), Valentinian Dynasty (364-378 CE) and the early part of the Theodosian dynasty (379-457 CE). According to the historian David Baker, the 'Eastern Empire enjoyed an expansion phase c. 285-450'.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> The period ends after the reign of Theodosius, the last emperor to rule over both the Eastern and Western halves of the Empire.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Near the end of the 3rd century, beginning at the end of the Severan Dynasty, the Principate nearly collapsed in the face of internal warfare and pressure from external foes, including the Sassanid Persian Empire and nomadic tribes from Germany and eastern Europe. Rome briefly lost control over parts of France, Britain, and southern Spain and suffered several significant losses in battle to the Sassanids. Under first the Emperor Aurelian (r. 270-275 CE) then Diocletian (r. 284-305), all territory was recovered and a series of administrative and economic reforms inaugurated a second phase of the Roman Empire, which we refer to as the Dominate (denoting the increasing centralization of authority and the development of a large bureaucratic apparatus). This period saw notably the increasing popularization of Christianity, culminating in its acceptance as the official state religion under the Emperor Theodosius at the end of the period. The late 3rd century also saw the Empire split into two distinct administrative halves: a Western half, with its capital at Rome, and an Eastern one, ruled first from Nicomedia in Anatolia and then from Byzantium (re-founded as Constantinople, modern-day Istanbul, by the Emperor Constantine I the Great in 330 CE). Each half was ruled by a different emperor along with a junior colleague, titled 'Caesar'. This arrangement is known as the Tetrarchy ('rule of four'), which lasted until Constantine I managed to once again rule both halves together. The Empire was divided a few more times, until Theodosius (r. 379-392 CE) united it for the final time. In 393, Theodosius once more divided the Empire, naming Arcadius Emperor in the East and Honorius Emperor in the West. This marks the end of the Dominate period, leading to a period of instability and, ultimately, the collapse of the Roman state in the west, yet recovery and the continuation of Roman rule in the east (which became known as the Byzantine Empire, after Constantinople's original name).</dd></dl>
<p><i>Population and political organization</i>
</p>
<dl><dd>During the Dominate period, the power centre of the Roman Empire shifted decisively away from Rome and Italy, beset by decades of crisis and civil infighting, to Anatolia; specifically, to the old Greek city of Byzantium that was re-founded and glorified by the Emperor Constantine I. Before this, Diocletian brought stability back to the Empire after the crises of the 3rd century CE by inaugurating a series of administrative and economic reforms. Although most offices and institutions of the preceding Principate period were retained, Diocletian increased the number of provinces, adding more governors and provincial officials who reported directly to the emperor, and further split the empire into two halves to aid in the administration of such a vast and diverse territory.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> The early Dominate is known for the decline of autonomy, prestige, and power of Rome's provincial elite and the concomitant rapid increase in the power of the central bureaucracy.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>When Constantine I established Constantinople as the capital in 330 CE, he furnished the city with a palace, hippodrome, and a great imperial bureaucracy. In terms of personnel the administration in Constantinople reached its largest extent in the 4th century with 'somewhat over thirty thousand functionaries'.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> Constantine was the first emperor to vigorously promote Christian religion and his patronage of the Christian church laid the foundations of a Christian empire. 'He built grand churches at the sacred loci of Christianity, including churches celebrating Christ's birth, baptism, and resurrection and Peter's death in Rome. ... Constantine's successors would continue this pattern. Many churches would become quite wealthy. Their clergy were exempt from taxation and other onerous obligations like labor.'<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The Empire, creaking under its vast territory of 4.5 million square kilometres, supported a population of up to 70 million people. Rome had lost population from its peak under the Principate, probably supporting around 800,000 in 300 CE and around 500,000 by the beginning of the 5th century. Constantinople also had slightly under 500,000 inhabitants, though it developed rapidly under the patronage of Constantine I and his successors and became the new centre of literacy and culture in the Roman world - rivalling, if not surpassing, Rome herself.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup></dd></dl>

Again, this model was established in the Antioch of Ignatius, as he underscores emphatically the necessity of gathering for learning, ritual, and teaching around a single bishop.

</p><p>_Mithraism_
</p><p>Cult of Mithra spread from the Parthian Empire to Rome (originated in India? bronze age?). "Contrary to other religions of the same type, such as the cults of Isis and Osiris, Serapis, Dionysus (all well-known examples), Mithraicism eschewed any external manifestations and depended only on its initiatory nature to recruit its followers. ... it gradually became a common faith for soldiers, civil servants, merchants ... The members joined a spirituality of an initiatory type ... shared with a large group of solar faiths ... that promised both a life near to the deity and a personal redemption."<sup id="cite_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup>
</p><p>"From the end of the first century B.C.E. we have evidence of a cult coming from the East and gradually and discretely conquering the Roman army and administration (Daniels). This god, previously unknown to the Romans, was called Mithra. Some historians believe (see Plutarch, Pomp. 24.7) that the notorius Cilician pirates defeated by Pompeius propagated this cult when deported in Calabria. We now believe that it was a late transformation of the god Mithra, the friendly protector of contracts .... and defender of true and just causes."<sup id="cite_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-57">[57]</a></sup>
</p><p>"We must also stress that this god retained, in his manifestation in the Roman Empire, his essential characteristics of friend and guardian of contracts."<sup id="cite_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup>
</p><p>"Mithra probably won over even the imperial house. We are wary about the well-known initiation of the emperor Nero to the mysteries of the Magi through Tiridates (see Turcan 1989:237). However, it seems that the emperor Commodus (192) was an unworthy adept of the mysteries, because he was suspected of having killed a fellow-adept during a ceremony simulating a ritual sacrifice. The imperial house had a much worthier adept in Diocletian and his colleagues of the Tetrarchy: Galerius and Licinius. The god is then called the fautor imperii sui, the "protector of the imperial power" (Inscription of Carnuntum in 307)."<sup id="cite_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup>
</p><p>Mithraism: "on the social level people learned, in the 'Persic Cavern', to respect the contract linking the human being to the cosmos and to the gods, and then, at least in an implicit way, to respect the emperors, who were divine beings, as intermediaries between the sky and the earth. The faithfulness to a vivifying cosmic order was thus accompanied by faithfulness to the one representing this order on earth. It is not surprising, then, that Mithra was invoked as Jupiter Dolichenus for the salvation of the emperor. In time, a cult ascribed to the enemies gets mixed up with the worship of the protecting gods of Rome!"<sup id="cite_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-60">[60]</a></sup>

</p><p>"Typically the men who commanded armies and legions were senators. There were no military specialists in Roman government and no imperial high command. All senators alternated brief periods of military command with administrative posts, participation in domestic politics and careers as legal advocates. As military commanders they were, to a great extent, amateurs, even though most did a brief spell as a junior officer (tribune) in a legion. They would have depended on the professional junior officers (tribunes and centurions) as well as the training and discipline of the legionaries themselves to win battles.""<sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup>

</p><p><b> ♠ Professional priesthood ♣ present ♥ </b> Early Roman cults were funded by regular public offerings, large individual donations, and payment for services. The hierarchy could also profit from land ownership. Professionalism of the priesthood likely pre-dates the Roman era as similar patterns are evident in Greek and Egyptian civilization. When the state provided gifts, it was often in the form of a lavish construction, such as a new temple. Examples: priests of Isis were "full-time religious professionals" <sup id="cite_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-70">[70]</a></sup>; Vestals were "supported by the state and were full-time professional clergy, along with the Priestess of Ceres and Proserpina." <sup id="cite_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup> The Flamen Dialis (the chief priest of Jupiter) was also a professional. He had to follow so many restrictive rules that he was effectively restricted to priestly duties. He could for example not touch horses, iron, etc, and he was not allowed to stand for election. Some priests, however, were not professional. These included the pontifices.

<p><b> ♠ Formal legal code ♣ present ♥ </b> A formal legal code was first founded in the Twelve Tables of 450-449 BCE. Law thereafter was based on precedent. Our sources of knowledge of Roman law include the forensic speeches of Cicero; the Institutes of Gaius textbook (from 160 CE); and, much later, the sixth century CE Corpus Ius Civilis of Justinian. Wax tablets and papyri (contracts and wills etc.) also provide information on Roman law. <sup id="cite_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-84">[84]</a></sup> However, before this time restrictions on funerary extravagance, from the start of the 6th century, may suggest the Twelve Tables laws (of the Early Republic) codified an existing body of law and legal practices. <sup id="cite_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-85">[85]</a></sup>
</p><p>Writing c200 CE "Papinian, perhaps the authority on law most respected in late antiquity, listed the sources of the ius civile as statutes (leges), popular resolutions (plebiscita), senatorial enactments (senatusconsulta), decrees of emperors (decreta principum) and the authoritative pronouncements of men learned in law, the jurists (auctoritas prudentium). To these was added the ius honorarium, the law contained in the Edict of the praetor, who, under the Republic and Early Empire administered law in Rome; this form of law derived its name from the praetor's magistracy (honos) and was held to 'assist, supplement or amend' the ius civile.".<sup id="cite_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-86">[86]</a></sup>
</p><p>Under-Diocletian, Codex Gregorianus (291 CE) - which contained constitutions and rescripts from Hadrian to Diocletian - and Codex Hermogenianus (c295 CE) - which contained supplementary material - became semi-official collections of law. Their authors had access to imperial chancery and the codes were considered authoritative by courts. <sup id="cite_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-87">[87]</a></sup> Throughout the imperial period a new body of law called ius novum developed <sup id="cite_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-88">[88]</a></sup> under the influence of Christianity which replaced the ius vetus. However, law-making was in general unstructured and confused. In 435 CE a commission was appointed to collate all constitutions since Constantine (numbering 3000 constitutions from 312 to 438 CE). The new compendium was published in 438 CE as Codex Theodosianus. <sup id="cite_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-89">[89]</a></sup> Private law (e.g. family law) came increasingly under the jurisdiction of the Christian church. <sup id="cite_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-90">[90]</a></sup>

Local magistrates dealt with local matters, provincial governors dealt with provincial matters, and the praetors often dealt with cases in Rome. The Roman people could be duly convened as a final court of appeal in cases involving citizens.
</p><p>Salvian's "On God's Governance of the World" highlights the corruption among Roman judges in the fifth century: "A transgressor who belongs to the wealthy classes is not punished for his injustice, while a poor man, who does not understand business, undergoes the legal penalty, that is, if he does not depart this life before the trial, so long is the course of lawsuits protracted, and so much money is expended on them. The climax of the misery is to have to pay in order to obtain justice. For no one will give a court to the injured man unless he pay a sum of money to the judge and the judge's clerks." <sup id="cite_ref-97" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-97">[97]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Courts ♣ present ♥ </b> During the Roman Dominate administration of justice was "thoroughly bureaucratized" and "regular courts, special courts were established to deal with particular matters and categories of persons." <sup id="cite_ref-98" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-98">[98]</a></sup> Also, a system of appeals developed.<sup id="cite_ref-99" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-99">[99]</a></sup> Before this time there was no specialised court building. Courts could be held in the basilicas<sup id="cite_ref-100" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-100">[100]</a></sup> (introduced by the 3rd Century BCE<sup id="cite_ref-101" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-101">[101]</a></sup>) where a provincial governor could an hold audience or in the Roman forum. Basilicas were multi-purpose buildings a place for banking and money-changing and town hall activities. The forum was a multi-purpose building which had existed since the Roman Kingdom.
</p><p><b> ♠ Professional Lawyers ♣ present ♥</b> Law specialists first existed during the Principate when they commanded fees for their expertise. We know this because Emperor Claudius attempted to "limit the fees of advocates, which had become intolerably heavy" to protect "women and other helpless litigants from the rapacity of their lawyers." <sup id="cite_ref-102" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-102">[102]</a></sup> The first law school in Rome, for persons who wished to pursue career in the Imperial civil service, was established late second century CE. A second school was established in Beriut in the early third century. Further schools of law were established in Alexandria, Caesaria, Athens, Constantinople, Carthage and Augustodunum. <sup id="cite_ref-103" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-103">[103]</a></sup> "Professional" lawyers (causidici, advocati) replaced orators (oratores) during the Roman Dominate period.<sup id="cite_ref-104" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-104">[104]</a></sup> Leo I (460 CE) demanded some lawyers produce a certificate proving their professional instruction, a requirement which was later demanded in the provinces. <sup id="cite_ref-105" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-105">[105]</a></sup>

With such a limited staff it was impossible to copy even the most frequently read authors such as Homer, the tragedians, and Herodotus and Thucydides.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ ludi ♥</b> <i>Ludi</i> included chariot races, theatrical performances, dances, and, generally speaking, any other non-violent form of public entertainment occurring on the occasion of a religious festival <sup id="cite_ref-250" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-250">[250]</a></sup>. Regarding chariot races <sup id="cite_ref-251" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-251">[251]</a></sup>: "The Circus Maximus was by far the largest stadium in Rome. It was a third of a mile long and could seat potentially up to 350,000 spectators. Unlike the Flavian Amphitheater, whose 55,000 seats would have been largely occupied by the upper classes, the size of the Circus Maximus meant that all segments of Roman society could attend races. Admission was free or for a nominal fee. In addition, chariot races were held frequently. Whereas there might have been only two or three gladiator contests per year, each of the over 100 holidays per year would have included chariot racing. All these factors ensured that chariot racing was the most popular form of entertainment for the average inhabitant of the city as well as the most accessible. "[A] race could have a maximum of 12 chariots. [...] The total length of a standard race was about eight kilometers and probably took less than 15 minutes to complete. [...] There were 24 races per day; thus, one could spend an entire day at the Circus Maximus. The winning charioteer received a crown of palm leaves and the winner's prize money. These prizes seem to have ranged between 5,000 and 60,000 sesterces for first place, and there were also lesser prizes for second, third, and fourth place. [...] They developed elaborate cheers and songs that tens of thousands of fans would chant and sing in unison. Often these chants deteriorated into abuse directed at the fans of other factions, and riots were not infrequent. [...] Many charioteers died not directly as the result of a crash but from being dragged around the track after one. This happened because charioteers habitually tied the reins to their arms." As for theatrical performances, which typically combined music, dance, and acting, they were divided in two kinds: "[m]imes sang, danced, and acted without masks, while pantomimes wore masks, acted, and danced but didn't sing; instead, musicians or a chorus offered musical accompaniment" <sup id="cite_ref-252" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-252">[252]</a></sup>. It is also worth noting the following: "Of course, many of those who went to enjoy the races or the plays may not have had 'religion' (in our sense of the word) uppermost in their minds; but there remained strong associations between the games and the gods throughout the principate. Images and symbols of the appropriate deities, for example, were paraded through the streets of Rome to the Circus or theatre, where sacrifices were performed" <sup id="cite_ref-253" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-253">[253]</a></sup>.</dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ votum pro salute domini ♥</b> On 3 January every year, in Rome and in the provinces, both civilians and soldiers made vows for the salvation of the Emperor. These vows were public, and led, in the provinces, by provincial officials. They involved prayer to the gods that they would preserve the Emperor and the State from harm. Occasionally, groups would compete in terms of who demonstrated loyalty most enthusiastically, and apparently this generated significant social tensions that risked erupting into violent conflict. <sup id="cite_ref-295" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-295">[295]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Triumph ♥</b> Triumphs were, traditionally, grand processions celebrating a general's military victories. However, starting from the rule of Augustus onwards, they became dynastic events, "used either to showcase [the Emperor's] chosen heirs [...] or to celebrate the beginning of reigns, almost as a coronation ritual" <sup id="cite_ref-374" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-374">[374]</a></sup>. During the Principate and the Dominate eras, moreover, triumphs were much rarer, sometimes with decades passing between successive ones. But, besides this, the way they were celebrated during the Empire seems to have been broadly similar to how they were celebrated during the Republic. The procession started from outside the city, then proceeded through Rome's streets, passed through the triumphal gate, and ended at the temple of Jupiter on the Capitol, where the Emperor, or a relative of his, dedicated a sacrifice to the god. Triumphs were grand affairs, involving feasts, and, in case of triumphs that were more military than dynastic, the display of prisoners of war, as well as precious items and natural wonders looted from the conquered territories. Usually they lasted one day, but there were exceptions. Prisoners of war were sometimes executed at some point during the festivities <sup id="cite_ref-375" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-375">[375]</a></sup>.</dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ dies sanguinis ♥</b> In 204 BCE, the Anatolian goddess Cybele was formally added to the Roman pantheon. Worship of the deity included the <i>taurobolium</i> (in which the devout stood in a pit while a bull was sacrificed on a slatted floor above them, thus bathing them in its blood), ecstatic dancing, and a day known as <i>dies sanguinis</i>, or Day of Blood, in which priests (and perhaps lay-worshippers, it is not very clear) whipped themselves to the point of bleeding. Some celebrants event castrated themselves, replicating the events of their cult's founding myth.

Each of these officials—excepting the princeps—had three assistants (adiutores) who, in turn, were assisted by chartularii. These latter were drawn from the exceptores, a corps of junior officials, divided into fifteen groups (scholae), which formed the basic administrative staff of the prefecture. Below these were a set of subclerical grades—ushers, messengers, doorkeepers, and attendants—each, at least on paper, carefully organized with a similar precision and regimentation...The continual see-sawing of advantage between emperors and the officials on whom they inescapably relied, and the tactics used by both sides to strengthen their positions, undoubtedly impaired the efficiency of later Roman bureaucracy.

<dd><b>♠ Promotion in administrative positions is open to people from all social classes ♣ yes ♥</b><sup id="cite_ref-563" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-563">[563]</a></sup> The following suggests that enslaved men employed in administrative positions could be promoted. "Of greater interest in the present context are the functionaries at a lower and intermediate level, in so far as slaves were there deployed. Rather complex and disparate findings emerge here. Still, it looks as if governmental service led, by middle age, to a sort of automatic manumission. With the exception of the treasurers (dispensatores), slaves aged between thirty and forty could mainly reckon with obtaining their freedom, although exceptions (CIL VI 8449; CIL VIII 12607) confirm the rule (Schumacher 2010). In most cases, the manumissio took place when the slaves, after subaltern positions as vicarii (managers: CIL VI 64), arcarii (treasurers: CIL VI 8719), and tabellarii (record-keepers: CIL VI 9052) were designated for higher duties, in other words, on the level of the adiutores (assistants), optiones (assistants), tabularii (account-keepers), praepositi (overseers), or proximi (personal assistants; Weaver 1972: 200–258). Their further careers continued in accordance with their aptitude, or by virtue of special promotion, to the post of procurator (high-level manager). These conditions explain why the auxiliary functions are not included in the inscriptions of successful freedmen; for the need to mention such low-level positions had now, with their social and professional rise, become inconsequential. Thus, as a rule, the careers of these men, as those careers are depicted in inscriptions of various sorts, begin with the position that they held at the time of their manumission (see, e.g., CIL VI 8428, 8608, 10233; ILS 1518)."<sup id="cite_ref-564" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-564">[564]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Education is available to people from all social classes ♣ yes ♥</b> "In spite of the facilitation of access to primary education by the spread of schools and teachers, at no time and in no place was there established a public educational system with free access to all children. Children of the senatorial class, as well as of wealthy and ambitious other families, did not attend primary schools, but continued to study with private teachers (i.e., their families' own slaves or paid instructors) (Booth 1979b). Thus, Pliny the Elder designates a boy attending a (public) school as poor (Plin. Nat. 9. 8. 25). The style of one's education, then, was socially determined. A thorough (private) education on the primary level continued to be connected to wealth and social status. The consequences of such practices, that is to say, the quality (literacy, semi‐literacy) and quantification of literacy in the late republic and the principate are still matters of debate. Apart from the social strata concerned, modern estimates of the overall population's literacy quota vary between 5% and 20%, with great differences regarding periods, cities, regions, and individual provinces. [...] But what of the children who were not even free‐born? The rearing of slaves was likewise based on the concept of forming a particular kind of individual, but had significantly other aims in this, and thus a significantly different educational concept: not to bring out the best, to anchor virtues and values in the mind by education and the teaching of letters, literature, and the cultural memory of the Romans, but rather, ‘training.’ Young slaves were manipulated, trained, and taught like whelps or colts (Plut. Cato 21. 1). The fostering of ‘homeborn’ slave children (vernae) was useful for the master's own requirements in the household (e.g., Nep. Atticus 13. 3; Plut. Cato 21. 7; Plut. Crassus 2. 6), and it was quite literally an economic investment, since trained slaves—for example, as singers, hairdressers, financial administrators, private secretaries, or teachers of Greek language and literature—could be sold at a higher price than they had been worth before such training. Accordingly, some slave children received a primary education either at home, if they were owned by wealthy families in which private education was common, or with teachers in the local community (Booth 1979a)."<sup id="cite_ref-565" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-565">[565]</a></sup></dd>

"'Equality,' wrote Cicero, 'is unequal when it does not recognize grades of dignity.' The most dignified citizens were the senators, whose dignity consisted in the public offices they held, the responsibilities they shouldered, and the fortunes they spent to maintain public order. Thus they earned the advantages they enjoyed, not least preferential treatment under the law. Ordinary citizens, for their part, were alert, if also submissive, to the “conflict between certain moral aspirations (justice, for instance) and the social institutions (like the law) which attempt to enshrine them.' [...] Cicero’s criticism of undifferentiated equality reflects the other ancient ideology, which provided for the judicial privileges enjoyed by the Roman elite for centuries.

They valued marriage and marital harmony, but the striking fact is that only one surviving author of the Roman empire, Musonius Rufus, made an unambiguously (p. 681) strong case for sexually exclusive marriage. Plutarch, in his Advice to the Bride and Groom, ultimately urged women to bear a husband’s escapades lightly. The Roman model of marriage simply did not demand sexual exclusivity from men. To call it a double standard is to trivialize the problem. The Greeks and Romans operated with a dual standard, two patently different sets of expectations in sexual behavior. This pattern was rooted in social structure. Female chastity was enforced in the name of ensuring patrimonial legitimacy. While men were viciously punished for violating free women, they were permitted to use dishonored women—prostitutes, concubines, and slaves—as sexual partners. Public law reinforced the system by protecting the sexual honor of respectable women and exposing dishonored women to the remainder of male desire. Salvian complained that Roman policy amounted to “forbidding adulteries, building brothels.” The average age at marriage strengthened the dual standard, with men entering marriage nearly a decade after sexual maturity. Young men were simply assumed to enter marriage with sexual experience. Married men also enjoyed sexual freedom with slaves and prostitutes, since adultery was determined by the status of the woman involved.150 Flagrant excess was poor form, but hardly damnable." <sup id="cite_ref-637" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-637">[637]</a></sup>

Pietas included duty to the family, the parents, one’s patron, and the state, as well as the gods. The gods were the guarantors of the welfare of the state and the continuance of the social order. Thus violating the social order by transgressing the mos maiorum (ancestral custom in any domain) was offensive to gods and liable to bring bad results on the group. [...] However, I think it is fair to say (1) that the Romans were more interested in punishing transgressions themselves than in waiting for the gods to do it. In their view, it was important to root out and punish wrongdoers so that they did not further contravene the mos maiorum and (by definition) anger the gods. Such punishment could avert disasters. (2) Punishment from the gods was expected to occur as disasters affecting the group/state, such as plague or famine or battle loss, more than the striking down of guilty individuals; (3) What we think of as the distinction between ritual transgression and ethical transgression tends to be collapsed, with ethical wrongdoing very often brought under the aegis of the gods or redefined as an offense to the gods."<sup id="cite_ref-679" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-679">[679]</a></sup>. As for Christianity: the Christian god is "the creator of the universe, omniscient and omnipotent"<sup id="cite_ref-680" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-680">[680]</a></sup> and he punishes moral transgression: "[A]fter the Resurrection, when God and Jesus appear to pass judgement, one must 'render an account' (Matt. 12:36). Death ends the day during which good works are to be done, and then, 'the night cometh, when no man can work' (John 9:4). Everyone's work will be tried in fire and revealed (1 Cor, 3:12-13). The just, whom God will gather to His right, receive 'life everlasting', the merciless, however, who stand to His left, 'shall go into everlasting punishment' (Matt. 25:46). Everything is decided with death and that gives both life and death the weight of finality."<sup id="cite_ref-681" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-681">[681]</a></sup></dd></dl>

The Latin translation was made in the fourth century, which demonstrates that these guidelines still held relevance in the post- persecution era and for a wider area than that envisaged by the original text. The Didascalia referred to the bishop as ‘the physician of the Church’ (medicus super ecclesiam constitutus), modelled on Christ. In the same instance, he was exhorted to love his congregation like his children, to teach them, but also to chastise (castigare) them. Christian discourse was inspired by customary paternalistic language when describing the actions of the bishop as a judge, which combined education and healing. He was to operate at the first level of punishment, the temporal one aiming at penance and forgiveness, to address specific sins committed by individual members of his community. His judgement was, however, not finite, but a means to best equip a sinner for final judgement, which belonged to God. "Translated into procedural terms, the Didascalia recommended, on the basis of Mt 18:15-18:16, a gradual approach to guarantee the healing and teaching aspects of the bishop’s criminal jurisdiction. Only once reproving the guilty in private to make them perform penance had failed was the matter to be taken before a group of two or three, and only in the last instance before the entire church. At this point, if the guilty still did not confess and agree to perform penance, they were to be excommunicated in a formal ceremony, but only after consultation with the bishop’s priest and deacons."<sup id="cite_ref-719" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-719">[719]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b>♠ bravery ♣ present: 284-311CE; inferred absent: 312-397CE ♥</b> "Courage was fundamental, the essential foundation to any aristocrat’s struggle for eminence, ‘‘nearly the most important thing in every state,’’ Polybius reported, ‘‘but especially in Rome’’ (Polyb. 31.29.1). Those whose accomplishments on the battlefield won them renown were recognized as the Republic’s natural leaders, a connection made explicit in the aftermath of Cannae. Losses in that disaster and prior reverses had so depleted the ranks of the Senate that a special effort had to be undertaken to replenish its membership. The men selected were, first, those who had held various minor public offices, then ‘‘those who had spoils taken from the enemy on display in their homes or who had been decorated for saving the life of a citizen in combat’’ (Livy 23.23.5-6; see also Chapters 16 and 24). The civic crown, a wreath of oak leaves awarded for saving a citizen’s life, was bestowed for an act of exceptional gallantry: one had not only to save another’s life but slay the enemy threatening him without giving ground in the fight (Gell. NA 6.5.13). Likewise a young aristocrat won spoils by stripping the enemy he killed in individual combat in a duel or in the general meˆle ́e of battle (Gell. NA 2.11.3). This principle extended to all the decorations for valor awarded to soldiers; they bespoke courage in circumstances when there was no need to endanger one’s life, bravery ‘‘above and beyond the call of duty,’’ in other words. Worn in religious processions, they formed an important element in one’s public image (Polyb. 6.39.1-10; see also Chapter 13). Renown (gloria) seen in the visible tokens of one’s courage and heard in others’ praise of one’s exploits (laus) paved the way to public office, at least initially. [...] Superior courage in combat thus set some men apart from others and fit them to lead. As such, it served as a central element within the system of values that justified the dominance of the Republic’s upper class. Outstanding valor was thought to have accumulated in certain families, so that over time their descendants came to be viewed as having a greater store of it than others and hence a greater claim on public offices and positions of leadership." <sup id="cite_ref-728" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-728">[728]</a></sup> As for the period following Constantine's conversion to Christianity, no evidence could be found for the enforcement of bravery among Christians, nor indeed does it seem that Christians saw cowardice as a vice or bravery as a virtue, at least in the sense of "the need to be strong, tough, brave, courageous, or heroic in battle or physical conflicts".</dd>
<dd><b>♠ respect for property ♣ ♥</b> Inferred from the fact that none of the virtues listed in the following quote closely coincides with "regulations about the need to respect others’ property, possessions, and territory (e.g., it is immoral to steal or trespass)".

Pietas included duty to the family, the parents, one’s patron, and the state, as well as the gods. The gods were the guarantors of the welfare of the state and the continuance of the social order. Thus violating the social order by transgressing the mos maiorum (ancestral custom in any domain) was offensive to gods and liable to bring bad results on the group. Various moral virtues were early on deified and provided with cult.

Christian discourse was inspired by customary paternalistic language when describing the actions of the bishop as a judge, which combined education and healing. He was to operate at the first level of punishment, the temporal one aiming at penance and forgiveness, to address specific sins committed by individual members of his community. His judgement was, however, not finite, but a means to best equip a sinner for final judgement, which belonged to God. "Translated into procedural terms, the Didascalia recommended, on the basis of Mt 18:15-18:16, a gradual approach to guarantee the healing and teaching aspects of the bishop’s criminal jurisdiction. Only once reproving the guilty in private to make them perform penance had failed was the matter to be taken before a group of two or three, and only in the last instance before the entire church. At this point, if the guilty still did not confess and agree to perform penance, they were to be excommunicated in a formal ceremony, but only after consultation with the bishop’s priest and deacons.

"The best-known case of a person of high social standing doing penance is the act by which the Roman Emperor Theodosius in 390 gained absolution for the massacre among the citizens of Thessalonica, which had taken place on his orders. A great number of citizens of Thessalonica had been killed by Gothic troops as a reprisal for the murder of their general Butherich. Although the penance assigned to the emperor has often been depicted as a show of force on the part of the Christian bishop, it is now conceived as a carefully balanced act between bishop and emperor to redeem Theodosius of the sin and of the political blame he had contracted. In Ambrose’s view Theodosius, as a baptized Christian, could not partake of the Eucharist with blood on his hands. Ambrose did his utmost to arrange for a public penance of the emperor, thereby strengthening the political position of his imperial friend. [...] As Ambrose had expressed it in a sermon delivered during another contest with an emperor, the emperor was a member of the Church and not someone who was above it (<i>intra ecclesiam, non supra ecclesiam</i>). As a member of the Church, a baptized emperor such as Theodosius - which at that time was still something of a novelty - should live according to the strict rules of the Christian faith. The guilt that he had incurred because of the massacre was well known to all Christians and put the bishop in a difficult position. Ambrose could not ignore the emperor’s sin, but could he deal with this sinner as he would have done with others? Probably not, although it has been observed that we lack specific knowledge about the ordinary ways of dealing with sinners in Milan in this period. Ambrose could point to biblical precedents of kings doing penance, most of all, of course, the case of David doing penance for his adultery with Bathsheba and his responsibility for the killing of her husband Uriah. Ambrose’s arguments might have helped to convince Theodosius that penance could also bring honour, but probably Ambrose also showed him the way out of a precarious political situation, as Neil McLynn has argued. In November the emperor declared that he was willing to undergo public penance. In the address delivered by Ambrose on the death of the penitent emperor five years later, the bishop reminded his audience how the emperor laid down all the imperial insignia, bewailed his sin in public in the basilica and implored absolution with tears and laments. He stressed that the emperor was not ashamed to do what the citizens were ashamed of: to do penance in public." <sup id="cite_ref-750" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-750">[750]</a></sup></dd>

Again we can observe that in Rome penitents were assigned a specific place in church. The entry of an honourable lady into the order of penitents seems to have aroused great public interest in the city of Rome. Interestingly, Jerome adds that this episode happened ‘ante diem paschae’, thereby probably stressing the import of Fabiola’s act, choosing to retire from the Christian fold as a penitent right before the most important Christian festival. Jerome presents Fabiola’s case as an example of how a Christian even of the highest social standing should not refrain from abasing themself in front of the community.

Banks were not operated by the state but by private individuals, normally of the social class of the equites, whose level of wealth was high, but below that of senators. The predominant function of banks undoubtedly remained the important role of money-changing for small-scale local transactions such as market purchases or the paying of taxes. ... It is clear that in the Roman empire it was possible to deposit and lend money at profitable levels of interest, that bills of exchange could be used, and that large sums could be transferred between individuals or between places in different provinces by means other than transporting actual coins. Bankers also placed deposits out on short-term interest-bearing loan on behalf of their clients, but most loans seem to have been made for the consumption or the puchase of land, rather than any kind of productive investment."<sup id="cite_ref-757" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-757">[757]</a></sup> "Towards the end of the Republic, however, the so-called centesimae usurae came into use (1/100 per month, i.e. 12% per year). They were maintained, essentially unchanged, as maximum rates during the imperial time right down to the 6th century... Justinian, under the influence of Christianity, was not favourably disposed towards the charging of interest. He tightened the usury laws and reduced the ordinary maximum rate to 6% and to 4% for senators. A special concession was made to those 'qui ergasteriis praesunt vel aliquam licitam negotiationem gerunt': they could charge up to 8%. Regarding policy, it is interesting to see that the problem of usury was tackled in Roman law by way of penal sanctions."<sup id="cite_ref-758" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-758">[758]</a></sup></dd>

As Loesby puts it: "The reconsideration of the late antique regulation of annona-transports in this newly entrepreneurial light has since emphasized the many benefits that shippers enjoyed in compensation for fulfilling their fiscal obligations and supplying the state’s needs at significantly below the market rate. Not only did the state absorb some of the costs of shipbuilding and indemnify the navicularii against the risks of loss, it left them with the means, the opportunity, and a generous time-frame in which to conduct their own business on the side, duty-free."<sup id="cite_ref-759" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-759">[759]</a></sup></dd></dl>

Recent research, however, has shown that the alimenta were schemes to aid families from Italian towns in raising their children. Certainly, some of these boys and girls were orphans in the homes of their guardians or widowed mothers, but most had living fathers. Trajan designed his alimenta systems not just to aid orphans, but to encourage Roman citizens of the Italian homeland to have more children. Trajan and his immediate successors wanted Italian communities to produce more Roman citizens for the empire's vast army."<sup id="cite_ref-767" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-767">[767]</a></sup> In any case, alimenta program suspended beginning 3rd CE.<sup id="cite_ref-768" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-768">[768]</a></sup> <i>epigraphic attestation of such benefactions, known in earlier periods, rare in this period; unclear if this reflects absence of the activity or a change in benefactors' self-representation</i></dd>

Hypoplasias are defects in the formation of dental enamel and can be caused by a number of health issues, including malnutrition, disease, and weaning; cribra orbitalia is generally considered to result from iron-deficiency anemia, which in turn can be caused by nutritional deficiencies or disease; and variation in adult stature, particularly a trend in shorter stature, results when an individual is stressed during childhood, as from disease or malnutrition. In general, skeletal series from Rome show higher frequencies of enamel hypoplasia and cribra orbitalia and shorter stature than do series from Britain, likely owing to the urban nature of Rome, which had high population density and unequal resource allocation."<sup id="cite_ref-778" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-778">[778]</a></sup> Previously quoted as "present" citing Baker (2011: 233), but nothing on that page in Baker's paper or anywhere else in that paper supports such a code.</dd></dl>
