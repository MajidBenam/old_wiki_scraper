<p>Crete is a large island in the Eastern Mediterranean. The Archaic Crete (7th-6th centuries) is divided in the following periods: Orientalizing or Daedalic or Early Archaic (710-600 BCE) and Archaic Archaic (600-500).
</p><p>There was no capital city as Crete was divided into territorial entities, each one centered upon a city that served as the main political and economic centre of its well-defined region. Political, military and religious control was exercised by the Kosmoi, a board of 3 to 10 annually elected nobles. <sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>
</p><p>No information could be found in the sources consulted regarding the polity's overall population, however the largest settlement, Knossos, is estimated to have housed about 4,000 people.

</p><p><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of monogamy ♣ present ♥</b> “Greek culture as a whole was monogamous in the sense that a man was expected to have only one wife at a time (the wife being the bearer of his legitimate heirs). However, exceptions were permitted among powerful men for dynastic reasons, especially during the Hellenistic period (Alexander is a good example, and also the Ptolemies). And throughout Greek history, even ordinary men could have a concubine (pallakis), visit prostitutes, conduct affairs with boys, etc. There was no presumption of male sexual fidelity as a part of the marital state. That was strictly for wives. It was considered in bad taste to keep a concubine in the same house as one’s wife, but that was just about the only restriction. In general, the philosophers said that sexual desire was something men must suppress in order to achieve the good life; they thought that friendship was the most important value and it should always take precedence over sex. [...] The bottom line is that monogamy was the cultural expectation (supported by religion in the sense that even Zeus and Poseidon and Hades only had one wife each). The philosophers did not make much headway in changing this, and where they did, it was more in favor of abstinence (either with or without marriage) than of polygamy.” <sup id="cite_ref-197" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-197">[197]</a></sup>

The only philosopher I can think of who specifically advocates “helping people” over “living luxuriously” is the Stoic Musonius Rufus from the first century CE, but he may have been an innovator in that respect. In general the Greeks had no religious or philosophical teachings to compare with Jewish and Christian teachings about almsgiving, gleaning, or caring for “widows and orphans.” Greek cities sometimes gave stipends to orphans if their fathers had died in battle defending the city.  The most important traditional religious teaching on this subject was that the gods required people to treat “strangers and suppliants” well. That is, you should assist strangers who come to your door in need (and definitely not harm them). You can see this when Odysseus disguised as a beggar receives hospitality (Homer was a basic school text in the Hellenistic period) or in the Hellenistic myth of Baucis and Philemon, a very poor elderly couple who received two strangers and gave them hospitality. The strangers turned out to be Zeus and Hermes, who rewarded the couple. The belief that the gods “tested” humans by coming down to earth was common Hellenistic Asia Minor, where Paul and Barnabas were mistaken for Zeus and Hermes in disguise (Acts 14). <sup id="cite_ref-200" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-200">[200]</a></sup></dd>

Two anecdotes about Zenon: "They say that he was once scourging a slave whom he had detected in theft; and when he said to him, 'It was fated that I should steal&nbsp;;' he rejoined, ‘Yes, and that you should be beaten.’ …’On one occasion, when he saw a slave belonging to one of his friends severely bruised, he said to his friend, “I see the footsteps of your anger.”’ The principal Stoic teaching about slavery (notable in Seneca and Musonius Rufus, but surely drawing on earlier teachers) was that masters should not mistreat slaves and should remember that a slave is not an inferior person, only one with a worse fortune. Both Stoics and Epicureans made much of the idea that ‘true slavery’ is not external but an internal matter: whether one is a slave to one’s desires and emotions. Thus every slave can be ‘free’ and every master can be “enslaved” depending on their character. Even Epictetus, who was a slave himself, did not advocate the abolishment of slavery (nor of course did the Christians).

It is true that sanctuaries sometimes owned slaves, just as they owned land or other forms of property.

This practice might be akin to those mentioned in the Iliad, which does not necessarily mean that they were condoned in the case of in-group members, but hints at the fact they might have been accepted in the case of prisoners of war. "The display ends with Funerary Pyre, the unique funerary pyre of a young aristocrat warrior, aged approximately 30 years, who was cremated with his companion in c. 720-700 BC. This pyre contained a unique find at its northwest edge: the remains of a well-built man 30-40 years old. The body’s position at the edge and clearly outside of the pyre’s limits, its unnatural crescent-like posture, the fact that it was headless, unburnt, and essentially without grave offerings suggest that it belonged to a man who did not die of natural causes. It is difficult to say whether this was an ordinary execution, ritual revenge, or a propitiatory sacrifice. The most widely accepted hypothesis is that the man was a prisoner-of-war who was executed in front of the warrior’s pyre. Based on this unique discovery and on the Homeric description of a similar event (Iliad, Book XXIII, 110-179 ff.), Professor N. Chr. Stampolidis was able to reconstruct the funerary ritual with his collaborators and students in 1996. Thus, the core of the saga of Patroclus’s funerary pyre, with its Cretan protagonists Idomeneus and Meriones, appears to have Cretan origins.

Based on this unique discovery and on the Homeric description of a similar event (Iliad, Book XXIII, 110-179 ff.), Professor N. Chr. Stampolidis was able to reconstruct the funerary ritual with his collaborators and students in 1996. Thus, the core of the saga of Patroclus’s funerary pyre, with its Cretan protagonists Idomeneus and Meriones, appears to have Cretan origins. The importance of the Orthi Petra necropolis lies not only in the fact that it provides the tangible remains of a Homeric burial practice, but also in that it forms a typical illustration of the verses of the Iliad and the Odyssey relating to a specific ritual." <sup id="cite_ref-225" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-225">[225]</a></sup> "Note that the material from Eleutherna was published after Hughes’ monograph and Bonnechere’s article. In my view, the case of Anemospilia deserves a closer look, before it can be dismissed as human sacrifice. On the contrary, the decapitated body found in Eleutherna reminds me of Troilos and his decapitation by Achilles at the altar of Apollon rather than of the sacrifice of the Trojan youths at the pyre of Patroklos." <sup id="cite_ref-226" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-226">[226]</a></sup></dd></dl>

A bad man (κακὸς ἀνήρ‎) does not follow justice (δίκη‎) with his mind, and acts immorally; he represents a source of religious pollution and danger for his community.

<dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of purity♣ present ♥</b> "Hesiod is generally quick to remark that the gods are pleased when the rites are performed correctly, and are displeased when proper ritual purity is not obtained. [...] We can also observe different grades of divine anger: libating with unwashed hands renders the ritual null and void, and the gods refuse to communicate with the worshipper. The failure to achieve the required state of purity results in the failure of the ritual. A graver and more serious offence is committed when someone crosses the river without prayer and the ritual washing—then the gods are not only irate, but also keen to punish. This makes sense: the rivers are divinities, and by entering them humans establish a particularly close contact with the divine. It is one of the basic premises of Greek religion that gods abhor pollution, which is why ritual cleansing is a necessary prerequisite for every ritual action. This would imply that entering a river requires a particularly stringent adherence to ritual purity, while avoiding this purification inspires a particularly harsh punishment—a punishment for jeopardizing the god’s own purity. The intensity of the contact with the divinity corresponds directly to the intensity of the purity required for the worshipper and to the severity of the divine punishment if this requirement is violated."<sup id="cite_ref-237" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-237">[237]</a></sup></dd>

Tantalos' transgression of the taboo against cannibalism also endangered human society, for it threatened the breakdown of civilization and a reversion to savagery, of which cannibalism was perceived to be an important characteristic."<sup id="cite_ref-240" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-240">[240]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>♠ care/harm ♣ present ♥</b> “The philosophers taught various versions of the Golden Rule, whereas traditional Greek morality said it was best to help one’s friends and harm one’s enemies. The only philosopher I can think of who specifically advocates “helping people” over “living luxuriously” is the Stoic Musonius Rufus from the first century CE, but he may have been an innovator in that respect. In general the Greeks had no religious or philosophical teachings to compare with Jewish and Christian teachings about almsgiving, gleaning, or caring for “widows and orphans.” Greek cities sometimes gave stipends to orphans if their fathers had died in battle defending the city.  The most important traditional religious teaching on this subject was that the gods required people to treat “strangers and suppliants” well. That is, you should assist strangers who come to your door in need (and definitely not harm them). You can see this when Odysseus disguised as a beggar receives hospitality (Homer was a basic school text in the Hellenistic period) or in the Hellenistic myth of Baucis and Philemon, a very poor elderly couple who received two strangers and gave them hospitality. The strangers turned out to be Zeus and Hermes, who rewarded the couple. The belief that the gods “tested” humans by coming down to earth was common Hellenistic Asia Minor, where Paul and Barnabas were mistaken for Zeus and Hermes in disguise (Acts 14). Hellenistic philanthropy was closely tied to piety because the benefactions were usually things like sponsoring a festival or enhancing a sanctuary. Sponsoring a festival meant entertainment and free food distribution, but the main goal was not necessarily to help the poor—it was more to enhance the public good. I think it is very likely that the teachings of philosophers encouraged these sorts of activities, but of course the donors also benefited from increased prestige.” <sup id="cite_ref-241" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-241">[241]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b>♠ respect for authority ♣ {present; absent} ♥</b> “It depends on what kind of authority. The rule of law was the most widely respected principle, starting from the time of the early Greek law codes in the Archaic period, when the culture moved from “self-help” family vigilantism and rival strongmen to a system in which men were expected to rely on the state to punish crime and decide civil disputes. Then it was a case of how widely power would be distributed among the citizens—in a kingship, an oligarchy or a democracy. The tyrannos or tyrant early on got a bad reputation precisely because he put himself above the law. During the Hellenistic period, the big problem was how to distinguish between legitimate rulers and tyrants, who were to be despised. Generals were constantly freeing states from the “tyrannies” imposed by their previous rulers and being hailed as saviors. There is much discussion in the literature of how Hellenistic cities reconciled the contradiction between the “freedom” they so highly valued and their obedience to a king. The kings permitted favored cities to self-govern (within certain limits), and this is what they considered “freedom,” quite different from the true autonomy of a Classical polis.” <sup id="cite_ref-243" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-243">[243]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ purity ♣ present ♥</b> “As I have suggested at the beginning of this paper, the idea that a ritually cleaned body cannot free a person from guilt and cannot be a sufficient require- ment for a harmonious relationship between mortals and immortals can be un- derstood as an implicit criticism of rituals. We have already seen that Euripides, one of the most sensitive and innovative intellectuals of the Classical period, criticized both the undifferentiated application of the ritual of supplication and the lack of a distinction between a pure body and pure thoughts. This suggests that the development of the idea of the purity of the mind and its priority over the purity of the body was part of a more general process of fundamental changes in the perception of rituals in Classical and Hellenistic Greece. This process leads from the traditional view that ritual actions are effective when correctly performed to the idea that a ritual’s efficacy depends (also) on the moral and other justifications of the individual who performs it. We may observe this process from the late fifth to the third centuries BCE in measures for the exclusion of criminals from asylum, in the development of a new type of curses, in moral requirements for initiation into mystery cults, and more generally in a tendency towards a priority of the word and the thought over the ritual action.” <sup id="cite_ref-244" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-244">[244]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ kinship ♣ present ♥</b> “Piety required respect for one’s parents, especially in regard to making the annual offerings once they were dead. To mistreat a parent or neglect a parental tomb was a sign of moral depravity. Greek city-states legislated that children owed their parents food, lodging and burial (this goes back to Solon, the first lawgiver at Athens); those who failed in this duty could have their citizenship rights revoked. The worst crimes imaginable were incest with a parent and killing one’s own parent. Killing one’s own child did not carry the same weight of horror, although any kin-murder was considered more serious than murder of non-kin. The expectations for ritual purification after killing made these types of distinctions, and they could be regarded as a form of “regulation.” The Greeks recognized both written and unwritten laws. In general, the need to obey and respect parents was much, much stronger than any parental obligation to a child. Greek fathers throughout antiquity had the right to “expose” offspring they rejected at birth, which meant abandoning the infant either in the wild or in a place known to be used for that purpose, where it might or might not be picked up by slave traders. This did not count as murder, although once the infant was acknowledged by the father and accepted into the household, that would be a different matter. The Kyrene religious law code of the 4th century BCE says that “a man is bound as far as his brother’s children,” meaning that religious obligation (such as paying a fine levied for religious offense on a nephew) extended that far, and only on the paternal side.” <sup id="cite_ref-245" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-245">[245]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ bravery ♣ present ♥</b> “Yes, this was definitely a “promoted value.” The Greeks called it either andreia (lit. “manliness”) or arete(“excellence”). A boy’s first school text was the Iliad, and he had to memorize long passages and write them out (or suffer beatings). As you know, this text is much concerned with the display of manly prowess in combat, which was the ultimate test of andreia. Evidence of cowardice (such as wounds taken in the back, or throwing away a shield in order to run) could ruin a man’s reputation in life or death. Plutarch wrote a book “On the Arete of Women,” in which he describes women who behaved in unexpectedly brave ways (usually by showing physical courage, fighting invaders, or counseling their men against cowardice). Some citations from the Hellenistic author Polybius: 5.111: King Attalus brought Gauls over from Europe as mercenaries because of their reputation for andreia. 6.46: [Citing unnamed sources] ‘For [they say that there are] two things on which the safety of a commonwealth depends,—andreia in the face of the enemy and concord at home.’ 27.8 [Deliberations by the Macedonian general Perseus after a victory]: ‘after this taste of Macedonian andreia, the Romans will be much more careful in the future not to impose an unjust or harsh burden upon the Macedonians.’” <sup id="cite_ref-246" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-246">[246]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ respect for property ♣ present ♥</b> “I recommend the chapter “Greek law in the Hellenistic period” in M. Gagarin ed. The Cambridge Companion to Greek Law (2005). There is also a chapter on family and property law. In general, there was great respect for property and a great concern for handing down property from one generation to another through the institution of marriage. First cousin, half-sibling and uncle-niece marriages were permitted or even required for heiresses, in order to keep property within the paternal family. The Romans noticed this Greek habit of endogamy and disapproved of it. Daniel Ogden’s bookGreek Bastardy may also be of help here. Zeus Herkeios was one of the gods who protected the household and its stores from robbers; there were many gods of this kind.” <sup id="cite_ref-247" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-247">[247]</a></sup></dd></dl>
