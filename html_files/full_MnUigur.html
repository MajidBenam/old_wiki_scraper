Bogu exhorted his people to “let [the country] with barbarous customs and smoking blood change into one where people can eat vegetables; and let the state where men kill be transformed into a kingdom where good works are encouraged.” By 821 the Arab visitor Tamim bin Bahr at the capital, Ordu-Baligh, found the city’s population primarily Manichean.

</p><p>"Yet a few further and more specific comments may be worthwhile. A Chinese source records the situation in 745 as follows: " The eastern extremity was [the territory of] the Shih-wei, the western, the Altai Mountains, and the southern controlled the Gobi Desert so it covered the entire territory of the ancient Hsiung-nu."9 This passage shows that the Chinese emperor recognized the territorial gains which the kaghan had recently made. It is unfortu­ nately a somewhat vague statement since the Altai Mountains and the Gobi both cover a large territory, but it certainly suggests that the extent of the Uighur empire was substantial. The Shih-wei lived south of the Kerulen River. A northern limit is not specified, but probably the kaghan assumed that his possessions ran at least as far as Lake Baikal, into which the Orkhon River flows. The territory of the Uighurs was expanded west with the firmer cooynquest of the Basmil and Karluk and then remained constant at least until the death of Tun bagha. The loss of Beshbalik and its aftermath appear to have reduced the extent of the Uighur empire drastically. We are told that the Karluk "over­ came [the territory round] the Fou-t'u Valley and seized it from the Uighurs."1 0 This valley was probably northwest of Mt. Ótükán,1 1 the sacred forest of the Turkic peoples, and dangerously close to Karabalghasun. In any case, the extent of Uighur alarm over the loss of the Fou-t'u may be gauged from the following comments of the Chinese historian: "The Uighurs trem­bled with fear and moved all the northwestern tribes, with their sheep and their horses, to the south of their ral camp in order to escape from them [the Karluk]." <sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>

Tamim records that "the town has twelve iron gates of huge size. The town is populous and thickly crowded and has markets and various trades."4 2 He adds that it was dominated by a golden tent, which could be seen from some distance outside the city. It stood on the flat top of the palace and could hold 100 people. At least part of the Uighur community had forsaken its nomadic past.

<p>"Associated with the growth of agriculture we find the development of towns, the presence of which is well attested in the passage just quoted. We know also two important cities built on the initiative of Uighur kaghans. One of them was Bay-Balik [lit. "Rich Town"], to which I referred earlier. Work on its construction was started in 757 upon an order from kaghan. The other was Karabalghasun, built at about the same time. Both, then, were completed under Mo-yen-ch'o kaghan, so that the process of urbanization must have begun very quickly after the empire was founded. Very little is known about Bay-Balik, and its precise significance for the Uighurs is unclear. It is certain, however, that Karabalghasun developed into quite an impressive city. It contained a royal palace, which appears from the Shine-usu inscription (south side, line 10) to have been built at about the same time as the city itself, and was completely walled.

<dl><dd><b> ♠ Articles ♣ present ♥ </b> "Earlier steppe people had exchanged some of their horses for Chinese silk, but the scale of the Sino- Uighur trade was unusually large. It reached impressive proportions about 760 and became one of the most important aspects of their mutual relations. A Chinese historian explains its development as follows: The Uighurs, taking advantage of their service to China [during the An Lu-shan rebellion], frequently used to send embassies with horses to trade at an agreed price for silken fabrics. Usually they came every year, trading one horse for forty pieces of silk. Every time they came they brought several tens of thousands of horses [. . .] The barbarians acquired silk insatiably and we were given useless horses. The court found it extremely galling.44 This was a forced trade, of far greater value to the Uighurs than to the Chinese, and continued throughout the period of the Uighur empire. Most of the vast quantity of silk involved could be re-exported to other countries or function as a form of currency. But some of it was possibly used among the urban rich, who were becoming accustomed to a softer life." <sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup></dd>

<p>"Uighur history is not unlike that of the other steppe polities. They conducted many military campaigns against other pastoralists and against China. In A.D. 758 they reportedly achieved a victory over the pastoralist Kirghiz, to the north. In 762 the Uighurs successfully supported the Tang emperor against a rebellion. The Uighurs were frequently Chinese allies, which involved several marriage alliances between the royal courts. Campaigns against their neighbors and internal conflicts continued to be the norm. In 839 there was a report of heavy snowfalls, a great famine and pestilence, and the loss of many sheep and horses. These events, along with the constant warfare with the Kirghiz to the north, may have triggered the rapid downfall of the Uighurs, although a gap in the Chinese sources gives no information on the previous decade (Mackerras 1990, p. 342). The Kirghiz destroyed the Uighur capital in 840 but did not take the opportunity to form an empire or a unified state." <sup id="cite_ref-98" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-98">[98]</a></sup>

<dl><dd>"The T'ang emperors naturally did not share the belief that the Uighur kaghans owed their majesty to Heaven. The Chinese histories record the ritual "appointment" of the successive kaghans, as if their right to rule was a favour granted by the Chinese emperor. The Uighurs themselves probably inter­preted the ceremony merely as a formal act of recognition, for certainly they did not regard themselves as under Chinese guardianship. On the other hand, the Uighur rulers were no doubt happy over this outward sign of approval from the emperor. Despite the contempt in which some of them held the T'ang, the Chinese court retained a good deal of prestige among the peoples of Inner Asia.</dd>
<dd>"In accordance with the divine authority they believed was theirs, the Uighur kaghans expected both their subjects and foreigners to show respect by an act of ritual. Nobody was exempt from this. When Mou-yii kaghan was in China in 762 assisting the T'ang forces against Shih Ch'ao-i, he demanded that the Chinese heir-apparent himself should make a ceremonial dance as a sign of reverence. An official subordinate to the prince refused on his behalf, but this proved a costly stand. The official and three other Chinese were savagely beaten and two of them died within a day. Another ceremonial sign of esteem for the kaghan was that his wives were buried with him when he died. This course was requested of the Princess of Ning-kuo when Mo-yen-ch'o kaghan died in 759. She refused, but succeeded in pacifying the Uighur courtiers by slashing her face, an ordinary sign of grief, loyalty or respect for the dead." <sup id="cite_ref-101" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-101">[101]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ bema ♥</b> "The bēma festival was held on the last day of a Manichean fasting month and marked the end of the fast. In the Babylonian lunar calendar it fell on the 7th day of Adar (Henning, JRAS, 1945, p. 148), i.e., in the last days of February or in March. Although Augustine (Contra Faustum, in Zycha, ed., op. cit., 25.6.1, p. 494.17-20) mentions only March as the month of the festival, certain indications in the Coptic Psalm-Book (p. 14, lines 18 and 25) led C. R. C. Allberry to conclude that the bēma ceremonies lasted four days in all (Psalm-­Book, p. xx n. 6). If so, the 27th, 28th, and 29th days of the fasting month would have been included in the festival. "The whole community of the elect and the laymen gathered together, and the principal ceremonies were a general confession said by the hearers and the elect, an absolution for all sins committed in the past year, and a quasi-sacramental meal in which the elect partook. Between or before these rites, vigil-keeping, hymn-singing, and recitation of canonical texts (such as Mani's Seal Letter) were customary, and no doubt there were also sermons, catechism classes, and telling of parables. "Significance. The bēma festival was dedicated both to commemoration of Mani’s death, as can be seen from the wording of certain bēma hymns (Psalm-Book, pp. 14ff.), and to glorification of his personality and saviorship. Augustine’s statement (Contra epistulam fundamenti, p. 102.11-12) that the bēma fell on the anniversary of Mani’s execution can only be correct on the assumption that the festival lasted four days, because Mani died on the 4th day of Ādār. Augustine regarded the bēma festival as an imitation of Easter because it took place in the same season and had a comparable commemorative character (Contra epistulam fundamenti, p. 203.2-3). "Coming at the end of the religious year and of a fasting month, the bēma was the day of the general confession (see above). It was believed that Mani himself came to this ceremony and personally gave the absolution. His coming from the world of light was vividly symbolized by splendid adornment of the bēma (throne). Being the seat on which the religion’s founder Mani came to sit, the throne probably bore his portrait (Greek eikṓn, Mid. Pers. pahikirb). Presumably the general confession was immediately followed by the meal of the elect, at which there was a ceremony of freeing the light from fruit brought by the hearers as alms in reparation for their sins of the past year." <sup id="cite_ref-103" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-103">[103]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ bema ♥</b> "The bēma festival was held on the last day of a Manichean fasting month and marked the end of the fast. In the Babylonian lunar calendar it fell on the 7th day of Adar (Henning, JRAS, 1945, p. 148), i.e., in the last days of February or in March. Although Augustine (Contra Faustum, in Zycha, ed., op. cit., 25.6.1, p. 494.17-20) mentions only March as the month of the festival, certain indications in the Coptic Psalm-Book (p. 14, lines 18 and 25) led C. R. C. Allberry to conclude that the bēma ceremonies lasted four days in all (Psalm-­Book, p. xx n. 6). If so, the 27th, 28th, and 29th days of the fasting month would have been included in the festival. "The whole community of the elect and the laymen gathered together, and the principal ceremonies were a general confession said by the hearers and the elect, an absolution for all sins committed in the past year, and a quasi-sacramental meal in which the elect partook. Between or before these rites, vigil-keeping, hymn-singing, and recitation of canonical texts (such as Mani's Seal Letter) were customary, and no doubt there were also sermons, catechism classes, and telling of parables. "Significance. The bēma festival was dedicated both to commemoration of Mani’s death, as can be seen from the wording of certain bēma hymns (Psalm-Book, pp. 14ff.), and to glorification of his personality and saviorship. Augustine’s statement (Contra epistulam fundamenti, p. 102.11-12) that the bēma fell on the anniversary of Mani’s execution can only be correct on the assumption that the festival lasted four days, because Mani died on the 4th day of Ādār. Augustine regarded the bēma festival as an imitation of Easter because it took place in the same season and had a comparable commemorative character (Contra epistulam fundamenti, p. 203.2-3). "Coming at the end of the religious year and of a fasting month, the bēma was the day of the general confession (see above). It was believed that Mani himself came to this ceremony and personally gave the absolution. His coming from the world of light was vividly symbolized by splendid adornment of the bēma (throne). Being the seat on which the religion’s founder Mani came to sit, the throne probably bore his portrait (Greek eikṓn, Mid. Pers. pahikirb). Presumably the general confession was immediately followed by the meal of the elect, at which there was a ceremony of freeing the light from fruit brought by the hearers as alms in reparation for their sins of the past year." <sup id="cite_ref-221" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-221">[221]</a></sup></dd>

This, moreover, is also incongruent with the Turkish Xwāstwānīft, which relates yiti yimki “seven Yimkis” (Asmussen, pp. 178, 198). Henning’s explanation of this fact is that Ebn al-Nadīm’s list is incomplete and that the Yimkis of the Three Presbyters were thus counted as three, because they were dedicated to three martyrs, i.e., in effect the memory of seven martyrs was honored in only five celebrations (Henning, 1945, p. 147). The sequence of the Yimki celebrations does not consequently follow the order of the martyrs, for they end with Mani’s death and then concede a central space for the Jesus-celebration. [...] The main achievement of these celebrations was an uninterrupted, two-day fast. The manuscript fragment S (mentioned above) contains the beginning of an index of homilies, which were recited on the Yimki days. It may be presumed that on those days the same rituals were performed as on the common weekly community celebrations.

There is no doubt that the first rulers of the Yaghlakar dynasty held undisputed power. They might ask the advice of their ministers, but certainly felt free to disregard it. As mentioned earlier, Mou-yii kaghan was advised by his Sogdian ministers to invade China. He chose to follow the suggestion. After a disgraceful incident in 780, in which an overenthusiastic Chinese official called Chang Kuang-sheng massacred about 1,000 Uighurs and Sogdians in north China in the hope of undermining Uighur power, Tun bagha was advised by all his ministers to take revenge on the Chinese by the simple expedient of killing the Chinese who came to Karabalghasun to apologize. Tun rejected the advice. It was only at the end of the dynasty that the kaghan's ministers gained ascendancy over him. In particular, El ogasi undoubtedly had the last Yaghlakar kaghan completely under his thumb. The second dynasty provides only one example of a ruler really strong by comparison with the first kaghans of the earlier period, namely the dynastic founder. Yet the impression conveyed in the sources is that the monarchs of the early ninth century were perfectly capable of controlling their own court. It was not until about 830 that the picture changed drastically. By that time the empire was fast crumbling and the last three rulers failed utterly to cope with the rebellious subjects of their empire. The pattern of decline was the same for both dynasties." <sup id="cite_ref-297" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-297">[297]</a></sup></dd>

The emperor allowed the construction of a Manichaean temple in each of present-day Kingchow, Hupeh province, Nanchang in Kiangsi, Shaohsing in Chekiang and Yangchow, Kiangsu.It may be that the kaghan wanted these temples partly as a means of supervising Uighurs resident in China and keeping them to some extent free from the influence of Chinese culture." <sup id="cite_ref-302" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-302">[302]</a></sup></dd></dl>

Moreover, there is no evidence that the functions of the various officials had changed much since earlier times. There were also a few official titles of Chinese origin. Most of these had been used already by the Turks, and not taken over by the Uighurs directly from China. The most striking was the tutuk derived from the Chinese tu-tu. This title had been in use among the steppe people for centuries. According to one authority, it had perhaps "not been borrowed by the Turkic founders of the new [Turk] empire, but by their predecessors, the Juan-juans."It is therefore not surprising that the word carried different meanings among the Uighurs and 8th-century Chinese. In the T'ang empire, a tu-tu was the leading official of a tu-tu fu, a title applied to certain major cities and their environs. Among the Uighurs, the tutuk were tribal leaders and there were eleven of them, one for each of the nine major tribes of the confederation and the Karluk and Basmil. A contemporary Chinese scholar writes that, apart from their political leadership they "were responsible for collecting taxes for the state treasury."  The tutuk of the Uighurs, that is the leading tribe of the nine, was normally a close relation of the kaghan, but not the kaghan himself. Presumably, the chieftains lived among their own people away from the capital, but they certainly held influence at court and maintained their own garrison there.

<p>We are interested here in any systems of thought and behavior that can influence people's actions, which we term a <i>Normative Ideology</i>.  Normative ideologies are thought-systems concerned with the correct behavior of people, governments/leaders, and other groups (and particularly the relationships between these groups).
</p><p>Mainly, this will be a religious or ritual system. As usual, when we mention Religious or Ritual System our focus  is on the 'official cult', defined the same way as in the Rituals section:
</p>
<dl><dd>With the official cult we refer to the set of collective religious practices that are most closely associated with legitimation of the power structure (including elites, if any).</dd></dl>
<p>However, Normative Ideologies are not restricted to religious/ritual systems. They include other thought systems, such as philosophy or anything that prescribes a particular pattern of behaviour.

</p><p><b>Description of the Normative Ideology</b>
</p><p>"Wherever it was present, Manicheism appeared as the religion of an often persecuted minority, with the exception of the Uighur steppe empire and the Uighur kingdom of Qocho, where it gained the status of a state religion from about 762 to the 11th century." <sup id="cite_ref-335" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-335">[335]</a></sup>
</p><p>"Uighur culture changed dramatically with Bayan-Chor’s forced conversion of his people to Manicheism. Manichean doctrines required strict vegetarianism of the elect priests, including the renunciation of KOUMISS. Bogu exhorted his people to “let [the country] with barbarous customs and smoking blood change into one where people can eat vegetables; and let the state where men kill be transformed into a kingdom where good works are encouraged.” By 821 the Arab visitor Tamim bin Bahr at the capital, Ordu-Baligh, found the city’s population primarily Manichean. Manicheism also adapted to Uighur life; Manichean hymns, for example, incorporated the Turk-Uighur reverence for otuken." <sup id="cite_ref-336" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-336">[336]</a></sup>
</p><p>"However, there is no evidence or reason to believe that conversion ever advanced far beyond the Uygur ruler and segments of his family, clan, entourage, and administration during the steppe empire. On the contrary, opposition to the new religion could have been one of the factors in the palace coup that resulted in the execution of Bugu Khan and his Sogdian advisers in 779, since Manichaeans also suffered grievously in the purge. 29 Although Manichaeism was restored to an official status under the rulers Ay Tangrite ulug Bulmis Alp Kutlug Ulug Bilga Khagan/Huai-hsin (795- 808) and Ay Tangrite Kut Bulmis Alp Bilga Khagan/Pao-i (808- 821), it surely served as one of the ideologies of the leadership and not as a belief system that integrated secular and religious life for the peoples of the realm." <sup id="cite_ref-337" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-337">[337]</a></sup>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Rulers are legitimated by gods ♣ inferred present ♥</b> Inferred from documents created in the Kingdom of Kocho, i.e. the polity founded by the Uyghur in the mid-9th centry CE. “Its ideological role was manifested in the Turkic literature from Kocho, which presents numerous examples of the glorification of the Uygur rulers of the steppe. For example, in one text (TM 417 and TM 47 [M 919]), the composer clearly sought to divinize these rulers by comparing one ruler’s death to the “sinking of the Sun God” and his enthronement to “the rising of the Moon God,” so that enthronement itself was likened to a reincarnation of the supreme bodies of Light, resident in the Khan. That these rulers accepted such symbols of their deification is evident from their titles which contained an element proclaiming that they had received their charisma or right to rule from the kun tangri ‘Sun God’ or the ay tangri ‘Moon God’ or both. Church leaders in Kocho had everything to gain from their conscious divinization of the Uygur rulers in the far-off steppe. Deification may not have been the sincerest form of flattery, but it did help to ensure protection of missionary activities within the realm.” <sup id="cite_ref-338" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-338">[338]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>♠ Rulers control supernatural energy ♣ present ♥</b> "Over his wives, officials and people the kaghan was in theory all-powerful, simply by virtue of his royal status. The full title of seven out of the thirteen kaghans includes one of the three phrases tangrida, ay tangrida or kun tangrida, showing that they believed their power was derived from "Heaven," "the God of the Moon," or "the God of the Sun" respectively. The beginning of the Sogdian version of the Karabalghasun inscription refers to one kaghan of the second dynasty as "the great Turkic ruler of the world who has received his splendor from Heaven." This last eulogy suggests that the Uighur rulers claimed universal suzerainty over all nations. Certainly the titles they took upon themselves prove that, like most sovereigns of Mongolia both before and after the Uighurs, they considered themselves to exercise government by a more than human right." <sup id="cite_ref-339" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-339">[339]</a></sup>  We should now take a closer look at Turk notions of the legitimation of rule. The key element, as we have seen, was qut: ‘heavenly good fortune, royal fortune, majesty, charisma’. The earliest meaning of this term appears to have been ‘vital principle, soul’ (Mazao 1981: 59), corresponding to the Chinese qi, ‘vivifying principle or aura, vital fluid’. The movement from the idea of ‘vital principle’ to ‘good fortune’ or ‘heavenly fortune’ mirrors a similar development in the Iranian conceptualization of xwârənah. According to Bombaci and Frye, the Iranian pattern influenced the Turkic. Similarly, Chinese, Indic and Iranian ideas of the ruler as ‘son of heaven’ (Chin. Tianzi, Indic devaputra and Iranian Bag'pur [cf. NeoPers. fag'fur]) may have had an impact on the Turks as well (Bombaci 1966: 32-37; Frye 1989: 139-40). [...] Uighur rulers styled themselves ‘heavenly Qaghans’ (tengri qag an, in Chinese transcription Tian kehan) as well as tengrim, tengri ilig (lit. ‘my tengri ilig quti (lit. ‘heavenly good fortune of the heavenly/divine prince’ = ‘his highness the heavenly ruler’) or tengri iligimiz ıduq qut (lit. ‘our heavenly prince the [heaven]-sent good fortune’).57 The Uighur ruler of Qoco, usually titled Xan, I'lig Xan or Tengriken could also bear such elaborate throne names as kun ay tengride qut bulmis ulug  qut ornanmis alpin erdemin el tutmis alp arslan qutlug kul bilge tengri xanimiz (von Gabain 1973: 68): ‘our khan, the kul,58 possessed of heavenly good fortune, the brave lion who has taken the realm by bravery and virtue, who has been established with great heavenly good fortune, who has received heavenly good fortune from the sun (and) moon god(s).’ The ruler's qut is noted at every turn. <sup id="cite_ref-340" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-340">[340]</a></sup></dd>

It made his body, and his digestive system in particular, a miraculous instrument for liberating the light particles of the World Soul that were imprisoned in melons, cucumbers, grapes, water, fruit juice, etc. By eating those fruits the elect set free the light particles from the material massa damnata and let them ascend to the New Paradise of Light in their hymns of praise, their prayers and, as Augustine derisively says, their belches (ructatibus, Baur, 1831 = 1973, p. 287). This happened in their sacramental meals, regularly held whenever fasting was not incumbent. If we call the communal meal of the elect a kind of Eucharist, it is just the opposite of the Christian ceremony.

But it necessarily entailed a submission to the rules of Manichean ethics (on this subject see in general and in detail BeDuhn, 2000). Their raison d’être followed from the events of the cosmogony. For example, the commandment (in Coptic) “that we eat no flesh” (Allberry, Psalm-Book, 1938, p. 161, ll. 21-22, in Parthian more generally dēnčihrīft “chastity,” Sims-Williams, 1985, p. 575) followed from the assumption that animals were the abortions of celestial she-demons and therefore rich in greed-arousing substance (Baur, 1831 = 1973, pp. 249-51, likewise forbidden was the consummation of alcoholic drinks, ibid, p. 251). On the other hand, the commandment (in Coptic) “that we do not kill” (Allberry, 1938, p. 573, ll. 21-22, in Sogdian more generally pu-azarmya “not to hurt,” Sims-Williams, 1985, pp. 574-75) implied that any living being, but also the earth, the water and the stars in the skies contain particles of the vulnerable World Soul, so that to kill an animal, to cut a plant, to walk on the earth, to take a bath, etc. was a violation of the Living Soul (Baur, 1831 = 1973, pp. 253-54; Henning, 1937, pp. 32-34 = 1977, I, pp. 446-47).//It is obvious that morals like these are impracticable. The dilemma was solved to a certain degree by the introduction of a double set of ethical demands: strict commandments (or rather prohibitions) for a small elite of “perfect” or “elect” people and ten less demanding commandments for the greater community of the devout lay-people (Puech, 1949, pp. 89-90).” <sup id="cite_ref-353" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-353">[353]</a></sup></dd></dl>

A Chinese record states that in 647 the Uighur kaghan "set up the names of officials similar to those which had formerly existed among the Turks,"  and an examination of the Uighurs of the empire period shows no radical departure from this pattern. Moreover, there is no evidence that the functions of the various officials had changed much since earlier times. There were also a few official titles of Chinese origin. Most of these had been used already by the Turks, and not taken over by the Uighurs directly from China. The most striking was the tutuk derived from the Chinese tu-tu. This title had been in use among the steppe people for centuries. According to one authority, it had perhaps "not been borrowed by the Turkic founders of the new [Turk] empire, but by their predecessors, the Juan-juans."It is therefore not surprising that the word carried different meanings among the Uighurs and 8th-century Chinese. In the T'ang empire, a tu-tu was the leading official of a tu-tu fu, a title applied to certain major cities and their environs. Among the Uighurs, the tutuk were tribal leaders and there were eleven of them, one for each of the nine major tribes of the confederation and the Karluk and Basmil. A contemporary Chinese scholar writes that, apart from their political leadership they "were responsible for collecting taxes for the state treasury."  The tutuk of the Uighurs, that is the leading tribe of the nine, was normally a close relation of the kaghan, but not the kaghan himself. Presumably, the chieftains lived among their own people away from the capital, but they certainly held influence at court and maintained their own garrison there. Information is lacking on whether the position of tutuk was hereditary. There is, however, ample evidence that the Yaghlakar kaghans normally succeeded from father to son, a pattern by no means universal among other Turkic rulers. ."<sup id="cite_ref-429" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-429">[429]</a></sup></dd>
