<p>A collective ritual is a ritual in which two or more people participate. With the official cult we refer to the set of collective ritual practices that are most closely associated with legitimation of the power structure (including elites, if any).

</p><p><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b>
</p><p><b>Description of the Ritual System</b>
</p><p>There is no written information specific to the rituals of the Kingdoms of Tabal. The Karatepe inscription, a north-eastern Neo-Hittite site, describes that "The Storm God Tarhunza ... had bestowed upon him the role of 'mother and father' to Adanawa" (a plain) <sup id="cite_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-87">[87]</a></sup> The inscription was written in Luwian and Phoenician; the Phoenician record calls Tarhunza, the Hittite deity, Baal who was a Levantine deity. Several Tabal kings were vassals of the Neo-Assyrians but it was also the polity that succeeded from the Hittite kingdoms. Without any records it cannot be said which ritual system was followed in the Kingdoms of Tabal, or whether it was some amalgamation of all the influences on it.
</p><p>This seemed revelant: "They are commonly referred to as the Neo-Hittite kingdoms, since they preserved a number of Hittite cultural traditions, including elements of Hittite religion, architecture and iconography." <sup id="cite_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-88">[88]</a></sup> Unfortunately, however, the authors of this quote do not then go on to explain which specific 'elements' of Hittite religion and ritual were preserved by the Neo-Hittites, so this quote was deemed insufficient to infer continuity, at least in matters of ritual.

<p>Code the variables below for the most widespread collective ritual of the official cult. Widespread refers to the degree of coverage a ritual has in a polity and therefore to the proportion of the overall population that participates in or observes a ritual. Keep in mind that it is possible that the ritual with the highest coverage is not necessarily a mass ritual performed at one location, but can be a ritual that is performed all over the polity and of which the aggregate of the audiences represent the largest degree of coverage.

</p><p>Based on the following quotes, a certain degree of continuity has been assumed from the New Kingdom Hatti in terms of how kings could have modelled their power after their predecessors.  However, these inferences are speculative and need to be double-checked by experts. On the other hand, inferring continuity in the fields of central and local administration, or legal rights, would be far-fetched considering the lack of information and the difference in scale between the New Kingdom Hatti polity and the much smaller and disparate Tabal kingdoms.
</p><p>"It is now time for us to begin our investigations of the Neo-Hittite kingdoms. ‘Neo-Hittite’ is a modern term, coined by scholars to refer to a group of states located in northern Syria and south-eastern Anatolia that arose, developed, and were finally absorbed into the Assyrian empire during the first four centuries of the Iron Age (mid 12th to late 8th century). The states so called displayed one or more of the following characteristics: [...] A number of inscriptions found at various sites within them are written in the Luwian hieroglyphic script and language. Luwian had (probably) become the predominant language of Anatolia in the last centuries of the Hittite empire. Its use by Late Bronze Age Hittite kings on their public monuments and seals provides an apparent link with later Iron Age kingdoms. The rulers of the kingdoms in question sometimes bore Luwian names, and sometimes the names, in Luwianized or Assyrianized form, of Late Bronze Age Hittite kings. There is material evidence of cultural links between these kingdoms and the Late Bronze Age Hittite kingdom, notably in their iconography and architecture." <sup id="cite_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-89">[89]</a></sup>
Tabal is one of the Neo-Hittite kingdoms. "The Neo-Hittite states varied considerably in size, from a few to several hundred square kilometres. The smaller Tabalian kingdoms are examples of the former, Hamath and Bit-Burutash of the latter." <sup id="cite_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-90">[90]</a></sup>

"It was a charge of witchcraft that led to the downfall of Arma- Tarhunda, governor of the strategically important Upper Land during the reign of King Muwatalli (II). As we have noted, Arma- Tarhunda was related to the royal family, and had the misfortune to be the arch-rival of the king’s brother Hattusili, later to occupy the throne as Hattusili III. Prior to this Muwatalli had made his brother governor of the Upper Land in place of Arma-Tarhunda, much to the latter’s fury. It was Hattusili who had brought the charge of witchcraft, to counter an indictment which Arma-Tarhunda had brought against him:‘Furthermore he and his wife and his son began to bewitch me. He also filled Samuha, the city of the deity, with witch- craft.’65 One cannot help suspecting that Arma-Tarhunda’s charge (whatever it may have been) was not unjustified, and Hattusili's a trumped-up one; it was certainly well within the capability of the wily and ruthlessly ambitious young prince to resort to such measures to rid himself of an inconvenient rival. In any case Muwatalli found against the defendant, and handed him over to Hattusili for punishment, thus ensuring the removal of one of the chief obstacles in his brother’s career path. Yet Hattusili’s treatment of Arma-Tarhunda was surprisingly mild: he let him go free and returned to him half his confiscated property; subsequently he attempted a reconciliation with his family. All this, he claims, he did out of pity, for Arma- Tarhunda was now an old man. More likely he was acting out of remorse—for a charge unjustly laid.The mere allegation of witchcraft may well have generated concerns and emotions which were almost sufficient in themselves to secure a conviction. To judge from the Proclamation of King Telipinu, even a knowledge of the black arts rendered one liable to prosecution. And persons who knew of but failed to denounce those suspected of having such knowledge were themselves liable to punishment: ‘In Hattusa hereafter sorcery must be exorcized. Whoever in the (royal) family knows about sorcery, you must seize him and bring him to the gate of the palace. Whoever does not bring him here—it will come about that things will go badly for this man and his house.’66" <sup id="cite_ref-104" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-104">[104]</a></sup>?</dd>

But even if this were so, the principle of hereditary succession had been firmly established by the time of Hattusili I, the king with whom our earliest written records are associated.

Since Tuatti is referred to by name and apparently held sway over several towns, one suspects that he was the most powerful of these kings."<sup id="cite_ref-126" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-126">[126]</a></sup> The Tabal kingdoms were a multitude of small-scale polities with no apparent overarching structure; hence all administrators would have only existed at the local level. There is no information on whether Tuatti was actually at the top of a regional hierarchical structure.

A liturgy might be recited and incense burned. The animal was brought in, sometimes with great fanfare. only top-quality items could be given to the deity. The substitution of a scrawny animal for a healthy one left the offerant vulnerable to divine retribution. The procession could include singers and musicians as well as other participants in the ritual, such as the cook. The moment of slaughter, for which a special knife was used, was one of jubilation. The animal was then butchered and the deity given the roasted heart and liver. The cook used the remainder of the animal to make a stew to be shared by the participants. The food was set out, libations poured, and the feasting began. At this point the king might “drink the god,” that is, toast him, a practice unique to the Hittites. Ceremonies of this kind correspond most closely to what are termed “fellowship” offerings (selamim) in the Hebrew Bible, the primary purpose of which was the communal meal with the deity.” <sup id="cite_ref-170" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-170">[170]</a></sup></dd>

<p><b>Supernatural Enforcement of Morality</b>

<dl><dd>For this section, include any type of supernatural punishment or reward either in this lifetime (e.g., curses, good fortune) or in the afterlife (e.g., hell, reincarnation). This includes generalized impersonal punishment/reward (e.g., karma, mana) as well as punishment by specific supernatural beings. Include specific details of the nature and extent of punishment/reward in the description. Code "compound" moral actions (e.g., filial piety = kin + respect) in multiple categories as necessary. Morality categories are based on Moral Foundations Theory (Haidt &amp; Graham, 2007) and Morality-As-Cooperation theory (Curry, 2016).</dd>

This relationship is expressed officially in the imagery of the shepherd protecting his flock: 'May the land of Hatti graze abundantly (?) in the hand of the labarna (i.e., the king) and tawananna (i.e., the queen), and may it expand!' In reality, however, outside of his family and principal advisors, the king probably had almost no contact with the people he ruled, living instead an isolated existence designed in part to preserve his life and in part to protect him from pollution. As priest of the gods, the king’s purity was a matter of considerable concern, and the lives of those whose carelessness jeopardized his higher state were forfeit.

The exchange between client and patron was not all unidirectional, but included some benefits to the client.39 Although the payment of tribute may have been a burden to the local populace, causing resentment and even unrest,40 it would ultimately have put more power in the hands of local elites.41" <sup id="cite_ref-260" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-260">[260]</a></sup></dd>
