</p><p><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ unitary state ♥ </b>
</p><p>This is contested between two main positions among scholars. The first assumes that empires and centralization happen together, and is based on an uncritical reading of the main source for the period, the Arthashastra. The source is from the perspective of elites in the imperial centre, and may be overstating the efficiency of the state. <sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>. The work of Gerard Fussman instead presents an argument that the empire could not have been centralized based on both the size and the technology of communication avaliable at the time. This argument is further bolstered by the presence of non-literal translations of edicts in local administrative languages. <sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> As with most questions of this nature, the empire was in parts centralized, and part autonomous. It was a large metropolitan state with an outward looking elite overseeing with varying degrees of success over a large and in no way homogeneous collection of functionaries at both the provincial, district and village level connected together through a central vision originating with the King.

His own inscriptions bear ample withness to the fact. While his doctrines follow the middle path, his gifts are to the brahmibns, sramansa (Buddhist priests) and others equally. His own name of adoption is Devanam Priya, the beloved of the gods. Which gods? Surely the gods of the Aryan religion. Buddhism had no gods of its own. The idea that Ashoka was a kind of Buddhist Constantine declearing himself against paganism is a complete misreading of India conditions.

<p>The Maurya Empire was one of the first geographically extensive empires in South Asia. The formation of the Mauryan Empire coincided with the invasion of India in the North-West of the armies of Alexander of Macedon in 327 BCE, most likely from territory in the Punjab.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>
</p><p>From circa 322 BCE until 187 BCE, the Mauryas extended their control over almost the entire subcontinent excluding Sri Lanka and the southernmost coast, as well as expanding northwest in Afghanistan.The exact origin of the empire is not clear.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> The empire was built on the earlier model of the Nandas. The first three rulers, Chandragupta (324/321 BCE-297 BCE), Bindusara (297 BCE-273 BCE) and Ashoka (268 BCE-232 BCE) oversaw the main period of expansion and codification of the imperial state, with subsequent rulers attempting to preserve the gains made by the first three Kings until 187 BCE. Evidence of diplomacy between the Alexandrian successor state and the Mauryas Empire exist, though whether this was extensive is unclear.  Exact details of when the conquests of territory took place are also murky, but evidence seems to indicate that the majority took place under the founder King Chandragupta.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>
</p><p>The reign of Ashoka was a period of stability and marked the peak of the empire, as well as religious reform. The Maurya Empire entered a period of decline and instability following his death, with weak rulers overseeing a quickly fragmenting state facing outward invasion by Bactrian Greeks. Brihadratha would be the last ruler of the Maurya dynasty, killed by his military commander Pushyamitra in 187 BCE. The commander would be the founder of the successor state of the Shunga Dynasty. <sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>

</p><p>The King was the head of state, he controlled the military and  the bureaucratic administration.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>
</p><p>The Empire was organized under a large bureaucracy and divided into four provinces named after the cardinal directions. Each province had a separate hierarchal administration, with the system duplicated at the capital to oversee the empire. <sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup>
</p><p>A unique account of the Mauryan imperial administration  is preserved in The Arthasastra. A handbook  for governance which outlines a module of centralized government, although whether it is descriptive or an idealized version of the administration  is disputed. <sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>

</p><p>Mauryas in Deccan
</p>
<dl><dd> "The recent archaeological survey by Allchin has also pointed out that while there existed a few possible 'Mauryan' cities in the Deccan and coast Andhra (such as Dharanikota and Sannati in Karnataka), they were distinctly small in scale compared with the cities of the Gangetic valley."<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup>
<dl><dd> "... such insignificant Mauryan presence in the Deccan may represent the non-unified nature of the Mauryan empire. Although the dynasty succeeded in holding vast territory through its military power and refined ruling structure, it was probably almost impossible to constitute a united empire controlled by central government due to the absence of an efficient communicate network and the great diversity of regional traditions. It is more likely that Mauryan rule in the provincial areas was primarily a supervisory role which remained at the upper level. The main concern in the provincial areas was extracting revenue from existing resources to enrich the core region (i.e. the lower Gangetic Valley) rather than changing local societies to establish unified rule in the empire. Although the Mauryas could possibly have had direct control over a few key locales such as Amaravati/Dhamnakataka, the remaining areas, which most probably retained their megalithic culture, may have been beyond their concern, may have been beyond their concern. In short, the Mauryan imperial expansion did not cause immediate and fundamental social changes in the lower Krishna valley."<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup>
<dl><dd> Mauryan Empire: "more recent scholarship has emphasized the discontinous geography of the empire and the internal variability in its administration ... In particular, Mauryan territories in the Deccan and south India appear to have been quite limited, restricted to areas near important mineral resources, especially gold sources along the Tungabhadra River and in the Kolar region of south India. Asokan inscriptions are rare in the western and eastern Deccan areas where the Satavahana polity emerged (... though Satavahana and Mauryan inscriptions co-occur at Sanchi, Amaravati, and Sannathi). Other than Asokan inscriptions and some rare trade wares, these areas contain little direct evidence of the Mauryan presence, and no evidence of the form that presence may have taken. ... claims for its universal status and highly centralized political structure appear to have been overstated."<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

_Notes_
</p><p>"more recent scholarship has emphasized the discontinous geography of the empire and the internal variability in its administration ... In particular, Mauryan territories in the Deccan and south India appear to have been quite limited, restricted to areas near important mineral resources, especially gold sources along the Tungabhadra River and in the Kolar region of south India. Asokan inscriptions are rare in the western and eastern Deccan areas where the Satavahana polity emerged (... though Satavahana and Mauryan inscriptions co-occur at Sanchi, Amaravati, and Sannathi). Other than Asokan inscriptions and some rare trade wares, these areas contain little direct evidence of the Mauryan presence, and no evidence of the form that presence may have taken. ... claims for its universal status and highly centralized political structure appear to have been overstated."<sup id="cite_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-73">[73]</a></sup>
</p><p>"We have a very detailed account of the structure and functions of Mauryan imperial bureaucracy in both Kautilya's Arthasastra and from the inscriptions of emperor Asoka. ... Arthasastra's first six "books" form probably the most detailed manual of monarchical administration in the ancient or medieval world, though more scholarly attention has been devoted to the last nine books, on war, diplomacy and international relations." <sup id="cite_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-74">[74]</a></sup>
</p><p>The Mauryan empire was not a homogeneous whole. It was made up of three concentric areas. The administration consisted of a metropolitan centre, core territories undergoing state formation, and  peripheral areas with a number of pre-state societies. It is therefore the case that the administrative levels and level of delegation most likely varied greatly, but in all cases was essentially exploitative. <sup id="cite_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-75">[75]</a></sup>
</p><p>Kautilya's Arthasastra and the Asoka inscriptions agree on "about two or three top levels in central administration; a minister or ministers called Mantrin (Kautilya) or Mahamatra (Asoka); a council of ministers at the next level (Mantri parishad), and many top officers and public servants variously called Amatyas or Sachivas, in a clear hierarchy. These three levels were retained with slightly changed names in the later Gupta Empire in the fifth century A.D. and under Harsha in the seventh century. The general of the army was also a Mantri of equal status, as were the viceroys or Kumaras of the four large regions or provinces of the Mauryan Empire. ... The central administrative structure was generally replicated in the regions or provinces governed by viceroys. These were subdivided into divisions and districts. The district has continued to be the nerve center of field administration today. The district officer then called Pradeshtri or Sthanika seems to have been much the same as his present day counterpart. He combined revenue collecting and magisterial duties and supervised the work of other technical or clerical officials (Yuktas) as well as village government under the Gopa."<sup id="cite_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-76">[76]</a></sup>

</p><p>"The Guptas in the North and the Cholas in the South made a sophisticated system of village self-government an integral part of the administrative system. But the overall structures of central and provincial administration were essentially modifications of the Arthasastra-Asoka model."<sup id="cite_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-78">[78]</a></sup>
</p><p>"Successive generations of scholars writing on statecraft replicated his ideas in a redefined adaptive manner keeping alive the same ideas of proper administration. Secondly, the general imperial administrative structure of Kautilya was adaptable for smaller empires after the 7th century, of the Vakatakas, Pratiharas, and Palas and they were also borrowed by the Mughal Empire later. But they could not be sustained in their fullness in a gemeinshaft society, without the total commitment of the intellectual elite."<sup id="cite_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-79">[79]</a></sup>

<b> ♠ Religious levels ♣ [1-5] ♥ </b>
</p><p>The Purohita was the royal priest. However, the sanctioned religions of the empire changed with the monarchs, and the multitude of faiths in such a diverse empire is staggering.  King Chandragupta followed Jainism, Bindusara followed the ascetic tradition known as Ajivikas, and Ashoka implemented and heavily supported Buddhism. Individual faiths were undergoing reform throughout the period as well. It is therefore likely that the royal priest was not necessarily resident at court, and rather largely ceremonial. <sup id="cite_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-80">[80]</a></sup>
</p><p>"Buddhist monastic communities replaced the caste system with one based on year of ordination.

<p>Code the variables below for the most widespread collective ritual of the official cult. Widespread refers to the degree of coverage a ritual has in a polity and therefore to the proportion of the overall population that participates in or observes a ritual. Keep in mind that it is possible that the ritual with the highest coverage is not necessarily a mass ritual performed at one location, but can be a ritual that is performed all over the polity and of which the aggregate of all participants represent the largest degree of coverage. If there are several collective rituals that are equally widespread, code the best documented one.

<p>Unlike the preceding rituals, the most dysphoric collective ritual may not belong to the official cult, but may be practiced by another group that has a significant role in the polity. When selecting the relevant ritual do keep in mind that we are foremost interested in rituals containing the highest intensity of dysphoria even though they may contain other elements that are less emotional or even euphoric. Furthermore, we are interested in peak levels of dysphoria for participants or ritual specialists (not the audience or sacrificial victims). Also, as we are interested in how these dysphoric moments are remembered it is necessary for the participants not normally to die during the rituals. If there are several collective rituals with the same high levels of peak dysphoria, code the best documented one.

</p><p>IMPORTANT NOTE
</p><p>‘Among the sources used extensively to reconstruct the polity of the Mauryas is the Arthashastra, which provides a detailed blueprint of how a kingdom should be governed. The precise date of the text remains uncertain, this being the case with many major texts of the early Indian past. Its authorship is attributed to Kautilya, also identified by some with Chanakya and thought to be the chief minister of Chandragupta. The present form of the text is the work of Vishnugupta in about the third century AD . The main chronological controversy hinges on which parts of the texts are datable to the Mauryan period, or if at all, and which are later. Even if some sections are likely to be dated to the Mauryan period, such as Book II, they should not be taken as descriptive since, as a theoretical treatise, it is only a pointer to what were regarded as essential matters pertaining to governance and to a particular political economy. These ideas did derive from some existing features, but the precision of detailed functioning on the part of a centralized government was doubtless an ideal. It is more important to recognize that such an ideal was seen as a possibility. The text therefore is essentially an encouragement to a particular pattern of governance.  <sup id="cite_ref-253" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-253">[253]</a></sup>

The respective Boards were in charge of different departments, e.g. Admiralty, Infantry, Cavalry, War-chariots, Elephants, Commissariat and Transport. According to Megasthenes the soldiers formed the most numerous class in the society. They were not a mere militia or contingent as they received regular pay from the state which also supplied them with arms and equipment.

Numerically they were inferior, but in wisdom and justice excelled all others. The most important amongst the Amatyas were the Mantrins or High Ministers corresponding to Mahamatras of Asoka’s time... The king consulted these High Ministers in formulating any kind of administrative measure. They were also summoned along with the Mantriparishad in emergency. They exercised a certain amount of control over the imperial princes, assisted the king in selecting Amatyas and sometimes accompanied the king in battlefield. In addition to the Mantrins there was the Mantriparishad or Council of Ministers which the king was bound to consult along with the Mantrins in times of emergency. The king was guided by the decision of the majority. ’ <sup id="cite_ref-269" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-269">[269]</a></sup> ‘The Council of Ministers or mantra-parishad existed in the administrative machinery of Asoka, but remained in sufferance as the final decision depended on the king and the latter regarded it as nothing more than an advisory body. A council whose members were personally selected by the king could do nothing but to remain as an ornamental facade in the administrative machinery. “The position of the ministry was not so much stabilised then as to curb his personal authority in the matter of administration and administrative changes.

<dd> <b>♠ Number of power transitions ♣ 8 ♥</b> This number is a best guess based on the literature which admits late turmoil and uncertainty. 1. Chandragupta (322-298 BCE) 2. Bindusara (298-268272/ BCE) 3. Ashoka (268/272-232 BCE). 4. Dasharatha(232-224 BCE). 5. Samprati (224-215 BCE) 6. Shalishuka (215-202 BCE). 7. Devavarman (202-195 BCE). 8. Shatadhanvan (195-187 BCE). 9. Brihadratha (187-185 BCE). ‘Chandragupta Maurya was succeeded in 299 B.C[E] by his son Bindusara. In classical accounts Bindusara is known as Amitrochates, a Greek verson of Sanskrit amitraghata (slayer of foes) or amitrakhada (devourer of enemies). The Puranas credit him with a reign of 25 years while the Burmese and Ceylonese chronicles with 27 and 28 years respectively’ <sup id="cite_ref-289" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-289">[289]</a></sup> ‘Unfortunately these inscriptions do not throw any light on the early life of Asoka for which we have to depend upon the Buddhist texts and Ceylonese chronicles. Tradition associates Asoka with viceroyalties of Taxila and Ujjain during the reign of Bindusara. The Divyavadana deposes that Asoka seized the throne with the help of Radhagupta, the chief minister of Bindusara. This was done against the last wish of Bindusara who had in mind to make his [other] son, Susima, as king. Both the Mahavamsa and the Dipavamsa represent Asoka as a cruel tyrant who had to eliminate his ninety-nine brothers before he became king. According to Taranatha, Asoka had six of his brothers put to death. It is difficult to believe such exaggerated accounts when we reflect that this was intended to extol Buddhism by drawing a sharp contrast between the careers of Asoka both before and after his conversion to Buddhism. Moreover, Asoka’s solicitude for his brothers and sisters which he expressed in unequivocal language in Rock Edicts IV and V cannot fit in with his alleged remorseless cruelty. The most sober view that can be adopted is that there was a struggle for succession among the princes on the death of Bindusara and Asoka had to make his position secure by removing some of his brothers before he could be crowned in 269 B.C [E]. This accounts for the interregnum of four years between the death of Bindusara and Asoka’s coronation.’ <sup id="cite_ref-290" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-290">[290]</a></sup>  ‘Ashoka’s successors clung to a diminishing state structure until, around 185 bce , a brahman general seized power and established a new ruling dynasty called Shunga. He revived the horse - sacrifice in contravention of the ban on animal offerings that had been imposed by Ashoka. But stability eluded the new state, thanks to invasions from Central Asia by remnants of Alexander’s old army, now under independent satraps who sought to rule more powerful states and use the wealth of India for their purposes.’ <sup id="cite_ref-291" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-291">[291]</a></sup> ‘The accounts of different sources about the later Mauryas are so conflicting that a reconstruction can at best be hypothetical.

The last ruler of the line was Brihadratha, and was assassinated by Pushyamitra, the founder of the Sunga dynasty.

The higher officials were extremely well paid according to this scheme and such salaries could have been a drain on the treasury. The chief minister, the purobita, and the army commander received 48,000 panas, the treasurer and the chief collector 24,000; the accountants, clerks and soldiers received 500 panas, whereas the ministers were paid 12,000; and artisans received 120 panas.

The figures given for the salaries of those running the administration come from a section of the text that is believed to be post-Mauryan. The hierarchy that emerges is of some interest in explaining where the emphasis lay in administration. The higher officials were extremely well paid according to this scheme and such salaries could have been a drain on the treasury. The chief minister, the purobita, and the army commander received 48,000 panas, the treasurer and the chief collector 24,000; the accountants, clerks and soldiers received 500 panas, whereas the ministers were paid 12,000; and artisans received 120 panas. The value of the pana is not indicated, nor the interval at which salaries were paid, assuming that they were paid in  money. Some comparison can be made with other sources, mentioning that a pair of oxen cost 24 panas and a slave could be bought for 100 panas. These may not have been the actual salaries but the implicit ratios in these amounts are of  interest.

The birth of a son was not necessary to Buddhist ritual as it was to Hindu ritual. Since Buddhist society accepted unmarried women, the women tended to be less concerned with finding husbands and consequently less subservient. All the same marriage was still regarded as the most suitable occupation for a women. Working women were restricted in their work. The only possibilities seem to have been those of performing in circuses and plays, working as domestic slaves, either in private homes or in royal palaces, and as a last resort, setting themselves up as prostitutes and courtesans.

GJ  ‘Historical accounts indicate that Buddhist education was conducted in monasteries and was open to all members of society, regardless of caste. In addition, Buddhism highlighted the importance of early childhood education, and parents were encouraged to instil daily habits and an affinity for nature during the ages of three to five. These practices helped expand the demand for basic education. Education was primarily religious in content, conducted orally in vernacular language, and emphasized memorization. Buddhist schools also stressed humility and asceticism, and to this end promoted public confession of faults and sanctioned corporal punishment of students. Although primarily offering  a religious curriculum,  Buddhist schools provided secular subjects as well. Children began their education by learning the alphabet, followed by grammar. Secondary schools taught arts and crafts, and higher education offered medicine, logic, and philosophy. Pupils who completed a high degree of education would go on to become teachers and monks themselves, either in their own or other monasteries. <sup id="cite_ref-414" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-414">[414]</a></sup></dd>

A cycle of legends has grown round it making it rather difficult to separate fact from fiction. The Brahmanical sources accord him the status of  a Shudra, a vrishala of low family. Prejudicial characterisation need not be considered valid for history... The Buddhist and Jain sources are no doubt emphatic regarding the Kshatriya origin of Chandragupta. The Pali Sources associate the Mauryas with the noble tribe of the Sakyas to which  Buddha belonged. The Mahavamsa describes Chandragupta as being born of Mauryas who  were Kshatriyas. The Divyavadana describes Chandragupta’s son Bindusara and also his grandson Ashoka as a Kshatriya. According to the jain tradition (Parisishtaparvan), Chandragupta was born of a family who reared peacocks... [from Greek sources]... Justin states that ‘he was born in humble life’ while Plutarch mentions Chandragupta - Sandrocottus - meeting Alexander and reporting about the Nanda king of Magadha as being unpopular for his wickedness and mean origin. According to the Buddhist tradition, as preserved in the Mahavamsa, his father, the chief of the tribe, was killed in a border fray. The helpless widow escaped to Pushpapura (Kusumpura-Pataliputra) where she gave birth to Chandragupta. The boy was spirited away by a cowherd who brought him up. Playing the role of king and administering justice,  he was spotted by Chanakya.

<p><b>♠ Proportion of population enslaved ♣ unknown ♥</b> ‘Sharma argues that “although we have no statistics for the Mauryan empire, the state sector of agricultural production was certainly run by slaves and agricultural labour, and in this sense dependent labour formed the backbone of the Mauryan state” (1958:183). Since the extent of state lands and the ratio of slave to other labour are not known, however, this remains a mere assertion. On the other hand, the so-called free labourers, and even tenants and small farmers, were constrained in various ways, because of the generally unequal distribution of land and wealth and the existence of the caste system.’ <sup id="cite_ref-429" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-429">[429]</a></sup>

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Chattel slavery ♣ present ♥</b> Asohka put forward injunctions to treat slaves well, but slavery was practiced (manumission seems favourable, compared to Mediterannean sopcieties). <sup id="cite_ref-432" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-432">[432]</a></sup>. ‘Slavery did exist in India but here its abject form as prevalent in Europe, where slaves were considered as chattels of their masters, was absent.’ <sup id="cite_ref-433" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-433">[433]</a></sup> ‘Megasthenes has commented on the absence of slavery in India, but this is contradicted by Indian sources. Perhaps he had the pattern of Athenian slavery in mind and the Indian pattern differed. He suggests a parallel with the Spartan system in Greece, which may have occurred to him because of the centrality of status through birth in both instances. Domestic slaves were a regular feature in prosperous households, where the slaves were of low-caste status, but were not untouchables or they would not have had entry into the homes of the upper castes. Slave labour was also used in the mines and by some craft associations. The conditions leading to slavery are listed in more than one text, and among them are: that a man could be a slave either by birth; by voluntarily selling himself; by being captured in war; or as a result of a judicial punishment. Slavery was a recognized institution and the legal relationship between master and slave was clearly defined. For example, if a female slave bore her master a son, not only was she legally free but the child was entitled to the legal status of a son of the master. Megasthenes may have confused caste status with stratification defined by degrees of freedom. Although Greek society in practice acknowledged degrees of unfreedom, in theory it made a distinction between the freeman and the slave, a distinction which was not so apparent in Indian society. A slave in India could buy back his freedom or be voluntarily released by his master; and, if previously he had the status of an arya, he could return to this status on the completion of his term as a slave, according to the Arthashastra. Possibly the function of arya and dasa had again undergone some change. What was immutable in Indian society was not freedom or slavery, but caste. In effect, however, the condition of freedom or slavery was implicit in caste, where, in the overall scheme, the lower castes were less free than the higher, and untouchability could coincide with slavery. <sup id="cite_ref-434" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-434">[434]</a></sup></dd>

Consequently, Buddhism’s ethical system emerged resting squarely on a body of preestablished forms of family practice, and supported by a fairly codified sociolegal system that had already taken form under the aegis of the Brahmanical tradition, sometime before the sixth-century bce. Thus, as a relatively late arriver, Buddhism accepted, tacitly, many of the given forms of social praxis in India. And, even when Buddhism sought to redefine religious goals and family values, these efforts were manifested vis-a-vis patterns that had already been in place for centuries. In short, whatever the exact historical reasons, one will look in vain for Buddhist spokespersons seeking to redo marriage law in India or in other Asian countries.” <sup id="cite_ref-470" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-470">[470]</a></sup>

If we take care of our own spiritual development, we render a service to others; and if we develop love towards others, we thereby also help ourselves. Accordingly, it is explicitly stated, someone who pursues the path of salvation only for his or her own benefit is to be censured, while the one who follows the path for one’s own benefit and for the benefit of others is to be commended (see AN 7:64).” <sup id="cite_ref-471" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-471">[471]</a></sup> “Three segments of the Noble Eightfold Path (3 - 5) are traditionally subsumed under the principle of morality (sila): ‘right speech’ (3), ‘right action’ (4) and ‘right livelihood’ (5). [...] ‘Right action’ is explained as abstaining from harming and killing sentient beings - including animals (!), and further as abstaining from ‘taking what is not given’ and from sexual misconduct, which means avoiding sexual relations with women who are still under the protection of their families, or with those who are married, betrothed, or celibate for religious reasons. From monks and nuns complete sexual abstention is demanded. ‘Right livelihood’ means abstaining from those sources of income which involve harming other beings: trading in weapons for instance, or trading in living beings, meat, intoxicants or poison; also included is the avoidance of fraud and avarice.” <sup id="cite_ref-472" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-472">[472]</a></sup> Jainism: “The ethos of storing up merit leads to all manner of positive charitable activities, for which the Jain community is justifiably famous.

And what little effort I make is in order that I may be free from debt to the creatures, that  I may render them happy here and they may gain heaven in the next world.”’... The new ideas of social and moral ethics which Asoka infused into Buddhism were in keeping with his idea of adapting a new religion to contemporary needs during a period of political and economic transition. Instead of appealing to the narrow sectarian religious interests, he stressed the conscious aplication of pristine virtues of humanitarianism in social behaviour. In the complex cultural milieu of the third century B.C., Asoka inculcated the true meaning of Dhamma - man’s responsibility to his fellow human beings.’ <sup id="cite_ref-474" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-474">[474]</a></sup>

<dd><b>♠ morality ♣ present ♥</b> Buddhism: “If ‘thirst’ and ‘attachment’ constitute the one root of suffering - both the suffering one undergoes oneself in sansaric existence, and the suffering one inflicts upon others - it follows that any successful attempt to reduce one’s ‘thirst’ and to moderate one’s ‘attachment’ will also result in a life causing less suffering (at least less deliberately-inflicted suffering) to others - and this is what morality basically means for Buddhism: reducing suffering, alleviating suffering, causing less suffering. Morality is an intrinsic part of the path to salvation because it is part and parcel of the salvific process of overcoming ‘thirst’ and ‘attachment’.” <sup id="cite_ref-482" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-482">[482]</a></sup> Jainism: “Like Hindus and Buddhists, Jains affirm the reality of a universal moral principle of cause and effect called karma. Derived from a Sanskrit word meaning ‘act’, karma governs all action. It can be likened to Newton’s Third Law of Motion: for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. But traditional Indic worldviews do not make the sharp distinction, so typical of modern Western thought, between the realms of fact and value. Karma thus manifests not only in the form of physical laws, such as gravity, but also as a moral law governing action. If one engages in actions that are violent, or motivated by hatred, selfishness, or egotism, the universe will respond in kind, producing suffering in the one who has caused suffering to others.

<p><b>Supernatural Enforcement of Morality</b>
</p>
<dl><dd>For this section, include any type of supernatural punishment or reward either in this lifetime (e.g., curses, good fortune) or in the afterlife (e.g., hell, reincarnation). This includes generalized impersonal punishment/reward (e.g., karma, mana) as well as punishment by specific supernatural beings. Include specific details of the nature and extent of punishment/reward in the description. Code “compound” moral actions (e.g., filial piety = kin + respect) in multiple categories as necessary. Morality categories are based on Moral Foundations Theory (Haidt &amp; Graham, 2007) and Morality-As-Cooperation theory (Curry, 2016).</dd>
<dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement against harm ♣ present ♥</b> “The heart of Buddhist spiritual life, whether lay or monastic, is punya (Pali punna). This term is usually translated as ‘merit’ and refers to certain significant kinds of action that are regarded as auspicious and potent deeds. Essentially, merit is good ‘karma’ (karman/kamma)&nbsp;: wholesome (kusla/kusala) deeds which plant seeds that bear fortunate and pleasant fruits, whether in this life or lives to come, and thereby create conditions for further meritorious action in the future. These are the kinds of action that conduce to the development of the qualities of the eightfold path. Moreover it is making merit that binds the lay and monastic communities together. The traditional ‘bases of merit’ are generosity (dana), ethical conduct (sila/sila), and meditation (bhavana). [...]The practice of good conduct takes the form of commitment to the five precepts usually recited in conjunction with the three refuges: (1) to refrain from harming living creatures, (2) to refrain from taking what is not given, (3) to refrain from sexual misconduct, (4) to refrain from false speech, (5) to refrain from intoxicants that cause heedlessness (see pp. 170- 2). In addition the lay disciple may on special occasions (traditionally the full moon ‘observance’ days) or for longer periods take the eight precepts, replacing the third precept (refraining from sexual misconduct) with complete sexual abstinence and adding (6) refraining from eating after midday, (7) refraining from attending entertainments and using perfumes, etc., and (8) refraining from using luxurious beds.”<sup id="cite_ref-529" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-529">[529]</a></sup> “The nature of bad action is usually illustrated by reference to a list of the ten courses of unwholesome action (karma/kamma-patha) which consist of three bodily courses of action (taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct), four vocal courses of action (lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech, frivolous speech), and three mental courses of action (covetousness, ill-will, wrong view). [...] Essentially the psychological states that motivate the ten unwholesome courses of action- strong greed, hatred, and delusion -lead to rebirth in the unhappy destinies or ‘descents’: in a hell realm, as a hungry ghost, an animal, or a jealous god. In fact rather a precise correlation exists here: dominated by greed one becomes a hungry ghost, a class of beings ever discontent and anguished because of being unable to satisfy their greed; dominated by hatred one enters one of the hell realms where one suffers terrible pain; dominated by ignorance one becomes an animal ruled by the instincts of food and reproduction.” <sup id="cite_ref-530" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-530">[530]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of fairness ♣ present ♥</b> “In the cosmology set out above, karma functions as the elevator that takes people from one floor of the building to another. Good deeds result in an upward movement and bad deeds in a downward one. Karma is not a system of rewards and punishments meted out by God but a kind of natural law akin to the law of gravity. [...] Buddhists speak of good karma as ‘merit’ (punna, Sanskrit: punya), and much effort is expended in acquiring it. Some picture it as a kind of spiritual capital-like money in a bank account-whereby credit is built up as the deposit on a heavenly rebirth. One of the best ways for a layman to earn merit is by supporting the order of monks. This can be done by placing food in the bowls of monks as they pass on their daily alms round, by providing robes for the monks, by listening to sermons and attending religious services, and by donating funds for the upkeep of monasteries and temples.” <sup id="cite_ref-531" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-531">[531]</a></sup>  “The nature of bad action is usually illustrated by reference to a list of the ten courses of unwholesome action (karma/kamma-patha) which consist of three bodily courses of action (taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct), four vocal courses of action (lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech, frivolous speech), and three mental courses of action (covetousness, ill-will, wrong view).

<dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of in-group loyalty ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> “As mentioned before, the development of a loving mind towards all beings, whether friend or foe, is the aim of one of the meditative practices of early Buddhism (see above p. 53f). In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsaric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21).” <sup id="cite_ref-540" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-540">[540]</a></sup> “[...] Buddhism maintained a fairly flexible posture vis-a-vis competing religions and never sought to require laity to identify themselves exclusively as Buddhist or to rely singularly on the Buddhist clergy for all their spiritual needs.” <sup id="cite_ref-541" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-541">[541]</a></sup></dd>

Some texts affirm that even killing in self-defence, or in defence of family or friends, is wrongful, and in general an attitude of non-resistance in the face of violence is commended. The commentary to the Dhammapada relates how on one occasion when the Buddha's kinsmen, the Sakyas, were under attack, they allowed themselves to be slaughtered rather than break the First Precept.

This term is usually translated as ‘merit’ and refers to certain significant kinds of action that are regarded as auspicious and potent deeds. Essentially, merit is good ‘karma’ (karman/kamma)&nbsp;: wholesome (kusla/kusala) deeds which plant seeds that bear fortunate and pleasant fruits, whether in this life or lives to come, and thereby create conditions for further meritorious action in the future.”<sup id="cite_ref-608" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-608">[608]</a></sup> On the other hand, Buddhism exhorts rulers to punish transgressors and reward virtuous behaviour: “The Sutra of the Golden Light lists several arguments as to why a king who rules in accordance with the Dharma must punish evil-doers and reward the good: In doing so, he demonstrates the basic principle of karma: good deeds lead to good results and bad deeds to bad ones. In this way the king establishes his subjects in good conduct. Moreover, if a king would overlook evil acts and leave the evil-doers unpunished, lawless conduct would become rife and the use of violence increase. By refraining from punishment, a king would thus support the evil-doers and become directly responsible for the growth of violence in his country. Ultimately, then, non-violence is not really an option, for non-violent rule would in fact lead to even more violence. Nevertheless the king’s motives in employing force must be selfless and lawful, his judgements impartial and the punishment measured to the crime (see Emmerick, 1970, pp. 57- 73).” <sup id="cite_ref-609" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-609">[609]</a></sup> This was confirmed by Vesna Wallace <sup id="cite_ref-610" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-610">[610]</a></sup>. However, because it is not clear that the ruler in this polity specifically rewarded or punished certain behaviours in virtue of their morality (e.g. giving alms or refusing to do so, treating one's parents well or mistreating them), these variables cannot now be coded "present".</dd></dl>

According to scattered references which were only fixed a millennium later, it may have dated back to at least the 5th century BCE. There is some disagreement about whether Takshashila can be considered a university. While some consider Taxila to be an early university or centre of higher education, others do not consider it a university in the modern sense, in contrast to the later Nalanda University. Takshashila is described in some detail in late Jataka tales, written in Sri Lanka around 5th century CE.  <sup id="cite_ref-656" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-656">[656]</a></sup></dd>

The system of guilds begun in the early Buddhist period had developed into fairly large-scale organisations. Localisation of occupation, the hereditary character of professions and economic competition strengthened the guilds. The Jatakas mention the eighteen guilds which show the extensive character of the organisation. Each craft had a Pramukha (president) or Jettha (alderman) presiding over it. The guilds possessed both executive and judicial authority and disputes between guilds were decided by a mahasetthi who acted practically as ‘a chief alderman over the alderman of the guilds’. Different guilds also federated under a common president, called Bhandagarika. The guilds worked as banks and received permanent deposits. Registered with local officials and fettered with restrictions, the guilds could not move from one place to another without official sanction. The members of the guild were protected against molestation.’ <sup id="cite_ref-657" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-657">[657]</a></sup>

One was a tax on the area of land cultivated and the other on the assessment of the produce. Ashoka's inscription at Lumbini, commemorating the birthplace of the Buddha, speaks of bali and bbaga which may have been these two taxes. Interestingly, he exempts the people of Lumbini from the first, but continues to impose a tax on produce. The assessment varied from region to region and the sources mention a range from one-sixth to a quarter of the produce of the land. It was generally based on the land worked by each individual cultivator, and also on the quality of the land. A reference to pindakara - a heap of taxes -could suggest a tax collected jointly from a village. The treasury was entitled to tax the shepherds and livestock breeders on the number and the produce of the animals. Taxes on other activities, referred to by the general term kara, were also levied.
