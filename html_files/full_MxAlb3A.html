</p><p><b> ♠ Specialized government buildings ♣ inferred present ♥ </b> If still in use from the previous period, the sunken plaza at Monte Alban (50m wide and 4m deep) could be interpreted as a governmental structure, along with a smaller structure (20m wide) at San José Mogote, as suggested by Marcus and Flannery for the previous period.<sup id="cite_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-72">[72]</a></sup> More generally, Charles Spencer commented: 'One cannot fail to be impressed by the amount and variety of public/institutional architecture constructed between B.C. 300 and A.D. 800 in and around the Main Plaza at Monte Alban. The archaeological data indicate that much of this architectural complexity was in existence by Monte Alban II (100 B.C. through A.D. 200). Many of these buildings do not appear to have been residential and most likely served an array of religious (e.g., the various structures associated with two-room temples), military (such as Building J and perhaps the Ballcourt), and other "administrative" functions (including a variety of other public/institutional buildings the functions of which are still unclear). At the same time, it is probably also appropriate to consider the quihuitao (royal palace) to be another example of a public/institutional building. Both the main candidate for a quihuitao at Monte Alban (the Patio Hundido complex, according to Flannery) and also the example recently excavated at El Palenque (which was probably the capital of a rival independent state polity in Late Formative times) near San Martin Tilcajete (see Spencer and Redmond 2004 in Lat Am Antiq, and Redmond and Spencer 2017 PNAS) were not associated with tombs like other elite (and non-elite) residences; also, both examples had "residential" as well as "ceremonial/governmental" components. Note that the El Palenque quihuitao is securely dated to the Late Monte Albán I phase (300-100 B.C.)'.<sup id="cite_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-73">[73]</a></sup>

Death
Burials-present-elite burials were tombs built below temples. Frequently the cruciform shaped tomb was built before the rest of the temple could be constructed. The walls of the tomb were painted with polychrome murals, including one in which royal Zapotec couples exited the tomb in single file. Tombs might contain one, two or many bodies. Tomb 104 had engravings with figures holding incense bags. <sup id="cite_ref-246" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-246">[246]</a></sup>
Grave goods-Present-funerary urns were elaborate and frequently one-offs. It is thought that they were formed so that the spirit of the heroes and royal ancestors could return and guide the deceased.<sup id="cite_ref-247" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-247">[247]</a></sup>. Many other grave goods were also given. Tomb 104 had dozens of pieces of pottery, filling wall niches and on the floor. <sup id="cite_ref-248" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-248">[248]</a></sup>
</p><p>Gatherings
Ritual Space
Architecture-present-temples-had inner and outer rooms and stood on pyramidal platforms, were not uniform and were dedicated to a number of individuals from royal ancestors, dynastic heroes or supernatural forces. Gifts were given, maybe to dynasty founders such as burnished grey ware beakers, personalised drinking cups have been found. <sup id="cite_ref-249" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-249">[249]</a></sup>
Plaza-the temples were situated in the plaza of Monte Alban, a large public space not associated with domestic dwellings. <sup id="cite_ref-250" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-250">[250]</a></sup>
</p><p>Monuments
Present-Inauguration of king-A stele from Monte Alban shows the inauguration of a ruler named 12 Jaguar. The stone is carved with a figure of the new ruler seated on a jaguar-pelt cushion. Below the cushion is a throne and the figure holds a staff of office. Glyphs suggest pilgrimages and offerings that were part of the inauguration ceremony. The stele is 2.08 x 2.08m (or 8 x 8 yaguen). More stele show military captives and foreign visitors who are ambassadors from foreign lands such as Teotihuacan. Hidden scenes-carvings of Teotihuacan visitors were hidden from view, which may suggest they were offerings to the earth who could see everything. <sup id="cite_ref-251" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-251">[251]</a></sup>

However, a number of important changes occurred around this time. "Commoners were increasingly excluded from the plaza. I suspect that largescale public ceremonies in the Main Plaza were less frequent, and when carried out the presence of elite residences acted as constant reminders of the control of the plaza by the nobility." <sup id="cite_ref-256" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-256">[256]</a></sup> "The ways in which commoners and perhaps nobles from hinterland communities experienced the plaza would have been colored by memories of its earlier uses and symbolism (A. Joyce 2004, 2009a). The evidence suggests to me that commoners were less actively engaged in the kinds of ritual performances and shared experiences that created a sense of belonging and identity with the symbols, rulers, and institutions of the polity. If local nobles actively competed and attempted to undermine the authority of Monte Albán, then central unifying symbols, especially surrounding the rulers of Monte Albán, would have been further weakened. The Main Plaza may have embodied an increasing separation, and perhaps tension, between the identity of commoners and rulers as well as between people in the center and periphery. Residences were increasingly enclosed and inwardly focused during the Late Classic, which might reflect these rising social tensions and divisions, especially among competing nobles and/or between nobles and commoners (Hutson 2002:68- 9; Winter 1974). An unintended outcome of competition among the nobility and the disengagement of commoners from public ceremonies could have been to weaken the allegiance of commoners and lesser nobles to rulers and ruling institutions, especially to the distant rulers of Monte Albán.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ ancestor worship ♥</b> NOTE: Because these rituals were performed differently depending on one's family's status, it seems best here to code only data pertaining to commoner rituals. "Nobles and especially rulers, however, had a greater degree of control over people’s access to the divine, since there is little evidence for non-elite domestic rituals other than mortuary ceremonies (Winter 2002:81- 2; Winter et al. 2007:192)." <sup id="cite_ref-274" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-274">[274]</a></sup> "Mortuary evidence from the Central Valleys shows a concern with constructing and maintaining memories of the genealogical relations of household heads (Urcid 2005). Most people were interred beneath the rooms or patio of their houses, although occasionally burials were located outside, but in the general vicinity of residences (figure 7.3). Urcid (2005:28- 44) shows how conjugal pairs who were the heads of households in each generation were successively interred in tombs or, in the case of some lower-status residences, in stone-lined cists. Archaeologists often find that Zapotec tombs, when opened and explored, contain a jumble of skeletal remains of many individuals along with offerings such as pottery and jade with few articulated interments. Urcid argues that these remains represent a sequence of household heads with the bones of earlier interments disarticulated and mixed due to later openings of the tomb for rituals and burial of descendants (also see Middleton et al. 1998). "Other members of the domestic group from infants to elders were interred in stone-lined cists, graves, and occasionally in reused pit features. High-status residences often included burials of adult females with elaborate offerings that Urcid (2005:40- 1) interprets as the secondary wives of male household heads, which is consistent with evidence for polygyny among nobles at the time of the Spanish Conquest. Neonates and fetuses were often placed within ceramic vessels and usually did not include offerings, suggesting that they had not achieved full adult personhood. These patterns mean that individual residences usually had several different kinds of interments, including at least one tomb. In houses occupied over long periods, the tomb might be expanded, or additional tombs constructed. "The architectural elaboration of the tomb as well as the quantity and quality of offerings found in tomb and non-tomb interments correlates with other indicators of status such as the size and quality of domestic architecture (Urcid 2005; Winter 1986:353- 61). Mourners often decorated the bodies with shell, bone, and greenstone ornaments, suggesting beautification and the marking of status or other social roles of the interred. Tombs and burials were accompanied by offerings of ceramic vessels, sometimes including urns that symbolized deities or ancestors. Dozens of vessels recovered from some tombs suggest the wide social networks of the deceased. In tombs, Zapotecs used red pigment to decorate the bones of earlier interments and at times bones of ancestors were removed for use as heirlooms in validating status (Urcid 2005:36- 7). People often performed sacrificial rituals as part of the mortuary ceremony with dog sacrifices associated with both commoners and nobles, whereas bird sacrifice was restricted to nobles. Interments of rulers may have at times included human sacrifice." <sup id="cite_ref-275" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-275">[275]</a></sup></dd>

Ruling nobles were usually men dressed as jaguars with feline heads covering their faces and with clawed extremities over their hands and feet. These Zapotec kings were often shown paired with queens. Other figures depicted in the tombs were probably collateral kin related to the dynastic line who may have led communities subject to the ruling couple. The imagery suggests that descent was reckoned through the male line, although there were instances where powerful women figured prominently in the succession of rulers." <sup id="cite_ref-473" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-473">[473]</a></sup> "The quantity of ceramic figurines depicting ballplayers throughout Mesoamerica brings home Susanna Ekholm's (1991) point that it was a wildly popular pastime with the commoners and was likely played by both women and men. Early Formative figurines documented by Douglas Bradley (2001) clearly attest to the presence of female ballplayers. Fray Bartolome de las Casas (1967:350) saw games played by women, possibly at Hispaniola. Classic Maya reliefs at Yaxchilan show royal women with a ball in one hand, indicating they indeed played the game or at the very least put the ball into play." <sup id="cite_ref-474" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-474">[474]</a></sup></dd>

<p><b>Elite status</b>
</p>
<dl><dd> <b>♠ elite status is hereditary ♣ present ♥</b> From Religion: "To summarize, imagery on tomb art and carved-stone monuments shows how Classic-period political authority was more exclusionary and less communal than during the Formative (A. Joyce 2004:207- 11; Urcid 2005:154- 5). Genealogy became a key element of ideologies that legitimated the social position of corporate groups as well as rulers. Using Giddens’ (1979:193- 5) framework for understanding how ideology creates, maintains, and justifies sectional interests, genealogy can be seen as having reified status distinctions among corporate groups since the prominence of apical ancestors was fixed. The imagery presented apical ancestors of noble groups as instrumental in the cosmic creation and their continued propitiation was crucial to world-centering rituals. This belief universalized the social position of the nobility by making nobles intermediaries between commoners and the divine, since nobles were both descended from and had privileged access to important ancestors. Wealth and status was further reified since rights to property, privileges, and special offices were held via membership in the corporate group. Members of ruling houses, for example, had the right to engage in warfare, take captives, play the ballgame, and offer human sacrifices. Status within the group was further reified as a function of a person’s proximity to the apical ancestor. Indications that important offices could be inherited, such as that of rainmaker and paramount sacrificer, suggest the means through which other nobles as well as commoners could be excluded from positions of power." <sup id="cite_ref-496" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-496">[496]</a></sup> From Religion: "Mortuary evidence from the Central Valleys shows a concern with constructing and maintaining memories of the genealogical relations of household heads (Urcid 2005). Most people were interred beneath the rooms or patio of their houses, although occasionally burials were located outside, but in the general vicinity of residences (figure 7.3). Urcid (2005:28- 44) shows how conjugal pairs who were the heads of households in each generation were successively interred in tombs or, in the case of some lower-status residences, in stone-lined cists. Archaeologists often find that Zapotec tombs, when opened and explored, contain a jumble of skeletal remains of many individuals along with offerings such as pottery and jade with few articulated interments. Urcid argues that these remains represent a sequence of household heads with the bones of earlier interments disarticulated and mixed due to later openings of the tomb for rituals and burial of descendants (also see Middleton et al. 1998). "Other members of the domestic group from infants to elders were interred in stone-lined cists, graves, and occasionally in reused pit features. High-status residences often included burials of adult females with elaborate offerings that Urcid (2005:40- 1) interprets as the secondary wives of male household heads, which is consistent with evidence for polygyny among nobles at the time of the Spanish Conquest. Neonates and fetuses were often placed within ceramic vessels and usually did not include offerings, suggesting that they had not achieved full adult personhood. These patterns mean that individual residences usually had several different kinds of interments, including at least one tomb. In houses occupied over long periods, the tomb might be expanded, or additional tombs constructed. "The architectural elaboration of the tomb as well as the quantity and quality of offerings found in tomb and non-tomb interments correlates with other indicators of status such as the size and quality of domestic architecture (Urcid 2005; Winter 1986:353- 61). Mourners often decorated the bodies with shell, bone, and greenstone ornaments, suggesting beautification and the marking of status or other social roles of the interred. Tombs and burials were accompanied by offerings of ceramic vessels, sometimes including urns that symbolized deities or ancestors. Dozens of vessels recovered from some tombs suggest the wide social networks of the deceased. In tombs, Zapotecs used red pigment to decorate the bones of earlier interments and at times bones of ancestors were removed for use as heirlooms in validating status (Urcid 2005:36- 7). People often performed sacrificial rituals as part of the mortuary ceremony with dog sacrifices associated with both commoners and nobles, whereas bird sacrifice was restricted to nobles. Interments of rulers may have at times included human sacrifice." <sup id="cite_ref-497" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-497">[497]</a></sup></dd>

It is possible that for many people the Main Plaza and other restricted ceremonial spaces came to symbolize the evasion of the moral responsibilities of rulers to their people." <sup id="cite_ref-518" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-518">[518]</a></sup>

<dd><b>♠ respect for authority ♣ present ♥</b> "Nobles were distinguished from commoners by dress, access to exotic goods, control of esoteric knowledge (e.g., special rituals, literacy), participation in restricted rituals, and by residing in architecturally elaborate houses. Perhaps nowhere is the special social position of nobility as clearly portrayed as in imagery on carved-stone monuments and tomb murals. Nobles are shown in elaborate attire, sometimes dressed as jaguars, richly ornamented and often shown in the act of dominating captives, performing human sacrifice, marrying, or communicating with ancestors." <sup id="cite_ref-570" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-570">[570]</a></sup> "To summarize, imagery on tomb art and carved-stone monuments shows how Classic-period political authority was more exclusionary and less communal than during the Formative (A. Joyce 2004:207- 11; Urcid 2005:154- 5). Genealogy became a key element of ideologies that legitimated the social position of corporate groups as well as rulers. Using Giddens’ (1979:193- 5) framework for understanding how ideology creates, maintains, and justifies sectional interests, genealogy can be seen as having reified status distinctions among corporate groups since the prominence of apical ancestors was fixed. The imagery presented apical ancestors of noble groups as instrumental in the cosmic creation and their continued propitiation was crucial to world-centering rituals. This belief universalized the social position of the nobility by making nobles intermediaries between commoners and the divine, since nobles were both descended from and had privileged access to important ancestors. Wealth and status was further reified since rights to property, privileges, and special offices were held via membership in the corporate group. Members of ruling houses, for example, had the right to engage in warfare, take captives, play the ballgame, and offer human sacrifices. Status within the group was further reified as a function of a person’s proximity to the apical ancestor. Indications that important offices could be inherited, such as that of rainmaker and paramount sacrificer, suggest the means through which other nobles as well as commoners could be excluded from positions of power." <sup id="cite_ref-571" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-571">[571]</a></sup> "Commoners were increasingly excluded from the plaza. I suspect that largescale public ceremonies in the Main Plaza were less frequent, and when carried out the presence of elite residences acted as constant reminders of the control of the plaza by the nobility." ref&gt;Joyce, A.A. 2009. <i>Peoples of America&nbsp;: Mixtecs, Zapotecs, and Chatinos: Ancient Peoples of Southern Mexico</i> p. 219. Hoboken, GB: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; However, no evidence could be found that this value was actually enforced. And even if respect for authority was enforced--which does seem likely--it's not obvious that this would have constituted enforcement of morality, as opposed to, for example, law enforcement, or, indeed, simple enforcement of the hierarchical order, with no connection to morality proper.</dd>
