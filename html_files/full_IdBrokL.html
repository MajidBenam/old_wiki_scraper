</p><p><b> ♠ Original name  ♣ Iban - Brooke Raj and Colonial ♥ </b> It is unclear whether 'Iban' or 'Dayak' was the name used originally. There is some variation concerning the usage of ethnonyms among the Iban of Borneo. 'The name "Iban" is of uncertain origin. Early scholars regarded it as originally a Kayan term, HIVAN, meaning "wanderer." The use of the name by those Iban in closer association with Kayan gives support to this possibility. Other Iban, of Sarawak's First and Second Divisions, used the name "Dayak", and even today consider "Iban" a borrowed term. The participation of a few Iban in alliances with Malays for coastal piracy in the 19th century led to their being called "Sea Dayaks." Iban are to be encountered in all of the political divisions of the island of Borneo, but in the largest numbers in the Malaysian state of Sarawak, on the northwest coast. They have lived predominantly in the middle-level hills of the island, and during the last 150 years, fully half have moved onto the delta plains.' <sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> 'Iban' is the more commonly used term in the ethnographic literature. 'Dayak' is sometimes used to signify the entire tribal population of Borneo: 'Dayak, also spelled Dyak, Dutch Dajak, the non-Muslim indigenous peoples of the island of Borneo, most of whom traditionally lived along the banks of the larger rivers. Their languages all belong to the Indonesian branch of the Austronesian (Malayo-Polynesian) language family. Dayak is a generic term that has no precise ethnic or tribal significance. Especially in Indonesian Borneo (Kalimantan), it is applied to any of the (non-Muslim) indigenous peoples of the interior of the island (as opposed to the largely Malay population of the coastal areas). In Malaysian Borneo (Sarawak and Sabah), it is used somewhat less extensively and is often understood locally to refer specifically to Iban (formerly called Sea Dayak) and Bidayuh (formerly called Land Dayak) peoples. [...] Although lines of demarcation are often difficult to establish, the most prominent of the numerous Dayak subgroups are the Kayan (in Kalimantan usually called Bahau) and Kenyah, primarily of southeastern Sarawak and eastern Kalimantan; the Ngaju of central and southern Kalimantan; the Bidayuh of southwestern Sarawak and western Kalimantan; and the Iban of Sarawak.' <sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> Iban was chosen due to its prevalence in the ethnographic record.

</p><p><b> ♠ Peak Date  ♣ 1900-1946 CE ♥ </b> During the latter half of the 19th century, the Iban communities of Borneo were increasingly subject to incursions on the part of the expanding White Rajah polity. 'During the first phase of Sarawak's history, Broke sent numerous punitive expeditions out from Kuching in an attempt to pacify the area. After each successful attempt in lands which belonged to the Sultan of Brunei, Brooke renewed his efforts to be granted dominion over the newly pacified area in exchange for financial remuneration. With each pacification came new Iban migrations. Piece by piece, the Brooke Raj was extended, eating up the territory of Brunei, while the Iban population continued to move in the same general direction, although not as quickly as the government (Figures 1.2 and 1.3).' <sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> 'The history of the Iban and of the Brookes has been written many times over, the most complete of the studies being that by Pringle (1970). In general, the following years were a study of conquest and expansion from 1841 to the turn of the century. When, in 1904, the British government formally intervened in Borneo, the expansion of Sarawak ended and its consolidation began.' <sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> The consolidation of Brooke Raj rule was terminated by the cessation of North Borneo to the Crown: 'In September 1941, on the centenary of Brooke rule, the third raja proclaimed a constitution designed to establish self-government for Sarawak, but shortly afterward the state fell to the Japanese. When World War II was over, Vyner Brooke decided that Sarawak should be ceded to Great Britain, and, after a bitter family feud, he formally terminated Brooke rule on July 1, 1946.' <sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> 'In July 1946 both Sarawak and North Borneo were made British crown colonies. In Dutch Borneo a strong nationalist sentiment developed and led to fighting between Indonesian and Dutch forces as the latter attempted to reimpose Netherlands control. Sovereignty passed to the Indonesians in 1949, and in 1950 a new constitution proclaimed Dutch Borneo part of the Republic of Indonesia. The British government relinquished its sovereignty over Sabah and Sarawak in 1963, when these territories joined the Malaysian federation. This marked the commencement of Indonesian hostilities in the form of guerrilla raids across the border. These raids ceased by agreement in 1966.

<p><b> ♠ Duration  ♣ 1841-1987 CE ♥ </b> 'At Singapore (founded 20 years earlier by Sir Stamford Raffles), Brooke learned that Pengiran Muda Hassim, chief minister of the sultanate of Brunei, was engaged in war with several rebel Iban (Sea Dayak) tribes in neighbouring Sarawak, nominally under Brunei control. The rebellion was crushed with Brooke’s aid, and as a reward for his services the title of raja of Sarawak was conferred upon him in 1841, confirmed in perpetuity by the sultan of Brunei in 1846.

</p><p><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ loose ♥ </b> Under Brooke Raj rule, the governed Iban communities were relatively autonomous in the regulation of local matters, although a colonial administrative structure was superimposed onto the Iban system were independent small villages. The White Rajahs sought to suppress infighting and mobilize Iban communities for their own military interests: 'In the present day, under the rule of Rajah Brooke, no Sea Dyaks may go out on a fighting expedition unless called out for that purpose by the Government. I remember not long ago that there were some rebels in the upper reaches of the Batang Lupar River, who had been guilty of many murders, and would not submit to the Government. After trying milder measures without any effect, it was decided to take a force into their country, and the Government sent round the War Spear to let the people of the different villages know they were to be ready to go on expedition at a certain date.' <sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> 'Recurring hostility between the Brookes and the highest ranking Malays, who were “Arabs” and Brunei pengiran, grew out of rivalry, and the rivalry was in no small measure a contest  for influence over the Iban population, as the history of the Malay Plot demonstrates. The Ibans were of central political importance because they loved to fight simply for the sake of fighting. The success of Charles Brooke with Iban levies from the lower Skrang and Saribas has already been described, but it is obvious that at this stage in Sarawak history, calling out the Ibans was still a game that more than one could play. At the time of the Chinese revolt in 1857, Charles had summoned his Skrang followers to the aid of besieged Kuching by sending a spear among them.  Three years later the Brookes indignantly accused Sharif Masahor of using exactly the same tactic in the same area to call out hostile Ibans to fight the Rajah after the siege of Mukah.  Well into the twentieth century, as we shall see, the dispatch of a “calling out spear” remained the standard official method of summoning Ibans for unpaid military service.' <sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> The allegiance of the Iban subject population to Brooke authority was loose and ambiguous: 'Friendly Ibans were frequently able to manipulate Residents, who depended on them for information as well as for striking power. A classic case of confusion took place in 1879 in the Second Division, when the Resident, F.R.O. Maxwell, entrusted a Government spear to a visiting Iban headman from the Kantu River in Dutch Borneo. Maxwell asked this man to deliver a message to another headman on the Skrang River, who was supposed to report to Fort Alice. In this case the spear was merely a token of Government authority, according to Maxwell's account, but it was also the sign commonly employed to raise forces for an expedition. Instead of using it to summon the man Maxwell wanted to see, his messenger called out a large force of Skrang warriors and led them in an attack on certain enemies in the upper Batang Lupar. The Resident then demanded a heavy fine from the Skrang leaders, charging that they should have known better, Government spear or no, than to follow a spurious call to arms. But they refused to pay the fine, and made threats against the Government. Eventually Maxwell had to send two large punitive expeditions into the Skrang River to restore Brooke authority. He blamed the whole affair on the principal Skrang headman, Kedu (Lang Ngindang).' <sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none: 1841-1946 CE; vassalage: 1947-1963 CE; none: 1964-1987 CE ♥ </b> SCCS variable 84 'Higher Political Organization' is coded 'Absent', not 'Peace group', 'Alliances', 'Confederation', or 'International organization'. During White Rajah rule, the Iban population and territory were not part of the formal British colonial system. This changed in 1946 when Sarawak was ceded to the crown. 'The 19th century marked the full flower of the British Empire. Administration and policy changed during the century from the haphazard arrangements of the 17th and 18th centuries to the sophisticated system characteristic of Joseph Chamberlain’s tenure (1895-1900) in the Colonial Office. That office, which began in 1801, was first an appendage of the Home Office and the Board of Trade, but by the 1850s it had become a separate department with a growing staff and a continuing policy; it was the means by which discipline and pressure were exerted on the colonial governments when such action was considered necessary. [...] In the wake of the Indian Mutiny (1857), the British crown assumed the East India Company’s governmental authority in India. Britain’s acquisition of Burma (Myanmar) was completed in 1886, while its conquest of the Punjab (1849) and of Balochistān (1854-76) provided substantial new territory in the Indian subcontinent itself. The French completion of the Suez Canal (1869) provided Britain with a much shorter sea route to India. Britain responded to this opportunity by expanding its port at Aden, establishing a protectorate in Somaliland (now Somalia), and extending its influence in the sheikhdoms of southern Arabia and the Persian Gulf. Cyprus, which was, like Gibraltar and Malta, a link in the chain of communication with India through the Mediterranean, was occupied in 1878. Elsewhere, British influence in the Far East expanded with the development of the Straits Settlements and the federated Malay states, and in the 1880s protectorates were formed over Brunei and Sarawak.' <sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> Under White Rajah rule, these protectorates were largely autonomous, and only in 1946 were they ceded to the Crown: 'In September 1941, on the centenary of Brooke rule, the third raja proclaimed a constitution designed to establish self-government for Sarawak, but shortly afterward the state fell to the Japanese.

By the middle of the 19th century, they were well established in the First and Second Divisions, and a few had pioneered the vast Rejang River valley.

After each successful attempt in lands which belonged to the Sultan of Brunei, Brooke renewed his efforts to be granted dominion over the newly pacified area in exchange for financial remuneration. With each pacification came new Iban migrations. Piece by piece, the Brooke Raj was extended, eating up the territory of Brunei, while the Iban population continued to move in the same general direction, although not as quickly as the government (Figures 1.2 and 1.3).' <sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> The Iban population itself was not organized around a capital, and permanent urban migration set in late, temporary labour migration being the norm for the duration of White Rajah rule.

</p><p>[(2); Colonial Towns;] (1) Hamlet or Longhouse Community
</p><p>'Each longhouse, as each BILEK, is an autonomous unit. Traditionally the core of each house was a group of descendants of the founders. Houses near one another on the same river or in the same region were commonly allied, marrying among themselves, raiding together beyond their territories, and resolving disputes by peaceful means. [...] Essentially egalitarian, Iban are aware of long-standing status distinctions among themselves of RAJA BERANI (wealthy and brave), MENSI SARIBU (commoners), and ULUN (slaves).' <sup id="cite_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup> 'Iban settlements are still predominantly in the form of longhouses. During the time when headhunting was endemic, the longhouse provided a sound strategy of defense. It continues to be a ritual unit, and all residents share responsibility for the health of the community. A longhouse is an attenuated structure of attached family units, each unit built by a separate family. The selection of different building materials and the uneven skills of Iban men who build their own houses are apparent in the appearance of family units, some with floors of split bamboo, others with planed and highly polished hardwood floors. The average width of a family unit is 3.5 meters, but the depth, that is, from front to back, varies widely. A longhouse may include as few as four families with 25 residents in a structure less than 15 meters long, or as many as 80 families with 500 residents in a house about 300 meters long. Access to a longhouse is by a notched-log ladder or stairs. At the top of the ladder is an uncovered porch (TANJU') on which clothing, rice, and other produce may be dried. Inside the outer wall is a covered veranda (RUAI), which is the thoroughfare for traffic within the house, where women and old men sit during the daytime weaving or carving, and where families gather in the evening to recount the days events or to listen to folklore told by story-tellers. Beyond the inner wall is the family apartment (BILEK), where the family cooks and eats its meals, stores its heirlooms, and sleeps. Above the BILEK and extending halfway over the RUAI is a loft (SADAU) where the family's rice is stored in a large bark bin and where unmarried girls sleep. The longhouse is constructed with its front to the water supply and preferably facing east. The core of each longhouse community is a group of siblings or their descendants. Through interethnic marriages, members of other societies may become part of Iban settlements to be assimilated as "Iban" in a generation or two. Until the past quarter-century, all Iban lived in or were related to longhouse settlements. Life in the longhouse was considered "normal", and those few people who lived in single-family dwellings apart from the longhouse were thought to be possessed by an evil spirit. <sup id="cite_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup> A longhouse constitutes an autonomous hamlet or village: 'The universal rule is that each long-house constitutes a single community; in other words, among the Iban the village and the long-house coincide. Moreover, traditionally each long-house community is an autonomous entity, not subject to the control of any other group. Every long-house is situated on part of a specified tract of land, and between long-houses there are always recognized boundaries, consisting in the main of unambiguous natural features such as streams or ridges. Each long-house then, is the domicile of a compact and independent community of families, and is situated on the bank of a river that is part of a specified territory over which these various families have either rights of access or ownership.' <sup id="cite_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup> Most migration to urban centres took the form of temporary labour migration rather than permanent migration. Iban generally resided in longhouse villages during the Brooke Raj period.

</p><p>[(4) Brooke Raj Administration;] (3) Paramount Chief (TEMENGGONG); (2) Regional Chief (PENGHULU); (1) Village Headman (TUAI RUMAH)
</p><p>Colonial rulers superimposed an administrative system of regional chiefs onto the village-based social structure of autonomous Iban longhouse communities: 'Prior to the arrival of the British adventurer, James Brooke, there were no permanent leaders, but the affairs of each house were directed by consultations of family leaders. Men of influence included renowned warriors, bards, augurs and other specialists. Brooke, who became Rajah of Sarawak, and his nephew, Charles Johnson, created political positions -- headman (TUAI RUMAH), regional chief (PENGHULU), paramount chief (TEMENGGONG) -- to restructure Iban society for administrative control, especially for purposes of taxation and the suppression of head-hunting. The creation of permanent political positions and the establishment of political parties in the early 1960s have profoundly changed the Iban.' <sup id="cite_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-57">[57]</a></sup> Iban social organization nevertheless remained relatively egalitarian: 'The economic self-sufficiency of the bilik  -family is reflected in other areas of Iban social life. Unlike the Kayan, Kenyah, pagan Melanau and several other Bornean peoples, the Iban are not divided into social classes.  Nor is there any  form of institutionalized leadership based upon hereditary succession, or some other socially divisive principle. Instead Iban society is characterized by a strongly egalitarian ethos. In this respect, each bilik  -family jurally constitutes a discrete and autonomous social unit, which manages its own affairs and recognizes no higher authority than that of its own household head.' <sup id="cite_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup> Longhouse communities are headed by informal leaders doubling as village functionaries: 'In every Iban long-house there are two offices of great importance--one secular and the other ritual. They are the positions of tuai rumah   and tuai burong  . In most long-houses they are held by different individuals, but it is perfectly permissible for one man to hold both offices, and in some communities this does happen. Neither position is ever held by a woman. (c.f. Footnote No. 22). When used as an adjective, the word tuai   means old, or mature, but as a noun it refers to any senior and influential member of a community. Here, the emphasis is not primarily on age, but on the personal qualities of the individual concerned. Thus, a party of young men setting off on an expedition ( bejalai  ), to gather jungle produce, always has its leader, or tuai  , though he may be no more than in his early twenties. And in long-house communities, able, though only middle-aged men often come to exert very considerable authority and influence. In all contemporary long-houses however, there is one man who holds the title of tuai rumah  , or house headman.' <sup id="cite_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup> Some Iban may have joined the civil and military administration early on, but expert feedback is needed on the matter.
</p><p><b> ♠ Religious levels ♣ 1 ♥ </b> levels.
</p><p>(1) Bards (LEMAMBANG), Augurs (TUAI BURONG), and Shamans (MANANG) associated with Longhouse Communities
</p><p>'The personnel of Iban religion, the experts, are those individuals who have specific roles in relation to rice cultivation, augury, ritual celebrations and the ordering of society. They act as a channel between the world of immediate experience and its spirit antecedents and influences. The leading exponents of these roles in Iban society are four, although one or more functions may be vested in the same person. They are the tuai burong or augur, the tuai rumah or village headman, the lemambang or ritual incantation specialist, and, lastly, the manang--shaman or ‘healer’.' <sup id="cite_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-60">[60]</a></sup> 'There are three religious practitioners: the bard (LEMAMBANG), the augur (TUAI BURONG), and the shaman (MANANG). Individually or in teams, bards are invited to chant at all major rituals. They are highly respected men, capable of recalling and adapting as appropriate, chants that go on for hours. The augur is employed for critical activities, such as farming or travelling. The shaman is a psychotherapist, who is consulted for unusual or persistent ailments.' <sup id="cite_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-61">[61]</a></sup> 'For deliberate auguries the knowledge of an expert augur is usually sought. If the undertaking involves the efforts of the whole community, as, for example, house-building, responsibility for seeking omens generally falls on the tuai burong , or community augur. The latter is a man generally recognized for his experience and skill as an augur. In practice, beburong ordinarily precedes a great many lesser occasions, aside from the major ones mentioned, and responsibility for taking auguries normally rests with tuai burong or with the person who leads the undertaking. Because of the importance of augury, any man traditionally aspiring to leadership within the community, as a longhouse headman or senior family head, or within the wider region, as a war chief, migrational leader, or the head of a trading venture, was expected to possess a proficient knowledge of augury. The position of the tuai burong was traditionally one of considerable influence in Iban society and a knowledge of practical augury was an important requirement of leadership more generally.' <sup id="cite_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-62">[62]</a></sup>  Village headmen often double as augurs: 'Administration of customary law and the social code as such, the adat in its restricted and technical sense, falls to the tuai rumah (see above, pp. 25 seq.). Unlike the office of tuai burong , the tuai rumah is officially recognized by the government, although the position carries no emoluments. The functions of tuai rumah and tuai burong are distinct, but in practice it is often the same man who performs both. This was the case in approximately two-thirds of the longhouses studied in the Lemanak and Delok. In the past, while the Iban remained comparatively isolated and pindah migration was a recurrent event thought to depend for its success on spirit favour and the correct response to spirit guidance, the tuai burong was almost invariably also tuai rumah . In recent years, a more settled way of life and the expectation that the tuai rumah will act as host to visiting officials and as spokesman or longhouse representative before the authorities, have come to demand qualities which the traditional tuai burong did not need nor always possess.' <sup id="cite_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-63">[63]</a></sup> Bards provide ritual incantations: 'The lemambang may perhaps be called a priest but he is not the ultimate authority on Iban religion. His concern is with intoning the ritual incantations, called pengap , which form a central part of major ceremonies ( gawai ). These occur intermittently. Although extremely important, they are not as significant in the context of day-to-day religion as are omens, dreams, and social ordinances.' <sup id="cite_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-64">[64]</a></sup> 'The incantations include the full names, honorifics, and nick-names of the spirits. These are unfamiliar in detail to Iban other than the lemambang&nbsp;; even the tuai burong rarely knows them fully. The lemambang , however, does not necessarily understand the precise role of the named spirits in augury or other rites, and does not, qua lemambang , participate in these. Less than being a priest, since he does not perform ritual acts, it is probably truer to say, as Scott (1956, 103) does in his dictionary, that the lemambang is the ‘bard’ of Iban society, albeit the liturgical bard or cantor.' <sup id="cite_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup> Shamans act as healers and perform rituals associated with head-hunting, which are continued symbolically even after the cessation of infighting and head-taking: 'Various female deities are then summoned to “nurse” ( ngua  ) the unhappy head, among them the wives of the legendary headhunting heroes of Panggau Libau. But even the best attempts of Kumang, Lulong, and the others are to no avail - the trophy head is inconsolable. In the end, in desperation, it is passed to the highest ranking shamans in the community - the manang bali'  . The latter are individuals who have changed their sex from male to female in the pursuit of their vocation ( bali'   lit. = “changed”), their adopted status being reflected in their female attire. The position of manang bali'   in society is a very special one in that they are able to slay malevolent demons ( antu  ) in ritual combat. In this respect their role is comparable to that of Iban warriors, except that their deeds are performed in the supernatural realm against unseen foe, rather than on the ground against enemies of flesh and blood.' <sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Military levels ♣ 2 ♥ </b> levels.
</p><p>(2) local war leaders; (1) Citizen-Soldiers;
</p><p>When head-taking and piracy were practiced, war parties were staffed with male community members: 'The taking of enemy heads then, was the prescriptive act for Iban males an act through which an individual could win for himself prestige and status within the longhouse community, while at the same time enhancing his desirability as a potential suitor and husband in the eyes of the opposite sex. But, as we have indicated, headhunting also had a ritual dimension which was of the utmost significance. It is the latter aspect which chiefly concerns us here, being  to do with Iban conceptions of male and female gender roles and relations of production and reproduction within Iban society.' <sup id="cite_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup> War parties were led by local war-leaders or village headmen: 'According to Sea Dayak custom, this feast, the fifth of the nine stages of the gawai burong  , should be held only by an experienced war-leader. Linggir was undoubtedly a very brave man, but he was young, and certainly far less experienced than Uyut, his father. Linggir had already made a statue of the hornbill in preparation for his festival when the older people of the house warned him that it would be presumptuous for him to hold the feast while Uyut still lived. They said that such a rash action might anger Sengalang Burong.' <sup id="cite_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-68">[68]</a></sup> 'Before the gawai diri   may be held, the patron of the feast must lead his warriors against some enemy. So Uyut and his men set off to raid the Kantu Dayaks of Merakai, in what is now Indonesian Borneo, in order to get some fresh heads. But before they came back, all the food which had been gathered for the feast, including tuak   wine and many different delicacies, began to go bad. So a brother-in-law of Uyut named Malang (Pengarah) decided to go ahead and hold the feast anyway, without the war-leader and his men. No sooner was it over than Uyut and his party returned from a victorious expedition. They were naturally outraged. Uyut and the others expelled Pengarah from the Anyut, and he retreated down river to live in the Serudit stream.' <sup id="cite_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-69">[69]</a></sup> Head-hunting persisted well into the 20th century: 'The persistence of headhunting as a living tradition, up until at least the Second World War, and even beyond (albeit in a drastically curtailed form), has meant that many of the details connected with the taking of heads are well documented. Moreover, the ritual significance of headhunting, and its attendant ceremonies, continue to play an important role in contemporary Iban society. We have already spoken of headhunting festivals ( gawai amat  ) held as celebrations of male prestige and achievement, but the traditional role of the Iban warrior continues to survive elsewhere in Iban culture, most notably in connection with mortuary rites. A visit to a Saribas Iban festival for the dead ( Gawai Antu  ), for instance, reveals a more than sufficient number of candidates to drink the sacred wine ( ai' garong  ) dedicated to those who have passed away. Previously, only those who had distinguished themselves as headhunters could partake in this sacred symposium with the dead; today the taking of a life - usually when on active service in the Sarawak Field Force - suffices. In this instance, and others of a similar nature, the warrior tradition of Iban society is maintained, and the ritual significance of headhunting preserved, as a major component in the Iban value system.' <sup id="cite_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-70">[70]</a></sup> Some Iban may have joined the civil and military administration early on, but expert feedback is needed on the matter.

<p><b> ♠ Occupational complexity ♣ absent ♥ </b> Most Iban were subsistence agriculturalists: 'The primary activity of a majority of Iban is rice farming. In the hills, farmers practice swidden cultivation of fields averaging one hectare. Each family maintains its own seed bank of rice, and plants between one dozen and two dozen varieties in any year.' <sup id="cite_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup> 'As can be seen in the breakdown of the Iban agricultural year shown in Figure 1.4, there is a definite division of labor based on sex. During the period of time from roughly November through April each year Iban males  have no specific duties associated with farming and are free to engage in outside activities, such as cash cropping, hunting and fishing and temporary wage labor. It is hypothesized that what was at one time a practice limited to this time span has developed into the contemporary Iban custom of bejalai, a status-validating temporary migration which in the present day may extend over an entire year or more.' <sup id="cite_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-72">[72]</a></sup> During the colonial period, wage labour was mostly temporary and practiced during the seasonal labour migrations of Iban men: 'The most important commercial activity for the largest number of Iban men has been the institutionalized BEJALAI, or journey to work for wages. In some longhouses almost all able-bodied men are away at any given time, working for a distant logging company or in the oilfields of northern Borneo. Wage-earning enabled men to buy jars, gongs, and other valuables for their families. Rubber and pepper have provided an unstable source of income, as has cocoa, a recent introduction. The attraction of salaried jobs is one of the principal reasons for Iban urban migration.' <sup id="cite_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-73">[73]</a></sup>

Iban working in the construction industries have been of great importance in the national development efforts of Brunei.

Charles himself had spent much of his life among the Iban people of Sarawak, knew their language, and respected their beliefs and customs. He made extensive use of down-river Malay chiefs as administrators, and encouraged selective immigration of Chinese agriculturalists, while the dominant indigenous group, the Ibans, were employed in military service.

</p><p><b> ♠ Professional priesthood ♣ inferred present ♥ </b> Full-time specialists 'There are three religious practitioners: the bard (LEMAMBANG), the augur (TUAI BURONG), and the shaman (MANANG). Individually or in teams, bards are invited to chant at all major rituals. They are highly respected men, capable of recalling and adapting as appropriate, chants that go on for hours. The augur is employed for critical activities, such as farming or travelling. The shaman is a psychotherapist, who is consulted for unusual or persistent ailments.' <sup id="cite_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-78">[78]</a></sup> 'Ritual is essential to preserve the spiritual well-being of the whole longhouse, as well as its families separately, and in the middle sections of this study Mr.Sandin outlines the major ritual festivals, or gawai , performed by the longhouse and describes the adat gawai , or rules of ritual procedure, that govern the performance of each of these festivals. More generally yet, observance of adat and ritual well-being are closely interrelated, a point I shall return to presently. As the author stresses at the outset of this study, the longhouse is a religious congregation, whose members are bound together by ties of ritual interdependence. For this reason, adat is of special importance to the Iban, for not only does it preserve social harmony among longhouse members, but, in doing so, it makes possible ritual cooperation upon which their collective prosperity and well-being is thought to depend.' <sup id="cite_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-79">[79]</a></sup> Augurs act as experts in the interpretation of omens, with village leaders often doubling as augurs: 'For deliberate auguries the knowledge of an expert augur is usually sought. If the undertaking involves the efforts of the whole community, as, for example, house-building, responsibility for seeking omens generally falls on the tuai burong , or community augur. The latter is a man generally recognized for his experience and skill as an augur. In practice, beburong ordinarily precedes a great many lesser occasions, aside from the major ones mentioned, and responsibility for taking auguries normally rests with tuai burong or with the person who leads the undertaking. Because of the importance of augury, any man traditionally aspiring to leadership within the community, as a longhouse headman or senior family head, or within the wider region, as a war chief, migrational leader, or the head of a trading venture, was expected to possess a proficient knowledge of augury. The position of the tuai burong was traditionally one of considerable influence in Iban society and a knowledge of practical augury was an important requirement of leadership more generally.' <sup id="cite_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-80">[80]</a></sup> Shamans officiate at communal rituals: 'A month or two after the opening of the ulit mourning period, the deceased's family will now sever the bonds of affection between the deceased and the members of his or her family remaining in this world in a final rite of farewell. To accomplish this a manang , or shaman, is invited by the bereaved family to recite the incantations of the besarara bunga ceremony, meaning, literally, “the severing of the flowers”.' <sup id="cite_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-81">[81]</a></sup> Augurs are not full-time specialists, but farmers like their co-villagers: 'The office of tuai burong is not inherited, although there is no reason why a son should not inherit from his father the same propensity, skill, and good fortune which would enable him to qualify. The essential qualification is success, success in rice farming. Consequently, when the community seeks a new tuai burong to lead the community, it is customary to seek among those who are regularly successful ( ni orang ti sebak bulih dia nanya ). When a tuai burong has been provisionally selected by the community as a whole, it is expected that his appointement will be confirmed to him in a dream. Should the spirits fail to give their approval in this way, the provisional tuai burong does not qualify to take office and it becomes necessary to consider an alternative candidate.' <sup id="cite_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-82">[82]</a></sup> The same is true for shamans: 'The manang , as someone capable of intercourse with the spirit world may be a person of some power in the locality where he operates. Usually his influence is confined to a limited area, though the reputation of certain exceptional manang may extend more widely. But although known for his achievements when effective, the manang is not otherwise a man of consequence or status in the community. Nor did I come across an instance of a manang who was also an augur ( tuai burong ) or headman ( tuai rumah ). On the contrary, the expression ‘to be like a manang’ ( baka manang ) is derogatory since it implies that a man grows insufficient rice for his bilek. [...] In the terms of normal Iban values, the manang is not a success. Success is measured largely in plentiful harvests, and the manang , who has frequently to be absent from his farm, is rarely a successful farmer, although his own farm-work may be supplemented by the labour of others given in lieu of payment for his services. Since a good name among men is also associated with physical prowess and skill in felling, hunting, and on expeditions, the manang is seldom a man of standing. The majority of manang suffer or have suffered from a physical handicap of which blindness or poor sight is by far the commonest, and a characteristic associated with the manang . While the manang may not enjoy the prestige of a respected position in Iban society, he is nevertheless likely to be widely known and feared by many. This is partly because the Iban acknowledge their need for a manang in certain circumstances, and partly because a human being at times so intimately associated with the spirits carries some of the attributes of spirit power or has the aura of it.' <sup id="cite_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-83">[83]</a></sup>

<p><b> ♠ Full-time bureaucrats ♣ absent ♥ </b> Full-time specialists The village headmen and war-leaders were not bureaucrats, as there was little formalization on the village level. But the White Rajahs established an administrative structure which was superimposed on the local-level system of the Iban: 'Throughout the twenties, the following administrative innovations were introduced: the establishment of a formal Secretariat under the chief secretary in Kuching in 1923; the creation of a legal department in 1928, and between 1924 and 1926, municipal administration was established in Kuching and Sibu. This trend towards establishing and expanding the administrative bodies of Vyner Brooke's rule continued until 1929, when the effects of the world depression brought about a decline in revenue, and necessitated some retrenchment (ibid, p. 335).' <sup id="cite_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-84">[84]</a></sup> Initially, Iban males were excluded from the newly established administration: 'As the Brooke's administrative positions were not opened to Iban then, these men on the whole had to be content with becoming medical assistants or policemen, while the more adventurous ones left for Singapore and Malaya to join government services. After the war, while most groups in the country were recovering from the impact of the Japanese occupation, Paku Iban were in a better position to take advantage of the rubber boom of the mid 1940's and early 1950's.' <sup id="cite_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-85">[85]</a></sup> Government officials and codes nevertheless sought to regulate Iban affairs, even though villages remained relatively autonomous in most matters: 'In ancient times before a large gawai was celebrated, such as the Gawai Burong and Gawai Antu, tubai fishing was carried out by the sponsoring longhouse and the catch salted and smoked in order to provide provisions for the feast. Today this method of fishing is regulated by the government and those who wish to engage in tubai fishing are expected to obtain prior permission from the local District Officer, although not all do so and individual violations are relatively frequent, and are highly destructive especially when insecticides or chemical poisons are used to kill fish, rather than the traditional tubai.' <sup id="cite_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-86">[86]</a></sup> In general, though, the Brooke Raj administration sought to shield their Iban subjects from the adverse effects of 'modernization': 'Only an unusually strong and far sighted ruler would have seen any virtue in such a suggestion in the pre-war years. If there were some administrators who recognized the need for change, and whose efforts initiated the limited new programs already described after 1935, there was in general little sense of urgency abroad in the land. The Rajah might talk of eventual independence in introducing the new constitution, but self-government was not yet an idea which many people took seriously. There were some Ibans who were already anxious for  more education, but the majority were still living in a world of wholly local, traditional concerns. Because it was a state of smallholders, and owing partly to the oil field at Miri, Sarawak had weathered the world depression with only minor hardships and dislocations. In 1941 it was a comparatively comfortable, profoundly isolated corner of colonial Southeast Asia. A weekly steamer provided the only connection between Kuching and Singapore, and when it sailed up the Sarawak River, a cannon shot from the damp-stained parapets of the old fort boomed out to signal the great event. To most Europeans and Asians alike, the great centers of trade, learning and politics all seemed very far away. It was altogether easy for a Government to remain convinced that modernization was remote and irrelevant.' <sup id="cite_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-87">[87]</a></sup> Iban 'government chiefs' were appointed regional leaders rather than full-time bureaucrats. Some Iban may have joined the civil and military administration early on, but expert feedback is needed on the matter.
</p><p><b> ♠ Source of support ♣ state salary ♥ </b> The Brooke administration appointed officers dealing with military and other executive matters: 'About three years later, the Orang Kaya Pemancha Dana (Bayang) led a large force against the Undup Ibans, who had killed his brother, Angkum. Long remembered as the ‘great bala ’, this expedition completely defeated the Undups, many of whom were killed or taken captive. The survivors fled to Lingga and the Kapuas valley and settled in the Salimbau area. They did not return to their old homes until the time of Mr Brereton, the first officer of James Brooke to serve in the Batang Lupar region, only to discover that many of their lands and fruit trees had been occupied by Skrang Ibans. Likewise, the Ulu Undup had been settled by Ibans from the Kumpang branch of the Batang Ai.' <sup id="cite_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-88">[88]</a></sup> The White Rajah administration also established courts dealing with civil matters such as land tenure and agriculture: 'The Brooke courts helped to reinforce the development of common farming land in the Second Division by adopting the principle that any land which had not been utilized for a specified period (including virgin land) reverted to the Government. For example, in Abang Embit [Page 20] and others v Penghulu Luta , an important case from the Paku, it was stated: “By published Gov't Orders, jungle of over 3 years growth on swamp and 7 years on hill land cannot be claimed by anyone, being the property of the State . . . [A]nyone wishing to fell same for the purpose of farming, may do so without the necessity for a permit” (Betong Court Book 1920:483). It is not clear to which Government Orders this statement refers, nor on what basis the 3 and 7 year limits were chosen (given that, for hill rice farming, 7 years is close to the absolute minimum fallow period required for sustained yield). Nevertheless, the use of these guidelines by the courts had the effect of strengthening the trend towards greater community control over the disposal of farming land, as in practice the designated “State land” differed little from the common land described by Phillips.' <sup id="cite_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-89">[89]</a></sup> The officials employed in the Brooke administration were probably salaried, although the sources reviewed so far are silent on that matter. Iban 'government chiefs' were salaried: 'The appointment to Penghulu   is salaried. Before the Japanese occupation it was made by the government for life; Penghulus   are now appointed for a limited period (of five years) on the basis of a local election. Although the office is not hereditary, it is not uncommon for the Penghulu   to be succeeded by his son or other relative.  This is especially true when a Penghulu   has been  conspicuously successful in office. Since profound knowledge of customary law and precedent, respected judgement, and wide acquaintance with the area administered are prerequisites, the son, son-in-law, or other close relative of a retiring Penghulu   is considered more likely to possess these than any other person. The tendency is, therefore, to look first for suitable candidates among the Penghulu's   immediate relatives, and only if these are found wanting, to seek elsewhere. Where a particular Penghulu   has lost public respect, a rival leader for the area may evolve, and he naturally becomes a strong candidate for the succession.' <sup id="cite_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-90">[90]</a></sup>

<p><b> ♠ Formal legal code ♣ absent: 1841-1924 CE; inferred present: 1924-1987 CE ♥ </b> Initially, Iban customary law was not formalized: 'The legal rights and duties of every Iban is defined by the adat  , customary law. Among the laws affecting women are courtship, marriage, divorce, inheritance, and fines imposed in cases of infraction of the law. The fines are  payed in kati  ,  the value of which is based on brass or bronze, or in money; one kati   equals one dollar.' <sup id="cite_ref-98" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-98">[98]</a></sup> The White Rajah administration introduced a formal penal code: 'Sir Charles Vyner de Windt Brooke (b.

It is, therefore, to be expected that Iban religion--their agricultural rituals and ordering of society--might vary from district to district. Some differences certainly exist, but those who know the Iban well are constantly impressed by the homogeneous quality of their culture. Knowing that the social order and customary law are rooted in Iban religion, A. J.N. Richards, at that time Resident of the Second Division, decided in 1961 to convene in Simanggang a meeting of traditional and religious leaders to discuss the standardization of Second Division (Iban) law, the formal core of the Iban way of life. The meeting, at which I was present, was attended by thirty-five Iban gathered from all over the Division: apart from a few manang ( shaman /healers) (see below, pp. 59-64; also 142 seq.), these were all either recognized community leaders ( penghulu and tuai rumah )--hence also tuai burong in many cases, religious incantation experts ( lemambang ), or, as is not unusual, persons combining more than one office.' <sup id="cite_ref-100" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-100">[100]</a></sup> We have assumed that the penal code was applied to Iban offenders as well.
</p><p><b> ♠ Judges ♣ absent: 1841-1924 CE; inferred present: 1924-1987 CE ♥ </b> SCCS variable 89 'Judiciary' is coded as 'absent'. From the point of view of Iban adat, a longhouse community functions as a judicial unit: 'Although each of its component families is largely autonomous, the longhouse as a whole also functions as an important legal unit. In former times, every longhouse was, as we have noted, a politically sovereign community. Even now, the longhouse headman is looked upon as the chief guardian of community adat . He and other longhouse elders are expected to be well-versed in adat and to make known to their followers what the rules of adat require of them. Through informal meetings and judicial hearings they are also expected to enforce compliance with these rules and, following their stipulations, resolve disputes and redress compliants that arise within the community. In addition to this the longhouse as a whole is thought to possess a collective ritual status with regard to the spiritual world (Richards 1963:1-2).' <sup id="cite_ref-101" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-101">[101]</a></sup> Village headmen double as judges in local matters: 'When the Tuai Rumah learns that a serious offence, such as adultery, has been committed, he must sacrifice a chicken at once. The significance of this sacrifice is that it calls public attention to the offence and indicates that it is now under formal juridical review, and that the parties involved are no longer permitted to resort to private vengeance or self-help. He must act at once, as any delay might result in bloodshed, in which case the Tuai Rumah himself is liable to be fined. Traditionally an injured husband or wife had the right to retaliate in the case of adultery provided the adulterous couple were found in flogrante delicto   and the retaliation was carried out at once.' <sup id="cite_ref-102" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-102">[102]</a></sup> But the Brooke administration established formal courts on district/polity level: 'By 1900, Brooke control of Sarawak was fairly well established. The government was gradually extending its efforts into such fields as agricultural research. As it established a system of courts and law, effort was made, whenever possible, to codify and preserve local customary law ( adat ). From this time on, the mainstream of Iban migration was much less violent, despite cultural ideals, and as we will see, much slower.

The risk of attack would have made it quite foolhardy to have an extensive dampasystem during the last century, especially in areas where “pacification” had not yet been undertaken. A dampa , having a much smaller number of people, would then be very vulnerable and it is possible that the furthest outlying farms were much closer to the main longhouse than is the case today, so that when the alarm was sounded to warn that an imminent attack might occur, there would have been a better chance for the people to reach the main longhouse, which could be more successfully defended.

This ease of access becomes an especial boon, when, after reaping, the padi has to be carried down from the hill tops--in huge baskets ( lanji  ) slung from the shoulders--to be threshed, winnowed and stored. Again, a house near to relatively unfrequented jungle presents far better opportunities than does the main long-house for that foraging for wild fruits, fungi, and other edible plants, at which Iban women excel. There are likewise better opportunities for hunting and fishing.

According to one informer it is not worth the trouble to work the family rubber trees, since the cost of processing the rubber comes to about the same as the price (for example, the cost for diluted acid for coagulating rubber latex is $1.50 per bottle). Most Iban have small holdings of rubber, the usual size is between 200-300 trees per family. The government assistance is by way of providing planting schemes (called RPS or Rubber Planting Schemes) to replant old trees with high yielding rubber. Under this scheme in 1971, over 300 acreas of rubber were to be replanted (ARLAD 1971). The Iban's gardens include both ‘RPS’ and old ones. The total district rubber sheet production for 1970 was 10,000 pikuls  . The rubber is bought by Chinese retailers in Engkilili and Lubuk Antu bazaars who then smoke the sheets and transport them to Kuching for shipment overseas. Iban in the district sell only unsmoked rubber (ARLAD 1970).' <sup id="cite_ref-117" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-117">[117]</a></sup> Trade relations were frequently channelled through non-tribal middlemen: 'Chinese and Iban economic relations characteristically have been of a patron-client nature. In early trading contacts, the Chinese were dependent upon Ibans and other indigenes for the supply of jungle produce on which their livelihood was based. With the establishment of trading centers such as the Sibu pasar, exchange tended to become fixed between the Iban client and his Chinese patron ( towkay  ), rather than an Iban dealing with a number of different businessmen. The patron-client relationship has proved to be of mutual advantage to both parties. In time of need ( maya suntok  ), the Iban can obtain credit or even a cash advance from his towkay. When he has marketable goods, he is assured of  an outlet through the trader. When he comes to the pasar   on business, because of an illness, or just to see the town ( ngalu diri'  ) he can usually find lodging over or behind his towkay's   shophouse. From the towkay's   perspective, he has an assurance of produce, as well as first choice on anything the client brings to market. Whereas the client usually has but one towkay  , the patron has a number of clients, all of whom are bound to him by credit relations. These relations are built upon trust and friendship which is honored in a majority of cases.' <sup id="cite_ref-118" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-118">[118]</a></sup> Some Iban leaders also formally owned bazaar shops: 'By 1900 it was not uncommon for Third Division Iban leaders to own bazaar shophouses.  Since the Ibans never took part in the operation of the business, which remained entirely in the hands of the Chinese, “owning” a shop in this manner was really no more than a form of loan, with rental substituted for interest and the shophouse serving as security. In the Second Division, where the Ibans did not enjoy such close proximity to an enormous hinterland rich in jungle produce, there is less evidence of cash wealth on such a scale at so early a period. But with the advent of cultivated rubber, the Saribas Ibans in particular caught up with and passed their migrated brethren in the Rejang. In the boom years during and following World War I, they too began to invest in Chinese shops, until nearly half the shops in Betong Bazaar, and more than half of those in some smaller outstations such as Spaoh on the Paku, were Iban owned. This trend, which was always restricted to the Saribas, has not continued since World War II, but in 1966 more than twenty of the sixty-six shophouses in Betong were still wholly or partially owned by Ibans.' <sup id="cite_ref-119" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-119">[119]</a></sup></dd>

Sometimes even more elaborate rites are staged. The most important of these is the gawai engkune  , in which all bilek-families   join. It is commonly held a few weeks after first occupation of the new house. A temporary shrine ( ranyai  ), containing offerings, omen-sticks, charms and pieces of wood termed engkune, is erected on the tuai of the tuai burong. For one whole night, a party of four men skilled in the task, encircle the spot, chanting an invocation ( timang  ) to the gods. In magical and poetic words, they describe the arrival of the gods, who, at the behest of the Iban, build for them a wonderful new house. Especially prominent is Apai Nendak (the father of the omen bird, Nendak), who brings most of the materials for this house built by the gods, and furnishes it with charms potent against all manner of evils. The gods, it is believed, enter the shrine charging the objects stored there with supernaturai power, and to conclude the ritual, the shrine is dismantled, and its contents shared out by the tuai-families   of the long-house.

Of this gallery each family possesses its own section, and although the whole of the ruai   is ordinarily open to all members of the long-house, each family retains the prescriptive right to cordon off its own part whenever, for ritual reasons, the need arises. Here and there, in about the centre of the ruai, in smoke-blackened clusters, hang the trophy heads or antu pala, with which so many of the most cherished values and beliefs of the Iban are associated.

Here I am relying mainly on Iban testimony, but in a number of instances I was able to calculate the capacity of the bins which had been filled in previous years, and so obtain rough estimates. The Iban themselves measure padi by the basketful. An average basket ( baka ) holds about one pasu, or bushel. About 20 pasu make one dunjong. (The term dunjong refers to a heap of padi left on the tanju after winnowing; it is only a rough measure and undoubtedly varies a good deal; but I estimate 20 pasu to be fairly typical). Four dunjong make one lumpong --a measure containing approximately 80 bushels. The Iban expression for the obtaining of an exceptionally good crop is “ bulih padi ” (literally, “got padi ”); it is used to describe a heavy yield, and always carries the implication of a substantial surplus.

<dd><b> ♠ Weight ♣ present ♥ </b> 'In the best years on the other hand, remarkably heavy crops are sometimes produced. Here I am relying mainly on Iban testimony, but in a number of instances I was able to calculate the capacity of the bins which had been filled in previous years, and so obtain rough estimates. The Iban themselves measure padi by the basketful. An average basket ( baka ) holds about one pasu, or bushel. About 20 pasu make one dunjong. (The term dunjong refers to a heap of padi left on the tanju after winnowing; it is only a rough measure and undoubtedly varies a good deal; but I estimate 20 pasu to be fairly typical). Four dunjong make one lumpong --a measure containing approximately 80 bushels.

Secondary growth fails to establish itself in the face of weeds and brackens: after a five year fallow trees grew less than a foot in diameter. As cultivation is done on steep terrain, there is a lot of padi wastage during sowing. According to one informer, it usually takes five to four pasu (Iban dry grain measurement equivalent to one bushel) for an average thirty to forty acres of family plot. A good harvest will yield about sixty pikuls (about 3.5 tons, as a pikul is equivalent to 133 1/3 lbs), from that amount of seed (that is four to five bushels), while a bad harvest would return about twenty pikuls.' <sup id="cite_ref-137" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-137">[137]</a></sup> Some of the measurements provided are of Malaysian origin.

After this trade had reached some bulk in the 1870's and until the introduction of cultivated rubber it provided around thirty per cent of the state's total exports. Rubber, which started to be grown in considerable quantities in the first decade of this century, became the most important of the small-holder cash-crops for the indigenous peoples. To begin with it was planted by many Iban communities in both the Second and the Third Division, but around the middle or late 1920's non-Christian communities began cutting down their rubber trees.

These gongs have the great advantage of being untouched by the Borneo climate and are virtually indestructible; further they have marked prestige value, and can be displayed and used on ceremonial occasions. In good  years, when a surplus of padi   has been gained, it is exchanged for gongs, which are then available in years of shortage. Each season, some families succeed in producing a surplus, while others find themselves with a deficit; and so, year by year in an area like the Baleh, scores of different families exchange gongs for padi,   or padi   for gongs. Jars ( tajau  ), though to a much lesser extent, are used in the same way.

In September, 1950 (one year after the period we have just been discussing), Chinese traders were travelling all the rivers of the Baleh region in search of Iban rubber, and the price offered at Rumah Nyala was $1.50 per kati. Accepting an average daily output per worker of 5 katis, in September, 1950, the production of rubber had become a pursuit at least three times more profitable than the production of padi.   Hulled rice ( brau  ) had risen in price to about $2 per gantang. Under these conditions it is difficult to understand, if one is thinking purely in terms of immediate profit and loss, why farming was not abandoned in favour of full-time rubber production. In the Saribas District of the Second Division,  indeed, there was a marked tendency in this direction. At Gansurai, a Dayak long-house on the banks of the Layar River, for example, 6 of the 19 bilek   families did not grow any padi   during the 1950-51 season, and were relying entirely on imported rice which they were able to purchase with money obtained from the sale of rubber. This was no great difficulty. One of the bilek   families of Gansurai, employed 11 Malays on a share-cropping basis, and in April, 1951, with rubber at $1.15 per kati, the monthly income of this family was about $1,400.' <sup id="cite_ref-165" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-165">[165]</a></sup></dd>

After this trade had reached some bulk in the 1870's and until the introduction of cultivated rubber it provided around thirty per cent of the state's total exports. Rubber, which started to be grown in considerable quantities in the first decade of this century, became the most important of the small-holder cash-crops for the indigenous peoples. To begin with it was planted by many Iban communities in both the Second and the Third Division, but around the middle or late 1920's non-Christian communities began cutting down their rubber trees. […] Prior to rubber, another cash-crop, coffee, had been grown with some success in the Second Division, notably amongst the Saribas Iban. The overproduction that completely upset the world market in 1897 and the drastic fall in prices, however, put an abrupt end to this endeavour.’ <sup id="cite_ref-166" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-166">[166]</a></sup> 'With the rubber boom of 1950 this balance was completely disturbed. In September, 1950 (one year after the period we have just been discussing), Chinese traders were travelling all the rivers of the Baleh region in search of Iban rubber, and the price offered at Rumah Nyala was $1.50 per kati. Accepting an average daily output per worker of 5 katis, in September, 1950, the production of rubber had become a pursuit at least three times more profitable than the production of padi.   Hulled rice ( brau  ) had risen in price to about $2 per gantang. Under these conditions it is difficult to understand, if one is thinking purely in terms of immediate profit and loss, why farming was not abandoned in favour of full-time rubber production. In the Saribas District of the Second Division,  indeed, there was a marked tendency in this direction. At Gansurai, a Dayak long-house on the banks of the Layar River, for example, 6 of the 19 bilek   families did not grow any padi   during the 1950-51 season, and were relying entirely on imported rice which they were able to purchase with money obtained from the sale of rubber. This was no great difficulty. One of the bilek   families of Gansurai, employed 11 Malays on a share-cropping basis, and in April, 1951, with rubber at $1.15 per kati, the monthly income of this family was about $1,400.' <sup id="cite_ref-167" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-167">[167]</a></sup></dd>

The up-country Dyaks procure what they need by a system of barter, and in most of the shopping done in the Chinese bazaars near the Dyak villages no money passes hands at all. Silver coins are used by the Dyaks for making belts and bangles, and are often attached to the edge of the petticoats worn by the women at feasts and on other special occasions, and are  esteemed only as ornaments.

<dl><dd><b> ♠ Couriers ♣ absent ♥ </b> 'In ancient times, when a warleader wanted to lead his people in war, he usually sent an urgent temuku tali   (“string with knots”) to call together his  warriors. Attached to each string was a chicken's feather and small piece of half-burnt wood. The meaning of these articles was that the message carried by the string must be transmitted in a great hurry and quickly relayed from one longhouse to another day and night, till it reached its final destination. Feathers are said to symbolize the swiftness of flight and the half-burnt wood, the torches to be used at night in carrying the message from one longhouse to another. The message itself was transmitted verbally. Each knot in the string signified one day and had to be untied each morning by the recipients. On the day when the last knot was untied, all the warriors who had armed themselves would arrive at the warleader's longhouse to join the war expedition.' <sup id="cite_ref-173" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-173">[173]</a></sup> These messages were not transmitted by professional couriers, but by regular community members. 'The other method used by ancient warleaders to summon their warriors was to send their most trusted warrior from one longhouse to another, with a sharp spear ( sangkoh  ) heavily decorated with the hair of enemies. On arrival at each fighting man's longhouse, the bearer of the spear informed his comrades-in-arms that they were requested to join the warpath on a certain day. On receiving this message, each warrior started to arm himself with weapons such as nyabor, langgai tingang, surong bila, ilang   and pedang   swords; terabai   (shield), sumpit   (blowpipe), sangkoh, bujak, perambut   and berayang   spears. A day or two before the war party was due to set out, all the fighters assembled at the warleader's longhouse, sufficiently provisioned by their wives with rice and cakes.

The risk of attack would have made it quite foolhardy to have an extensive dampasystem during the last century, especially in areas where “pacification” had not yet been undertaken. A dampa , having a much smaller number of people, would then be very vulnerable and it is possible that the furthest outlying farms were much closer to the main longhouse than is the case today, so that when the alarm was sounded to warn that an imminent attack might occur, there would have been a better chance for the people to reach the main longhouse, which could be more successfully defended. Stockades and other means of defence were probably also used by many more than the famous anti-government leader Rentap when he made his stand on the summit of Sadok Mountain.’ <sup id="cite_ref-212" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-212">[212]</a></sup></dd>

<p><b> ♠ Standing armies ♣ absent ♥ </b> In conflict, Iban communities sent out raiding parties rather than organized armies: ‘In Benedict Sandin's ethnohistorical account of how his people migrated from the Kapuas area northwards, we encounter head-hunting and fighting, but not in the massive manner that came to characterize these groups at a later stage. The conflicts that these migrations caused with other groups were not always solved through the use of violence, we also find examples of alliance or absorption as mechanisms to aid settling in new areas. It would seem logical to assume that other inland and up-river Iban groups even after the establishment of the raj, continued in this manner and that warfare here was carried on largely by small raiding parties. This also seems more consistent with the size of these up-river settlements, which do not appear to have been any larger then than they are today. This question of settlement size might also have a bearing on the occurrence and success of head-hunting expeditions, as large settlements could supply more warriors who could be more successful because of their number, while they also gave the home community a higher defence potential. In the middle of the nineteenth century larger settlements seem to have existed only in the lower reaches of the rivers and one might suspect that this was due to both food production potential and trade.

A man would bring this spear to a long Dyak house, deliver his message, and return, leaving the spear to be carried on by one of the men in that house to the next village, and so on. At once the men in the house would get their war-boats ready. They would begin making figure-heads for the bows of their boats, and paint the side planks in various patterns. They would furbish up their arms, and sharpen their weapons, and decorate their helmets and war-jackets. The Dyaks generally wear their best when going out to fight. I asked a Dyak once why this was done, because, as I pointed out to him, most of the finery they put on inter-fered with the free action of their limbs.

Successful more often than not, these punitive expeditions came to be a major tool of Brooke policy. A large number of the Iban thus pacified remained in the area and elected to serve in Brooke's irregular armies in the future.

<p><b>♠ Inter-polity wars ♣ present ♥</b>   Note: This section is in need of a 'cap' indicating when warfahre and infighting ended, assuming that neither continued up until 1987.Following the murder of Steele and Fox, in June, 1859, the Iban of the Katibas joined forces with the Tuan Muda in his puntitive expedition against the Kanowits (and others involved), in the nearby Kabah river. This event aggravated the existing enmity between the Iban and the peoples of the uppei Rejang (the Kajangs, and the Kayans), and led to retaliatory raids. In December, 1861, when travelling the lower reaches of the Katibas, the Tuan Muda passed the blackened posts of an Iban house which had been burnt during a recent ‘treacherous attack’ of the Kayans. The Katibas Iban gained their revenge, and most drastically, during the great expedition of 1863, as members of a force of about 12,000 men (from all parts of the country), which led by the Tuan Muda, ascended the upper Rejang, and launched a crushing attack on its inhabitants... At Kanowit, in October, 1863, a formal peace was made with the Kayans and other tribes of the interior.<sup id="cite_ref-224" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-224">[224]</a></sup> Illegal headhunting continued in many Iban areas up until the 1920s and 1930s. There was also a brief resurgence at the end of the Second World War, when heads were taken in mopping up operations against the Japanese.  Again, one or two isolated occurrences were reported during the period of confrontation with Indonesia (1963-1966).<sup id="cite_ref-225" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-225">[225]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Internal wars ♣ present ♥</b> In February of 1857, the Tuan Muda and his Iban irregulars were, for the first time, instrumental in saving Sarawak. In that month the Hakka Chinese gold miners of the Sarawak River destroyed Kuching, nearly killed James Brooke, and further weakened his already far from vigorous Government. From the beginning of his rule, the Rajah had welcomed the Chinese to Sarawak, realizing that a Chinese population was the surest key to economic self-sufficiency.  But although his relations with Hokkians and others who settled as merchants in Kuching remained cordial, the Hakka gold miners, concentrated around Bau on the upper Sarawak River, were always a problem. They maintained close ties with their numerous and well organized brethren across the border in Sambas, even after the Sambas Chinese had been heavily defeated by the Dutch in the “Kongsi Wars” of 1853-54, and they were most reluctant to accept any  directive from the new English ruler in Kuching. Not surprisingly, there was continual friction between the Bau Chinese and James Brooke.<sup id="cite_ref-226" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-226">[226]</a></sup> In the following year, 1854, the Rajah authorized two punitive expeditions against the hostile Ibans in the watershed area between the Skrang and Saribas Rivers. The first, directed against the house of Apai Dendang,  was a total fiasco. The enemy learned of the expedition's approach, and the officer in charge, probably Brereton, failed to control the native force of Sarawak Malays and Balau Ibans. They consequently dashed rashly to the attack, suffered needless casualties and achieved nothing. In August of the same year, Brooke led another expedition against Rentap, who was living on Sungai Lang, a Skrang tributary in the same general area. Rentap's stockaded longhouse was captured and the enemy leader was wounded, but he succeeded in retreating into the interior, to an even stronger and much more inaccessible location on the summit of Sadok Mountain... The conviction was growing in [Brooke's] mind that only Ibans could be used to fight Ibans; “only Dayaks can kill Dayaks,”<sup id="cite_ref-227" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-227">[227]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Intra-elite conflicts ♣ present ♥</b> 'Recurring hostility between the Brookes and the highest ranking Malays, who were “Arabs” and Brunei pengiran  , grew out of rivalry, and the rivalry was in no small measure a contest  for influence over the Iban population, as the history of the Malay Plot demonstrates. The Ibans were of central political importance because they loved to fight simply for the sake of fighting. The success of Charles Brooke with Iban levies from the lower Skrang and Saribas has already been described, but it is obvious that at this stage in Sarawak history, calling out the Ibans was still a game that more than one could play. At the time of the Chinese revolt in 1857, Charles had summoned his Skrang followers to the aid of besieged Kuching by sending a spear among them.  Three years later the Brookes indignantly accused Sharif Masahor of using exactly the same tactic in the same area to call out hostile Ibans to fight the Rajah after the siege of Mukah.  Well into the twentieth century, as we shall see, the dispatch of a “calling out spear” remained the standard official method of summoning Ibans for unpaid military service.' <sup id="cite_ref-228" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-228">[228]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Popular uprisings ♣ present ♥</b> 'Walter Watson, the Brooke officer at Saribas, returned to his post after participating in the Mukah campaign to find his district in an even greater state of turmoil than usual. He discovered that Masahor had sent a war spear among the people, the traditional means of summoning Ibans to battle.  Rumors were circulating that Charles Brooke himself had been killed at Mukah, but the Tuan Muda soon quashed these reports by arriving at Saribas in person. Many among the divided population were still loyal to the Brookes, and with the additional help of the always reliable Balau Ibans of Banting, he was able to launch two expeditions against Nanang's fortified position at Nanga Spak on the main Layar branch of the Saribas. Nanang was defeated, and he and his party retreated to join Rentap, who was still in his lair on Mount Sadok.  Before they left, they threw the cannons which Sharif Masahor had given them into the river at Nanga Spak, where to this day they sometimes unpredictably foul the lines of fishermen, in the accustomed manner of very old cannon possessing magical powers.' <sup id="cite_ref-229" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-229">[229]</a></sup> 'The Great Depression of 1929 and the early 1930s affected the people of Sarawak, including the Iban, just as it did the people of Europe and America. Some Iban, who had planted cash crops, especially rubber, could not understand the decline in market prices, and felt aggrieved towards the Rajah's government. In the 1930s, several Iban refused to pay taxes to the government, among them Asun and Kendawang (see Chapter 3). They were branded rebels because of their open defiance of the Rajah's authority. The episode of Penghulu Asun is well documented, and involved some of Koh's followers who joined government forces in a punitive expedition. The story of Kendawang is less well known, and involved Jugah in the eventual surrender of Kendawang and his half-brother, Banyang. Throughout the decade, Koh and Jugah, remained loyal to the Rajah and to their positions as Temenggong and Penghulu respectively.' <sup id="cite_ref-230" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-230">[230]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Military revolts ♣ absent ♥</b> (NB: Whilst the majority of rebellions were led by military leaders of different Iban tribes (e.g. Bantin), the fluid nature of the military association between the Brooke Rajahs and different Iban tribes makes it unclear as to whether it is appropriate to characterise these rebellions as "military revolts" as such. c.f. Wagner: "In the 1850's and 1860's and perhaps even later the down-river Iban apparently regarded themselves as allies and not as subordinates of the state."<sup id="cite_ref-231" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-231">[231]</a></sup> "Due to the expansionist policies of the Brooke rajahs, and the variety of tactical manoeuvres manifested by different Iban groups in opposition, it is clear that there was never any hard and fast dividing line between the allies and the rebels. From the reports in the third chapter we saw that the enemy of today  was frequently the staunch supporter of to-morrow, yet any future disinclination to toe the government line would again class you as an enemy of law and order. It is clear that geographical - or toporgraphical - distance was an important factor in deciding which side you joined and this was also the major reason allowing the up-river areas to continue in opposition to the government."<sup id="cite_ref-232" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-232">[232]</a></sup>  No documented instances of military revolts within the military immediately associated with the Brooke Rajahs were found.)
</p><p><b>♠ Separatist rebellions ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> (NB: Whilst rebellions against the Brooke Raj were a frequent occurrence amongst different many Iban tribes, particularly those further from the capital, these do not appear to have been motivated by specifically "separatist" intentions as such, rather, predominantly by various tribal concerns or as a reaction against unpopular policies or taxes imposed by the Raj government. See Wagner sources immediately above.)

For example, Brooke recruited as allies Balau, traditional enemies of Iban of the Skrang and Saribas, and in 1844, they were led by the Honourable Henry Keppel in an attack on the Skrang Iban.<sup id="cite_ref-233" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-233">[233]</a></sup> Generally speaking, however, one would expect the larger expeditions to have a more devastating effect and this we find in another large undertaking aimed at “rebels” on and around the Kadang Ridge on the border to the then Dutch Borneo. The reason for the attack was that the Ulu Ai   Iban (up-river Iban) had been raiding the Lamanak, the Skrang and the Kapuas for about 20  years and these depredations could no longer be tolerated.  The expedition started out in the beginning of March in 1886, with the rajah, the Resident of the Rejang, and a force of 10,000 - 12,000 Iban warriors. During the three weeks that the campaign lasted, they were indeed successful.<sup id="cite_ref-234" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-234">[234]</a></sup>

By associating the Sarawak Government with an Iban force of great size in such a way, he gave unwitting encouragement to Iban raiding against the ethnically distinct, far less numerous peoples of the upper Rejang. This was probably apparent within a few years to Charles Brooke himself. The Katibas Ibans, whose complaints about Kayan misbehavior had spurred him to undertake the expedition, and who participated eagerly in it, did not remain his allies for long. Willing enough to take heads at Government command, they were unwilling to stop when requested to do so.

In that month the Hakka Chinese gold miners of the Sarawak River destroyed Kuching, nearly killed James Brooke, and further weakened his already far from vigorous Government. From the beginning of his rule, the Rajah had welcomed the Chinese to Sarawak, realizing that a Chinese population was the surest key to economic self-sufficiency.  But although his relations with Hokkians and others who settled as merchants in Kuching remained cordial, the Hakka gold miners, concentrated around Bau on the upper Sarawak River, were always a problem. They maintained close ties with their numerous and well organized brethren across the border in Sambas, even after the Sambas Chinese had been heavily defeated by the Dutch in the “Kongsi Wars” of 1853-54, and they were most reluctant to accept any  directive from the new English ruler in Kuching. Not surprisingly, there was continual friction between the Bau Chinese and James Brooke.<sup id="cite_ref-240" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-240">[240]</a></sup> Illegal headhunting continued in many Iban areas up until the 1920s and 1930s. There was also a brief resurgence at the end of the Second World War, when heads were taken in mopping up operations against the Japanese.  Again, one or two isolated occurrences were reported during the period of confrontation with Indonesia (1963-1966).<sup id="cite_ref-241" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-241">[241]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Annexation ♣ present ♥</b> The Sarawak Government's need for a trustworthy source of fighting power in its new northeastern provinces was sharpened by worsening relations with Brunei following the seizure of Limbang in March, 1890. The Sultan remained bitterly opposed to the loss of what had been his most important remaining river, and the Rajah of Sarawak believed that some of the Limbang chiefs were in league with him. In May of 1895, more than four years after Limbang was annexed by Sarawak, Charles found it necessary to send an expedition made up largely of Iban levies to attack a Limbang chief, Orang Kaya Temenggong Lawai, who was suspected of pro-Brunei sentiment. <sup id="cite_ref-245" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-245">[245]</a></sup> Note: This section is in need of a 'cap' indicating when warfahre and infighting ended, assuming that neither continued up until 1987.
</p><p><b>♠ Looting ♣ present ♥</b>  The looting of valuables and padi stores that must also have formed part of the traditional economic motivation, continued in the punitive expeditions. Valuables like jars and metal implements were confiscated by the government, which retained one half and used the other to remunerate the Malay contingents of the expeditions. It would seem likely however, that a certain amount of plunder was retained by the Iban,  since their large numbers would make control by the few government commanding officers very difficult.<sup id="cite_ref-246" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-246">[246]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Sack ♣ present ♥</b> Paku on the Saribas, burnt, plundered and destroyed; Kanowit on the Rejang (Skrang Iban), 18 villages destroyed (population estimated at 1,350 [unknown] 450) and the country laid waste for a hundred miles... 16 houses destroyed (averaging something over 16 bilek in each according to the Sarawak Gazette of Nov. 14, 1876) with an estimated population of about 1,500 people. All valuables and necessities seized or burnt. <sup id="cite_ref-247" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-247">[247]</a></sup> The Katibas Iban gained their revenge, and most drastically, during the great expedition of 1863, as members of a force of about 12,000 men (from all parts of the country), which led by the Tuan Muda, ascended the upper Rejang, and launched a crushing attack on its inhabitants... The Iban vanguard penetrated well beyond the Bakun Rapids of the Balui, taking heads and captives, burning and pillaging.<sup id="cite_ref-248" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-248">[248]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Rape ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b>  <i>No data yet found in the literature.</i>
</p><p><b>♠ Deportation ♣ present ♥</b> In 1904, the Govern-ment was again obliged to attack a group of Iban (men, women and children), who, in defiance of the Rajah's orders, had retreated to Bukit Batu--the mountain fastness at the head of the Mujong river. The attack (directed by Charles Hose, then Resident, Third Division) was successful, and the rebels were compelled to return to the Sut, and to other down river areas.<sup id="cite_ref-249" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-249">[249]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Expulsion ♣ present ♥</b> In the years after 1902, Bantin's rebellion centering in the upper Batang Lupar stimulated a spirit of restlessness among the related Ibans of the upper Rejang. As usual, defiance of Government took the form of increasingly overt migration, combined with headhunting. Late in 1902 a leader named Ayum moved with his people to Bukit Batu, where the rebels of 1880 had made their stand, but after a good deal of negotiation he was persuaded to leave the area, and the affair terminated just short of revolt.  In 1904 another group of dissidents under Janting congregated around Bukit Batu, which by now had become a symbol of resistance to the Government.  The Resident, Charles Hose, led a force of Ibans and Kayans against them in July, 1904, and they were compelled to move downstream.<sup id="cite_ref-250" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-250">[250]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Enslavement ♣ present ♥</b> 'The Iban trace their origins to the Kapuas Lake region of Kalimantan. With a growing population creating pressures on limited amounts of productive land, the Iban fought members of other tribes aggressively, practicing headhunting and slavery. Enslavement of captives contributed to the necessity to move into new areas. By the middle of the 19th century, they were well established in the First and Second Divisions, and a few had pioneered the vast Rejang River valley.' <sup id="cite_ref-251" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-251">[251]</a></sup> 'The right to own slaves ( ulun  ) and serfs ( jaum   or pengurang  ) was enjoyed by Iban leaders and warriors since time immemorial.  Ulun   are captives in war, whereas jaum   are debt-servants who were unable to pay their debts due to poverty. The descendants of both ulun   and jaum   remain the property of their owners until they can free themselves by paying their debt or by holding a festival called a gawai betembang  , in which they are freed with the mutual consent of their masters.' <sup id="cite_ref-252" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-252">[252]</a></sup> 'From the days of early Brooke rule, the government of Sarawak opposed slavery. In 1880 the second Rajah proclaimed that all slaves must be freed by their owners formally in the Gawai Betembang ceremony. By this decree, any slave who was able to redeem himself, was allowed to do so by compensating his owner with cash or with valuable jars and brass wares. Those who could not pay the compensation were allowed to free themselves by the Gawai Betembang ceremony. The last of these ceremonies took place during the 1890's after which time slavery was officially abolished. Today it is a fineable offence to refer publicly to another person's slave ancestry.' <sup id="cite_ref-253" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-253">[253]</a></sup> ‘Whether it was due to Malay inspiration or not, head-taking amongst the Saribas and Skrang Iban reached very high proportions, and Morgan has regarded this as a kind of inflationary spiral generated by the high prestige that accrued to success in warlike expeditions. On the other hand, it is evident that a division of plunder, that only gave the heads to the Iban and the rest of the booty to the Malay - as is maintained by some of the earlier writers - is somewhat simplistic, as the Iban also had an interest in arms and other prestige items. The older sources mention, however, that the Iban also took slaves on these raiding expeditions and that the captives were usually women and children. These captives were probably absorbed into the households of their captors where they provided additional labour. With an agricultural system of a type where the size of the area farmed depends very much on the labour available to carry out the arduous but very necessary weeding, it can be argued that the capture of additional women and children to help with the production of the basic staple - padi - will allow an inflation in masculine activities such as warfare and head-hunting since it allows the men to retract from the agricultural sphere.’ <sup id="cite_ref-254" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-254">[254]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Imprisonment ♣ absent ♥</b> We have decided to class the taking of captives as a form of enslavement rather than imprisonment: "The Katibas Iban gained their revenge, and most drastically, during the great expedition of 1863, as members of a force of about 12,000 men (from all parts of the country), which led by the Tuan Muda, ascended the upper Rejang, and launched a crushing attack on its inhabitants...

</p><p><b>♠ Mutilation ♣ present ♥</b> 'Until the middle of this century, headhunting, as a cultural institution, was practiced widely by numerous tribal societies in Southeast Asia. From the upland regions of Taiwan, as far west as Assam, and extending southwards to Sulawesi and the outer islands of the Indonesian archipelago, the purposeful taking of heads was a dominant feature amongst peoples such as the Bunun, Kalinga, Naga, Ifugao, Iban and Toraja. Above all, headhunting was identified with the island of Borneo' <sup id="cite_ref-257" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-257">[257]</a></sup> 'But headhunting was more than simply an institutionalized channel for native aggression and bloodlust.

Great war leaders went by the title of tau serang (lit. “those who know how to make war”), and such men were accorded the highest status and honor among their fellows. In this respect, headhunting provided the means for male social mobility and ascendancy in what was an essentially egalitarian society (see below).' <sup id="cite_ref-259" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-259">[259]</a></sup> 'The cessation of the Iban custom of ngayau , or headhunting, although admittedly not complete until the 20th century, resulted in an “increase in the size of the community and a disturbance of the balance between population and the land (Lee, 1970, pg. 121).”' <sup id="cite_ref-260" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-260">[260]</a></sup>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ The rites of manggol ♥</b> 'The rites of manggol, which inaugurate the actual clearing of farm-land. No family, however, begins until it feels that it has the good will or blessing of the spirits--the state called lantang--and spirit approval is normally conveyed in a dream. Once assured that the spirits have approved the undertaking, and, in practice, this normally occurs at the distribution of kayu burong or a day later, the Iban go in family units to their farms to perform the manggol rites. On the way their ears are stopped (besedal pending) to avoid hearing other undesirable bird-calls. They take with them their kayu burongand all that is required for sacrifices and offerings. All bilekmembers participate, even children who cannot contribute actively, since it is thought that the fortune of one is the fortune of all. Both manggoland the rites which initiate harvest are matters for the bilekand must be attended by the man and his wife as well as their children if possible and other bilekmembers. On arriving at the farm site (pangkalan) the Iban selects a suitable tree. It must be latex- or sap-producing (kayu begetah), ideally pudu, or alternatively tekalong, lengkan, or the fruiting arak. With his left hand he scrapes away the weeds and undergrowth from a patch of ground close to the base of the chosen tree. He does this two or three times. Afterwards, in the same way, he does it with his right hand. Although in theory any member of the bilekfamily can do this, it is most commonly performed by the tuai bilek, who then places the kayu burongon the cleared patch and says a prayer. The left-side omen-sticks (Nendak kiba, etc.) are placed in position at the foot of the chosen tree, which is considered especially suitable if it has buttresses (bandir). The right-hand omen-sticks (Nendak kanan) are fixed into the tree where a cut is made (silit kayu) at the height of rice grain when ripe (tuntun buah padi). At felling, this tree is left standing. After making a first symbolic slash, called mantap pangkalan, with his bush-knife (duku), the Iban places his ritual whetstones close to the ground. The whetstones themselves are carefully screened and sheltered (dipantar). Were they to be damaged, this would be a sign of serious misfortune, and in no case may they be disturbed by another Iban. After a piring sacrifice, which comprises the usual ingredients but must be topped by an egg, the Iban performs a biau ceremony. As he waves a fowl, which, in this instance, is specifically required to be female (manok indu), he calls on the spirits. After this he kills the hen and arranges the sacrifice in either two or three piring. One he places at ground level by the foot of the tree where the kayu burongare, a second one by the whetstones (apa batu), and for this he constructs a little shelter (langkau); the third one is set on a raised support (tresang dipanggau) at a height of five to six feet. If there are only two piring, one is placed at ground level and the other on a raised support. Wherever the piring, it is carefully fenced to forestall an ill omen: a snake, for example, passing over it (mansa ular) would imply poor yields for at least three years.' <sup id="cite_ref-261" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-261">[261]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-262" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-262">[262]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Piring ♥</b> Piring. Food Offerings that accompany almost every Iban ritual. 'The piring is an offering composed of rice cooked in bamboos, cakes, eggs, sweet potatoes, plantains, or other fruit, and sometimes small live chickens. If the offering be made in the house these things are put on a brass dish (tabak ). If the occasion of the sacrifice requires that it be offered elsewhere, a little platform is constructed, consisting of pieces of wood tied together with cane, and fixed on four sticks stuck in the ground. This is the para piring (the altar of sacrifice), and the offering is laid on it. It is covered with a rough roof of palm-leaf, and looks like a miniature native house, and is decorated with white flags. It is the most flimsy thing imaginable, and soon tumbles to pieces. The god or spirit is supposed to come and eat the good things provided, and go away contented. It is no use arguing with the Dyak that he can see for himself that his offering is eaten up by fowls, or pigs, or boys, who are full of mischief, and have no fear of spirits. The Dyak says the spirits eat the soul or spirit of the food; what is left on the altar is only its outer husk, not its true essence.' <sup id="cite_ref-302" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-302">[302]</a></sup></dd>

The opening ceremony is miring ka tangga , (the offering to the ladder). As soon as the new ladder is placed in position, Pulang Gana and other gods are propitiated by an offering, which is hung underneath the ladder, and the sacrifice of a pig. An old man then recites. The second ceremony is mangkong tiang. The same old man enters the room of the chief of the house first to perform the rite. Another offering is prepared in the room, and is placed on the shelf of the kitchen for Pulang Gana, the god of the earth. The chanter must repeat the ceremony in every room, and if the house be a long one, a great part of the day will have slipped by ere the drowsy old man, now an object of mirth and laughter, has finished his task. In the ruai or reception room of the house the professional reciters are deeply engaged with their incantation called pengap to look for igi engkuni. It is a long recitation (and is done at the top of their voices) to implore the father of Nendak to descend from above or the father of Nendak. The incantation begins from four in the afternoon and goes on till daylight the next day. The feast lasts a day and a night and the house or village is generally quite full. The confusion and the noise are great. At the approach of day light much stir is made, when Apai Nendak, Pulang Gana, and the rest of the gods are supposed to arrive at the feast. Offerings are made to them and the musical instruments are struck louder and with more vigor. There is shouting and laughter, the crowing of cocks and dogs fighting.' <sup id="cite_ref-382" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-382">[382]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Funerary ritual ♥</b> 'When a person dies a professional wailer is engaged either immediately or two or three days after the death occurs. This is called the rite of nyabak nerengka, which means lamenting the deceased in order that he may travel direct to Hades. It appears that, with the Dyaks, unless the ceremony of nyabak nerengka is performed the soul of the dead wanders about in the unseen world and will never reach Hades. The professional wailer is generally a gifted person, skilled in poetry, and is supposed to possess an intimate knowledge of all that befalls the dead on their journey to Hades through the unseen regions. He avers that the soul has to pass seven places of the utmost importance before it reaches it's destination. Therefore unless the sabak nerengka is properly performed the soul will never reach Hades and will encounter the greatest danger. He avers also that while giving the should assistance he is himself treading on dangerous soil, and therefore demands a large fee for steering the soul of the departed into it's haven of everlasting bliss. The proceeding in nyabak nerengka is considered to be a complete sacrifice to the powers reigning in Hades. The wailer sits on a swing in the room of the deceased, and her opening words are couched in the choicest poetry which charms and fascinates her hearers who delight in such fictions. She commences by severely blaming all the materials of the building for not holding back the soul of the deceased. This undoubtedly points to the fact that the Dyaks regard such inanimate objects as gods. She then traces the journey of the soul in it's six perilous positions. Firstly, towards the country of the Tigers; secondly, towards the Kayu malam; thirdly, towards the abode of the bird Dundun;fourthly, towards the haunt of the bird Undan; fifthly, towards the country of the Great Wind; and sixthly, towards Hades, and when it arrives it throws itself down as one who has endured great fatigue. As the soul is in that unconscious state through the fatigue of it's incessant journey Dara Rambai Geruda Salabong Kanggam brings it refreshment and through her magic revives it, and enables it to partake of it with a good appetite.' <sup id="cite_ref-425" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-425">[425]</a></sup></dd>

</p><p>Note: The 'native' social system was not bureaucratic. Iban social organization was based on autonomous residential communities and kin groups: 'Each longhouse, as each BILEK, is an autonomous unit. Traditionally the core of each house was a group of descendants of the founders. Houses near one another on the same river or in the same region were commonly allied, marrying among themselves, raiding together beyond their territories, and resolving disputes by peaceful means. Regionalism, deriving from these alliances, in which Iban distinguished themselves from other allied groups, persist in modern state politics. Essentially egalitarian, Iban are aware of long-standing status distinctions among themselves of RAJA BERANI (wealthy and brave), MENSI SARIBU (commoners), and ULUN (slaves). Prestige still accrues to descendants of the first status, disdain to descendants of the third.' <sup id="cite_ref-464" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-464">[464]</a></sup> 'The economic self-sufficiency of the bilik  -family is reflected in other areas of Iban social life. Unlike the Kayan, Kenyah, pagan Melanau and several other Bornean peoples, the Iban are not divided into social classes.  Nor is there any  form of institutionalized leadership based upon hereditary succession, or some other socially divisive principle. Instead Iban society is characterized by a strongly egalitarian ethos. In this respect, each bilik  -family jurally constitutes a discrete and autonomous social unit, which manages its own affairs and recognizes no higher authority than that of its own household head.' <sup id="cite_ref-465" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-465">[465]</a></sup> Longhouse communities were headed by informal leaders doubling as village functionaries: 'In every Iban long-house there are two offices of great importance--one secular and the other ritual. They are the positions of tuai rumah   and tuai burong  . In most long-houses they are held by different individuals, but it is perfectly permissible for one man to hold both offices, and in some communities this does happen. Neither position is ever held by a woman. (c.f. Footnote No. 22). When used as an adjective, the word tuai   means old, or mature, but as a noun it refers to any senior and influential member of a community. Here, the emphasis is not primarily on age, but on the personal qualities of the individual concerned. Thus, a party of young men setting off on an expedition ( bejalai  ), to gather jungle produce, always has its leader, or tuai  , though he may be no more than in his early twenties. And in long-house communities, able, though only middle-aged men often come to exert very considerable authority and influence. In all contemporary long-houses however, there is one man who holds the title of tuai rumah  , or house headman.' <sup id="cite_ref-466" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-466">[466]</a></sup> Accordingly, social control was informal: 'Iban employ three strategies of social control. First, from childhood, they are taught to avoid conflict, and for a majority, every effort is made to prevent it. Second, they are taught by story and drama of the existence of numerous spirits, who vigilantly ensure observation of numerous taboos; some spirits are interested in preserving the peace, while others are responsible for any strife that arises. In these ways, the stresses and conflicts of ordinary life, especially life in the longhouse, in which one is in more or less constant sight and sound of others, have been displaced onto the spirits. Third, the headman hears disputes between members of the same house, the regional chief, disputes between members of different houses, and government officers, hear those disputes that headmen and regional chiefs cannot resolve.' <sup id="cite_ref-467" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-467">[467]</a></sup> Only in the colonial period did rulers superimpose an administrative system of regional chiefs onto the village-based social structure of autonomous longhouse communities: 'Prior to the arrival of the British adventurer, James Brooke, there were no permanent leaders, but the affairs of each house were directed by consultations of family leaders. Men of influence included renowned warriors, bards, augurs and other specialists. Brooke, who became Rajah of Sarawak, and his nephew, Charles Johnson, created political positions -- headman (TUAI RUMAH), regional chief (PENGHULU), paramount chief (TEMENGGONG) -- to restructure Iban society for administrative control, especially for purposes of taxation and the suppression of head-hunting. The creation of permanent political positions and the establishment of political parties in the early 1960s have profoundly changed the Iban.' <sup id="cite_ref-468" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-468">[468]</a></sup> The White Rajahs established this administrative structure: 'Throughout the twenties, the following administrative innovations were introduced: the establishment of a formal Secretariat under the chief secretary in Kuching in 1923; the creation of a legal department in 1928, and between 1924 and 1926, municipal administration was established in Kuching and Sibu. This trend towards establishing and expanding the administrative bodies of Vyner Brooke's rule continued until 1929, when the effects of the world depression brought about a decline in revenue, and necessitated some retrenchment (ibid, p. 335).' <sup id="cite_ref-469" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-469">[469]</a></sup> Initially, Iban males were excluded from the newly established administration: 'As the Brooke's administrative positions were not opened to Iban then, these men on the whole had to be content with becoming medical assistants or policemen, while the more adventurous ones left for Singapore and Malaya to join government services. After the war, while most groups in the country were recovering from the impact of the Japanese occupation, Paku Iban were in a better position to take advantage of the rubber boom of the mid 1940's and early 1950's.' <sup id="cite_ref-470" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-470">[470]</a></sup> Government officials and codes nevertheless sought to regulate Iban affairs, even though villages remained relatively autonomous in most matters: 'In ancient times before a large gawai was celebrated, such as the Gawai Burong and Gawai Antu, tubai fishing was carried out by the sponsoring longhouse and the catch salted and smoked in order to provide provisions for the feast. Today this method of fishing is regulated by the government and those who wish to engage in tubai fishing are expected to obtain prior permission from the local District Officer, although not all do so and individual violations are relatively frequent, and are highly destructive especially when insecticides or chemical poisons are used to kill fish, rather than the traditional tubai.' <sup id="cite_ref-471" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-471">[471]</a></sup> Iban 'government chiefs' were appointed regional leaders rather than full-time bureaucrats. Some Iban may have joined the civil and military administration early on, but expert feedback is needed on the matter. Accordingly, some of the below variables may be irrelevant to the colonial-period Iban. Data on the White Rajah administration are included in the bureaucracy variables.

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from military ♣ absent ♥</b> Leadership was informal and based on individual ability and charisma: 'It is also within these sectors that we find specialisation and whatever limited leadership there is above the bilek level. This is embodied in the tuai rumah (house headman) and the tuai burong (augur). The foremost accomplishment of the tuai rumah is a sound knowledge of Iban customary law, adat , but he should also possess oratorical skill and the ability to serve as a mediator. It should be remembered that the adat not only signifies law in our western sense as a set of rules ordering social interaction, it has a wider implication of relating Iban society to the supra-human sphere, and it is extremely vital that the balance between these two ‘worlds’ does not get upset. The tuai rumah is thus the expounder of the law and the arbitrator between opposing parties on one level but through his meting out ‘fines’, or rather atonements, he is instrumental in restoring harmony between this level and a higher one. He can resort to no sanctions to ascertain that his rulings are carried out and there is no need for this either as the pressure to rectify, originates in the spiritual sphere which if necessary could be implemented by social sanctions by other members of the community, who themselves face ritual danger because of the actions of the malfeasant. Thus the tuai rumah does not enact his role within a formal institution of leadership but attains his standing through knowledge of adat , shrewdness of judgment and eloquent skills. Should he lose any of these “charismatic” qualities, which I think would manifest itself through inter-community strife and possibly natural mishaps, the people will leave him and the longhouse that carries his name and seek out some other community which they could join by employing the wide net of kindred. Alternatively there is the possibility of rejecting a non-satisfactory tuai rumah and [Page 101] choosing a new one.' <sup id="cite_ref-472" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-472">[472]</a></sup> 'As there is no formal institution of headman-ship and there is the possibility of rejection by the community, it is logical that the position of tuai rumah can not be inherited. At times this might not be appreciated and when there are cases of this office remaining within the same bilek -family or being taken over by some very close relative outside the bilek one could easily be led to believe that the office was hereditary or semi-hereditary. This can probably be explained by seeing that the likelihood of a close male relative - women never hold this office - learning the adat and the much admired oratorical skills is much greater than for somebody else not so closely involved with the tuai rumah .' <sup id="cite_ref-473" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-473">[473]</a></sup> 'My suggestion then is that individual achievement and charismatic style had a sociological significance in the Iban social system. If we look at the Iban kinship system in relation to the local community it becomes apparent that kinship links, however highly valued, did not suffice to tie the individual family-unit, the bilek , to one longhouse community only. The bilek , which was, and is, an autonomous and jural entity of unlimited life, could at any stage detach itself from the longhouse and move elsewhere. The community was thus an aggregation of such individual units. This was further evident in the structure of the longhouse domicile itself, because a departing bilek could, after having paid the ritual fine ( pemali fine) literally cemove the building material of its bilek apartment when it left the house. If the removing bilek was not situated at either end of the house this would mean that the longhouse would be broken into two parts with a gap in between. In the prevailing social system there was no institutionalized way in which to apply coercion to prevent the departure of individual bilek in order to safeguard the continued life of the community. It is in this context that I think we have to consider the roles of the war-leader [Page 135] and/or house headman, whom I will simply refer to as the leader hereafter. His role was the embodiment of the various aspects of success and through this he supplied the “social cement” that Helped both in founding a community and in keeping it together.' <sup id="cite_ref-474" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-474">[474]</a></sup> When head-taking and piracy were practiced, war parties were staffed with male community members: 'The taking of enemy heads then, was the prescriptive act for Iban males an act through which an individual could win for himself prestige and status within the longhouse community, while at the same time enhancing his desirability as a potential suitor and husband in the eyes of the opposite sex. But, as we have indicated, headhunting also had a ritual dimension which was of the utmost significance. It is the latter aspect which chiefly concerns us here, being  to do with Iban conceptions of male and female gender roles and relations of production and reproduction within Iban society.' <sup id="cite_ref-475" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-475">[475]</a></sup> War parties were led by local war-leaders or village headmen: 'According to Sea Dayak custom, this feast, the fifth of the nine stages of the gawai burong  , should be held only by an experienced war-leader. Linggir was undoubtedly a very brave man, but he was young, and certainly far less experienced than Uyut, his father. Linggir had already made a statue of the hornbill in preparation for his festival when the older people of the house warned him that it would be presumptuous for him to hold the feast while Uyut still lived. They said that such a rash action might anger Sengalang Burong.' <sup id="cite_ref-476" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-476">[476]</a></sup> 'Before the gawai diri   may be held, the patron of the feast must lead his warriors against some enemy. So Uyut and his men set off to raid the Kantu Dayaks of Merakai, in what is now Indonesian Borneo, in order to get some fresh heads. But before they came back, all the food which had been gathered for the feast, including tuak   wine and many different delicacies, began to go bad. So a brother-in-law of Uyut named Malang (Pengarah) decided to go ahead and hold the feast anyway, without the war-leader and his men. No sooner was it over than Uyut and his party returned from a victorious expedition. They were naturally outraged. Uyut and the others expelled Pengarah from the Anyut, and he retreated down river to live in the Serudit stream.' <sup id="cite_ref-477" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-477">[477]</a></sup> Historically, pioneer settlements were established and headed by charismatic war-leaders: 'From Benedict Sandin's ethnohistorical account it is clear that the pioneering leaders that came northwards from the Kapuas region were war-leaders as well as men of some wealth, and that their followers - kin-affiliation aside - were attracted to them for these very reasons. Former success in war meant that the followers would have confidence in their leader's ability both in attacking others and also in the defence of the home community, either through actual combat or through a reputation that would intimidate others. The wealth of the leader also would enable the payment of compensations should this become necessary (p. 155), and his ability to speak well would unite his followers against the outside and also aid in settling disputes or disagreements between members of the community. These various factors added up to the charisma of the leader and helped in binding the units together. Should his strength and ability lessen or even disappear this would immediately manifest itself in the lack of success and if this was a continuing trend, his followers, that is the different bilek entities, would seek to attach themselves to another longhouse or to establish a new one. There was also a possibility of ousting the leader and appointing someone else, believed to possess the qualities giving superior strength against others, good harvests and the absence of illness and death.' <sup id="cite_ref-478" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-478">[478]</a></sup> 'In Iban social crganisation there seem to be two opposing principles at work, one favouring cohesion of the local community, the other tending towards fragmentation by emphasising the autonomy of the primary unit, the bilek family. Factors working towards unity are to be sought in terms of kinship and ritual harmony, because there was as we have seen earlier, a high degree of local endogamy making for a close network and also the [Page 136] idea that decisions involving the whole community could only be reached after general discussion. Obedience to the adat and the observance of the omens also involved the whole community, because if the harmony became upset this would endanger the whole longhouse and show itself in misfortune and death. Although earlier writers on the Iban have remarked that the position of the “chief” was not a very strong one, because it did not correspond to the formal hierarchy of the Western world, I suggest that his role was of great importance in holding the local community together. His charisma and continuing success, which also was the success of the community, added to the centripetal forces and taken together meant that there could be lasting communities in spite of the atomistic character that the autonomy of the bilek imparts to Iban social organisation.' <sup id="cite_ref-479" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-479">[479]</a></sup> 'The question immediately springs to mind in this context: was the type of Iban leadership a function of the basic economy which necessitated continuous movement? If we compare the Iban with the Kayan it immediately becomes apparent that this was not the case. The Kayan had the same type of basic economy as the Iban, yet in their social organisation we find a rather rigid class structure and institutionalized leadership. There must have been other conditions that obtained for the Iban that account for this difference. I would suggest that the competition and warring that most likely started the Iban migrations into Sarawak would be conditions favouring the emergence of non-formalized leadership (if it did not obtain before, of which we know nothing). The charismatic leader would then be a prime agent in effecting communal cohesion, especially if the context was that of continuing disruption. It would also seem reasonable that there would be competition for leadership as every bilek unit was, in a sense, politically independent. Iban men, especially the younger males, would seek to display achievement within the fields constituting this success paradigm. They would try to excell in warring, raiding and head-taking, in amassing [Page 137] jungle-produce when on bejalai which could be converted into prestige items, and they would try to become skilled in oratory and the knowledge of the adat . Although this is a hypothetical discussion, such an interpretation seems to fit the historical and sociological facts and also helps to explain why the Iban men should have displayed an expressive life-style.' <sup id="cite_ref-480" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-480">[480]</a></sup> 'This, of course, is a process that easily leads to escalation and it is probable that the high degree of raiding, head-taking and “piracy” that made the Saribas and Skrang Iban so notorious at the middle of the last century, not only mirrored the prestige and its “inflationary spiral” that Morgan has discussed, but also was the logical consequence of an overextension of charismatic leadership and the competition for this position. Certain ecological considerations need also to be taken into account here; soils and climate together would have to be such that increasingly larger communities could be supported. If this was the case then increased strength both economically and as a fighting force would be favourable factors in any confrontation with outside adversaries. The large settlements seen by James Brooke and his companions in the down-river areas of the First and Second Division support such an argument. Whether centrifugal tendencies would have increased and again broken up these large longhouse communities had the Brooke raj not been created, is naturally impossible to say. The change of the ecology factor as well as the increased defence potential of a larger community might equally well have led to greater stability. It seems clear, however, that the introduction of “law and order”, the reorganization of warfare and head-hunting and the increased opportunities in the economic sector would have a direct effect on the leadership. It is against this background that I presume Sandin to be justified when he talks about leadership amongst the Saribas Iban as being hereditary, because these new conditions would favour the institutionalization of the leadership in a more formal shape.' <sup id="cite_ref-481" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-481">[481]</a></sup> Head-hunting persisted well into the 20th century: 'The persistence of headhunting as a living tradition, up until at least the Second World War, and even beyond (albeit in a drastically curtailed form), has meant that many of the details connected with the taking of heads are well documented. Moreover, the ritual significance of headhunting, and its attendant ceremonies, continue to play an important role in contemporary Iban society. We have already spoken of headhunting festivals ( gawai amat  ) held as celebrations of male prestige and achievement, but the traditional role of the Iban warrior continues to survive elsewhere in Iban culture, most notably in connection with mortuary rites. A visit to a Saribas Iban festival for the dead ( Gawai Antu  ), for instance, reveals a more than sufficient number of candidates to drink the sacred wine ( ai' garong  ) dedicated to those who have passed away. Previously, only those who had distinguished themselves as headhunters could partake in this sacred symposium with the dead; today the taking of a life - usually when on active service in the Sarawak Field Force - suffices. In this instance, and others of a similar nature, the warrior tradition of Iban society is maintained, and the ritual significance of headhunting preserved, as a major component in the Iban value system.' <sup id="cite_ref-482" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-482">[482]</a></sup> Authority remained fluid in practice even after formalization was introduced in the colonial period: 'With the coming of the Europeans a certain formalising of the role of the tuai rumah took place by investing it with legal and administrative powers as an agent of the government. In the same manner, influential leaders within territorial groupings, who often were war-leaders able to draw large followings, were elevated to district headmen ( penghulu ), a formal position with little correspondence to the factual and fluctuating basis for their authority. In fact the idea of leadership within Iban society appears so fluid and situational that an impromptu leader for any group undertaking, however small, is referred to as tuai .' <sup id="cite_ref-483" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-483">[483]</a></sup> Accordingly, there was no military in the sense of a separate institution in the 'native' system. However, we need to confirm when and to which extent Iban men joined the troops of the White Rajahs, and whether this was on a temporary or permanent basis.</dd>

In this, they were greatly aided by the highly comprehensive nature of traditional adat itself, which, although unwritten gave systematic definition of offences and correct punishments. Also important in this connection was the role formerly played by go-betweens. Within a longhouse respected elders frequently intervened in disputes, restraining the two sides and acting with their consent as negotiating agents. Such intervention was strongly supported by Iban values, particularly by the notion that a breach of adat or unresolved contention posed a collective [Page xxiv] spiritual danger to the well-being of all community members. Public spirited elders, including the longhouse headman and friends of the disputants, might even agree to make token compensation themselves, called sa-uta iring manok . In doing so, a speedy settlement was often achieved that avoided acrimony and possible loss of face by the principals.' <sup id="cite_ref-487" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-487">[487]</a></sup> Headmanship was determined by individual ability rather than predetermined social status: 'It is also within these sectors that we find specialisation and whatever limited leadership there is above the bilek level.

This pattern of aggressive outward expansion continued into the 1850's and, on a more peaceful basis, even later. Throughout this traditional period, social loyalties centered on major river systems. The watersheds dividing these rivers tended to delimit major regional groups, or “tribes”, and these groups, under the leadership of senior warriors and warleaders, the raja berani, tau kayau or tau serang , constituted the maximal units of traditional society organized for aggression and territorial defence. While regional leaders sought to minimize the dangers of fratricidal conflict among their followers, their formal powers were limited almost entirely to the context of warfare. Thus Iban society was traditionally “acephelous” and totally without a centralized, hierarchical political order. Political power was dispersed between basically sovereign local communities, longhouses and kindreds. It was in this turbulent setting that traditional Iban adat evolved, as an intricate system of social rules and sanctions, in independent, highly egalitarian communities without centralized authority, which, yet, for reasons of survival, required effective means for resolving contention and preserving internal order.' <sup id="cite_ref-492" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-492">[492]</a></sup>  The mediating abilities of headmen impacted the viability of longhouse communities: 'The number of bilek -families making up a longhouse community varies a great deal. There may be from just a few up to twenty, thirty or even more in a few cases. Many factors are included; the quality and quantity of land in the area, whether past harvests have been good or not, the stage of the development cycle of the bilek -families of the house, equally also the stage of the dampa system cycle in which the community finds itself, and whether it is in a pioneer area or in a long-settled district. The degree of communal strife, which indirectly reflects on the [Page 91] mediating ability of the tuai rumah is probably also a factor to be taken into account. After initial establishment in a new area by a core group of pioneering households, the house grows to its maximum size, at all times dependent on these variables, and in communities with a traditional type of agriculture the ecological factor will decide the upper limit after which one can expect a period of decrease until the community is no longer viable.' <sup id="cite_ref-493" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-493">[493]</a></sup> Only in the colonial period did rulers superimpose an administrative system of regional chiefs onto the village-based social structure of autonomous longhouse communities: 'Prior to the arrival of the British adventurer, James Brooke, there were no permanent leaders, but the affairs of each house were directed by consultations of family leaders. Men of influence included renowned warriors, bards, augurs and other specialists. Brooke, who became Rajah of Sarawak, and his nephew, Charles Johnson, created political positions -- headman (TUAI RUMAH), regional chief (PENGHULU), paramount chief (TEMENGGONG) -- to restructure Iban society for administrative control, especially for purposes of taxation and the suppression of head-hunting. The creation of permanent political positions and the establishment of political parties in the early 1960s have profoundly changed the Iban.' <sup id="cite_ref-494" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-494">[494]</a></sup> Even after the formalization of offices undertaken in the colonial period, authority remained fluid in practice: 'With the coming of the Europeans a certain formalising of the role of the tuai rumah took place by investing it with legal and administrative powers as an agent of the government. In the same manner, influential leaders within territorial groupings, who often were war-leaders able to draw large followings, were elevated to district headmen ( penghulu ), a formal position with little correspondence to the factual and fluctuating basis for their authority. In fact the idea of leadership within Iban society appears so fluid and situational that an impromptu leader for any group undertaking, however small, is referred to as tuai .' <sup id="cite_ref-495" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-495">[495]</a></sup> Given the informal nature of authority, there was no independent legislative within the 'native' system. We have assumed that Iban had little to no access to councils held by the White Rajah administration.</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from judiciary ♣ absent ♥</b> Initially, Iban customary law was not formalized: 'The legal rights and duties of every Iban is defined by the adat  , customary law. Among the laws affecting women are courtship, marriage, divorce, inheritance, and fines imposed in cases of infraction of the law. The fines are  payed in kati  ,  the value of which is based on brass or bronze, or in money; one kati   equals one dollar.' <sup id="cite_ref-496" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-496">[496]</a></sup> From the point of view of Iban adat, a longhouse community functions as a judicial unit: 'Although each of its component families is largely autonomous, the longhouse as a whole also functions as an important legal unit. In former times, every longhouse was, as we have noted, a politically sovereign community. Even now, the longhouse headman is looked upon as the chief guardian of community adat . He and other longhouse elders are expected to be well-versed in adat and to make known to their followers what the rules of adat require of them. Through informal meetings and judicial hearings they are also expected to enforce compliance with these rules and, following their stipulations, resolve disputes and redress compliants that arise within the community. In addition to this the longhouse as a whole is thought to possess a collective ritual status with regard to the spiritual world (Richards 1963:1-2).' <sup id="cite_ref-497" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-497">[497]</a></sup> Village headmen double as judges in local matters: 'When the Tuai Rumah learns that a serious offence, such as adultery, has been committed, he must sacrifice a chicken at once. The significance of this sacrifice is that it calls public attention to the offence and indicates that it is now under formal juridical review, and that the parties involved are no longer permitted to resort to private vengeance or self-help. He must act at once, as any delay might result in bloodshed, in which case the Tuai Rumah himself is liable to be fined. Traditionally an injured husband or wife had the right to retaliate in the case of adultery provided the adulterous couple were found in flogrante delicto   and the retaliation was carried out at once.' <sup id="cite_ref-498" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-498">[498]</a></sup> The judicial disputes presided over by village headmen do not constitute courts in the conventional sense of the term: 'The responsibility of the headman is to look after the affairs of his anak-biak , or followers, and, as a matter of course, he is expected to know every aspect of customary adat . If a dispute is referred to the headman, he will attempt to settle it with the help of the Tuai Umai or Tuai Burong (the farm leader or augury expert, respectively), and other village members who are well versed in customary adat . The Tuai Burong is an expert in various kinds of augury as well as being well versed in the genealogies and history of his community.' <sup id="cite_ref-499" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-499">[499]</a></sup> The importance of face-to-face hearings varied regionally: 'Of even greater importance was the face-to-face hearing, the baum or betunga . Heppell (1975:8-9) sees the present day system of longhouse and Penghulu courts ( bechara ) as a “hybridization” of the traditional Iban baum and the introduced concept of the court. However, there appears to have been some difference here between major regional groups in the relative importance in the past of the baum as a judicial institution. In the Saribas local and regional leaders appear to have exercised greater authority than was generally true among Iban elsewhere. Consequently they seem to have enjoyed greater success in compelling disputants to accept negotiation in face-to-face hearings and the decisions made by the baum appear to have carried greater force traditionally than may have been the case elsewhere. Thus these hearings functioned as a nascent court system well before the arrival of the Brookes. However, Heppell is right when he points out (1975:227) that their nature was profoundly altered when decisions were backed by the formal authority of the state. Even so, the present day bechara is thoroughly indigenized and its workings are closely modelled on those of the traditional baum . More than this, the baum itself remains the chief means by which local conflicts are resolved.' <sup id="cite_ref-500" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-500">[500]</a></sup> Difficult cases were solved through ordeal: 'In particularly intractable cases resort was sometimes made in the past to legal contests or ordeals in which the outcome was believed to be supernaturally determined. These ordeals are also described in the chapter that follows and consisted of diving contests, cock fights, and the thrusting of hands into boiling water or into a fire. As a general rule, these procedures were used, as tests of innocence or ways of choosing between conflicting claims, particularly those of ownership, in situations where there exists no possible way to arrive at an infallible human judgment. Like betempoh , ordeals were conducted according to strict rules, were judged by impartial witnesses, and were supervised, and compliance with their outcome upheld, by regional leaders. Ordeals had the advantage of giving a clear-cut verdict which other forms of legal action might not be able to achieve because of a lack of evidence or demonstrable proof. Partly as a result, elimination of ordeals proved difficult, despite government prohibitions at various times, as the author notes here in connection with diving contests.' <sup id="cite_ref-501" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-501">[501]</a></sup> Protracted litigation was considered to be spiritually dangerous: 'The spiritual danger of unresolved contention may effect not only an individual through harm done to his soul, but may collectively endanger the whole longhouse to which he belongs. Dissension within a longhouse and failure to abide by the adat rumah , the “longhouse rules”, are believed to cause a state of angat , or spiritual “heat”. The community is described as “hot”, in a spiritual sense, and as a result its members are likely to suffer chronic illness, crop failures, famine and other misfortunes. In addition, the effectiveness of major rituals performed by the longhouse is thought to be lessened when a community is divided by internal quarrels. Thus traditionally, for example, before the major farming rites that preceed the initial clearing ( manggol ) of farms can be held, it is necessary first to clear away all outstanding litigation, particularly boundary disputes, so as to restore social cohesion within the community performing the rites, as a necessary pre-condition to their success. Thus longhouse members are compelled to settle their differences. In the case of major ritual festivals as well, all are opened by admonitions delivered by the community leaders present to all of those who have gathered enjoining them to put aside their past grievances, avoid quarrelling and breach of adat , for the success of the rituals they perform depend upon their preserving social harmony among themselves.' <sup id="cite_ref-502" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-502">[502]</a></sup> In the colonial period, the Brooke Raj administration introduced a formal penal code and courts: 'Sir Charles Vyner de Windt Brooke (b. Sept. 26, 1874, London-d. May 9, 1963, London) was the third and last “white raja” (1917-46). He joined the Sarawak administration in 1897. After World War I, a boom in rubber and oil drew Sarawak further into the world economy, and for that and other reasons the state embarked on gradual modernization of its institutions. Public services were developed, a Sarawak penal code modelled on that of British India was introduced in 1924, and there was some extension of educational opportunity.' <sup id="cite_ref-503" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-503">[503]</a></sup> 'By 1900, Brooke control of Sarawak was fairly well established. The government was gradually extending its efforts into such fields as agricultural research. As it established a system of courts and law, effort was made, whenever possible, to codify and preserve local customary law ( adat ). From this time on, the mainstream of Iban migration was much less violent, despite cultural ideals, and as we will see, much slower. However, government regulations notwithstanding, the migrations did not cease.' <sup id="cite_ref-504" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-504">[504]</a></sup> This had a profound impact on legal and judicial practice: 'Despite the cherished belief of the first two Rajahs that their government preserved indigenous adat very largely as they found it, the development of administrative institutions that took place during their rule inevitably brought in its train profound changes. Most importantly, the Brookes introduced courts to the Iban and elevated and ultimately backed the judicial role of indigenous leaders. At the level of the longhouse, the traditional longhouse forum ( baum ) was restructed, as a court ( bechara ), as we shall see presently, and the longhouse headman was formally impowered through its use to settle disputes among his followers according to the principles of adat . In contrast to traditional society, his legal authority, and the binding force of adat itself were thus sanctioned by the state, government magistrates and police. Judicial decisions were enforceable and non-compliance or resort to force was strictly punishable. Indeed, many instances of such punishment occurred during the early years of Brooke rule. At the regional level, the status of regional leaders was similarly formalized in the creation of salaried Penghulus or native chiefs. These leaders assumed responsibility for their own bechara . Moreover, the Penghulu courts were not only granted special areas of jurisdiction, but were formally instituted as superior courts of appeal vis-a-vis the longhouse bechara . The basis on which adat operated as a mechanism of social control was thus profoundly altered.' <sup id="cite_ref-505" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-505">[505]</a></sup> 'In addition the Brookes moved gradually to eliminate some elements of adat that they considered bad, or in need of reform, and this process was continued by local officers through the years. Several aspects of Iban custom were ultimately proscribed, including the death penalty for incest, the right of an aggrieved husband to take the lives of an adulterous pair caught in flagrante delicto , rights of forceable seizure of property, and head hunting. In the case of adultery and forceable seizure, their proscription coincided with the efforts of Iban leaders themselves to avert recourse to these measures. Forced appropriation of property, called ngerampas , was an important element of traditional Iban law, and was only gradually suppressed through the substitution of effective means of judicial redress and the enforcement of monetary fines. Head hunting was even more important and was the focus of a complex religious cult bearing importantly on political leadership. Its suppression was also gradual, and indeed, during the early days of the Raj its practice was sometimes fostered as a punitive measure in extending control over recalcitrant tribal groups (cf. Wagner 1972). Two other institutions, though officially disapproved, were only gradually eliminated: slavery and legal contests. Both are described in some detail later in this study. As Pringle (1970:176) observes, the first two Rajahs liked to think of themselves as acting always within a traditional framework, even when they introduced changes in the customs of the country. But more than this, they often did, in fact, make use of traditional means in bringing about changes, one of the reasons why innovations made by the Brookes took such deep root in Sarawak. Resistance to the elimination of slavery came not so much from the Iban and other interior communities as from the Malay aristocracy. Although the Iban formerly kept slaves, whose status was theoretically heritable, slaves, in fact, usually enjoyed eventual emancipation. As a consequence, the Iban [Page xvii] preserved their basic egalitarianism and there never developed a significant slave class in Iban society. The final elimination of slavery was brought about, as Mr. Sandin indicates here, by means of the traditional Iban procedure of manumission through adoption ( betembang ) and the descendants of former slaves were protected from formal disability by Iban rules against personal defamation. In suppressing slavery, the Brookes thus showed considerable insight, bringing it about largely through the inner workings of indigenous institutions. Similarly legal contests were only gradually eliminated, and not totally disallowed until alternative judicial procedures become generally accepted. Ordeals by fire and boiling water were disliked by the Iban themseves and were allowed to die a natural death. Legal contests involving the use of wooden weapons were seen as a dangerous convention by the Iban themselves and their suppression, again, coincided with the efforts of indigenous leaders to avert their use. For reasons which will become clear presently, diving contests proved to be more resilent and their gradual elimination took many years to achieve.'  <sup id="cite_ref-506" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-506">[506]</a></sup> 'For the Iban, the most far-reaching effect of government legislation was restriction of the traditional system of acquiring rights to the use of land by jungle clearage. More fundamentally yet, the sovereignty of the local com [Page xx] munity in land matters, a basic feature of all indigenous tenure systems (Richards 1961:20-21,56), was replaced by a system in which land rights are ultimately maintained and administered by the state. Considerable litigation has resulted in adjusting indigenous adat to this principle, particularly where the land use patterns of shifting agriculturalists have not been fully under-stood. With the introduction of courts, the most frequent single area of litigation concerned land disputes, and at the present time, as well, land rights remain a major source of legal contention. Today Iban patterns of land holding are changing radically, with extensive, but as yet little studied social consequences.' <sup id="cite_ref-507" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-507">[507]</a></sup> While courts were present in the colonial system, there was no independent judiciary in the 'native' system. Accordingly, we have coded 'absent'. This is debatable, however, given the 'entanglements' between colonial and 'native' governance (see above). This is a general problem that we need to address in our coding procedures for low-complexity NGAs under imperialism.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Customary mechanism ♣ absent ♥</b> Longhouse communities were headed by leaders doubling as village functionaries: 'In every Iban long-house there are two offices of great importance--one secular and the other ritual. They are the positions of tuai rumah   and tuai burong  . In most long-houses they are held by different individuals, but it is perfectly permissible for one man to hold both offices, and in some communities this does happen. Neither position is ever held by a woman. (c.f. Footnote No. 22). When used as an adjective, the word tuai   means old, or mature, but as a noun it refers to any senior and influential member of a community. Here, the emphasis is not primarily on age, but on the personal qualities of the individual concerned. Thus, a party of young men setting off on an expedition ( bejalai  ), to gather jungle produce, always has its leader, or tuai  , though he may be no more than in his early twenties. And in long-house communities, able, though only middle-aged men often come to exert very considerable authority and influence. In all contemporary long-houses however, there is one man who holds the title of tuai rumah  , or house headman.' <sup id="cite_ref-508" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-508">[508]</a></sup> Social control and authority were informal: 'Prior to the arrival of the British adventurer, James Brooke, there were no permanent leaders, but the affairs of each house were directed by consultations of family leaders. Men of influence included renowned warriors, bards, augurs and other specialists. Brooke, who became Rajah of Sarawak, and his nephew, Charles Johnson, created political positions -- headman (TUAI RUMAH), regional chief (PENGHULU), paramount chief (TEMENGGONG) -- to restructure Iban society for administrative control, especially for purposes of taxation and the suppression of head-hunting. The creation of permanent political positions and the establishment of political parties in the early 1960s have profoundly changed the Iban.' <sup id="cite_ref-509" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-509">[509]</a></sup> 'Iban employ three strategies of social control. First, from childhood, they are taught to avoid conflict, and for a majority, every effort is made to prevent it. Second, they are taught by story and drama of the existence of numerous spirits, who vigilantly ensure observation of numerous taboos; some spirits are interested in preserving the peace, while others are responsible for any strife that arises. In these ways, the stresses and conflicts of ordinary life, especially life in the longhouse, in which one is in more or less constant sight and sound of others, have been displaced onto the spirits. Third, the headman hears disputes between members of the same house, the regional chief, disputes between members of different houses, and government officers, hear those disputes that headmen and regional chiefs cannot resolve.' <sup id="cite_ref-510" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-510">[510]</a></sup> 'Traditionally Iban leaders sought to settle disputes, as far as possible, through negotiation and attempted to avert recourse to self-help and other means that might potentially lead to open violence. In this, they were greatly aided by the highly comprehensive nature of traditional adat itself, which, although unwritten gave systematic definition of offences and correct punishments. Also important in this connection was the role formerly played by go-betweens. Within a longhouse respected elders frequently intervened in disputes, restraining the two sides and acting with their consent as negotiating agents. Such intervention was strongly supported by Iban values, particularly by the notion that a breach of adat or unresolved contention posed a collective [Page xxiv] spiritual danger to the well-being of all community members. Public spirited elders, including the longhouse headman and friends of the disputants, might even agree to make token compensation themselves, called sa-uta iring manok . In doing so, a speedy settlement was often achieved that avoided acrimony and possible loss of face by the principals.' <sup id="cite_ref-511" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-511">[511]</a></sup> War-leaders and headmen attained prestige, but were not entitled to exceptional deference: '150. When a man does become a tuai rumah there is no kind of initiation ceremony, nor is he given any kind of honorific title. His kindred continue to use the ordinary terms of classificatory kinship ( anak, menyadi, apai , etc.). while strangers address him as wai (friend), or with his personal name (e.g. Nyala). Towards him there are no special attitudes of deference or respect, other than he is able to command by virtue of his own personal prowess and prestige. He receives no tribute of any kind, and is entitled to no special privileges -- except in his relations with Government officials. Unless he also is a tuai burong , he has no religious duties to perform, and no sort of ritual sanctity attaches to his person or the apartment be occupies. It frequently happens, of course, that a tuai rumah is also a man of considerable personal prestige. He may, for example, be a successful head-hunter, and have sealed his renown by performing a number of the great rituals ( gawai ), which rank so high in Iban estimation. Again, being a tuai rumah does mean that a man becomes widely known, for it is usual for an Iban community to be called after its tuai rumah (e.g. Rumah Nyala, etc.). and this is undoubtedly one of the main attractions which the office has for ambitions individuals. A tuai rumah is also presented with special opportunities for meeting Europeans, and, in Iban eyes, such meetings are likely to lead to all manner of desirable results. But here, we are primarily concerned with the jural status of a tuai rumah within his own long-house. Under Iban adat a tuai rumah has no authority to command other members of the community, nor are they, in any real sense, his subordinates. Were a tuai rumah so rash as to issue commands to others, he would at once be rebuffed, and sharply. Rather, such influence as he does exert is by a subtle mixture of persuasion and admonition, for he knows that his position is dependent on the continued goodwill and approval of his anembiak , as the other members of the house are called. In many ways his role is an unenviable one. I remember tuai rumah Nyala, remarking to me with some feeling that he only ever gave his opinion when it was asked for; he would be malu (ashamed), he said, to volunteer advice to any of his anembiak , and, in any case, no-one would ever listen to him if he did.' <sup id="cite_ref-512" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-512">[512]</a></sup> Headmanship was determined by individual ability rather than predetermined social status: 'It is also within these sectors that we find specialisation and whatever limited leadership there is above the bilek level. This is embodied in the tuai rumah (house headman) and the tuai burong (augur). The foremost accomplishment of the tuai rumah is a sound knowledge of Iban customary law, adat , but he should also possess oratorical skill and the ability to serve as a mediator. It should be remembered that the adat not only signifies law in our western sense as a set of rules ordering social interaction, it has a wider implication of relating Iban society to the supra-human sphere, and it is extremely vital that the balance between these two ‘worlds’ does not get upset. The tuai rumah is thus the expounder of the law and the arbitrator between opposing parties on one level but through his meting out ‘fines’, or rather atonements, he is instrumental in restoring harmony between this level and a higher one. He can resort to no sanctions to ascertain that his rulings are carried out and there is no need for this either as the pressure to rectify, originates in the spiritual sphere which if necessary could be implemented by social sanctions by other members of the community, who themselves face ritual danger because of the actions of the malfeasant. Thus the tuai rumah does not enact his role within a formal institution of leadership but attains his standing through knowledge of adat , shrewdness of judgment and eloquent skills. Should he lose any of these “charismatic” qualities, which I think would manifest itself through inter-community strife and possibly natural mishaps, the people will leave him and the longhouse that carries his name and seek out some other community which they could join by employing the wide net of kindred. Alternatively there is the possibility of rejecting a non-satisfactory tuai rumah and [Page 101] choosing a new one.' <sup id="cite_ref-513" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-513">[513]</a></sup> 'My suggestion then is that individual achievement and charismatic style had a sociological significance in the Iban social system. If we look at the Iban kinship system in relation to the local community it becomes apparent that kinship links, however highly valued, did not suffice to tie the individual family-unit, the bilek , to one longhouse community only. The bilek , which was, and is, an autonomous and jural entity of unlimited life, could at any stage detach itself from the longhouse and move elsewhere. The community was thus an aggregation of such individual units. This was further evident in the structure of the longhouse domicile itself, because a departing bilek could, after having paid the ritual fine ( pemali fine) literally cemove the building material of its bilek apartment when it left the house. If the removing bilek was not situated at either end of the house this would mean that the longhouse would be broken into two parts with a gap in between. In the prevailing social system there was no institutionalized way in which to apply coercion to prevent the departure of individual bilek in order to safeguard the continued life of the community. It is in this context that I think we have to consider the roles of the war-leader [Page 135] and/or house headman, whom I will simply refer to as the leader hereafter. His role was the embodiment of the various aspects of success and through this he supplied the “social cement” that Helped both in founding a community and in keeping it together.' <sup id="cite_ref-514" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-514">[514]</a></sup> There was no hereditary succession: 'The economic self-sufficiency of the bilik  -family is reflected in other areas of Iban social life. Unlike the Kayan, Kenyah, pagan Melanau and several other Bornean peoples, the Iban are not divided into social classes.  Nor is there any  form of institutionalized leadership based upon hereditary succession, or some other socially divisive principle. Instead Iban society is characterized by a strongly egalitarian ethos. In this respect, each bilik  -family jurally constitutes a discrete and autonomous social unit, which manages its own affairs and recognizes no higher authority than that of its own household head.' <sup id="cite_ref-515" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-515">[515]</a></sup> 'As there is no formal institution of headman-ship and there is the possibility of rejection by the community, it is logical that the position of tuai rumah can not be inherited. At times this might not be appreciated and when there are cases of this office remaining within the same bilek -family or being taken over by some very close relative outside the bilek one could easily be led to believe that the office was hereditary or semi-hereditary. This can probably be explained by seeing that the likelihood of a close male relative - women never hold this office - learning the adat and the much admired oratorical skills is much greater than for somebody else not so closely involved with the tuai rumah .' <sup id="cite_ref-516" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-516">[516]</a></sup> Accordingly, the Iban have been characterized as an acephalous society: 'Prior to the arrival of the Brookes, the Iban present a picture of an exceedingly energetic people, waring among themselves and with others, and constantly expanding territorially, absorbing and displacing other groups of people in the process. This pattern of aggressive outward expansion continued into the 1850's and, on a more peaceful basis, even later. Throughout this traditional period, social loyalties centered on major river systems. The watersheds dividing these rivers tended to delimit major regional groups, or “tribes”, and these groups, under the leadership of senior warriors and warleaders, the raja berani, tau kayau or tau serang , constituted the maximal units of traditional society organized for aggression and territorial defence. While regional leaders sought to minimize the dangers of fratricidal conflict among their followers, their formal powers were limited almost entirely to the context of warfare. Thus Iban society was traditionally “acephelous” and totally without a centralized, hierarchical political order. Political power was dispersed between basically sovereign local communities, longhouses and kindreds. It was in this turbulent setting that traditional Iban adat evolved, as an intricate system of social rules and sanctions, in independent, highly egalitarian communities without centralized authority, which, yet, for reasons of survival, required effective means for resolving contention and preserving internal order.' <sup id="cite_ref-517" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-517">[517]</a></sup> The mediating abilities of headmen impacted the viability of longhouse communities: 'The number of bilek -families making up a longhouse community varies a great deal. There may be from just a few up to twenty, thirty or even more in a few cases. Many factors are included; the quality and quantity of land in the area, whether past harvests have been good or not, the stage of the development cycle of the bilek -families of the house, equally also the stage of the dampa system cycle in which the community finds itself, and whether it is in a pioneer area or in a long-settled district. The degree of communal strife, which indirectly reflects on the [Page 91] mediating ability of the tuai rumah is probably also a factor to be taken into account. After initial establishment in a new area by a core group of pioneering households, the house grows to its maximum size, at all times dependent on these variables, and in communities with a traditional type of agriculture the ecological factor will decide the upper limit after which one can expect a period of decrease until the community is no longer viable.' <sup id="cite_ref-518" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-518">[518]</a></sup> Even after the formalization of offices undertaken in the colonial period, authority remained fluid in practice: 'With the coming of the Europeans a certain formalising of the role of the tuai rumah took place by investing it with legal and administrative powers as an agent of the government. In the same manner, influential leaders within territorial groupings, who often were war-leaders able to draw large followings, were elevated to district headmen ( penghulu ), a formal position with little correspondence to the factual and fluctuating basis for their authority. In fact the idea of leadership within Iban society appears so fluid and situational that an impromptu leader for any group undertaking, however small, is referred to as tuai .' <sup id="cite_ref-519" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-519">[519]</a></sup> Given the informal nature of social control, there was no fixed system of power transfer on the local level.</dd>

<p><b>♠ State-level administrators ♣ present ♥</b> There was no bureaucracy prior to colonial rule. Iban social organization was based on autonomous residential communities and kin groups: 'Each longhouse, as each BILEK, is an autonomous unit. Traditionally the core of each house was a group of descendants of the founders. Houses near one another on the same river or in the same region were commonly allied, marrying among themselves, raiding together beyond their territories, and resolving disputes by peaceful means. Regionalism, deriving from these alliances, in which Iban distinguished themselves from other allied groups, persist in modern state politics. Essentially egalitarian, Iban are aware of long-standing status distinctions among themselves of RAJA BERANI (wealthy and brave), MENSI SARIBU (commoners), and ULUN (slaves). Prestige still accrues to descendants of the first status, disdain to descendants of the third.' <sup id="cite_ref-521" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-521">[521]</a></sup> 'The economic self-sufficiency of the bilik  -family is reflected in other areas of Iban social life.

Nor is there any  form of institutionalized leadership based upon hereditary succession, or some other socially divisive principle. Instead Iban society is characterized by a strongly egalitarian ethos. In this respect, each bilik  -family jurally constitutes a discrete and autonomous social unit, which manages its own affairs and recognizes no higher authority than that of its own household head.' <sup id="cite_ref-522" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-522">[522]</a></sup> Longhouse communities were headed by informal leaders doubling as village functionaries: 'In every Iban long-house there are two offices of great importance--one secular and the other ritual. They are the positions of tuai rumah   and tuai burong  . In most long-houses they are held by different individuals, but it is perfectly permissible for one man to hold both offices, and in some communities this does happen. Neither position is ever held by a woman. (c.f. Footnote No. 22). When used as an adjective, the word tuai   means old, or mature, but as a noun it refers to any senior and influential member of a community. Here, the emphasis is not primarily on age, but on the personal qualities of the individual concerned. Thus, a party of young men setting off on an expedition ( bejalai  ), to gather jungle produce, always has its leader, or tuai  , though he may be no more than in his early twenties. And in long-house communities, able, though only middle-aged men often come to exert very considerable authority and influence. In all contemporary long-houses however, there is one man who holds the title of tuai rumah  , or house headman.' <sup id="cite_ref-523" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-523">[523]</a></sup> Accordingly, social control was informal: 'Iban employ three strategies of social control. First, from childhood, they are taught to avoid conflict, and for a majority, every effort is made to prevent it. Second, they are taught by story and drama of the existence of numerous spirits, who vigilantly ensure observation of numerous taboos; some spirits are interested in preserving the peace, while others are responsible for any strife that arises. In these ways, the stresses and conflicts of ordinary life, especially life in the longhouse, in which one is in more or less constant sight and sound of others, have been displaced onto the spirits. Third, the headman hears disputes between members of the same house, the regional chief, disputes between members of different houses, and government officers, hear those disputes that headmen and regional chiefs cannot resolve.' <sup id="cite_ref-524" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-524">[524]</a></sup> In the colonial period, the White Rajahs superimposed an administrative system of regional chiefs onto the village-based social structure of autonomous longhouse communities: 'Prior to the arrival of the British adventurer, James Brooke, there were no permanent leaders, but the affairs of each house were directed by consultations of family leaders.

The Government steadily expanded its scope during the postwar period until 1929, when the onset of world depression and the consequent decline in rubber prices brought a sharp decline in revenues and necessitated some retrenchment. A written criminal code based on the Indian Penal Code went into effect in 1923, and a Legal Department under a trained Chief Justice was created in 1928. The first State-wide land law was promulgated in 1920, to be replaced with far more complex legislation in 1930 and 1933. There were periodic examinations for Government officers after 1924, and municipal administration began in Kuching and Sibu during the following two years. Gradually more departments were created, and some technical specialists were posted to the outstations. With the appointment of a Chief Secretary in 1923, a small, formal Secretariat began to function in Kuching. The power of the Residents remained great, but a wholly new emphasis on administrative uniformity began to appear in some official pronouncements. The Rajah's address to the Council Negri in 1924 contained a passage that would have been unthinkable twenty years previously. The Residents were urged to regard the Chief Secretary as a “coordinator,” and were further advised, “It was sometimes forgotten that these Divisions were not independent provinces; but that they all formed part of one united Sarawak; and when a policy was formed, orders were drawn up for the good of the whole state.”' <sup id="cite_ref-526" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-526">[526]</a></sup> 'Throughout the twenties, the following administrative innovations were introduced: the establishment of a formal Secretariat under the chief secretary in Kuching in 1923; the creation of a legal department in 1928, and between 1924 and 1926, municipal administration was established in Kuching and Sibu. This trend towards establishing and expanding the administrative bodies of Vyner Brooke's rule continued until 1929, when the effects of the world depression brought about a decline in revenue, and necessitated some retrenchment (ibid, p. 335).' <sup id="cite_ref-527" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-527">[527]</a></sup> The Brooke administration appointed officers dealing with military and other executive matters: 'About three years later, the Orang Kaya Pemancha Dana (Bayang) led a large force against the Undup Ibans, who had killed his brother, Angkum. Long remembered as the ‘great bala ’, this expedition completely defeated the Undups, many of whom were killed or taken captive. The survivors fled to Lingga and the Kapuas valley and settled in the Salimbau area. They did not return to their old homes until the time of Mr Brereton, the first officer of James Brooke to serve in the Batang Lupar region, only to discover that many of their lands and fruit trees had been occupied by Skrang Ibans. Likewise, the Ulu Undup had been settled by Ibans from the Kumpang branch of the Batang Ai.' <sup id="cite_ref-528" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-528">[528]</a></sup> The White Rajah administration also established courts dealing with civil matters such as land tenure and agriculture: 'The Brooke courts helped to reinforce the development of common farming land in the Second Division by adopting the principle that any land which had not been utilized for a specified period (including virgin land) reverted to the Government. For example, in Abang Embit [Page 20] and others v Penghulu Luta , an important case from the Paku, it was stated: “By published Gov't Orders, jungle of over 3 years growth on swamp and 7 years on hill land cannot be claimed by anyone, being the property of the State . . . [A]nyone wishing to fell same for the purpose of farming, may do so without the necessity for a permit” (Betong Court Book 1920:483). It is not clear to which Government Orders this statement refers, nor on what basis the 3 and 7 year limits were chosen (given that, for hill rice farming, 7 years is close to the absolute minimum fallow period required for sustained yield). Nevertheless, the use of these guidelines by the courts had the effect of strengthening the trend towards greater community control over the disposal of farming land, as in practice the designated “State land” differed little from the common land described by Phillips.' <sup id="cite_ref-529" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-529">[529]</a></sup> The Britannica provides a general description of these transformations under the second adn third Rajahs: 'Sir Charles Anthony Johnson Brooke (b. June 3, 1829, Berrow, Somerset, Eng.-d. May 17, 1917, Cirencester, Gloucestershire), who adopted the surname Brooke, became the second raja. The government of Charles Brooke has been described as a benevolent autocracy. Charles himself had spent much of his life among the Iban people of Sarawak, knew their language, and respected their beliefs and customs. He made extensive use of down-river Malay chiefs as administrators, and encouraged selective immigration of Chinese agriculturalists, while the dominant indigenous group, the Ibans, were employed in military service. In general, social and economic changes were limited in impact, shielding the inhabitants from both the benefits and the hardships of Western-style development.' <sup id="cite_ref-530" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-530">[530]</a></sup> 'Sir Charles Vyner de Windt Brooke (b. Sept. 26, 1874, London-d. May 9, 1963, London) was the third and last “white raja” (1917-46). He joined the Sarawak administration in 1897. After World War I, a boom in rubber and oil drew Sarawak further into the world economy, and for that and other reasons the state embarked on gradual modernization of its institutions. Public services were developed, a Sarawak penal code modelled on that of British India was introduced in 1924, and there was some extension of educational opportunity.' <sup id="cite_ref-531" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-531">[531]</a></sup> Initially, Iban men were excluded from the newly established administration: 'As the Brooke's administrative positions were not opened to Iban then, these men on the whole had to be content with becoming medical assistants or policemen, while the more adventurous ones left for Singapore and Malaya to join government services. After the war, while most groups in the country were recovering from the impact of the Japanese occupation, Paku Iban were in a better position to take advantage of the rubber boom of the mid 1940's and early 1950's.' <sup id="cite_ref-532" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-532">[532]</a></sup> Initially, the Brooke Raj administration sought to shield their Iban subjects from the adverse effects of 'modernization': 'Only an unusually strong and far sighted ruler would have seen any virtue in such a suggestion in the pre-war years. If there were some administrators who recognized the need for change, and whose efforts initiated the limited new programs already described after 1935, there was in general little sense of urgency abroad in the land. The Rajah might talk of eventual independence in introducing the new constitution, but self-government was not yet an idea which many people took seriously. There were some Ibans who were already anxious for  more education, but the majority were still living in a world of wholly local, traditional concerns. Because it was a state of smallholders, and owing partly to the oil field at Miri, Sarawak had weathered the world depression with only minor hardships and dislocations. In 1941 it was a comparatively comfortable, profoundly isolated corner of colonial Southeast Asia. A weekly steamer provided the only connection between Kuching and Singapore, and when it sailed up the Sarawak River, a cannon shot from the damp-stained parapets of the old fort boomed out to signal the great event. To most Europeans and Asians alike, the great centers of trade, learning and politics all seemed very far away. It was altogether easy for a Government to remain convinced that modernization was remote and irrelevant.' <sup id="cite_ref-533" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-533">[533]</a></sup> Accordingly, legal formalization was a protracted process: 'One of the first administrative acts of James Brooke was to accord official recognition to Malay written law, the Undang-Undang, shortly after establishing his government in 1842. For other indigenous groups, including the Iban, both James Brooke and his successor, Charles Brooke, extended similar recognition to those areas of adat constituting an accepted body of customary law. The policy pursued was basically one of non-interference with adat , except in cases involving physical violence, capital offences, or where traditional punishments were considered to be too harsh. This policy was dictated by practical necessity.' <sup id="cite_ref-534" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-534">[534]</a></sup> 'As Pringle (1970:173-75) notes the first Rajahs as men of strongly conservative instinct, steadfastly resisted efforts to systematize adat . A comprehensive code of law, based on the Indian Penal Code and Indian Criminal Procedure Code, was instituted in Sarawak only in the time of the Third [Page xvi] Rajah, and even then, its provisions were understood to apply only to offences not covered by customary rules of adat (Chater 1964:225).' <sup id="cite_ref-535" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-535">[535]</a></sup> Government officials and codes nevertheless sought to regulate Iban affairs, even though villages remained relatively autonomous in most matters: 'In ancient times before a large gawai was celebrated, such as the Gawai Burong and Gawai Antu, tubai fishing was carried out by the sponsoring longhouse and the catch salted and smoked in order to provide provisions for the feast. Today this method of fishing is regulated by the government and those who wish to engage in tubai fishing are expected to obtain prior permission from the local District Officer, although not all do so and individual violations are relatively frequent, and are highly destructive especially when insecticides or chemical poisons are used to kill fish, rather than the traditional tubai.' <sup id="cite_ref-536" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-536">[536]</a></sup> The political and legal transformations of the colonial period had a profound impact on Iban institutions: 'The establishment of Brooke rule profoundly altered the structure of Iban society. Although the early policy of the Rajahs' government was to interfere as little as possible with indigenous adat , the creation of a centralized government and the elimination of blood feud and the gradual suppression of intertribal warfare had far-reaching effects on Iban political life and internal institutions of social control.' <sup id="cite_ref-537" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-537">[537]</a></sup> 'Despite the cherished belief of the first two Rajahs that their government preserved indigenous adat very largely as they found it, the development of administrative institutions that took place during their rule inevitably brought in its train profound changes. Most importantly, the Brookes introduced courts to the Iban and elevated and ultimately backed the judicial role of indigenous leaders. At the level of the longhouse, the traditional longhouse forum ( baum ) was restructed, as a court ( bechara ), as we shall see presently, and the longhouse headman was formally impowered through its use to settle disputes among his followers according to the principles of adat . In contrast to traditional society, his legal authority, and the binding force of adat itself were thus sanctioned by the state, government magistrates and police. Judicial decisions were enforceable and non-compliance or resort to force was strictly punishable. Indeed, many instances of such punishment occurred during the early years of Brooke rule. At the regional level, the status of regional leaders was similarly formalized in the creation of salaried Penghulus or native chiefs. These leaders assumed responsibility for their own bechara . Moreover, the Penghulu courts were not only granted special areas of jurisdiction, but were formally instituted as superior courts of appeal vis-a-vis the longhouse bechara . The basis on which adat operated as a mechanism of social control was thus profoundly altered.' <sup id="cite_ref-538" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-538">[538]</a></sup> 'In addition the Brookes moved gradually to eliminate some elements of adat that they considered bad, or in need of reform, and this process was continued by local officers through the years. Several aspects of Iban custom were ultimately proscribed, including the death penalty for incest, the right of an aggrieved husband to take the lives of an adulterous pair caught in flagrante delicto , rights of forceable seizure of property, and head hunting. In the case of adultery and forceable seizure, their proscription coincided with the efforts of Iban leaders themselves to avert recourse to these measures. Forced appropriation of property, called ngerampas , was an important element of traditional Iban law, and was only gradually suppressed through the substitution of effective means of judicial redress and the enforcement of monetary fines. Head hunting was even more important and was the focus of a complex religious cult bearing importantly on political leadership. Its suppression was also gradual, and indeed, during the early days of the Raj its practice was sometimes fostered as a punitive measure in extending control over recalcitrant tribal groups (cf. Wagner 1972). Two other institutions, though officially disapproved, were only gradually eliminated: slavery and legal contests. Both are described in some detail later in this study. As Pringle (1970:176) observes, the first two Rajahs liked to think of themselves as acting always within a traditional framework, even when they introduced changes in the customs of the country. But more than this, they often did, in fact, make use of traditional means in bringing about changes, one of the reasons why innovations made by the Brookes took such deep root in Sarawak. Resistance to the elimination of slavery came not so much from the Iban and other interior communities as from the Malay aristocracy. Although the Iban formerly kept slaves, whose status was theoretically heritable, slaves, in fact, usually enjoyed eventual emancipation. As a consequence, the Iban [Page xvii] preserved their basic egalitarianism and there never developed a significant slave class in Iban society. The final elimination of slavery was brought about, as Mr. Sandin indicates here, by means of the traditional Iban procedure of manumission through adoption ( betembang ) and the descendants of former slaves were protected from formal disability by Iban rules against personal defamation. In suppressing slavery, the Brookes thus showed considerable insight, bringing it about largely through the inner workings of indigenous institutions. Similarly legal contests were only gradually eliminated, and not totally disallowed until alternative judicial procedures become generally accepted. Ordeals by fire and boiling water were disliked by the Iban themseves and were allowed to die a natural death. Legal contests involving the use of wooden weapons were seen as a dangerous convention by the Iban themselves and their suppression, again, coincided with the efforts of indigenous leaders to avert their use. For reasons which will become clear presently, diving contests proved to be more resilent and their gradual elimination took many years to achieve.' <sup id="cite_ref-539" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-539">[539]</a></sup> Expert feedback is needed on the possible involvement of Iban men in the Brooke military. We have considered colonial officials of the White Rajah administration to be 'state-level administrators'.

Although the office is not hereditary, it is not uncommon for the Penghulu   to be succeeded by his son or other relative.  This is especially true when a Penghulu   has been  conspicuously successful in office. Since profound knowledge of customary law and precedent, respected judgement, and wide acquaintance with the area administered are prerequisites, the son, son-in-law, or other close relative of a retiring Penghulu   is considered more likely to possess these than any other person. The tendency is, therefore, to look first for suitable candidates among the Penghulu's   immediate relatives, and only if these are found wanting, to seek elsewhere. Where a particular Penghulu   has lost public respect, a rival leader for the area may evolve, and he naturally becomes a strong candidate for the succession.' <sup id="cite_ref-540" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-540">[540]</a></sup></dd>

The Residents were urged to regard the Chief Secretary as a “coordinator,” and were further advised, “It was sometimes forgotten that these Divisions were not independent provinces; but that they all formed part of one united Sarawak; and when a policy was formed, orders were drawn up for the good of the whole state.”' <sup id="cite_ref-546" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-546">[546]</a></sup> 'Throughout the twenties, the following administrative innovations were introduced: the establishment of a formal Secretariat under the chief secretary in Kuching in 1923; the creation of a legal department in 1928, and between 1924 and 1926, municipal administration was established in Kuching and Sibu. This trend towards establishing and expanding the administrative bodies of Vyner Brooke's rule continued until 1929, when the effects of the world depression brought about a decline in revenue, and necessitated some retrenchment (ibid, p. 335).' <sup id="cite_ref-547" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-547">[547]</a></sup> The Brooke administration appointed officers dealing with military and other executive matters: 'About three years later, the Orang Kaya Pemancha Dana (Bayang) led a large force against the Undup Ibans, who had killed his brother, Angkum. Long remembered as the ‘great bala ’, this expedition completely defeated the Undups, many of whom were killed or taken captive. The survivors fled to Lingga and the Kapuas valley and settled in the Salimbau area. They did not return to their old homes until the time of Mr Brereton, the first officer of James Brooke to serve in the Batang Lupar region, only to discover that many of their lands and fruit trees had been occupied by Skrang Ibans. Likewise, the Ulu Undup had been settled by Ibans from the Kumpang branch of the Batang Ai.' <sup id="cite_ref-548" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-548">[548]</a></sup> The White Rajah administration also established courts dealing with civil matters such as land tenure and agriculture: 'The Brooke courts helped to reinforce the development of common farming land in the Second Division by adopting the principle that any land which had not been utilized for a specified period (including virgin land) reverted to the Government. For example, in Abang Embit [Page 20] and others v Penghulu Luta , an important case from the Paku, it was stated: “By published Gov't Orders, jungle of over 3 years growth on swamp and 7 years on hill land cannot be claimed by anyone, being the property of the State . . . [A]nyone wishing to fell same for the purpose of farming, may do so without the necessity for a permit” (Betong Court Book 1920:483). It is not clear to which Government Orders this statement refers, nor on what basis the 3 and 7 year limits were chosen (given that, for hill rice farming, 7 years is close to the absolute minimum fallow period required for sustained yield). Nevertheless, the use of these guidelines by the courts had the effect of strengthening the trend towards greater community control over the disposal of farming land, as in practice the designated “State land” differed little from the common land described by Phillips.' <sup id="cite_ref-549" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-549">[549]</a></sup> The Britannica provides a general description of these transformations under the second adn third Rajahs: 'Sir Charles Anthony Johnson Brooke (b. June 3, 1829, Berrow, Somerset, Eng.-d. May 17, 1917, Cirencester, Gloucestershire), who adopted the surname Brooke, became the second raja. The government of Charles Brooke has been described as a benevolent autocracy. Charles himself had spent much of his life among the Iban people of Sarawak, knew their language, and respected their beliefs and customs. He made extensive use of down-river Malay chiefs as administrators, and encouraged selective immigration of Chinese agriculturalists, while the dominant indigenous group, the Ibans, were employed in military service. In general, social and economic changes were limited in impact, shielding the inhabitants from both the benefits and the hardships of Western-style development.' <sup id="cite_ref-550" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-550">[550]</a></sup> 'Sir Charles Vyner de Windt Brooke (b. Sept. 26, 1874, London-d. May 9, 1963, London) was the third and last “white raja” (1917-46). He joined the Sarawak administration in 1897. After World War I, a boom in rubber and oil drew Sarawak further into the world economy, and for that and other reasons the state embarked on gradual modernization of its institutions. Public services were developed, a Sarawak penal code modelled on that of British India was introduced in 1924, and there was some extension of educational opportunity.' <sup id="cite_ref-551" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-551">[551]</a></sup> Initially, Iban men were excluded from the newly established administration: 'As the Brooke's administrative positions were not opened to Iban then, these men on the whole had to be content with becoming medical assistants or policemen, while the more adventurous ones left for Singapore and Malaya to join government services. After the war, while most groups in the country were recovering from the impact of the Japanese occupation, Paku Iban were in a better position to take advantage of the rubber boom of the mid 1940's and early 1950's.' <sup id="cite_ref-552" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-552">[552]</a></sup> Initially, the Brooke Raj administration sought to shield their Iban subjects from the adverse effects of 'modernization': 'Only an unusually strong and far sighted ruler would have seen any virtue in such a suggestion in the pre-war years. If there were some administrators who recognized the need for change, and whose efforts initiated the limited new programs already described after 1935, there was in general little sense of urgency abroad in the land. The Rajah might talk of eventual independence in introducing the new constitution, but self-government was not yet an idea which many people took seriously. There were some Ibans who were already anxious for  more education, but the majority were still living in a world of wholly local, traditional concerns. Because it was a state of smallholders, and owing partly to the oil field at Miri, Sarawak had weathered the world depression with only minor hardships and dislocations. In 1941 it was a comparatively comfortable, profoundly isolated corner of colonial Southeast Asia. A weekly steamer provided the only connection between Kuching and Singapore, and when it sailed up the Sarawak River, a cannon shot from the damp-stained parapets of the old fort boomed out to signal the great event. To most Europeans and Asians alike, the great centers of trade, learning and politics all seemed very far away. It was altogether easy for a Government to remain convinced that modernization was remote and irrelevant.' <sup id="cite_ref-553" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-553">[553]</a></sup> Accordingly, legal formalization was a protracted process: 'One of the first administrative acts of James Brooke was to accord official recognition to Malay written law, the Undang-Undang, shortly after establishing his government in 1842. For other indigenous groups, including the Iban, both James Brooke and his successor, Charles Brooke, extended similar recognition to those areas of adat constituting an accepted body of customary law. The policy pursued was basically one of non-interference with adat , except in cases involving physical violence, capital offences, or where traditional punishments were considered to be too harsh. This policy was dictated by practical necessity.' <sup id="cite_ref-554" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-554">[554]</a></sup> 'As Pringle (1970:173-75) notes the first Rajahs as men of strongly conservative instinct, steadfastly resisted efforts to systematize adat . A comprehensive code of law, based on the Indian Penal Code and Indian Criminal Procedure Code, was instituted in Sarawak only in the time of the Third [Page xvi] Rajah, and even then, its provisions were understood to apply only to offences not covered by customary rules of adat (Chater 1964:225).' <sup id="cite_ref-555" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-555">[555]</a></sup> Government officials and codes nevertheless sought to regulate Iban affairs, even though villages remained relatively autonomous in most matters: 'In ancient times before a large gawai was celebrated, such as the Gawai Burong and Gawai Antu, tubai fishing was carried out by the sponsoring longhouse and the catch salted and smoked in order to provide provisions for the feast. Today this method of fishing is regulated by the government and those who wish to engage in tubai fishing are expected to obtain prior permission from the local District Officer, although not all do so and individual violations are relatively frequent, and are highly destructive especially when insecticides or chemical poisons are used to kill fish, rather than the traditional tubai.' <sup id="cite_ref-556" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-556">[556]</a></sup> But the political and legal transformations of the colonial period had a profound impact on Iban institutions: 'The establishment of Brooke rule profoundly altered the structure of Iban society. Although the early policy of the Rajahs' government was to interfere as little as possible with indigenous adat , the creation of a centralized government and the elimination of blood feud and the gradual suppression of intertribal warfare had far-reaching effects on Iban political life and internal institutions of social control.' <sup id="cite_ref-557" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-557">[557]</a></sup> 'Despite the cherished belief of the first two Rajahs that their government preserved indigenous adat very largely as they found it, the development of administrative institutions that took place during their rule inevitably brought in its train profound changes. Most importantly, the Brookes introduced courts to the Iban and elevated and ultimately backed the judicial role of indigenous leaders. At the level of the longhouse, the traditional longhouse forum ( baum ) was restructed, as a court ( bechara ), as we shall see presently, and the longhouse headman was formally impowered through its use to settle disputes among his followers according to the principles of adat . In contrast to traditional society, his legal authority, and the binding force of adat itself were thus sanctioned by the state, government magistrates and police. Judicial decisions were enforceable and non-compliance or resort to force was strictly punishable. Indeed, many instances of such punishment occurred during the early years of Brooke rule. At the regional level, the status of regional leaders was similarly formalized in the creation of salaried Penghulus or native chiefs. These leaders assumed responsibility for their own bechara . Moreover, the Penghulu courts were not only granted special areas of jurisdiction, but were formally instituted as superior courts of appeal vis-a-vis the longhouse bechara . The basis on which adat operated as a mechanism of social control was thus profoundly altered.' <sup id="cite_ref-558" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-558">[558]</a></sup> 'In addition the Brookes moved gradually to eliminate some elements of adat that they considered bad, or in need of reform, and this process was continued by local officers through the years. Several aspects of Iban custom were ultimately proscribed, including the death penalty for incest, the right of an aggrieved husband to take the lives of an adulterous pair caught in flagrante delicto , rights of forceable seizure of property, and head hunting. In the case of adultery and forceable seizure, their proscription coincided with the efforts of Iban leaders themselves to avert recourse to these measures. Forced appropriation of property, called ngerampas , was an important element of traditional Iban law, and was only gradually suppressed through the substitution of effective means of judicial redress and the enforcement of monetary fines. Head hunting was even more important and was the focus of a complex religious cult bearing importantly on political leadership. Its suppression was also gradual, and indeed, during the early days of the Raj its practice was sometimes fostered as a punitive measure in extending control over recalcitrant tribal groups (cf. Wagner 1972). Two other institutions, though officially disapproved, were only gradually eliminated: slavery and legal contests. Both are described in some detail later in this study. As Pringle (1970:176) observes, the first two Rajahs liked to think of themselves as acting always within a traditional framework, even when they introduced changes in the customs of the country. But more than this, they often did, in fact, make use of traditional means in bringing about changes, one of the reasons why innovations made by the Brookes took such deep root in Sarawak. Resistance to the elimination of slavery came not so much from the Iban and other interior communities as from the Malay aristocracy. Although the Iban formerly kept slaves, whose status was theoretically heritable, slaves, in fact, usually enjoyed eventual emancipation. As a consequence, the Iban [Page xvii] preserved their basic egalitarianism and there never developed a significant slave class in Iban society. The final elimination of slavery was brought about, as Mr. Sandin indicates here, by means of the traditional Iban procedure of manumission through adoption ( betembang ) and the descendants of former slaves were protected from formal disability by Iban rules against personal defamation. In suppressing slavery, the Brookes thus showed considerable insight, bringing it about largely through the inner workings of indigenous institutions. Similarly legal contests were only gradually eliminated, and not totally disallowed until alternative judicial procedures become generally accepted. Ordeals by fire and boiling water were disliked by the Iban themseves and were allowed to die a natural death. Legal contests involving the use of wooden weapons were seen as a dangerous convention by the Iban themselves and their suppression, again, coincided with the efforts of indigenous leaders to avert their use. For reasons which will become clear presently, diving contests proved to be more resilent and their gradual elimination took many years to achieve.' <sup id="cite_ref-559" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-559">[559]</a></sup> Expert feedback is needed on the possible involvement of Iban men in the Brooke military. We have provisionally considered government chiefs as 'local-level administrators', even though they were not professional bureaucracts .

<p><b>♠ Multiple legal systems ♣ absent: 1841-1924 CE; present: 1925-1987 CE ♥</b> Initially, Iban customary law was not formalized: 'The legal rights and duties of every Iban is defined by the adat  , customary law. Among the laws affecting women are courtship, marriage, divorce, inheritance, and fines imposed in cases of infraction of the law. The fines are  payed in kati  ,  the value of which is based on brass or bronze, or in money; one kati   equals one dollar.' <sup id="cite_ref-561" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-561">[561]</a></sup> From the point of view of Iban adat, a longhouse community functions as a judicial unit: 'Although each of its component families is largely autonomous, the longhouse as a whole also functions as an important legal unit. In former times, every longhouse was, as we have noted, a politically sovereign community. Even now, the longhouse headman is looked upon as the chief guardian of community adat . He and other longhouse elders are expected to be well-versed in adat and to make known to their followers what the rules of adat require of them. Through informal meetings and judicial hearings they are also expected to enforce compliance with these rules and, following their stipulations, resolve disputes and redress compliants that arise within the community. In addition to this the longhouse as a whole is thought to possess a collective ritual status with regard to the spiritual world (Richards 1963:1-2).' <sup id="cite_ref-562" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-562">[562]</a></sup> Village headmen double as judges in local matters: 'When the Tuai Rumah learns that a serious offence, such as adultery, has been committed, he must sacrifice a chicken at once. The significance of this sacrifice is that it calls public attention to the offence and indicates that it is now under formal juridical review, and that the parties involved are no longer permitted to resort to private vengeance or self-help. He must act at once, as any delay might result in bloodshed, in which case the Tuai Rumah himself is liable to be fined. Traditionally an injured husband or wife had the right to retaliate in the case of adultery provided the adulterous couple were found in flogrante delicto   and the retaliation was carried out at once.' <sup id="cite_ref-563" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-563">[563]</a></sup> The judicial disputes presided over by village headmen do not constitute courts in the conventional sense of the term: 'The responsibility of the headman is to look after the affairs of his anak-biak , or followers, and, as a matter of course, he is expected to know every aspect of customary adat . If a dispute is referred to the headman, he will attempt to settle it with the help of the Tuai Umai or Tuai Burong (the farm leader or augury expert, respectively), and other village members who are well versed in customary adat . The Tuai Burong is an expert in various kinds of augury as well as being well versed in the genealogies and history of his community.' <sup id="cite_ref-564" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-564">[564]</a></sup> 'However, if a case cannot be settled informally, the tuai rumah   will then call a bechara  . A time is set and the two parties are notified, witnesses and members of every family in the community are informed, and, if necessary, messengers are dispatched to call people back from their farms. On the appointed evening, after the last meal of the day has been finished, the tuai rumah   spreads mats on his section of the gallery ( ruai  ). As people gather, the principal disputants are called forward and made to sit facing each other before the tuai rumah   and senior family heads. The tuai rumah   then calls upon the disputants to present their accounts, beginning first with the plaintiff. After each party has spoken, the testimony of witnesses ( saksi  ) is given and discussion is open to questions. Finally, after each side has stated its case, the hearing is opened to a general discussion which continues until the tuai rumah   is satisfied that the issues involved in the dispute are clear and that each party has had an opportunity to air its case fully. He will then call upon several of the elders present to express their opinions. In stating their views, the elders, who are recognized for their knowledge of adat  , are expected to cite precedent and draw parallels with previous judgments made in similar cases by former headmen and regional leaders.' <sup id="cite_ref-565" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-565">[565]</a></sup> The importance of face-to-face hearings varied regionally: 'Of even greater importance was the face-to-face hearing, the baum or betunga . Heppell (1975:8-9) sees the present day system of longhouse and Penghulu courts ( bechara ) as a “hybridization” of the traditional Iban baum and the introduced concept of the court. However, there appears to have been some difference here between major regional groups in the relative importance in the past of the baum as a judicial institution. In the Saribas local and regional leaders appear to have exercised greater authority than was generally true among Iban elsewhere. Consequently they seem to have enjoyed greater success in compelling disputants to accept negotiation in face-to-face hearings and the decisions made by the baum appear to have carried greater force traditionally than may have been the case elsewhere. Thus these hearings functioned as a nascent court system well before the arrival of the Brookes. However, Heppell is right when he points out (1975:227) that their nature was profoundly altered when decisions were backed by the formal authority of the state. Even so, the present day bechara is thoroughly indigenized and its workings are closely modelled on those of the traditional baum . More than this, the baum itself remains the chief means by which local conflicts are resolved.' <sup id="cite_ref-566" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-566">[566]</a></sup> Difficult cases were traditionally solved through ordeal: 'In particularly intractable cases resort was sometimes made in the past to legal contests or ordeals in which the outcome was believed to be supernaturally determined. These ordeals are also described in the chapter that follows and consisted of diving contests, cock fights, and the thrusting of hands into boiling water or into a fire. As a general rule, these procedures were used, as tests of innocence or ways of choosing between conflicting claims, particularly those of ownership, in situations where there exists no possible way to arrive at an infallible human judgment. Like betempoh , ordeals were conducted according to strict rules, were judged by impartial witnesses, and were supervised, and compliance with their outcome upheld, by regional leaders. Ordeals had the advantage of giving a clear-cut verdict which other forms of legal action might not be able to achieve because of a lack of evidence or demonstrable proof. Partly as a result, elimination of ordeals proved difficult, despite government prohibitions at various times, as the author notes here in connection with diving contests.' <sup id="cite_ref-567" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-567">[567]</a></sup> Protracted litigation was considered to be spiritually dangerous: 'The spiritual danger of unresolved contention may effect not only an individual through harm done to his soul, but may collectively endanger the whole longhouse to which he belongs. Dissension within a longhouse and failure to abide by the adat rumah , the “longhouse rules”, are believed to cause a state of angat , or spiritual “heat”. The community is described as “hot”, in a spiritual sense, and as a result its members are likely to suffer chronic illness, crop failures, famine and other misfortunes. In addition, the effectiveness of major rituals performed by the longhouse is thought to be lessened when a community is divided by internal quarrels. Thus traditionally, for example, before the major farming rites that preceed the initial clearing ( manggol ) of farms can be held, it is necessary first to clear away all outstanding litigation, particularly boundary disputes, so as to restore social cohesion within the community performing the rites, as a necessary pre-condition to their success. Thus longhouse members are compelled to settle their differences. In the case of major ritual festivals as well, all are opened by admonitions delivered by the community leaders present to all of those who have gathered enjoining them to put aside their past grievances, avoid quarrelling and breach of adat , for the success of the rituals they perform depend upon their preserving social harmony among themselves.' <sup id="cite_ref-568" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-568">[568]</a></sup> In the colonial period, the Brooke Raj administration introduced a formal penal code and courts: 'Sir Charles Vyner de Windt Brooke (b. Sept. 26, 1874, London-d. May 9, 1963, London) was the third and last “white raja” (1917-46). He joined the Sarawak administration in 1897. After World War I, a boom in rubber and oil drew Sarawak further into the world economy, and for that and other reasons the state embarked on gradual modernization of its institutions. Public services were developed, a Sarawak penal code modelled on that of British India was introduced in 1924, and there was some extension of educational opportunity.' <sup id="cite_ref-569" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-569">[569]</a></sup> 'By 1900, Brooke control of Sarawak was fairly well established. The government was gradually extending its efforts into such fields as agricultural research. As it established a system of courts and law, effort was made, whenever possible, to codify and preserve local customary law ( adat ). From this time on, the mainstream of Iban migration was much less violent, despite cultural ideals, and as we will see, much slower. However, government regulations notwithstanding, the migrations did not cease.' <sup id="cite_ref-570" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-570">[570]</a></sup> Pringle provides a general description of the process of legal transformation: 'Well before the advent of rubber restriction it had been necessary to regularize, to “bureaucratize,” the administration of Sarawak in many fields. The Government steadily expanded its scope during the postwar period until 1929, when the onset of world depression and the consequent decline in rubber prices brought a sharp decline in revenues and necessitated some retrenchment. A written criminal code based on the Indian Penal Code went into effect in 1923, and a Legal Department under a trained Chief Justice was created in 1928. The first State-wide land law was promulgated in 1920, to be replaced with far more complex legislation in 1930 and 1933. There were periodic examinations for Government officers after 1924, and municipal administration began in Kuching and Sibu during the following two years. Gradually more departments were created, and some technical specialists were posted to the outstations. With the appointment of a Chief Secretary in 1923, a small, formal Secretariat began to function in Kuching. The power of the Residents remained great, but a wholly new emphasis on administrative uniformity began to appear in some official pronouncements. The Rajah's address to the Council Negri in 1924 contained a passage that would have been unthinkable twenty years previously. The Residents were urged to regard the Chief Secretary as a “coordinator,” and were further advised, “It was sometimes forgotten that these Divisions were not independent provinces; but that they all formed part of one united Sarawak; and when a policy was formed, orders were drawn up for the good of the whole state.”' <sup id="cite_ref-571" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-571">[571]</a></sup> This had a profound impact on legal and judicial practice: 'Despite the cherished belief of the first two Rajahs that their government preserved indigenous adat very largely as they found it, the development of administrative institutions that took place during their rule inevitably brought in its train profound changes.

More fundamentally yet, the sovereignty of the local com [Page xx] munity in land matters, a basic feature of all indigenous tenure systems (Richards 1961:20-21,56), was replaced by a system in which land rights are ultimately maintained and administered by the state. Considerable litigation has resulted in adjusting indigenous adat to this principle, particularly where the land use patterns of shifting agriculturalists have not been fully under-stood.

</p><p><b>♠ Courts are supported by the state ♣ absent: 1841-1924 CE; present: 1925-1987 CE ♥</b> In the colonial period, the Brooke Raj administration introduced a formal penal code and courts: 'Sir Charles Vyner de Windt Brooke (b. Sept. 26, 1874, London-d. May 9, 1963, London) was the third and last “white raja” (1917-46). He joined the Sarawak administration in 1897. After World War I, a boom in rubber and oil drew Sarawak further into the world economy, and for that and other reasons the state embarked on gradual modernization of its institutions. Public services were developed, a Sarawak penal code modelled on that of British India was introduced in 1924, and there was some extension of educational opportunity.' <sup id="cite_ref-577" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-577">[577]</a></sup> 'By 1900, Brooke control of Sarawak was fairly well established. The government was gradually extending its efforts into such fields as agricultural research. As it established a system of courts and law, effort was made, whenever possible, to codify and preserve local customary law ( adat ). From this time on, the mainstream of Iban migration was much less violent, despite cultural ideals, and as we will see, much slower. However, government regulations notwithstanding, the migrations did not cease.' <sup id="cite_ref-578" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-578">[578]</a></sup> Pringle provides a general description of the process of legal transformation: 'Well before the advent of rubber restriction it had been necessary to regularize, to “bureaucratize,” the administration of Sarawak in many fields. The Government steadily expanded its scope during the postwar period until 1929, when the onset of world depression and the consequent decline in rubber prices brought a sharp decline in revenues and necessitated some retrenchment. A written criminal code based on the Indian Penal Code went into effect in 1923, and a Legal Department under a trained Chief Justice was created in 1928. The first State-wide land law was promulgated in 1920, to be replaced with far more complex legislation in 1930 and 1933. There were periodic examinations for Government officers after 1924, and municipal administration began in Kuching and Sibu during the following two years. Gradually more departments were created, and some technical specialists were posted to the outstations. With the appointment of a Chief Secretary in 1923, a small, formal Secretariat began to function in Kuching. The power of the Residents remained great, but a wholly new emphasis on administrative uniformity began to appear in some official pronouncements. The Rajah's address to the Council Negri in 1924 contained a passage that would have been unthinkable twenty years previously. The Residents were urged to regard the Chief Secretary as a “coordinator,” and were further advised, “It was sometimes forgotten that these Divisions were not independent provinces; but that they all formed part of one united Sarawak; and when a policy was formed, orders were drawn up for the good of the whole state.”' <sup id="cite_ref-579" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-579">[579]</a></sup> Iban communities occasionally made use of the colonial system of courts seeking verdicts in translocal matters: 'The Chinese-Iban relationship was not entirely harmonious.

<p><b>♠ Non-state judiciary ♣ present ♥</b> Initially, Iban customary law was not formalized: 'The legal rights and duties of every Iban is defined by the adat  , customary law. Among the laws affecting women are courtship, marriage, divorce, inheritance, and fines imposed in cases of infraction of the law. The fines are  payed in kati  ,  the value of which is based on brass or bronze, or in money; one kati   equals one dollar.' <sup id="cite_ref-581" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-581">[581]</a></sup> From the point of view of Iban adat, a longhouse community functions as a judicial unit: 'Although each of its component families is largely autonomous, the longhouse as a whole also functions as an important legal unit. In former times, every longhouse was, as we have noted, a politically sovereign community. Even now, the longhouse headman is looked upon as the chief guardian of community adat . He and other longhouse elders are expected to be well-versed in adat and to make known to their followers what the rules of adat require of them. Through informal meetings and judicial hearings they are also expected to enforce compliance with these rules and, following their stipulations, resolve disputes and redress compliants that arise within the community. In addition to this the longhouse as a whole is thought to possess a collective ritual status with regard to the spiritual world (Richards 1963:1-2).' <sup id="cite_ref-582" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-582">[582]</a></sup> Village headmen double as judges in local matters: 'When the Tuai Rumah learns that a serious offence, such as adultery, has been committed, he must sacrifice a chicken at once. The significance of this sacrifice is that it calls public attention to the offence and indicates that it is now under formal juridical review, and that the parties involved are no longer permitted to resort to private vengeance or self-help. He must act at once, as any delay might result in bloodshed, in which case the Tuai Rumah himself is liable to be fined. Traditionally an injured husband or wife had the right to retaliate in the case of adultery provided the adulterous couple were found in flogrante delicto   and the retaliation was carried out at once.' <sup id="cite_ref-583" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-583">[583]</a></sup> The judicial disputes presided over by village headmen do not constitute courts in the conventional sense of the term: 'The responsibility of the headman is to look after the affairs of his anak-biak , or followers, and, as a matter of course, he is expected to know every aspect of customary adat . If a dispute is referred to the headman, he will attempt to settle it with the help of the Tuai Umai or Tuai Burong (the farm leader or augury expert, respectively), and other village members who are well versed in customary adat . The Tuai Burong is an expert in various kinds of augury as well as being well versed in the genealogies and history of his community.' <sup id="cite_ref-584" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-584">[584]</a></sup> 'However, if a case cannot be settled informally, the tuai rumah   will then call a bechara  . A time is set and the two parties are notified, witnesses and members of every family in the community are informed, and, if necessary, messengers are dispatched to call people back from their farms. On the appointed evening, after the last meal of the day has been finished, the tuai rumah   spreads mats on his section of the gallery ( ruai  ). As people gather, the principal disputants are called forward and made to sit facing each other before the tuai rumah   and senior family heads. The tuai rumah   then calls upon the disputants to present their accounts, beginning first with the plaintiff. After each party has spoken, the testimony of witnesses ( saksi  ) is given and discussion is open to questions. Finally, after each side has stated its case, the hearing is opened to a general discussion which continues until the tuai rumah   is satisfied that the issues involved in the dispute are clear and that each party has had an opportunity to air its case fully. He will then call upon several of the elders present to express their opinions. In stating their views, the elders, who are recognized for their knowledge of adat  , are expected to cite precedent and draw parallels with previous judgments made in similar cases by former headmen and regional leaders.' <sup id="cite_ref-585" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-585">[585]</a></sup> The importance of face-to-face hearings varied regionally: 'Of even greater importance was the face-to-face hearing, the baum or betunga . Heppell (1975:8-9) sees the present day system of longhouse and Penghulu courts ( bechara ) as a “hybridization” of the traditional Iban baum and the introduced concept of the court. However, there appears to have been some difference here between major regional groups in the relative importance in the past of the baum as a judicial institution. In the Saribas local and regional leaders appear to have exercised greater authority than was generally true among Iban elsewhere. Consequently they seem to have enjoyed greater success in compelling disputants to accept negotiation in face-to-face hearings and the decisions made by the baum appear to have carried greater force traditionally than may have been the case elsewhere. Thus these hearings functioned as a nascent court system well before the arrival of the Brookes. However, Heppell is right when he points out (1975:227) that their nature was profoundly altered when decisions were backed by the formal authority of the state. Even so, the present day bechara is thoroughly indigenized and its workings are closely modelled on those of the traditional baum . More than this, the baum itself remains the chief means by which local conflicts are resolved.' <sup id="cite_ref-586" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-586">[586]</a></sup> Difficult cases were traditionally solved through ordeal: 'In particularly intractable cases resort was sometimes made in the past to legal contests or ordeals in which the outcome was believed to be supernaturally determined. These ordeals are also described in the chapter that follows and consisted of diving contests, cock fights, and the thrusting of hands into boiling water or into a fire. As a general rule, these procedures were used, as tests of innocence or ways of choosing between conflicting claims, particularly those of ownership, in situations where there exists no possible way to arrive at an infallible human judgment. Like betempoh , ordeals were conducted according to strict rules, were judged by impartial witnesses, and were supervised, and compliance with their outcome upheld, by regional leaders. Ordeals had the advantage of giving a clear-cut verdict which other forms of legal action might not be able to achieve because of a lack of evidence or demonstrable proof. Partly as a result, elimination of ordeals proved difficult, despite government prohibitions at various times, as the author notes here in connection with diving contests.' <sup id="cite_ref-587" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-587">[587]</a></sup> Protracted litigation was considered to be spiritually dangerous: 'The spiritual danger of unresolved contention may effect not only an individual through harm done to his soul, but may collectively endanger the whole longhouse to which he belongs. Dissension within a longhouse and failure to abide by the adat rumah , the “longhouse rules”, are believed to cause a state of angat , or spiritual “heat”. The community is described as “hot”, in a spiritual sense, and as a result its members are likely to suffer chronic illness, crop failures, famine and other misfortunes. In addition, the effectiveness of major rituals performed by the longhouse is thought to be lessened when a community is divided by internal quarrels. Thus traditionally, for example, before the major farming rites that preceed the initial clearing ( manggol ) of farms can be held, it is necessary first to clear away all outstanding litigation, particularly boundary disputes, so as to restore social cohesion within the community performing the rites, as a necessary pre-condition to their success. Thus longhouse members are compelled to settle their differences. In the case of major ritual festivals as well, all are opened by admonitions delivered by the community leaders present to all of those who have gathered enjoining them to put aside their past grievances, avoid quarrelling and breach of adat , for the success of the rituals they perform depend upon their preserving social harmony among themselves.' <sup id="cite_ref-588" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-588">[588]</a></sup> In the colonial period, the Brooke Raj administration introduced a formal penal code and courts: 'Sir Charles Vyner de Windt Brooke (b. Sept. 26, 1874, London-d. May 9, 1963, London) was the third and last “white raja” (1917-46). He joined the Sarawak administration in 1897. After World War I, a boom in rubber and oil drew Sarawak further into the world economy, and for that and other reasons the state embarked on gradual modernization of its institutions.

Most importantly, the Brookes introduced courts to the Iban and elevated and ultimately backed the judicial role of indigenous leaders. At the level of the longhouse, the traditional longhouse forum ( baum ) was restructed, as a court ( bechara ), as we shall see presently, and the longhouse headman was formally impowered through its use to settle disputes among his followers according to the principles of adat . In contrast to traditional society, his legal authority, and the binding force of adat itself were thus sanctioned by the state, government magistrates and police. Judicial decisions were enforceable and non-compliance or resort to force was strictly punishable. Indeed, many instances of such punishment occurred during the early years of Brooke rule. At the regional level, the status of regional leaders was similarly formalized in the creation of salaried Penghulus or native chiefs. These leaders assumed responsibility for their own bechara . Moreover, the Penghulu courts were not only granted special areas of jurisdiction, but were formally instituted as superior courts of appeal vis-a-vis the longhouse bechara . The basis on which adat operated as a mechanism of social control was thus profoundly altered.' <sup id="cite_ref-592" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-592">[592]</a></sup> 'In addition the Brookes moved gradually to eliminate some elements of adat that they considered bad, or in need of reform, and this process was continued by local officers through the years. Several aspects of Iban custom were ultimately proscribed, including the death penalty for incest, the right of an aggrieved husband to take the lives of an adulterous pair caught in flagrante delicto , rights of forceable seizure of property, and head hunting. In the case of adultery and forceable seizure, their proscription coincided with the efforts of Iban leaders themselves to avert recourse to these measures. Forced appropriation of property, called ngerampas , was an important element of traditional Iban law, and was only gradually suppressed through the substitution of effective means of judicial redress and the enforcement of monetary fines. Head hunting was even more important and was the focus of a complex religious cult bearing importantly on political leadership. Its suppression was also gradual, and indeed, during the early days of the Raj its practice was sometimes fostered as a punitive measure in extending control over recalcitrant tribal groups (cf. Wagner 1972). Two other institutions, though officially disapproved, were only gradually eliminated: slavery and legal contests. Both are described in some detail later in this study. As Pringle (1970:176) observes, the first two Rajahs liked to think of themselves as acting always within a traditional framework, even when they introduced changes in the customs of the country. But more than this, they often did, in fact, make use of traditional means in bringing about changes, one of the reasons why innovations made by the Brookes took such deep root in Sarawak. Resistance to the elimination of slavery came not so much from the Iban and other interior communities as from the Malay aristocracy. Although the Iban formerly kept slaves, whose status was theoretically heritable, slaves, in fact, usually enjoyed eventual emancipation. As a consequence, the Iban [Page xvii] preserved their basic egalitarianism and there never developed a significant slave class in Iban society. The final elimination of slavery was brought about, as Mr. Sandin indicates here, by means of the traditional Iban procedure of manumission through adoption ( betembang ) and the descendants of former slaves were protected from formal disability by Iban rules against personal defamation. In suppressing slavery, the Brookes thus showed considerable insight, bringing it about largely through the inner workings of indigenous institutions. Similarly legal contests were only gradually eliminated, and not totally disallowed until alternative judicial procedures become generally accepted. Ordeals by fire and boiling water were disliked by the Iban themseves and were allowed to die a natural death. Legal contests involving the use of wooden weapons were seen as a dangerous convention by the Iban themselves and their suppression, again, coincided with the efforts of indigenous leaders to avert their use. For reasons which will become clear presently, diving contests proved to be more resilent and their gradual elimination took many years to achieve.'  <sup id="cite_ref-593" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-593">[593]</a></sup> 'For the Iban, the most far-reaching effect of government legislation was restriction of the traditional system of acquiring rights to the use of land by jungle clearage. More fundamentally yet, the sovereignty of the local com [Page xx] munity in land matters, a basic feature of all indigenous tenure systems (Richards 1961:20-21,56), was replaced by a system in which land rights are ultimately maintained and administered by the state. Considerable litigation has resulted in adjusting indigenous adat to this principle, particularly where the land use patterns of shifting agriculturalists have not been fully under-stood. With the introduction of courts, the most frequent single area of litigation concerned land disputes, and at the present time, as well, land rights remain a major source of legal contention. Today Iban patterns of land holding are changing radically, with extensive, but as yet little studied social consequences.' <sup id="cite_ref-594" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-594">[594]</a></sup> Iban communities occasionally made use of the colonial system of courts seeking verdicts in translocal matters: 'The Chinese-Iban relationship was not entirely harmonious. The Chinese sometimes cheated their customers by using rigged scales to weigh jungle produce, but the Ibans retaliated by mixing earth and other trash into the gutta, and later they learned to practice similar tricks with cultivated rubber as well. The early outstation Chinese were often rough and roistering, the Ibans were hot tempered, and communal quarrels inevitably occurred. Ibans sometimes protested in the Simanggang court when rowdy shopkeepers pinched the exposed bosoms of their women. After one such incident the magistrate observed, “More than one complaint has been made by Dayaks of Chinamen behaving thus, and it is disgraceful that a woman cannot walk in the bazaar without being assaulted in an indecent manner by Chinamen.”' <sup id="cite_ref-595" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-595">[595]</a></sup> Legal standardization was pursued in the post-war period as well: 'The Iban have lived for generations in widely separated river valleys, and during their migrations they have come into close contact with other peoples.

<p><b>♠ Private property (land) ♣ absent ♥</b> Wealth was transmitted within longhouse families. eHRAF provides a general description of the kinship system: 'The fundamental unit of Iban society is the BILEK-family, a group of five or six persons defined by kinship and affinity. Depending upon negotiations at a couple's marriage, there is an almost even chance that their children will be born into the family of either the wife or the husband. Iban families are part of a widely ramifying kinship system which developed in response to Iban mobility. The SUKU JURU and KABAN BELAYAN correspond to the kindred. The former connotes kin ties originating with one's grandparents and includes persons to the degree of first cousin. The latter is any group of people who share rights of reciprocity with an Iban, and may include nonkin and even non-Iban. More inclusive groups include "the brotherhood" and "food-sharers", made up of distant kin who would be invited to one's festivals, or whose festivals an Iban would attend. Attachment is ambilateral and descent, ambilineal. Although some Iban are capable of reconstructing genealogies up to fifteen generations in depth, such reconstructions are selective and illustrate the Iban practice of "genealogizing" so as to establish ancestral ties with strangers.' <sup id="cite_ref-597" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-597">[597]</a></sup> 'Terms of reference are Eskimo and the terms of address, Hawaiian.' <sup id="cite_ref-598" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-598">[598]</a></sup> 'The BILEK-family is an autonomous unit, able to join with other units of a longhouse or to detach itself. Iban become members of a family through birth, adoption, marriage, or incorporation. The family is responsible for construction of its own unit, production of its own food, and management of its own affairs. In a sample of 1,051 families, 60 percent were comprised of parents and children, 40 percent included grandparents. The family is a kin-based, corporate group, holding in trust land, sacred rice, sacred charms, ritual formulas, taboos, and heirloom gongs and jars. Traditionally, one son or daughter has remained in the BILEK to ensure continuity over time. With urban migration, and mail service making possible postal remittances, an increasing number of parents have no adult child residing in the BILEK with them.' <sup id="cite_ref-599" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-599">[599]</a></sup> 'Rights to land are established by clearing and farming it, or by occupying it. Rights to the use of farmland are vested in the BILEK-family, and are held in perpetuity. These rights are maintained in the living memory of the residents of each longhouse. Boundaries are indicated by landforms or trees, or are marked by planting a row of bamboo. Except for the land overshadowed by the eaves of the longhouse, there is no land to which a community holds rights. With the introduction of surveys and titles to land in the early 1900s, Iban who lived closer to government centers obtained titles to their land, under which rights of individual families to land could be verified. As a result of increased population and the commercialization of land, some Iban have bought land for investment and speculation.' <sup id="cite_ref-600" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-600">[600]</a></sup> Both sons and daughters could inherit property: 'Male and female children share equally in rights to real and other property so long as they remain members of their natal BILEK. Children who move out of the BILEK at marriage or for any other reason receive a small portion of the family estate, and in theory relinquish all rights to family land. In fact, however, they retain the right to request land for farming at the annual meeting commencing the agricultural year.' <sup id="cite_ref-601" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-601">[601]</a></sup> 'Typically the ownership of the bilik apartment passes from parents to children. It is rare, however, for married siblings to share the same bilik , and so the apartment usually goes to just one child and his or her spouse. The remaining brothers and sisters will then marry into other bilik -families, or else establish a new bilik on their own. As will be evident from this last statement, residence patterns following marriage may be either virilocal or uxorilocal, with no particular preference being given for either one form of the other. Nor is there any formal principle - such as a rule of primogeniture - to decide which individual in a group of siblings gets to inherit the bilik in which they were born.' <sup id="cite_ref-602" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-602">[602]</a></sup> The Iban practiced both partible and nonpartible inheritance. Nonpartible property was transmitted within senior lineages attached to a continuous longhouse community: 'It is one of the axioms of Iban adat that the padi pun of a bilek is nonpartible. What then is the solution when a family sub-divides into two separate households? Briefly it is this: the senior section retains possession of the padi pun , while the seceding section is presented with one of the sangking , which is then elevated to become its padi pun . Here, clearly, we have a criterion of crucial importance for the study of the process of bilek family formation in Iban society. The senior section of a family is always definable by the fact that its padi pun was inherited as padi pun&nbsp;; while the padi pun of a seceding section is always inherited as sangking . By studying the inheritance of padi pun and sangking , therefore, it is possible to establish the main line of a family, and the various offshoots from it which have been brought about by partition.' <sup id="cite_ref-603" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-603">[603]</a></sup> 'A second non-partible object is the batu pemanggol , or ritual whetstone, which is the centre-piece of the rites that initiate the yearly farming cycle. Each bilek family possesses one of these stones which is cherished as a magical charm of most vital importance. A few Iban families, indeed, still have whetstones upon which human victims--captives taken in war--were once sacrificed. Such stones are called batu jaum , and are immeasurably valuable in Iban estimation. To divide a batu pemanggol would be to destroy it, and so, when partition takes place, it is always retained in the ancestral bilek . The seceding section, seeking an auspicious occasion, gathers a suitable-looking stone from the river bed. With a great show of solemnity, the new stone is touched on the old and then consecrated; tutelary spirits are invoked and offerings made, and finally a pig or cock is sacrificed and the blood allowed to run on the stone's surface. This stone then becomes the batu pemanggol of the seceding section.' <sup id="cite_ref-604" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-604">[604]</a></sup> 'When partition occurs then, the senior section of the family always retains the ancestral sacred rice and ritual whetstone. It may also happen that a bilek possesses some other unique magical or ritual object and, if this be the case, this too is retained by the senior section. With these exceptions, however, all the other property of the bilek is partible, and its apportionment is in accord with the relative size and the composition of the two sections resulting from the partition, following the general rule that siblings are parceners.' <sup id="cite_ref-605" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-605">[605]</a></sup> Residence was ambilocal: 'Now, as already remarked, among the Iban virilocal marriage and uxorilocal marriage are equally permissible, for in Iban culture there are no beliefs or values which result in either form of marriage being given any sort of special preference. However, in all cases of permanent marriage a definite choice between the two possibilities must in the end be made, for there is no longterm system of alternate residence. Often, it is true, a newly married couple will follow first one form of domicile and then the other before finally settling down. Marrying into another apartment means permanently departing from one's natal or adoptive bilek family, and it is almost always an occasion of stress and sorrow, particularly for the parents of the seceding son or daughter. Conflicts of interest very frequently arise, but if a marriage is to endure a compromise is always reached, and, sooner or later, the couple permanently adopt either virilocal or uxorilocal residence.' <sup id="cite_ref-606" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-606">[606]</a></sup> 'Marriage then, is an event of great moment, and particularly for the spouse who is leaving his (or her) natal apartment. Out-marriage, as we have seen, involves a radical change in jural status. It is also an occasion of psychological stress for the out-marrying spouse, since she (or he) is, in a sense, abandoning her natal family. Thus, one informant remarked that out-marriage ( ngugi ka orang ) meant ‘the casting away of one's father and mother’ (‘ itong udah buai apai indai ’). However, about 75% of Iban marriages are within the kindred, and so the stresses of out-marriage are often allayed by the fact that the out-marrying spouse is entering the household of fairly close kin.' <sup id="cite_ref-607" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-607">[607]</a></sup> Both patrifiliation and matrifiliation were common: 'Further, membership of his (or her) natal bilek confers upon a child inheritance rights over its properties and lands, and these rights are retained as long as the individual remains a resident member. Among the Iban, then, filiation is of a special kind, for it may be either to an individual's mother's bilek or to an individual's father's bilek, but not to both at the same time. Moreover, in practice, both types of filiation occur to an approximately equal extent. We are here confronted with a fundamental principle of the Iban family system.' <sup id="cite_ref-608" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-608">[608]</a></sup> Given the practice of ambilocal residence, inheritance rights were thus determined by residence rather than gender: 'However, should a man, upon marriage, permanently leave his natal bilek , he thereby relinquishes his parcenary rights over its estate, but acquires rights in the bilek into which he marries and settles down. The same applies to a woman who marries out of her natal apartment. An affine, then, possesses parcenary rights within the bilek of which he (or she) is a resident member.' <sup id="cite_ref-609" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-609">[609]</a></sup> '10. Within the bilek family siblings have equivalent rights; in other words, they are parceners or co-heirs. If a sibling marries out he thereby relinquishes rights of inheritance in his natal bilek family, but acquires rights in the bilek family into which he marries. This rule applies equally to men and to women. When divorce occurs an individual returns to his or her natal bilek family and resumes rights there; but widows and widowers do not return to their natal bilek families. Thus, an analysis of 52 cases showed that there were 26 widows or widowers living as members of their natal bilek families, and 26 who were living in bilek families of which they were members by right of marriage and local residence.' <sup id="cite_ref-610" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-610">[610]</a></sup> 'In accordance with custom, an Iban who marries into another longhouse and joins his or her spouse's family is no longer entitled to inherit ancestral lands left behind in the former longhouse area. If such an individual has no siblings living in his or her original family bilek , these lands are left under the guardianship of the Tuai Rumah, who has authority to allow other members of the longhouse to make use of them until one of the former owner's heirs can re-establish the ancestral bilek and reclaim its lands. Only lands which are officially titled can be claimed wherever the owner lives in the country; otherwise rights of use are contigent upon the family's continual residence within the longhouse where the land is located. This means that if an Iban migrates from one river to another, he will automatically loose rights to all of his temuda lands which have no official title. If he has no sibling living in the village these lands will become available for use by the people of the longhouse he has left and are subject to reapportionment by the Tuai Rumah.' <sup id="cite_ref-611" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-611">[611]</a></sup> While dispersal did not necessarily entail forfeiture of inheritance rights in the traditional system, this aspect was legally prescribed in the colonial period: 'Traditionally it was by no means the general rule that an emigrant household would forfeit its land rights. The Simanggang Resident, H. F. Deshon, reported in 1882: It has hitherto been the custom of Rembas Dyaks who have moved into the Krian to still claim their old farming grounds in the Rembas river however distant they may be, and they have steadily refused to allow people living on the land and in the vicinity to farm these lands even after a lapse of ten years and more from the time of their removal (cited in Roth 1896[1]:420). However, Brooke Low, writing in the 1880s, observed: The tenure . . . has been modified within late years in view of the increasing demand for accomodation, and it is now generally understood that when the proprietor chooses to leave the district and remove into a distant country he forfeits, by so doing, all title to the ground and can no longer exact rent (in Roth 1896[1]:420). This development was formalized by a Government Order issued in 1899 which provided that: “Any Dyak removing from a river or district may not claim, sell, or transfer any farming ground in such river or district, nor may he prevent others farming thereon, unless he holds such land under a grant” (cited in Porter 1967:12, 13). The Order also dealt with fruit trees which had “become common property of the inhabitants of a long house or village,” stating that they were “in no cases to be sold or in any way transferred or claimed by individuals leaving such houses or villages.” The forfeiture of a household's land rights did not automatically give rise to a pool of common land. In the pioneer context studied by Freeman, abandoned secondary forest, whether previously claimed by a single household or by an entire community, “is treated as though it [Page 19] were primary forest, and the first person to re-fell it establishes presumptive rights over its use in future years” (1970:148, 149). However, in the established phase in the Saribas, the absence of primary forest and the increasing scarcity of secondary forest made any abandoned land extremely valuable to all households in the community. Hence in the interests of community solidarity it came to be placed under the headman's authority for the shared use of all community members.' <sup id="cite_ref-612" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-612">[612]</a></sup> Both sons and daughters could initiate partition and out-marriage: '2. The bilek , with the exception of certain ritual objects, is a partible estate; and a sibling who remains in his (or her) natal bilek has the right to claim a proportionate share of the family inheritance, and set up a separate domestic unit. This is a common happening. Indeed, when two elementary families emerge [Page 8] within a bilek, partition always follows in due course. This precludes the development of joint or extended families, and nowhere in Sarawak did I encounter siblings--married and having adult children of their own--who were still living together as members of the same bilek. Again, my observations showed that partition always involves the break-up of a sibling group. When partition occurs one sibling and his (or her) family secedes from the ancestral bilek to found a new and independent household. Furthermore, this sibling is just as likely to be a man as a woman; thus, an analysis of 34 cases of partition showed that 17 founders of seceding families were males, while 17 were females. A fundamental feature of partition is that each part--after partition has occurred--is an autonomous unit in its own right, and not merely a constituent part of some wider corporate group. The partition of bilek families as it occurs in Iban society is thus a different process from segmentation as it occurs in societies based on unilineal principles.' <sup id="cite_ref-613" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-613">[613]</a></sup> Property could also be transferred to adopted children: 'If a man and his wife, after many years of marriage, are certain that they will have no child of their own, they are likely to adopt a child in order that he or she may inherit their property after they have passed away and perpetuate their bilek family. Most couples prefer to adopt a child of their closest relatives, such as a nephew or a niece. However, if their close relatives have no child whom they are willing or able to give in adoption, the couple may adopt the child of a distant cousin or an unrelated friend.' <sup id="cite_ref-614" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-614">[614]</a></sup> 'In order to make an adoption legal, the adopters must hold a formal ceremony called the Gawai Biru-iru, in which they publicly announce in the presences of guests, including at least two Tuai Rumah or a Penghulu, and their relatives who, otherwise, would inherit their property if they were to die childless, that the child is hereby adopted to be their own. By this proclamation the child is acknowledged as their legal heir with identical rights of inheritance, as if he or she were the couple's sole natural child. In future, if any argument arises over the disposal of the couple's property, the [Page 79] Tuai Rumah or Penghulu who were present at the Gawai Biru-iru, are responsible for safeguarding the rights of the adopted child in court. These rights, are identical whether the child is male or female.' <sup id="cite_ref-615" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-615">[615]</a></sup> 'We have now seen that the Iban bilek family is an autonomous, corporate group, all the resident members of which--natal, adopted and affinal--hold rights over its estate. As the Iban themselves put it: ‘Whoever stands by the bilek (i.e. remains a resident member), he (or she) possesses the belongings, possesses the valuables’ (‘ Sapa tan ka bilek, iya empu utai, empu keresa ’). This was an utterance made at Rumah Nyala in 1950 during the formal discussion of the conditions which were to govern the adoption of an infant boy, and it was made by one of the men of the adopting family. It was a public pledge that as long as the adopted child elected to remain resident in their apartment he would possess identical rights of inheritance with the other members of the family. This fundamental principle of inheritance was reiterated many times during the course of the discussion--as it always is on such occasions. finally, to clinch the matter, another of the adopting party put it even more trenclantly by abruptly asserting: ‘Whoever stands by the bilek , even be he a Kayan, a Bukitan, a Punan, an Ukit, it matters not, he is the one who inherits the property’ (‘ Sapa tan ka bilek, Kayan, Pakatan, Punan, Ukit, enda iboh, tya empu keresa ’) Now, the Kayans, the Bukitans, the Punans and the Ukits are neighbouring tribes of the Rejang headwaters; all are alien, and the Kayans and Ukits, in particular, are the bitter traditional enemies of the Iban. When this is realized, the force of the utterance just quoted will be appreciated. It affirms that even an enemy and an alien, should he come to live in an Iban bilek , would, if he maintained his residence, hold equal rights of inheritance with the other members of the family. For Iban ears there could be no more emphatic avowal than this of the principle we have been considering.' <sup id="cite_ref-616" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-616">[616]</a></sup> In-marrying affines of either sex became full members of their spouse's longhouse community: 'The position of the natal members of a bilek family in regard to inheritance is clear, for their prerogative depends on direct descent. Furthermore, as we have seen, an adopted child has conferred upon him exactly the same rights. But what of an affine whose membership dates only from the time of his (or her) marriage? By way of explanation let us consider the case of a man who marries out of his natal bilek . When such a man decides upon uxorilocal residence, and when, in the course of time, it becomes evident to all concerned that this marriage will be a lasting one, he receives from his natal bilek family a form of personal inheritance called pemai . The amount of pemai given to an out-marrying member varies considerably from case to case, for it depends largely on the degree to which the other senior members of the bilek family approve of the marriage that has been contracted. Cases do occur in which [Page 36] no pemai at all is given, while at the other extreme, planned marriages between members of wealthy families are often marked by a show of ostentation. Very commonly the pemai consists of a Chinese jar or a bronze gong, and of various smaller articles such as plates and bowls.' <sup id="cite_ref-617" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-617">[617]</a></sup> 'The giving of this pemai is an event of signal importance, for it constitutes the final fulfilling of a man's rights of inheritance as far as his natal bilek is concerned, and it further represents the formal termination of membership of his natal (or adoptive) bilek family. Henceforward, he is a full member of his wife's bilek . His pemai , or personal inheritance, becomes part of the estate of his wife's apartment, and all his energies are now devoted to the welfare of this new family; any valuables he may acquire (as, for example, on a bejalai , or journey) are the property-- meum et tuum --of this group. In other words, when a man marries out of his own apartment and into another, he has conferred upon him full jural membership of a new corporate group, with all its attendant privileges and obligations. And the same, of course, applies to a woman.' <sup id="cite_ref-618" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-618">[618]</a></sup> Freeman provides a general summary of the ineritance system: 'Having briefly described the composition of the bilek family and the way in which its members are recruited, we may turn to an examination of the principles governing inheritance, for these, under the Iban system of filiation, are of particular significance. Let us begin by considering the position of the natal and adopted members of the family. As has already been stressed, children become members by right of birth of either their father's or their mother's bilek --but it is always one or the other. Thus, the children of a man practising uxorilocal residence are the members of their mother's natal bilek , and of this local group alone. They have no rights of inheritance within their father's natal bilek, of which they are not resident members. Similarly, the children of a woman practising virilocal residence are members of their father's local group, and have no rights of inheritance in their mother's natal bilek . Adopted children are members of the bilek into which they have been adopted, and of this bilek only.' <sup id="cite_ref-619" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-619">[619]</a></sup> 'The general rule for both natural and adopted children is this: as long as they remain resident members of their own bilek family, sons and daughters possess full and equal rights of inheritance over the family estate. In other words, within a bilek siblings are parceners or co-heirs. There is thus recognition of neither primogeniture nor ultimogeniture, and no differentiation [Page 32] between the sexes, nor between natural and adopted children. Instead, in matters of inheritance, siblings are equals. Their equivalence is well expressed in the phrase: ‘ menyadi tampong pala ’ which the Iban use to describe them. These words, which have the literal meaning: ‘siblings whose heads are joined’, symbolize aptly the kind of relationship in which siblings stand. Another much-used phrase is: ‘ menyadi begulai pemai ’ meaning ‘siblings of common inheritance’.' <sup id="cite_ref-620" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-620">[620]</a></sup> 'As long then, as an individual remains resident in a bilek , he (or she) is one of the group in which ownership and inheritance are vested. Indeed, it is the family as a whole that holds common tenure of the conglomeration of property and other rights which constitute ‘the bilek ’. In other words, the Iban bilek family is a corporation aggregate. Thus, no one of its members holds the right [Page 33] to disinherit another. In life the members of a bilek are parceners, and even in death each member is entitled to his share of the family estate--that last inheritance which he carries with him to the after-world. An elder looks to his children and to his grandchildren within the bilek family to care for him in his old age, and to perform conscientiously the elaborate mortuary rites which must accompany his passing from this world to the next. To the Iban these mortuary rites and the furnishing of grave goods are matters of supreme importance, and all the senior surviving members of the bilek family are expected to join in their faithful performance. As the Iban themselves phrase it: ‘As the mortuary rites are equally performed, so equally is the bilek estate inherited’ (‘ Enti blah ngelumbong, blah empu utai ’).' <sup id="cite_ref-621" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-621">[621]</a></sup> The above information indicates that private property in land did not exist traditionally as land was attached to longhouse communities rather than individuals. The Brooke Raj was initially reluctant to more clearly regulate land ownership: 'There was a general tendency on the part of the Brooke courts to resist the demand from longhouse headmen for a clear demarcation of territorial boundaries, stemming in part from the attitudes of Charles Brooke himself. For example in 1889 Brooke settled a case ( Apai Jilani v Buya ) concerning land along the Graji stream, a tributary of the Padeh (Betong Court Book 1889:473). The land on the left bank of the Graji had already been divided in three (meaning a permanent [Page 13] division among three longhouses) but the land on the right bank had not yet been settled. The Rajah ordered: “No distinct division of land but they are to agree amongst themselves and the land to be as it were common.” The rationale for this tendency to maintain areas of disputed priority as common land between communities was apparently that it prevented one community excluding another from land for which the latter had a genuine need. It was a prime emphasis of Brooke land policy to prevent anyone from detaining land which others could use more productively. This policy was in keeping with the views of many regional leaders, who saw the importance of providing equal access to land at the inter-community level.' <sup id="cite_ref-622" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-622">[622]</a></sup> 'However, the maintenance of shared territorial rights proved difficult in practice, indicating that the transaction costs involved in this type of arrangement were high. Whereas it was a relatively simple matter for those within one longhouse community to “agree amongst themselves” on the size and location of farms each year, for two or more communities to agree year by year on the use of common territory was not so straightforward. The difficulties were compounded when one of the communities experienced an influx of households, thereby obtaining greater use of the shared land, and this was a frequent cause of dispute. The Brooke courts muddled through this situation, laying down boundaries in some cases and establishing zones of common land in others, but the trend towards exclusive territorial rights proved inexorable and in the post-war period the convention of two or more communities sharing access to a tract of land is rarely found. Today territorial rights are still highly valued and hotly contested, with boundary disputes occasionally leading to outbreaks of violence.' <sup id="cite_ref-623" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-623">[623]</a></sup> But longhouse territory became more clearly defined in the colonial period: 'The widespread adoption of rubber by the Saribas Iban from around 1910 helped to consolidate the notion of an exclusive longhouse territory. Firstly it had the effect of curtailing the semi-migratory tendencies which had continued during the 19th century. Sandin, reflecting on the importance of rubber, illipenut, and other perennial crops in the Saribas, observed: These trees, and accumulated family wealth, are reasons why the people are not attracted to other places. While some Iban frequently migrate, or pindah , moving always from place to place, that is not the way of the Saribas people. Our ancestors were foresightful. They saw the importance of settling properly in one place. Also there is enough land here, enough for rubber and rice (cited in Sather 1981:129,130). With the adoption of pepper in the post-war period the attachment to the longhouse territory was further increased. Despite Sandin's comment, in many communities there was not enough land for both rubber and rice, and in the 1950s and 1960s individual households had to rent wet rice land in downriver locations a day's journey or more from the longhouse. This tendency towards spatial diversification was reversed when pepper, a land-saving crop, became more profitable in the early [Page 14] 1970s and attracted farmers back to their upriver territories.' <sup id="cite_ref-624" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-624">[624]</a></sup> 'Secondly, planting rubber, as well as providing a strong incentive to remain in one clearly defined location, also made possible the more precise identification of territorial claims. In cases where the boundary between two communities was disputed it often occurred that all the land along the disputed part of the boundary would be planted with rubber, even if it was too far from the longhouse to be economically tapped. This had the effect of more clearly identifying a community's territorial rights, as the act of planting rubber was a recent and easily remembered event compared with the felling of the original forest, and to cut down someone's rubber was a considerably more blatant offence than merely encroaching on secondary forest.' <sup id="cite_ref-625" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-625">[625]</a></sup> However, the longhouse community largely remained the major property-holding institution of Iban society even in the post-war period: 'In the post-war period the Sarawak Government has introduced a number of planting schemes to assist smallholders in establishing cash crops, beginning with the Rubber Planting Scheme in 1956. These schemes involve the provision of planting material, fertilizer, equipment, and a cash grant to approved individuals. In recent years, however, the Department of Agriculture (which administers the schemes) has shifted its emphasis from dealing with only some individuals in a longhouse to treating the longhouse community itself as the focus of its extension program. This is in recognition that the interactions among households which gave rise to community property rights under a system of shifting cultivation also favour “community land development” in the case of perennial cash crops.' <sup id="cite_ref-626" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-626">[626]</a></sup> 'The longhouse territory has also proved a suitable basis for the recent introduction of oil palm, a more capital intensive crop exhibiting economies of scale in post-harvest operations and hence usually requiring an estate mode of management to be viable. A significant feature of the Iban oil palm estate in the upper Lupar, administered by the Sarawak Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority (SALCRA), is that the land for the scheme was acquired on a community basis, with participating longhouses each arriving at a group decision to contribute a portion of the longhouse territory. Moreover the estate is sub-divided into sectors belonging to individual communities, which have first right to employment in their own sector and can organize the way in which work will be distributed among community members. In some cases the whole community will work on the oil palm together, sharing the wages equally among all participants; in others, smaller groups will carry out the work. However in all cases the oil palm is treated as a common-property resource whose exploitation is subject to institutional regulation by the community.' <sup id="cite_ref-627" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-627">[627]</a></sup> 'The incorporation of the longhouse community as the basic land-holding unit within a larger estate has been a major innovation by SALCRA which has reduced the transaction costs involved both in consolidating the land for planting and in the ongoing management of the estate. This institutional arrangement shows the viability of community property rights even in large-scale land development projects. Current land policy, however, appears to ignore this experience, calling as it does for the consolidation of land ownership into large private estates of several thousand hectares and for the [Page 15] regrouping of longhouse communities into centralized townships. The vehicle for this policy is the recently constituted Land Custody and Development Authority, which to date has made little progress in rural land development, arguably because it has underestimated the opportunity costs associated with dismantling the existing system of community property rights, not to mention the social and cultural dislocation likely to result from the changes envisaged.' <sup id="cite_ref-628" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-628">[628]</a></sup> 'Summarizing the development of community property rights, it is clear that from the outset of the pioneer phase the Iban sought to convert a situation of open access into one of common or community property in which the “optimal commons” was the territory controlled by a single longhouse community. Initially community rights were vaguely defined because of the low scarcity value of primary forest and high exclusion costs. However the increased value of secondary forest in the established phase, coupled with a lowering in exclusion costs (brought about in part by the pacification of the Saribas and surrounding areas and the setting up of “native courts”), led to a much more precise definition of exclusive community property rights. The advent of perennial cash crops continued this trend by providing more incentive to remain in one location as well as a new means of identifying community claims to land. The successful recognition of community property rights within both agricultural extension programs and an estate-type development indicates the continued viability of this institutional form.' <sup id="cite_ref-629" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-629">[629]</a></sup> The adoption of cash crops caused some changes in the 'native' property system: 'The adoption of perennial cash crops was a major factor affecting the evolution of land tenure. Like fruit trees, these crops have a long productive life. Consequently the “cropping period”, during which exclusive household rights of usufruct had always been recognized, lasted many years or even decades. Moreover the area planted was often extensive, so that exclusive rights to the trees (which was all fruit-tree tenure entailed) in effect conferred exclusive control over the tract of land on which the trees were planted. This was especially the case with rubber, with some Saribas farmers establishing quite large plantations. Even the smallest rubber holding occupied the equivalent area of one hill rice clearing and so reduced the fallow period by one year.' <sup id="cite_ref-630" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-630">[630]</a></sup> 'Where exclusive household rights to farming land were still recognized it was a matter of individual choice to use some of this land to plant rubber, the household concerned having to weigh the benefits of rubber against the cost of having less fallow land for [Page 22] padi. However, the use of common land for rubber required careful arrangements to avoid disputes. Planting rubber effectively converted common land to privately held land and so any household not involved in rubber planting stood to lose. Moreover, there was the possibility that a household might use rubber planting simply as a device to bring more land under its exclusive control. This led to the principle that as far as possible all the co-owners of a tract of land should be included in the allocation of plots for rubber and that these should be roughly equal in size. However the risk remained that one of the co-owners would not agree to the proposed use of the land and so dispute the legitimacy of the allocation.' <sup id="cite_ref-631" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-631">[631]</a></sup> 'The permanency of claims over land planted to cash crops has varied with the crop in question. In the case of the early coffee plantations, once these were abandoned and became overgrown they were treated as any other fallow land, and in communities with shared rights of access to such land the individual household's exclusive claim was forfeited. For example, in Ngumbang and Guntor v Saban the plaintiffs accused Saban of clearing a hill which had been the site of Guntor's coffee garden (Betong Court Book 1915:417). The Court stated [Page 23] that “. . . the coffee garden, originally planted up by Guntor has been abandoned by him [and] is now overgrown with ten or more years growth of jungle. According to custom here, he has therefore no right to restrain others from using the land.” 6 Similarly when pepper became an important crop in the post-war period some communities exercised a reversionary right over the land when the pepper itself was abandoned (though in general the small size of pepper gardens and the run-down condition of the soil gave little incentive to reclaim the land).' <sup id="cite_ref-632" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-632">[632]</a></sup> 'However, in the case of rubber a household's exclusive rights have been allowed to exist indefinitely, even when the household leaves the community. The indefinite duration of these rights is attributable in part to the ability of rubber to survive even when not maintained or utilized, and to the lingering memory of the rubber booms when many Iban became rich. The household's claim has been strengthened, however, by the imposition of a colonial land tenure system which from the beginning of the rubber era has issued incipient titles in the form of “permits to plant” or “occupation tickets”, made out to individuals (Porter 1967). It is this factor which has overridden the principle established in the nineteenth century that on emigration a household should forfeit all claim to its farmland and tree crops. Hence the combination of a profitable and durable export crop and an institutional environment attuned to foreign principles of private property reversed the trend towards community control of land use which had emerged in relation to rice land. It has only been in recent years, with the greatly increased demand for land, that some communities have taken unilateral action to resume control over rubber land owned by emigrants, for example in the impoverished Lemanak region, where rubber trees belonging to emigrants have been cut down in order to release land for a community cocoa scheme.' <sup id="cite_ref-633" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-633">[633]</a></sup> 'Summarizing, community regulation of land use has stressed exclusive household property rights and shared property rights in different degrees at different stages. The recognition of exclusive household rights of use and disposal in the pioneer phase, in a situation where land as such was abundant, was related to the high value placed on newly-cleared land (and on mature tree crops) and to the relative ease of negotiating and enforcing individual claims within the solidary longhouse community. The institution of the longhouse meeting ( aum ) and the principle of making all dealings clear ( terang ) to the whole community ensured that disputes over access to land were minimized. A situation which could have resulted in a scramble for the use of productive virgin land was instead carefully regulated in the long-term interests of the community. In the established phase, with uncleared and recently cleared land no longer available and mature secondary forest increasingly scarce, it became important to emphasize shared property rights to ensure an efficient and equitable pattern of land use, and hence to safeguard community [Page 24] solidarity. This involved the assertion of reversionary rights over the land and tree crops of emigrant households, the wider sharing of use rights among all the descendants of the first feller, and in many cases the pooling of all rights of disposal to form a single tract of annually reallocated farming land. Once again the longhouse meeting was the crucial institution facilitating the observance of collectively derived land-use decisions. The onset of the commercial phase required the recognition of exclusive household rights over rubber and other cash crops if there was to be any incentive to plant. However collective interests continued to be paramount in that all households had to be given a say in the allocation of land for rubber and in general gardens were of roughly equivalent size. The indefinite tenure accorded to owners of rubber gardens was a result of its durability as a crop and the imposition of alien principles of land administration. That this went against the general direction of local-level institutional change can be seen in the recent example of a community asserting reversionary rights over the land of absentee rubber owners.' <sup id="cite_ref-634" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-634">[634]</a></sup>

Depending upon negotiations at a couple's marriage, there is an almost even chance that their children will be born into the family of either the wife or the husband. Iban families are part of a widely ramifying kinship system which developed in response to Iban mobility. The SUKU JURU and KABAN BELAYAN correspond to the kindred. The former connotes kin ties originating with one's grandparents and includes persons to the degree of first cousin. The latter is any group of people who share rights of reciprocity with an Iban, and may include nonkin and even non-Iban. More inclusive groups include "the brotherhood" and "food-sharers", made up of distant kin who would be invited to one's festivals, or whose festivals an Iban would attend. Attachment is ambilateral and descent, ambilineal. Although some Iban are capable of reconstructing genealogies up to fifteen generations in depth, such reconstructions are selective and illustrate the Iban practice of "genealogizing" so as to establish ancestral ties with strangers.' <sup id="cite_ref-635" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-635">[635]</a></sup> 'Terms of reference are Eskimo and the terms of address, Hawaiian.' <sup id="cite_ref-636" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-636">[636]</a></sup> 'The BILEK-family is an autonomous unit, able to join with other units of a longhouse or to detach itself. Iban become members of a family through birth, adoption, marriage, or incorporation. The family is responsible for construction of its own unit, production of its own food, and management of its own affairs. In a sample of 1,051 families, 60 percent were comprised of parents and children, 40 percent included grandparents. The family is a kin-based, corporate group, holding in trust land, sacred rice, sacred charms, ritual formulas, taboos, and heirloom gongs and jars. Traditionally, one son or daughter has remained in the BILEK to ensure continuity over time. With urban migration, and mail service making possible postal remittances, an increasing number of parents have no adult child residing in the BILEK with them.' <sup id="cite_ref-637" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-637">[637]</a></sup> 'Rights to land are established by clearing and farming it, or by occupying it. Rights to the use of farmland are vested in the BILEK-family, and are held in perpetuity. These rights are maintained in the living memory of the residents of each longhouse. Boundaries are indicated by landforms or trees, or are marked by planting a row of bamboo. Except for the land overshadowed by the eaves of the longhouse, there is no land to which a community holds rights. With the introduction of surveys and titles to land in the early 1900s, Iban who lived closer to government centers obtained titles to their land, under which rights of individual families to land could be verified. As a result of increased population and the commercialization of land, some Iban have bought land for investment and speculation.' <sup id="cite_ref-638" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-638">[638]</a></sup> Both sons and daughters could inherit property: 'Male and female children share equally in rights to real and other property so long as they remain members of their natal BILEK. Children who move out of the BILEK at marriage or for any other reason receive a small portion of the family estate, and in theory relinquish all rights to family land. In fact, however, they retain the right to request land for farming at the annual meeting commencing the agricultural year.' <sup id="cite_ref-639" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-639">[639]</a></sup> 'Typically the ownership of the bilik apartment passes from parents to children. It is rare, however, for married siblings to share the same bilik , and so the apartment usually goes to just one child and his or her spouse. The remaining brothers and sisters will then marry into other bilik -families, or else establish a new bilik on their own. As will be evident from this last statement, residence patterns following marriage may be either virilocal or uxorilocal, with no particular preference being given for either one form of the other. Nor is there any formal principle - such as a rule of primogeniture - to decide which individual in a group of siblings gets to inherit the bilik in which they were born.' <sup id="cite_ref-640" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-640">[640]</a></sup> The Iban practiced both partible and nonpartible inheritance. Nonpartible property was transmitted within senior lineages attached to a continuous longhouse community: 'It is one of the axioms of Iban adat that the padi pun of a bilek is nonpartible. What then is the solution when a family sub-divides into two separate households? Briefly it is this: the senior section retains possession of the padi pun , while the seceding section is presented with one of the sangking , which is then elevated to become its padi pun . Here, clearly, we have a criterion of crucial importance for the study of the process of bilek family formation in Iban society. The senior section of a family is always definable by the fact that its padi pun was inherited as padi pun&nbsp;; while the padi pun of a seceding section is always inherited as sangking . By studying the inheritance of padi pun and sangking , therefore, it is possible to establish the main line of a family, and the various offshoots from it which have been brought about by partition.' <sup id="cite_ref-641" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-641">[641]</a></sup> 'A second non-partible object is the batu pemanggol , or ritual whetstone, which is the centre-piece of the rites that initiate the yearly farming cycle. Each bilek family possesses one of these stones which is cherished as a magical charm of most vital importance. A few Iban families, indeed, still have whetstones upon which human victims--captives taken in war--were once sacrificed. Such stones are called batu jaum , and are immeasurably valuable in Iban estimation. To divide a batu pemanggol would be to destroy it, and so, when partition takes place, it is always retained in the ancestral bilek . The seceding section, seeking an auspicious occasion, gathers a suitable-looking stone from the river bed. With a great show of solemnity, the new stone is touched on the old and then consecrated; tutelary spirits are invoked and offerings made, and finally a pig or cock is sacrificed and the blood allowed to run on the stone's surface. This stone then becomes the batu pemanggol of the seceding section.' <sup id="cite_ref-642" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-642">[642]</a></sup> 'When partition occurs then, the senior section of the family always retains the ancestral sacred rice and ritual whetstone. It may also happen that a bilek possesses some other unique magical or ritual object and, if this be the case, this too is retained by the senior section. With these exceptions, however, all the other property of the bilek is partible, and its apportionment is in accord with the relative size and the composition of the two sections resulting from the partition, following the general rule that siblings are parceners.' <sup id="cite_ref-643" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-643">[643]</a></sup> Residence was ambilocal: 'Now, as already remarked, among the Iban virilocal marriage and uxorilocal marriage are equally permissible, for in Iban culture there are no beliefs or values which result in either form of marriage being given any sort of special preference. However, in all cases of permanent marriage a definite choice between the two possibilities must in the end be made, for there is no longterm system of alternate residence. Often, it is true, a newly married couple will follow first one form of domicile and then the other before finally settling down. Marrying into another apartment means permanently departing from one's natal or adoptive bilek family, and it is almost always an occasion of stress and sorrow, particularly for the parents of the seceding son or daughter. Conflicts of interest very frequently arise, but if a marriage is to endure a compromise is always reached, and, sooner or later, the couple permanently adopt either virilocal or uxorilocal residence.' <sup id="cite_ref-644" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-644">[644]</a></sup> 'Marriage then, is an event of great moment, and particularly for the spouse who is leaving his (or her) natal apartment. Out-marriage, as we have seen, involves a radical change in jural status. It is also an occasion of psychological stress for the out-marrying spouse, since she (or he) is, in a sense, abandoning her natal family. Thus, one informant remarked that out-marriage ( ngugi ka orang ) meant ‘the casting away of one's father and mother’ (‘ itong udah buai apai indai ’). However, about 75% of Iban marriages are within the kindred, and so the stresses of out-marriage are often allayed by the fact that the out-marrying spouse is entering the household of fairly close kin.' <sup id="cite_ref-645" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-645">[645]</a></sup> Both patrifiliation and matrifiliation were common: 'Further, membership of his (or her) natal bilek confers upon a child inheritance rights over its properties and lands, and these rights are retained as long as the individual remains a resident member. Among the Iban, then, filiation is of a special kind, for it may be either to an individual's mother's bilek or to an individual's father's bilek, but not to both at the same time. Moreover, in practice, both types of filiation occur to an approximately equal extent. We are here confronted with a fundamental principle of the Iban family system.' <sup id="cite_ref-646" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-646">[646]</a></sup> Given the practice of ambilocal residence, inheritance rights were thus determined by residence rather than gender: 'However, should a man, upon marriage, permanently leave his natal bilek , he thereby relinquishes his parcenary rights over its estate, but acquires rights in the bilek into which he marries and settles down. The same applies to a woman who marries out of her natal apartment. An affine, then, possesses parcenary rights within the bilek of which he (or she) is a resident member.' <sup id="cite_ref-647" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-647">[647]</a></sup> '10. Within the bilek family siblings have equivalent rights; in other words, they are parceners or co-heirs. If a sibling marries out he thereby relinquishes rights of inheritance in his natal bilek family, but acquires rights in the bilek family into which he marries. This rule applies equally to men and to women. When divorce occurs an individual returns to his or her natal bilek family and resumes rights there; but widows and widowers do not return to their natal bilek families. Thus, an analysis of 52 cases showed that there were 26 widows or widowers living as members of their natal bilek families, and 26 who were living in bilek families of which they were members by right of marriage and local residence.' <sup id="cite_ref-648" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-648">[648]</a></sup> 'In accordance with custom, an Iban who marries into another longhouse and joins his or her spouse's family is no longer entitled to inherit ancestral lands left behind in the former longhouse area. If such an individual has no siblings living in his or her original family bilek , these lands are left under the guardianship of the Tuai Rumah, who has authority to allow other members of the longhouse to make use of them until one of the former owner's heirs can re-establish the ancestral bilek and reclaim its lands. Only lands which are officially titled can be claimed wherever the owner lives in the country; otherwise rights of use are contigent upon the family's continual residence within the longhouse where the land is located. This means that if an Iban migrates from one river to another, he will automatically loose rights to all of his temuda lands which have no official title. If he has no sibling living in the village these lands will become available for use by the people of the longhouse he has left and are subject to reapportionment by the Tuai Rumah.' <sup id="cite_ref-649" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-649">[649]</a></sup> Both sons and daughters could initiate partition and out-marriage: '2. The bilek , with the exception of certain ritual objects, is a partible estate; and a sibling who remains in his (or her) natal bilek has the right to claim a proportionate share of the family inheritance, and set up a separate domestic unit. This is a common happening. Indeed, when two elementary families emerge [Page 8] within a bilek, partition always follows in due course. This precludes the development of joint or extended families, and nowhere in Sarawak did I encounter siblings--married and having adult children of their own--who were still living together as members of the same bilek. Again, my observations showed that partition always involves the break-up of a sibling group. When partition occurs one sibling and his (or her) family secedes from the ancestral bilek to found a new and independent household. Furthermore, this sibling is just as likely to be a man as a woman; thus, an analysis of 34 cases of partition showed that 17 founders of seceding families were males, while 17 were females. A fundamental feature of partition is that each part--after partition has occurred--is an autonomous unit in its own right, and not merely a constituent part of some wider corporate group. The partition of bilek families as it occurs in Iban society is thus a different process from segmentation as it occurs in societies based on unilineal principles.' <sup id="cite_ref-650" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-650">[650]</a></sup> Property could also be transferred to adopted children: 'If a man and his wife, after many years of marriage, are certain that they will have no child of their own, they are likely to adopt a child in order that he or she may inherit their property after they have passed away and perpetuate their bilek family. Most couples prefer to adopt a child of their closest relatives, such as a nephew or a niece. However, if their close relatives have no child whom they are willing or able to give in adoption, the couple may adopt the child of a distant cousin or an unrelated friend.' <sup id="cite_ref-651" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-651">[651]</a></sup> 'In order to make an adoption legal, the adopters must hold a formal ceremony called the Gawai Biru-iru, in which they publicly announce in the presences of guests, including at least two Tuai Rumah or a Penghulu, and their relatives who, otherwise, would inherit their property if they were to die childless, that the child is hereby adopted to be their own. By this proclamation the child is acknowledged as their legal heir with identical rights of inheritance, as if he or she were the couple's sole natural child. In future, if any argument arises over the disposal of the couple's property, the [Page 79] Tuai Rumah or Penghulu who were present at the Gawai Biru-iru, are responsible for safeguarding the rights of the adopted child in court. These rights, are identical whether the child is male or female.' <sup id="cite_ref-652" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-652">[652]</a></sup> 'We have now seen that the Iban bilek family is an autonomous, corporate group, all the resident members of which--natal, adopted and affinal--hold rights over its estate. As the Iban themselves put it: ‘Whoever stands by the bilek (i.e. remains a resident member), he (or she) possesses the belongings, possesses the valuables’ (‘ Sapa tan ka bilek, iya empu utai, empu keresa ’). This was an utterance made at Rumah Nyala in 1950 during the formal discussion of the conditions which were to govern the adoption of an infant boy, and it was made by one of the men of the adopting family. It was a public pledge that as long as the adopted child elected to remain resident in their apartment he would possess identical rights of inheritance with the other members of the family. This fundamental principle of inheritance was reiterated many times during the course of the discussion--as it always is on such occasions. finally, to clinch the matter, another of the adopting party put it even more trenclantly by abruptly asserting: ‘Whoever stands by the bilek , even be he a Kayan, a Bukitan, a Punan, an Ukit, it matters not, he is the one who inherits the property’ (‘ Sapa tan ka bilek, Kayan, Pakatan, Punan, Ukit, enda iboh, tya empu keresa ’) Now, the Kayans, the Bukitans, the Punans and the Ukits are neighbouring tribes of the Rejang headwaters; all are alien, and the Kayans and Ukits, in particular, are the bitter traditional enemies of the Iban. When this is realized, the force of the utterance just quoted will be appreciated. It affirms that even an enemy and an alien, should he come to live in an Iban bilek , would, if he maintained his residence, hold equal rights of inheritance with the other members of the family. For Iban ears there could be no more emphatic avowal than this of the principle we have been considering.' <sup id="cite_ref-653" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-653">[653]</a></sup> In-marrying affines of either sex became full members of their spouse's longhouse community: 'The position of the natal members of a bilek family in regard to inheritance is clear, for their prerogative depends on direct descent. Furthermore, as we have seen, an adopted child has conferred upon him exactly the same rights. But what of an affine whose membership dates only from the time of his (or her) marriage? By way of explanation let us consider the case of a man who marries out of his natal bilek . When such a man decides upon uxorilocal residence, and when, in the course of time, it becomes evident to all concerned that this marriage will be a lasting one, he receives from his natal bilek family a form of personal inheritance called pemai . The amount of pemai given to an out-marrying member varies considerably from case to case, for it depends largely on the degree to which the other senior members of the bilek family approve of the marriage that has been contracted. Cases do occur in which [Page 36] no pemai at all is given, while at the other extreme, planned marriages between members of wealthy families are often marked by a show of ostentation. Very commonly the pemai consists of a Chinese jar or a bronze gong, and of various smaller articles such as plates and bowls.' <sup id="cite_ref-654" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-654">[654]</a></sup> 'The giving of this pemai is an event of signal importance, for it constitutes the final fulfilling of a man's rights of inheritance as far as his natal bilek is concerned, and it further represents the formal termination of membership of his natal (or adoptive) bilek family. Henceforward, he is a full member of his wife's bilek . His pemai , or personal inheritance, becomes part of the estate of his wife's apartment, and all his energies are now devoted to the welfare of this new family; any valuables he may acquire (as, for example, on a bejalai , or journey) are the property-- meum et tuum --of this group. In other words, when a man marries out of his own apartment and into another, he has conferred upon him full jural membership of a new corporate group, with all its attendant privileges and obligations. And the same, of course, applies to a woman.' <sup id="cite_ref-655" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-655">[655]</a></sup> Freeman provides a general summary of the ineritance system: 'Having briefly described the composition of the bilek family and the way in which its members are recruited, we may turn to an examination of the principles governing inheritance, for these, under the Iban system of filiation, are of particular significance. Let us begin by considering the position of the natal and adopted members of the family. As has already been stressed, children become members by right of birth of either their father's or their mother's bilek --but it is always one or the other. Thus, the children of a man practising uxorilocal residence are the members of their mother's natal bilek , and of this local group alone. They have no rights of inheritance within their father's natal bilek, of which they are not resident members. Similarly, the children of a woman practising virilocal residence are members of their father's local group, and have no rights of inheritance in their mother's natal bilek . Adopted children are members of the bilek into which they have been adopted, and of this bilek only.' <sup id="cite_ref-656" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-656">[656]</a></sup> 'The general rule for both natural and adopted children is this: as long as they remain resident members of their own bilek family, sons and daughters possess full and equal rights of inheritance over the family estate. In other words, within a bilek siblings are parceners or co-heirs. There is thus recognition of neither primogeniture nor ultimogeniture, and no differentiation [Page 32] between the sexes, nor between natural and adopted children. Instead, in matters of inheritance, siblings are equals. Their equivalence is well expressed in the phrase: ‘ menyadi tampong pala ’ which the Iban use to describe them. These words, which have the literal meaning: ‘siblings whose heads are joined’, symbolize aptly the kind of relationship in which siblings stand. Another much-used phrase is: ‘ menyadi begulai pemai ’ meaning ‘siblings of common inheritance’.' <sup id="cite_ref-657" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-657">[657]</a></sup> 'As long then, as an individual remains resident in a bilek , he (or she) is one of the group in which ownership and inheritance are vested. Indeed, it is the family as a whole that holds common tenure of the conglomeration of property and other rights which constitute ‘the bilek ’. In other words, the Iban bilek family is a corporation aggregate. Thus, no one of its members holds the right [Page 33] to disinherit another. In life the members of a bilek are parceners, and even in death each member is entitled to his share of the family estate--that last inheritance which he carries with him to the after-world. An elder looks to his children and to his grandchildren within the bilek family to care for him in his old age, and to perform conscientiously the elaborate mortuary rites which must accompany his passing from this world to the next. To the Iban these mortuary rites and the furnishing of grave goods are matters of supreme importance, and all the senior surviving members of the bilek family are expected to join in their faithful performance. As the Iban themselves phrase it: ‘As the mortuary rites are equally performed, so equally is the bilek estate inherited’ (‘ Enti blah ngelumbong, blah empu utai ’).' <sup id="cite_ref-658" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-658">[658]</a></sup></dd>

Each bilik -family is an economically independent land-owning unit, whose individual members hold joint and equal rights in the family estate. Land ownership is established by the felling of primary forest, with usufructury rights maintained for as long as the bilik -family continues to exist, or at least remains resident within the longhouse community. Most bilik will also own sago and cocoa plantations, wild or semi-wild fruit trees, rubber small holdings, pepper gardens, pigs and poultry. In addition, each family will also possess its own farming equipment, tools, weapons, shotguns, canoes and other essential items needed in everyday life.

Wage-earning enabled men to buy jars, gongs, and other valuables for their families. Rubber and pepper have provided an unstable source of income, as has cocoa, a recent introduction.

It is rare, however, for married siblings to share the same bilik , and so the apartment usually goes to just one child and his or her spouse. The remaining brothers and sisters will then marry into other bilik -families, or else establish a new bilik on their own. As will be evident from this last statement, residence patterns following marriage may be either virilocal or uxorilocal, with no particular preference being given for either one form of the other. Nor is there any formal principle - such as a rule of primogeniture - to decide which individual in a group of siblings gets to inherit the bilik in which they were born.' <sup id="cite_ref-669" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-669">[669]</a></sup> The Iban practiced both partible and nonpartible inheritance. Nonpartible property was transmitted within senior lineages attached to a continuous longhouse community: 'It is one of the axioms of Iban adat that the padi pun of a bilek is nonpartible. What then is the solution when a family sub-divides into two separate households? Briefly it is this: the senior section retains possession of the padi pun , while the seceding section is presented with one of the sangking , which is then elevated to become its padi pun . Here, clearly, we have a criterion of crucial importance for the study of the process of bilek family formation in Iban society. The senior section of a family is always definable by the fact that its padi pun was inherited as padi pun&nbsp;; while the padi pun of a seceding section is always inherited as sangking . By studying the inheritance of padi pun and sangking , therefore, it is possible to establish the main line of a family, and the various offshoots from it which have been brought about by partition.' <sup id="cite_ref-670" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-670">[670]</a></sup> 'A second non-partible object is the batu pemanggol , or ritual whetstone, which is the centre-piece of the rites that initiate the yearly farming cycle. Each bilek family possesses one of these stones which is cherished as a magical charm of most vital importance. A few Iban families, indeed, still have whetstones upon which human victims--captives taken in war--were once sacrificed. Such stones are called batu jaum , and are immeasurably valuable in Iban estimation. To divide a batu pemanggol would be to destroy it, and so, when partition takes place, it is always retained in the ancestral bilek . The seceding section, seeking an auspicious occasion, gathers a suitable-looking stone from the river bed. With a great show of solemnity, the new stone is touched on the old and then consecrated; tutelary spirits are invoked and offerings made, and finally a pig or cock is sacrificed and the blood allowed to run on the stone's surface. This stone then becomes the batu pemanggol of the seceding section.' <sup id="cite_ref-671" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-671">[671]</a></sup> 'When partition occurs then, the senior section of the family always retains the ancestral sacred rice and ritual whetstone. It may also happen that a bilek possesses some other unique magical or ritual object and, if this be the case, this too is retained by the senior section. With these exceptions, however, all the other property of the bilek is partible, and its apportionment is in accord with the relative size and the composition of the two sections resulting from the partition, following the general rule that siblings are parceners.' <sup id="cite_ref-672" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-672">[672]</a></sup> Residence was ambilocal: 'Now, as already remarked, among the Iban virilocal marriage and uxorilocal marriage are equally permissible, for in Iban culture there are no beliefs or values which result in either form of marriage being given any sort of special preference. However, in all cases of permanent marriage a definite choice between the two possibilities must in the end be made, for there is no longterm system of alternate residence. Often, it is true, a newly married couple will follow first one form of domicile and then the other before finally settling down. Marrying into another apartment means permanently departing from one's natal or adoptive bilek family, and it is almost always an occasion of stress and sorrow, particularly for the parents of the seceding son or daughter. Conflicts of interest very frequently arise, but if a marriage is to endure a compromise is always reached, and, sooner or later, the couple permanently adopt either virilocal or uxorilocal residence.' <sup id="cite_ref-673" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-673">[673]</a></sup> 'Marriage then, is an event of great moment, and particularly for the spouse who is leaving his (or her) natal apartment. Out-marriage, as we have seen, involves a radical change in jural status. It is also an occasion of psychological stress for the out-marrying spouse, since she (or he) is, in a sense, abandoning her natal family. Thus, one informant remarked that out-marriage ( ngugi ka orang ) meant ‘the casting away of one's father and mother’ (‘ itong udah buai apai indai ’). However, about 75% of Iban marriages are within the kindred, and so the stresses of out-marriage are often allayed by the fact that the out-marrying spouse is entering the household of fairly close kin.' <sup id="cite_ref-674" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-674">[674]</a></sup> Both patrifiliation and matrifiliation were common: 'Further, membership of his (or her) natal bilek confers upon a child inheritance rights over its properties and lands, and these rights are retained as long as the individual remains a resident member. Among the Iban, then, filiation is of a special kind, for it may be either to an individual's mother's bilek or to an individual's father's bilek, but not to both at the same time. Moreover, in practice, both types of filiation occur to an approximately equal extent. We are here confronted with a fundamental principle of the Iban family system.' <sup id="cite_ref-675" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-675">[675]</a></sup> Given the practice of ambilocal residence, inheritance rights were thus determined by residence rather than gender: 'However, should a man, upon marriage, permanently leave his natal bilek , he thereby relinquishes his parcenary rights over its estate, but acquires rights in the bilek into which he marries and settles down. The same applies to a woman who marries out of her natal apartment. An affine, then, possesses parcenary rights within the bilek of which he (or she) is a resident member.' <sup id="cite_ref-676" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-676">[676]</a></sup> '10. Within the bilek family siblings have equivalent rights; in other words, they are parceners or co-heirs. If a sibling marries out he thereby relinquishes rights of inheritance in his natal bilek family, but acquires rights in the bilek family into which he marries. This rule applies equally to men and to women. When divorce occurs an individual returns to his or her natal bilek family and resumes rights there; but widows and widowers do not return to their natal bilek families. Thus, an analysis of 52 cases showed that there were 26 widows or widowers living as members of their natal bilek families, and 26 who were living in bilek families of which they were members by right of marriage and local residence.' <sup id="cite_ref-677" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-677">[677]</a></sup> 'In accordance with custom, an Iban who marries into another longhouse and joins his or her spouse's family is no longer entitled to inherit ancestral lands left behind in the former longhouse area. If such an individual has no siblings living in his or her original family bilek , these lands are left under the guardianship of the Tuai Rumah, who has authority to allow other members of the longhouse to make use of them until one of the former owner's heirs can re-establish the ancestral bilek and reclaim its lands. Only lands which are officially titled can be claimed wherever the owner lives in the country; otherwise rights of use are contigent upon the family's continual residence within the longhouse where the land is located. This means that if an Iban migrates from one river to another, he will automatically loose rights to all of his temuda lands which have no official title. If he has no sibling living in the village these lands will become available for use by the people of the longhouse he has left and are subject to reapportionment by the Tuai Rumah.' <sup id="cite_ref-678" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-678">[678]</a></sup> Both sons and daughters could initiate partition and out-marriage: '2. The bilek , with the exception of certain ritual objects, is a partible estate; and a sibling who remains in his (or her) natal bilek has the right to claim a proportionate share of the family inheritance, and set up a separate domestic unit. This is a common happening. Indeed, when two elementary families emerge [Page 8] within a bilek, partition always follows in due course. This precludes the development of joint or extended families, and nowhere in Sarawak did I encounter siblings--married and having adult children of their own--who were still living together as members of the same bilek. Again, my observations showed that partition always involves the break-up of a sibling group. When partition occurs one sibling and his (or her) family secedes from the ancestral bilek to found a new and independent household. Furthermore, this sibling is just as likely to be a man as a woman; thus, an analysis of 34 cases of partition showed that 17 founders of seceding families were males, while 17 were females. A fundamental feature of partition is that each part--after partition has occurred--is an autonomous unit in its own right, and not merely a constituent part of some wider corporate group. The partition of bilek families as it occurs in Iban society is thus a different process from segmentation as it occurs in societies based on unilineal principles.' <sup id="cite_ref-679" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-679">[679]</a></sup> Property could also be transferred to adopted children: 'If a man and his wife, after many years of marriage, are certain that they will have no child of their own, they are likely to adopt a child in order that he or she may inherit their property after they have passed away and perpetuate their bilek family. Most couples prefer to adopt a child of their closest relatives, such as a nephew or a niece. However, if their close relatives have no child whom they are willing or able to give in adoption, the couple may adopt the child of a distant cousin or an unrelated friend.' <sup id="cite_ref-680" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-680">[680]</a></sup> 'In order to make an adoption legal, the adopters must hold a formal ceremony called the Gawai Biru-iru, in which they publicly announce in the presences of guests, including at least two Tuai Rumah or a Penghulu, and their relatives who, otherwise, would inherit their property if they were to die childless, that the child is hereby adopted to be their own. By this proclamation the child is acknowledged as their legal heir with identical rights of inheritance, as if he or she were the couple's sole natural child. In future, if any argument arises over the disposal of the couple's property, the [Page 79] Tuai Rumah or Penghulu who were present at the Gawai Biru-iru, are responsible for safeguarding the rights of the adopted child in court. These rights, are identical whether the child is male or female.' <sup id="cite_ref-681" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-681">[681]</a></sup> 'We have now seen that the Iban bilek family is an autonomous, corporate group, all the resident members of which--natal, adopted and affinal--hold rights over its estate. As the Iban themselves put it: ‘Whoever stands by the bilek (i.e. remains a resident member), he (or she) possesses the belongings, possesses the valuables’ (‘ Sapa tan ka bilek, iya empu utai, empu keresa ’). This was an utterance made at Rumah Nyala in 1950 during the formal discussion of the conditions which were to govern the adoption of an infant boy, and it was made by one of the men of the adopting family. It was a public pledge that as long as the adopted child elected to remain resident in their apartment he would possess identical rights of inheritance with the other members of the family. This fundamental principle of inheritance was reiterated many times during the course of the discussion--as it always is on such occasions. finally, to clinch the matter, another of the adopting party put it even more trenclantly by abruptly asserting: ‘Whoever stands by the bilek , even be he a Kayan, a Bukitan, a Punan, an Ukit, it matters not, he is the one who inherits the property’ (‘ Sapa tan ka bilek, Kayan, Pakatan, Punan, Ukit, enda iboh, tya empu keresa ’) Now, the Kayans, the Bukitans, the Punans and the Ukits are neighbouring tribes of the Rejang headwaters; all are alien, and the Kayans and Ukits, in particular, are the bitter traditional enemies of the Iban. When this is realized, the force of the utterance just quoted will be appreciated. It affirms that even an enemy and an alien, should he come to live in an Iban bilek , would, if he maintained his residence, hold equal rights of inheritance with the other members of the family. For Iban ears there could be no more emphatic avowal than this of the principle we have been considering.' <sup id="cite_ref-682" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-682">[682]</a></sup> In-marrying affines of either sex became full members of their spouse's longhouse community: 'The position of the natal members of a bilek family in regard to inheritance is clear, for their prerogative depends on direct descent. Furthermore, as we have seen, an adopted child has conferred upon him exactly the same rights. But what of an affine whose membership dates only from the time of his (or her) marriage? By way of explanation let us consider the case of a man who marries out of his natal bilek . When such a man decides upon uxorilocal residence, and when, in the course of time, it becomes evident to all concerned that this marriage will be a lasting one, he receives from his natal bilek family a form of personal inheritance called pemai . The amount of pemai given to an out-marrying member varies considerably from case to case, for it depends largely on the degree to which the other senior members of the bilek family approve of the marriage that has been contracted. Cases do occur in which [Page 36] no pemai at all is given, while at the other extreme, planned marriages between members of wealthy families are often marked by a show of ostentation. Very commonly the pemai consists of a Chinese jar or a bronze gong, and of various smaller articles such as plates and bowls.' <sup id="cite_ref-683" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-683">[683]</a></sup> 'The giving of this pemai is an event of signal importance, for it constitutes the final fulfilling of a man's rights of inheritance as far as his natal bilek is concerned, and it further represents the formal termination of membership of his natal (or adoptive) bilek family. Henceforward, he is a full member of his wife's bilek . His pemai , or personal inheritance, becomes part of the estate of his wife's apartment, and all his energies are now devoted to the welfare of this new family; any valuables he may acquire (as, for example, on a bejalai , or journey) are the property-- meum et tuum --of this group. In other words, when a man marries out of his own apartment and into another, he has conferred upon him full jural membership of a new corporate group, with all its attendant privileges and obligations. And the same, of course, applies to a woman.' <sup id="cite_ref-684" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-684">[684]</a></sup> Freeman provides a general summary of the ineritance system: 'Having briefly described the composition of the bilek family and the way in which its members are recruited, we may turn to an examination of the principles governing inheritance, for these, under the Iban system of filiation, are of particular significance. Let us begin by considering the position of the natal and adopted members of the family. As has already been stressed, children become members by right of birth of either their father's or their mother's bilek --but it is always one or the other. Thus, the children of a man practising uxorilocal residence are the members of their mother's natal bilek , and of this local group alone. They have no rights of inheritance within their father's natal bilek, of which they are not resident members. Similarly, the children of a woman practising virilocal residence are members of their father's local group, and have no rights of inheritance in their mother's natal bilek . Adopted children are members of the bilek into which they have been adopted, and of this bilek only.' <sup id="cite_ref-685" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-685">[685]</a></sup> 'The general rule for both natural and adopted children is this: as long as they remain resident members of their own bilek family, sons and daughters possess full and equal rights of inheritance over the family estate. In other words, within a bilek siblings are parceners or co-heirs. There is thus recognition of neither primogeniture nor ultimogeniture, and no differentiation [Page 32] between the sexes, nor between natural and adopted children. Instead, in matters of inheritance, siblings are equals. Their equivalence is well expressed in the phrase: ‘ menyadi tampong pala ’ which the Iban use to describe them. These words, which have the literal meaning: ‘siblings whose heads are joined’, symbolize aptly the kind of relationship in which siblings stand. Another much-used phrase is: ‘ menyadi begulai pemai ’ meaning ‘siblings of common inheritance’.' <sup id="cite_ref-686" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-686">[686]</a></sup> 'As long then, as an individual remains resident in a bilek , he (or she) is one of the group in which ownership and inheritance are vested. Indeed, it is the family as a whole that holds common tenure of the conglomeration of property and other rights which constitute ‘the bilek ’. In other words, the Iban bilek family is a corporation aggregate. Thus, no one of its members holds the right [Page 33] to disinherit another. In life the members of a bilek are parceners, and even in death each member is entitled to his share of the family estate--that last inheritance which he carries with him to the after-world. An elder looks to his children and to his grandchildren within the bilek family to care for him in his old age, and to perform conscientiously the elaborate mortuary rites which must accompany his passing from this world to the next. To the Iban these mortuary rites and the furnishing of grave goods are matters of supreme importance, and all the senior surviving members of the bilek family are expected to join in their faithful performance. As the Iban themselves phrase it: ‘As the mortuary rites are equally performed, so equally is the bilek estate inherited’ (‘ Enti blah ngelumbong, blah empu utai ’).' <sup id="cite_ref-687" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-687">[687]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b>♠ State expropriation ♣ present ♥</b> Unused lands reverted to the colonial government: 'The Brooke courts helped to reinforce the development of common farming land in the Second Division by adopting the principle that any land which had not been utilized for a specified period (including virgin land) reverted to the Government. For example, in Abang Embit [Page 20] and others v Penghulu Luta , an important case from the Paku, it was stated: “By published Gov't Orders, jungle of over 3 years growth on swamp and 7 years on hill land cannot be claimed by anyone, being the property of the State . . . [A]nyone wishing to fell same for the purpose of farming, may do so without the necessity for a permit” (Betong Court Book 1920:483). It is not clear to which Government Orders this statement refers, nor on what basis the 3 and 7 year limits were chosen (given that, for hill rice farming, 7 years is close to the absolute minimum fallow period required for sustained yield). Nevertheless, the use of these guidelines by the courts had the effect of strengthening the trend towards greater community control over the disposal of farming land, as in practice the designated “State land” differed little from the common land described by Phillips.' <sup id="cite_ref-688" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-688">[688]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Monogamy ♣ present ♥</b> eHRAF provides a general description of the marriage and kinship systems: 'The BILEK-family is an autonomous unit, able to join with other units of a longhouse or to detach itself. Iban become members of a family through birth, adoption, marriage, or incorporation. The family is responsible for construction of its own unit, production of its own food, and management of its own affairs. In a sample of 1,051 families, 60 percent were comprised of parents and children, 40 percent included grandparents. The family is a kin-based, corporate group, holding in trust land, sacred rice, sacred charms, ritual formulas, taboos, and heirloom gongs and jars. Traditionally, one son or daughter has remained in the BILEK to ensure continuity over time. With urban migration, and mail service making possible postal remittances, an increasing number of parents have no adult child residing in the BILEK with them.' <sup id="cite_ref-689" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-689">[689]</a></sup> 'Preferred and proscribed marriages are commonly recognized. Though parents prefer to arrange their children's marriages, especially educated young people would rather choose their own mates. Marriage is preferably with a person between the degree of first and fifth cousin. Distinctions are made between parallel and cross cousins; marriages between the former are avoided. Although most Iban marriages are monogamous, isolated instances of sororal and nonsororal polygyny occur. Marriage between a man and a woman who are related as member of adjacent generations is not approved, but propitiatory rites can be performed if, for example, an aunt and nephew insist on marrying. Marriage within the kin group is preferred in order to protect property rights, and to avoid union with a descendant of slaves or a person of ill fortune. Residence is ambilocal or neolocal. Divorce may be initiated by either partner and, if with mutual consent, is relatively easy.' <sup id="cite_ref-690" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-690">[690]</a></sup> According to Freeman, monogamy was the norm: 'Finally, let me comment briefly on the most important affinal relationship of all&nbsp;: that of husband and wife. The conjugal tie, as we have already seen, is basic to the structure of the bilek family, and of crucial significance to the kinship system as a whole. Monogamy is reflected in the fact that the terms laki (husband) and bini (wife) can be applied to only one person at a time. Between husband and wife there is no clearly structured pattern of superordination-subordination; although there is a sharply demarcated sexual division of labour, and a differentiation of ritual and other roles, a husband and wife, in their family life, are equals. Again, marriage among the Iban rests not on status, class, clan membership, or any other kind of prescriptive structural consideration but on the affection and regard which a husband and wife have for one another. It is understandable, therefore, that the bond between husband and wife, in the opinion of the Iban is, ideally, closer than that between siblings.' <sup id="cite_ref-691" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-691">[691]</a></sup> Conjugal relations were relatively egalitarian: 'Among the Dyaks no man has more than one wife. Polygamy is considered very displeasing to the gods, and [Page 129] conjugal affection is rare among the Dyaks. On the contrary, a great deal of it exists, and the men very often love their wives and think a great deal of their opinion. They will not decide upon any important course of action without consulting them. Where there are children, the husbands very often help their wives in doing more than their share of the man's work, and I have often seen the men nursing and fondling their naked babies when the mothers were busy.' <sup id="cite_ref-692" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-692">[692]</a></sup> Residence was ambilocal: 'Now, as already remarked, among the Iban virilocal marriage and uxorilocal marriage are equally permissible, for in Iban culture there are no beliefs or values which result in either form of marriage being given any sort of special preference. However, in all cases of permanent marriage a definite choice between the two possibilities must in the end be made, for there is no longterm system of alternate residence.

Out-marriage, as we have seen, involves a radical change in jural status. It is also an occasion of psychological stress for the out-marrying spouse, since she (or he) is, in a sense, abandoning her natal family. Thus, one informant remarked that out-marriage ( ngugi ka orang ) meant ‘the casting away of one's father and mother’ (‘ itong udah buai apai indai ’).

Full membership of a bilek family may also be attained by marrying into it. Marriage, indeed, is a crucial determinant of bilek family membership. As already remarked, the Iban are a rigorously monogamous people, and [Page 30] further, the Iban bilek family--by adat --is a strictly exogamous unit. Iban custom does ordinarily permit the marriage of first cousins ( petunggal diri menyadi ), but incest rules prescribe that marriage between first cousins who are resident members of the same bilek should never take place. From this fact that marriage never occurs within the confines of a single bilek family it follows that every marriage necessitates one of the partners leaving his or her natal or adoptive bilek .' <sup id="cite_ref-695" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-695">[695]</a></sup> The relative frequency of outmarriage and partition was associated with the size of the sibling group: 'A special problem with which one has to deal in attempting to explain the working of the Iban family system is the differential incidence of out-marriage and partition. An obvious way of coping with this question is to examine a series of different sibling groups and to determine, for each of them, the relative incidence of outmarriage, adoption out of the bilek , and bilek partition. One necessary condition for a survey of this kind is that all the sibling groups considered should have reached a stage at which all of the processes to be examined had reached a state of completion. Accordingly, I extracted from my collection of genealogies for R. Nyala, R. Sibat and R. Tungku, all the available cases of this kind. This gave me ninety-eight sibling groups in all--ranging in size from one to nine members. For all of these ninety-eight groups I noted the instances of out-marriage, adoption out, and partition--where they occurred--and then tabulated the results. The results for out-marriage and partition are tabulated in the diagram opposite. Along the horizontal axis of the graph the ninety-eight sibling groups of the sample are arranged in order of size from one to nine; and along the vertical axis frequencies are shown as percentages, cases of out-marriage, as they occurred, as a percentage of all possible cases; cases of partition, as they occurred, as percentage of the total number of cases of partition which might have occurred.' <sup id="cite_ref-696" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-696">[696]</a></sup> 'The diagram can be summarized verbally, as follows: Size of sibling group ref.: out-marriage and partition: 1: Partition never occurs; out-marriage is exceedingly rare (5% of cases); (i.e. sole heir always remains in natal bilek , except in highly rare and unusual circumstances). 2: Out-marriage and partition about equal (e.g. 47%:44%). 3: Out-marriage slightly more common than partition (e.g. 53%:37%). 4: Out-marriage about twice as common as partition (e.g. 66%:29%). 5: Out-marriage remains markedly more common than partition (e.g. about twice as common).' <sup id="cite_ref-697" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-697">[697]</a></sup> 'Let us now glance at the phenomenon of out-marriage. We can, I think, on the evidence from our sample of ninety-eight sibling groups, make a generalization something of this kind: The incidence of marriage out of natal bilek families (i.e. into other bilek families) exhibits a slight tendency to progressive increase as the size of sibling groups (in bilek families) progressively increases.' <sup id="cite_ref-698" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-698">[698]</a></sup> '(E.g. from an average incidence of 48% in the case of sibling groups of two members to an average incidence of 60% in the cases of sibling groups of five and over.) (1) As a sibling group increases in numbers the potential share of any one individual of the bilek estate decreases. (E.g. sole heir inherits whole of estate, two children inherit half each, three one-third each, and so on.) This means that as a sibling group increases in size it becomes increasingly less ‘worth while’ for any member of the group to remain in his natal bilek , with the intention of claiming his share of the bilek estate. In other words, it is more ‘worth while’ (i.e. in his material, social and other interests) for any member of a large sibling group to marry out of his natal bilek and into another with only one or two members in its sibling group. He thus tends to inherit more property; and to acquire, as a result of this, greater social and ritual standing and influence. (2) The male members of large sibling groups are presented with greater opportunities for going on bejalai because their services in farming are not so vitally [Page 50] required. This presents them with greater opportunities for meeting nubile females and settling down in other areas. The inducement for such males to return to a large bilek family is not so great.' <sup id="cite_ref-699" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-699">[699]</a></sup> '(3) All Iban apartments are of about the same size. As a large family grows up living in this confined space becomes increasingly uncongenial. For members of large families out-marriage is the easiest avenue of escape. (Partition is a much more difficult operation, for other members of the sibling group may offer opposition, etc.) (4) The aim of most Iban men and women is to possess a bilek of their own. This confers the independence which is dear to every Iban's heart. Out-marriage is an easier avenue to this independence than partition.' <sup id="cite_ref-700" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-700">[700]</a></sup> 'The incidence of partition exhibits a tendency to progressive decrease as the size of sibling groups progressively increases. (E.g. from an average incidence of 44% in the case of sibling groups of two to three members to an average incidence of 21% in the case of sibling groups of five and over.) These, in general, are the converse of what has been said for out-marriage. When a sibling group is small in size (two to three members) the share of the family estate available to a sibling is sufficiently large (i.e. one-half to one-third) to provide strong inducement. As a sibling group increases in size, however, the share available to a sibling desiring partition becomes progressively less, so offering less inducement towards partition. Because of this, out-marriage offers stronger inducements as the size of the sibling group increases. So the incidence of partition decreases and the incidence of out-marriage increases as the size of the sibling group increases.' <sup id="cite_ref-701" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-701">[701]</a></sup> Howell provides a description of courtship and wedding practices: 'When a young man has been successful in his wooing, and has made an alliance with a maiden, he leaves her a ring as a pledge of his betrothal to her. After visiting her for some little time and finding her faithful to him, he asks for his parent's consent to marry. If his parents have no objection to his choice they go to see the girl's parents and take a cup with them to ask for their daughter. If the girl's parents approve of the contract they accept the cup. The cup is the final pledge of a marriage contract between the two parties. They then fix the day when the bride is to be fetched.' <sup id="cite_ref-702" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-702">[702]</a></sup> 'The marriage ceremony is very simple and is celebrated in the bride's house. It consists of splitting a pinang or areca nut into seven pieces and these are put on a brass tray with seven serih leaves, seven pieces of gambier and seven small lumps of lime. All the friends and relations gather round the tray and eat it's contents, at the same time talking over the binding nature of the marriage contract. It is to this effect. If a man leaves or puts away his wife unless she commits adultery or on account of an unlucky dream, or a bad omen. or inhospitality to stranger, or bad temper, he will be fined according to the law laid down by their forefathers. Similar things are also said about the woman. The binding nature of a Dyak marriage in itself is good, if it be carried out. There are other rules connected with marriage among Dyaks, such as, if the wife in the natural course of things becomes blind, or diseased, and the husband puts her away, he must incur a heavy fine. 8imilar rules also are binding on the wife.' <sup id="cite_ref-703" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-703">[703]</a></sup> Low claims that permarital sexual relations were common in some groups: 'Though from their friendly intercourse with the Malays they have adopted some of the customs, and have borrowed considerably from the language of that [Page 195] people, they have not introduced polygamy, or, with the exception of slavery, any other of their reprehensible practices. The ceremony of marriage, as far as I have learnt, is very simple, and consists merely in the persons, who have previously agreed upon the point, living together, and a feast being made on the occasion to which all who choose may repair. Their marriage feasts, like all the others, usually end in the whole of the persons assembled becoming intoxicated with a fermented beverage which they make from rice, and which they affirm they were taught by the Chinese. The state of morality amongst the Sakarran and Sambas Dyaks is strangely more lax than in any of the other tribes. It is affirmed, and they themselves have frequently told me, that it is the common custom for the unmarried women to have amongst the similarly situated of the other sex, lovers to whom they are liberal of their favours: this proceeds with the knowledge and consent of the parents for some time, but if the girl should prove pregnant, the father of the child must take the mother for his wife; but if the connexion should long continue without the attainment of this desired result, the acquaintance is discontinued, and they each seek new sharers of their loves. Should they not be constant to each other during this stage of their intimacy, the offence, though public, never becomes an occasion of scandal to either person concerned, and nothing is said of it except, perhaps, by the one who has been deceived. [Page 196] Though virtue before marriage is thus little respected, faithlessness after the marriage feast has taken place is a grave and serious offence in which the whole village is concerned. I believe it is punished by fine, but the offence is of such rare occurrence that no person to my knowledge ever incurred the penalty. The license granted to the young women appears amongst these people only to extend to their own nation, but it is probable, and in fact certain, in some tribes, that their favours are liberally extended to the Malays, should any happen to reside in their vicinity. This laxity of manners has been carried so far, that I have been assured that should a chief, or distinguished warrior of another tribe, travelling through the country, rest for a night at a village, it is a necessary part of their hospitality to provide a girl for his companion; but my information on this particular is derived from the Malays. I, however, think it correct, as a similar custom is always followed by the Kyans.' <sup id="cite_ref-704" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-704">[704]</a></sup> Iban notions of incest included a 'generation taboo' that if broken was in need of ritual redress. Sandin provides a description: 'If the bridegroom's parents agree to pay the marriage price, then a genealogist ( tukang tusut ) will recite the bride's and the bridegroom's family trees to see whether the marriage is incestuous or not. Incestuous means in this connection that the couple are kin of different generations. If their union is incestous to this sense then the bridal parents should infrom the Penghulu (district chief) that the coming marriage ceremony of their children will be celebrated with besapat ka ai or bekalih didarat depending on the category of the incest as discussed earlier (cf, pp. 29-30).'  <sup id="cite_ref-705" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-705">[705]</a></sup> 'In addition, he also recites the customs regarding marriage in defiance of the generation taboo which is disastrous, following Sengalang Burong's advice which he gave to his grandson, Sera Gunting who committed incest with his mother's sister, Endu Dara Chempaka Tempurong Alang alias Dayang Patri Langit. After he has related those customs, he then begins to set forth his pedigree further and gives information regarding his forefathers' expensive dowries as they were rich and chivalrous. On reaching the generation of the bride and bridegroom, he then discloses their relationship. The people will discuss the appropriate customs to remedy the marriage which might happen to be in defiance of the generation [Page 35] taboo, after the genealogist has set forth his pedigree up to that stage. If their relationship is calculated from their parents, and is in the ratio of one to two (which means that he is married to his auntie or niece), then the water is being partitioned for them, and two pigs will be slaughtered: one is to be killed in the water while the other will be butchered on land. They are requested to bathe themselves with the water that has been saturated with the blood of the pigs. The pigs to be slaughtered must be the ones that have had litters, and the jar that the bridegroom produces must be equivalent to the monetary value of nine dollars while the bride pays seven dollars. (Other customs are obtainable from a book entitled “Sengalang Burong”.)' <sup id="cite_ref-706" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-706">[706]</a></sup> 'If their generation ratio is at two to three, the water is being partitioned for them and the number of pigs that have had litters is the same. But the amount of money paid decreases. A pig is slaughtered to smear the land if their generation ratio is at three to four. They are forced to cut down fruit trees if their marriage is at the generation gap of four to five ratio. When their generation ratio is five to six, they are only asked to bite on a piece of iron. The bride and bridegroom are requested to bite grains of salt if their marriage is at the generation ratio of six to seven. This is to protect their bodies and souls.' <sup id="cite_ref-707" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-707">[707]</a></sup> 'Later, the guests are asked to take their seats to consume breakfast. After the breakfast the newly-wedded couple will undergo another ceremony to release them from taboo if they are married in defiance of it. They are brought to a river where they will be bathed with the blood of a pig together with river water. If their marriage does not cause disaster, the ceremonial cutting of betel nuts into slices, which is the actual marriage session, ends upon the child's awakening.' <sup id="cite_ref-708" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-708">[708]</a></sup> 'Arriving at the river, the appointed man proceeds to make an invocation, calling for God and all members of the marine supernaturals, so that they will know about the ceremony of releasing the couple who are married in defiance of the taboo. He also appeals to [Page 37] God and the marine supernaturals not to cause disaster because the error of human beings getting married in defiance of the generation taboo has been corrected in accordance with the customs laid down by Sengalang Burong. The person who has been appointed to slaughter the pig then kills it with a sword. Its blood flows downriver to the place where the couple, who are to be released from the taboo, are taking their ceremonial bath.' <sup id="cite_ref-709" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-709">[709]</a></sup> 'While the pig is being slaughtered, the man who has been assigned to act as a ghost across river shouts at the people on the other side of the river as to why they are making such a lot of noise. In response to this question, an elder from this side of the river answers: “We are releasing so and so from the generation taboo as they are married in defiance of it. In accordance with our old customs, we are, therefore, smearing lands with the blood of a pig ceremonially, in order to prevent disasters such as earthquakes, and tidal waves. In addition to this, we are also harmonising the water with the following: [...] After the appointed man has killed the pig at the river, he slaughters another one to smear the land with the blood. The blood of the pig is then buried, while some is sent to farms to prevent disaster. This marks the end of the ceremony to release the couple from the generation taboo.' <sup id="cite_ref-710" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-710">[710]</a></sup> Incest in general was considered to be spiritually dangerous: 'Wrongful acts contrary to adat evoke disapproval and in many instances are punished. The Iban concept of adat also refers to the ways in which people customarily deal with such acts. When the Iban discuss adat they very often use the term to describe, in any given situation, both the rules of behaviour that apply and also the correct punishment to be meted out should these rules be transgressed. The term adat applies to both. For many transgressions punishment takes the form of fines, or reparations of value. The notion of fines ( tunggu ) is closely associated with adat and written codifications of adat are characteristically described as tusun tunggu , or “fine lists” (cf. Richards 1963). Traditionally tunggu is a reparation payable to the injured party and mutually agreed to by both disputants. This is distinguished from the more recent ukum , an imposed fine or penalty, retained all or in part by the government or presiding authority. After the arrival of the Brookes in 1841, Iban fines were systematized and assigned monetary equivalents. In the first chapter of this study the author describes the major scale of fines used today by Iban judicial authorities in the Second Division of Sarawak. Later, in listing specific rules of adat , he stipulates in each case the appropriate class of fines levied in the event of its violation. Generally these fines are stated as maxima and may be reduced depending on circumstances. Many wrontful acts have also spiritual implications and so require ritual propitiation. Some are [Page xiv] thought to disturb relations with the spiritual world and unless repaired by ritual means are believed to provoke supernatural retaliation. For serious offences, such as incest, supernatural danger may extend to the whole community to which the transgress or belongs. In such cases, ritual redress is aimed at preserving the group's collective well-being. In addition, violations, of adat that cause personal injury, or result in damage or loss of possessions, are perceived by the Iban as an attack upon the victim's soul, or spiritual personality. Such acts therefore require ritual redress aimed at reviving the victim's soul, either by itself or in addition to fines. Thus wrongful acts often have spiritual consequences, or are thought to invite supernatural punishment, and these notions further reinforce the moral authority of adat , and the application of fines and more diffuse social sanctions in maintaining compliance.' <sup id="cite_ref-711" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-711">[711]</a></sup> Adultery also required redress through sacrifice: 'On most occasions the victim of the sacrifice, be it pig or fowl, is afterwards eaten. But if the sacrifice be to Pulang Gana at the commencement of the farming, the pig and other offerings are conveyed with the beating of gongs to the land prepared for receiving the seed. The pig is killed, its liver and gall examined for divination, the body and other offerings put in the ground, and some tuak (native spirit) poured upon them; a long invocation is then made to Pulang Gana, the god of the land. If a [Page 204] fowl be sacrificed for adultery, its body is thrown away in the jungle.' <sup id="cite_ref-712" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-712">[712]</a></sup> Adulterers were liable to fines and could not officiate at certain ritual activities: 'The women, as a rule, are faithful to their husbands, and adultery is uncommon when we consider the density of the population. If a woman commit adultery with a husband his wife may fine that woman whoever she may be, or if she prefer it she may waylay her on the ground and thrash her; but if she does this she must forego one-half the fine she would otherwise be entitled to demand. If her husband deserts her she may fine him or require him to provide for her children. If he forsake her in order to marry some other person, she has a right to fine her rival in his affection for enticing him away from her. If either wish to separate from the other and there is no issue to the marriage, nothing is simpler; it is merely necessary to allege a bad dream or adverse omen, and both are free to marry again; but if the dream or omen be a reality, and the pair are not desirous of parting company, they can avert any evil consequences from neglecting to do so by sacrificing a pig.' <sup id="cite_ref-713" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-713">[713]</a></sup> 'When all the guests have arrived and have seated themselves a live fowl is waved over their heads, and then the fowl is killed and the forehead of everybody is touched with the blood. The toddy is distributed and the cheers begin. Quiet again reigns when food is served out. After everybody has eaten an elderly man is asked to make the sacrifice and the offering to Pulang Gana, Ini Andan , and Manang Jaban . The man that is selected to officiate must necessarily be free from the stain of adultery. He takes his position on the platform ( tanju ) just below the eaves of the roof; two or three mats are spread one above the other and he [Page [p.38]] sits on them; above him home-made blankets ( pua kumbu ) are suspended like an awning; a wooden trough is put before him and in it the whetstones are put; above the whetstones a pig is placed and the man takes a spear and pierces the heart of the pig and the blood is made to run into the wooden trough to besmear the whetstones. After the sacrifice is over the man commences to make an offering of pinang, sireh , black pulut rice, and barley cooked in leaves, smoked fish, eggs, sweet cakes, and smoked keli . This offering is put into the wooden trough with the whetstones. The man then invokes Pulang Gana Raja Sua, Ini Andan , and Manang Jaban , beseeching them to look and behold and to turn their faces towards them; he requests them to listen to their petitions, protect them, and show favour to them.' <sup id="cite_ref-714" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-714">[714]</a></sup> But it appears that seasonal migrations by men occasionally led to adultery: 'The lengthy absence of males on bejalai clearly affects their home communities, particularly their wives and children. Although most children apparently miss their fathers, they support bejalai as a means of earning money for the family. Batang Ai women approve the institution and yet complain about their husbands' absences. In some cases, absences due to bejalai result in adultery, separation, and/or broken marriages.' <sup id="cite_ref-715" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-715">[715]</a></sup> 'In addition to the problems of sickness and farm work, women mentioned the loss of companionship with their spouse. About one-third of those interviewed emphasized their loneliness while their husbands were on bejalai. In some extreme instances, the lack of companionship led to adultery and separation. Cases of divorce or separation because of bejalai were often brought to court. The Simanggang Court Case Books record proceedings of hearings to request or contest divorce as early as 1879. Women interviewed knew of 11 cases of adultery in the study area that resulted from bejalai.' <sup id="cite_ref-716" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-716">[716]</a></sup> 'Jealousy is the trait most commonly attributed to Iban women by Iban men. The Iban word for jealousy, ninding , is instructive, because it derives from dinding or “wall”. The inference I draw from the word is that women in traditional Iban society attempted to secure or “wall” in their outgoing men, but with little apparent success. There was the expectation--indeed, the legitimization by men--of husbands philandering while on bejalai certainly one of the motives for men undertaking their travels. According to some of my informants, husbands reverted to the status of bachelor and might take another wife in addition to the one he left behind. This happened in the extended travels of Tun Jugah etween 1918 and 1921. Though he was married, both Jugah and his brother Tedong took wives in a Kenyah community. Upon their return to their home community, they left their Kenyah wives and Jugah returned to find that his own young bride had divorced him and had gone back to her parents.' <sup id="cite_ref-717" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-717">[717]</a></sup> Graham claims that male adulterers were treated more leniently than female ones: 'The factors outlined above -- the high social valuation and ritual elaboration of specifically male achievements, together with an implicit recognition of men's dependence on women's cooperation -- inform certain behavioural and ideational complexes [Page 107] found amongst the Iban. Men's anxiety about their own adequacy and potency is evident in assertive boasting about the size of their penises (Heppell 1975:115), in castration dreams (Freeman 1968:372), and in the practice of wearing a penis pin ( palang ) (Freeman 1968:388). Their vulnerability, should their women be seduced away from them, is expressed in their violent reaction to being cuckolded (Heppell 1976) and is reified in the customary law forbearance of male, but condemnation of female, adultery when spouses are apart (Freeman 1967:335). Tension between the sexes finds expression in women's mockery of men and male pretensions. Freeman reports that the mockery of men is one of the favourite pastimes of Iban women and describes it occurring in both a social and a ritual context' <sup id="cite_ref-718" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-718">[718]</a></sup> Divorce could be either temporary or permanent: 'Much as the Dyak marriage ceremony seems to be binding, yet when it comes to the question of divorce it reveals the whole secret, and lowers it's rite before the eyes of civilization.

If the husband is the guilty party he pays a fine not only to the woman but towards the up-keep of the children also if he has any.

There is no law to punish immorality between unmarried people. The parents do not seem to be strict, and it is considered no disgrace for a girl to be on terms of intimacy with the youths of her fancy until she has made her final choice. It is supposed that every young Dyak woman will eventually marry, so her duty is plainly to choose a husband in her youth from among the many men she knows. And yet, for all this, I should say that promiscuous immorality is unknown. It is true that very often a girl is with child before her marriage, but from the Dyak point of view this is no disgrace if the father acknowledges the child and marries the woman. The greatest desire of the Dyak is to become a parent, to be known as father or mother of So-and-so. They drop their own names after the birth of a child. A young couple in love have no opportunities of private meetings excepting at night, and the only place is the loft where the young lady sleeps. The suitor pays his visit, there-fore, when the rest of the family are asleep, and she gets up from her bed and receives him. Two or three hours may be spent in her company before he leaves her. or if he should be one whom she is not willing to accept as a husband, she soon gives him his dismissal. If acceptable, the young man may be admitted to such close intimacy as though they were already married. The reason is to ascertain the certainty of progeny.

He takes his position on the platform ( tanju ) just below the eaves of the roof; two or three mats are spread one above the other and he [Page [p.38]] sits on them; above him home-made blankets ( pua kumbu ) are suspended like an awning; a wooden trough is put before him and in it the whetstones are put; above the whetstones a pig is placed and the man takes a spear and pierces the heart of the pig and the blood is made to run into the wooden trough to besmear the whetstones. After the sacrifice is over the man commences to make an offering of pinang, sireh , black pulut rice, and barley cooked in leaves, smoked fish, eggs, sweet cakes, and smoked keli . This offering is put into the wooden trough with the whetstones. The man then invokes Pulang Gana Raja Sua, Ini Andan , and Manang Jaban , beseeching them to look and behold and to turn their faces towards them; he requests them to listen to their petitions, protect them, and show favour to them.' <sup id="cite_ref-737" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-737">[737]</a></sup> But it appears that seasonal migrations by men occasionally led to adultery: 'The lengthy absence of males on bejalai clearly affects their home communities, particularly their wives and children. Although most children apparently miss their fathers, they support bejalai as a means of earning money for the family. Batang Ai women approve the institution and yet complain about their husbands' absences. In some cases, absences due to bejalai result in adultery, separation, and/or broken marriages.' <sup id="cite_ref-738" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-738">[738]</a></sup> 'In addition to the problems of sickness and farm work, women mentioned the loss of companionship with their spouse. About one-third of those interviewed emphasized their loneliness while their husbands were on bejalai. In some extreme instances, the lack of companionship led to adultery and separation. Cases of divorce or separation because of bejalai were often brought to court. The Simanggang Court Case Books record proceedings of hearings to request or contest divorce as early as 1879. Women interviewed knew of 11 cases of adultery in the study area that resulted from bejalai.' <sup id="cite_ref-739" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-739">[739]</a></sup> 'Jealousy is the trait most commonly attributed to Iban women by Iban men. The Iban word for jealousy, ninding , is instructive, because it derives from dinding or “wall”. The inference I draw from the word is that women in traditional Iban society attempted to secure or “wall” in their outgoing men, but with little apparent success. There was the expectation--indeed, the legitimization by men--of husbands philandering while on bejalai certainly one of the motives for men undertaking their travels. According to some of my informants, husbands reverted to the status of bachelor and might take another wife in addition to the one he left behind. This happened in the extended travels of Tun Jugah etween 1918 and 1921. Though he was married, both Jugah and his brother Tedong took wives in a Kenyah community. Upon their return to their home community, they left their Kenyah wives and Jugah returned to find that his own young bride had divorced him and had gone back to her parents.' <sup id="cite_ref-740" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-740">[740]</a></sup> Graham claims that male adulterers were treated more leniently than female ones: 'The factors outlined above -- the high social valuation and ritual elaboration of specifically male achievements, together with an implicit recognition of men's dependence on women's cooperation -- inform certain behavioural and ideational complexes [Page 107] found amongst the Iban. Men's anxiety about their own adequacy and potency is evident in assertive boasting about the size of their penises (Heppell 1975:115), in castration dreams (Freeman 1968:372), and in the practice of wearing a penis pin ( palang ) (Freeman 1968:388). Their vulnerability, should their women be seduced away from them, is expressed in their violent reaction to being cuckolded (Heppell 1976) and is reified in the customary law forbearance of male, but condemnation of female, adultery when spouses are apart (Freeman 1967:335). Tension between the sexes finds expression in women's mockery of men and male pretensions. Freeman reports that the mockery of men is one of the favourite pastimes of Iban women and describes it occurring in both a social and a ritual context' <sup id="cite_ref-741" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-741">[741]</a></sup> We have assumed the above to be true of both the colonial and pre-colonial periods.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Gender ♣ absent ♥</b> eHRAF provides a general description of the marriage and kinship systems: 'The BILEK-family is an autonomous unit, able to join with other units of a longhouse or to detach itself. Iban become members of a family through birth, adoption, marriage, or incorporation. The family is responsible for construction of its own unit, production of its own food, and management of its own affairs. In a sample of 1,051 families, 60 percent were comprised of parents and children, 40 percent included grandparents. The family is a kin-based, corporate group, holding in trust land, sacred rice, sacred charms, ritual formulas, taboos, and heirloom gongs and jars. Traditionally, one son or daughter has remained in the BILEK to ensure continuity over time. With urban migration, and mail service making possible postal remittances, an increasing number of parents have no adult child residing in the BILEK with them.' <sup id="cite_ref-742" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-742">[742]</a></sup> 'Preferred and proscribed marriages are commonly recognized. Though parents prefer to arrange their children's marriages, especially educated young people would rather choose their own mates. Marriage is preferably with a person between the degree of first and fifth cousin. Distinctions are made between parallel and cross cousins; marriages between the former are avoided. Although most Iban marriages are monogamous, isolated instances of sororal and nonsororal polygyny occur. Marriage between a man and a woman who are related as member of adjacent generations is not approved, but propitiatory rites can be performed if, for example, an aunt and nephew insist on marrying. Marriage within the kin group is preferred in order to protect property rights, and to avoid union with a descendant of slaves or a person of ill fortune. Residence is ambilocal or neolocal. Divorce may be initiated by either partner and, if with mutual consent, is relatively easy.' <sup id="cite_ref-743" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-743">[743]</a></sup> Residence was ambilocal: 'Now, as already remarked, among the Iban virilocal marriage and uxorilocal marriage are equally permissible, for in Iban culture there are no beliefs or values which result in either form of marriage being given any sort of special preference. However, in all cases of permanent marriage a definite choice between the two possibilities must in the end be made, for there is no longterm system of alternate residence. Often, it is true, a newly married couple will follow first one form of domicile and then the other before finally settling down. Marrying into another apartment means permanently departing from one's natal or adoptive bilek family, and it is almost always an occasion of stress and sorrow, particularly for the parents of the seceding son or daughter. Conflicts of interest very frequently arise, but if a marriage is to endure a compromise is always reached, and, sooner or later, the couple permanently adopt either virilocal or uxorilocal residence.' <sup id="cite_ref-744" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-744">[744]</a></sup> 'Marriage then, is an event of great moment, and particularly for the spouse who is leaving his (or her) natal apartment. Out-marriage, as we have seen, involves a radical change in jural status. It is also an occasion of psychological stress for the out-marrying spouse, since she (or he) is, in a sense, abandoning her natal family. Thus, one informant remarked that out-marriage ( ngugi ka orang ) meant ‘the casting away of one's father and mother’ (‘ itong udah buai apai indai ’). However, about 75% of Iban marriages are within the kindred, and so the stresses of out-marriage are often allayed by the fact that the out-marrying spouse is entering the household of fairly close kin.' <sup id="cite_ref-745" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-745">[745]</a></sup> Both sons and daughters could inherit wealth: 'Male and female children share equally in rights to real and other property so long as they remain members of their natal BILEK. Children who move out of the BILEK at marriage or for any other reason receive a small portion of the family estate, and in theory relinquish all rights to family land. In fact, however, they retain the right to request land for farming at the annual meeting commencing the agricultural year.' <sup id="cite_ref-746" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-746">[746]</a></sup> Conjugal relations were relatively egalitarian: 'Among the Dyaks no man has more than one wife. Polygamy is considered very displeasing to the gods, and [Page 129] conjugal affection is rare among the Dyaks. On the contrary, a great deal of it exists, and the men very often love their wives and think a great deal of their opinion. They will not decide upon any important course of action without consulting them. Where there are children, the husbands very often help their wives in doing more than their share of the man's work, and I have often seen the men nursing and fondling their naked babies when the mothers were busy.' <sup id="cite_ref-747" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-747">[747]</a></sup> 'The first point to be made is one of sexual equality and mutual respect. This principle is evident in a number of different areas of Iban life. We have already mentioned the bilateral kinship system and the “utrolateral” (Freeman 1970:14) patterns of residence following marriage. It can also be seen in the sharing of economic responsibilities and the even distribution of jural rights and obligations. Similarly, in terms of decision-making, due consideration is given to the views of women as well as those of men. Furthermore, although menstruation, pregnancy and childbearing are considered to be polluting, or ritually dangerous situations (Gana 1988:15 seq.), the “otherness” of women in this respect is not something that is unduly emphasized (see below). In short, Iban society is characterized by a remarkable equity between the sexes.' <sup id="cite_ref-748" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-748">[748]</a></sup> However, the Iban followed a gendered division of labour: 'Domestic chores, such as cooking and tending to the BILEK, are performed primarily by women. Both men and women collect wild foods for family consumption and, among Iban living near towns, for sale. Men fell trees and do the heavier farm work, fish, hunt, and take on contracts with logging and oil companies. In urban contexts, both men and women perform office jobs.' <sup id="cite_ref-749" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-749">[749]</a></sup> Accordingly, sons and daughters were socialized differently: 'At birth the infant becomes the center of attention and the subject of numerous rituals. Weaning is casual and discipline relaxed. During the farming season, children are left in the care of older people. By age 5, children wash their own clothes and by 8, girls help with domestic chores. Traditionally adolescent males would undertake "the initiate's journey", a trip of several months or years, from which they were expected to return with trophies. Adolescent females demonstrate their maturity with diligence and in the weaving of ceremonial cloths, baskets, and mats.' <sup id="cite_ref-750" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-750">[750]</a></sup> It appears that male adulterers were treated more leniently than female ones: 'The factors outlined above -- the high social valuation and ritual elaboration of specifically male achievements, together with an implicit recognition of men's dependence on women's cooperation -- inform certain behavioural and ideational complexes [Page 107] found amongst the Iban. Men's anxiety about their own adequacy and potency is evident in assertive boasting about the size of their penises (Heppell 1975:115), in castration dreams (Freeman 1968:372), and in the practice of wearing a penis pin ( palang ) (Freeman 1968:388). Their vulnerability, should their women be seduced away from them, is expressed in their violent reaction to being cuckolded (Heppell 1976) and is reified in the customary law forbearance of male, but condemnation of female, adultery when spouses are apart (Freeman 1967:335). Tension between the sexes finds expression in women's mockery of men and male pretensions. Freeman reports that the mockery of men is one of the favourite pastimes of Iban women and describes it occurring in both a social and a ritual context' <sup id="cite_ref-751" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-751">[751]</a></sup> Women did not have access to prestige acquired through head-hunting: 'The egalitarian nature of male and female relationships in Iban society has often been remarked upon in the past (Gomes 1911:86). There is (or was), however, one important area of traditional Iban society which was denied to Iban women, and this was the cult of headhunting. Certainly Iban women played an important ritual role in connection with headhunting - particularly with regard to the ceremonial reception of newly-taken heads into the longhouse (see below). But as non-combatants, they were automatically disqualified from participating in this system of prestige and status acquisition.' <sup id="cite_ref-752" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-752">[752]</a></sup> 'Sather comments: “From their display of skill and leadership in warfare, men alone derived the highest honours and achieved positions of status and power in Iban society, further symbolized by praise-names and ritual distinctions, from which women, as a sex, were totally excluded” (1978:343). He adds that “[w]arfare as an institution and its attendant glorification of male aggressiveness thus directly conflicted with the principles of sexual equality and egalitarianism otherwise inherent in traditional Iban society structure” (1978:343).' <sup id="cite_ref-753" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-753">[753]</a></sup> However, women could attain prestige in other ways: 'But if women were unable to compete with men in the arena of headhunting, this does not mean that the acquisition of prestige and status was altogether denied them. On the contrary, women were able to claim honor and positions of influence in Iban society through their skill at weaving and their ritual mastery of the art of dyeing cloth. These activities were traditionally identified as the female equivalent of headhunting (see below, and also Mashman in this volume). In this respect Iban women were compensated - at least in part - for their exclusion from the exclusively male domain of headhunting. In the end, however, it was to those who had taken heads that the highest honors in Iban society went, and in this respect Iban women were socially disadvantaged.' <sup id="cite_ref-754" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-754">[754]</a></sup> According to Davison, the result of this was gender complementary rather than inequality: 'The result of this, it has been suggested, was a conflict of interests between Iban men and women. Certainly there is evidence for this in the explicit sexual mockery of men, by women, which occurs at specified points during major Iban headhunting rituals. On such occasions, Iban women dress up as men - in the past sporting grotesquely carved wooden penises - to ridicule the pretentious posturings of their menfolk as warriors (Freeman 1968:388-90). Freeman reports that Iban men frequently become incensed by this mockery, retaliating in kind with crude jests at the expense of women which leave little to the imagination.' <sup id="cite_ref-755" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-755">[755]</a></sup> 'No doubt tensions and antagonisms do exist between Iban men and women, just as in any society. To see this, however, as evidence for a collective envy of men, on the part of Iban women, is perhaps to go a little too far (Freeman 1968:388). Contemporary Iban describe the sexual banter at headhunting festivals as “play” ( main-main ), and men themselves willingly participate n the role reversal farce, collecting firewood and forest vegetables, which they then cook, in imitation of the domestic duties of Iban women. Furthermore, one finds that many Iban women express little interest in the status-seeking self-aggrandizement of their menfolk, preferring instead to concentrate on achieving recognition in their own domain as expert weavers and ritual specialists in the art of dyeing cloth (Gavin; private communication). The latter attitude can, of course, be interpreted as symptomatic of a suppressed rivalry between men and women, where by thwarted women reject a dominant male ideology and replace it with a value system of their own. It is quite possible that this may be true in [Page 165] individual instances; to argue, however, that Iban society as a whole is characterized by sexual rivalry and conflict would be to overstate the case. At the same time, it should also be pointed out that if the institution of headhunting can be identified as a major source of conflict between the sexes, nevertheless both men and women alike had an interest in the taking of heads which were ritually portrayed as a source of fertility for the longhouse community. In this respect if should be noted that women actively encouraged their menfolk to go on the warpath and scorned those who were not able to live up to the warrior ideal (see below).' <sup id="cite_ref-756" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-756">[756]</a></sup> We have provisionally chosen to follow Davison's interpretation of gender relations. This is open to review. We have assumed the above to be true of both the colonial and pre-colonial periods.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Social class ♣ absent ♥</b> The Iban were organized in relatively autonomous residential longhouse communities rather than social classes: 'The fundamental unit of Iban society is the BILEK-family, a group of five or six persons defined by kinship and affinity. Depending upon negotiations at a couple's marriage, there is an almost even chance that their children will be born into the family of either the wife or the husband. Iban families are part of a widely ramifying kinship system which developed in response to Iban mobility. The SUKU JURU and KABAN BELAYAN correspond to the kindred. The former connotes kin ties originating with one's grandparents and includes persons to the degree of first cousin. The latter is any group of people who share rights of reciprocity with an Iban, and may include nonkin and even non-Iban. More inclusive groups include "the brotherhood" and "food-sharers", made up of distant kin who would be invited to one's festivals, or whose festivals an Iban would attend. Attachment is ambilateral and descent, ambilineal. Although some Iban are capable of reconstructing genealogies up to fifteen generations in depth, such reconstructions are selective and illustrate the Iban practice of "genealogizing" so as to establish ancestral ties with strangers.' <sup id="cite_ref-757" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-757">[757]</a></sup> 'Terms of reference are Eskimo and the terms of address, Hawaiian.' <sup id="cite_ref-758" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-758">[758]</a></sup> 'The BILEK-family is an autonomous unit, able to join with other units of a longhouse or to detach itself. Iban become members of a family through birth, adoption, marriage, or incorporation. The family is responsible for construction of its own unit, production of its own food, and management of its own affairs.

Traditionally the core of each house was a group of descendants of the founders. Houses near one another on the same river or in the same region were commonly allied, marrying among themselves, raiding together beyond their territories, and resolving disputes by peaceful means. Regionalism, deriving from these alliances, in which Iban distinguished themselves from other allied groups, persist in modern state politics. Essentially egalitarian, Iban are aware of long-standing status distinctions among themselves of RAJA BERANI (wealthy and brave), MENSI SARIBU (commoners), and ULUN (slaves). Prestige still accrues to descendants of the first status, disdain to descendants of the third.' <sup id="cite_ref-760" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-760">[760]</a></sup> Social control and authority were informal: 'Prior to the arrival of the British adventurer, James Brooke, there were no permanent leaders, but the affairs of each house were directed by consultations of family leaders. Men of influence included renowned warriors, bards, augurs and other specialists. Brooke, who became Rajah of Sarawak, and his nephew, Charles Johnson, created political positions -- headman (TUAI RUMAH), regional chief (PENGHULU), paramount chief (TEMENGGONG) -- to restructure Iban society for administrative control, especially for purposes of taxation and the suppression of head-hunting. The creation of permanent political positions and the establishment of political parties in the early 1960s have profoundly changed the Iban.' <sup id="cite_ref-761" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-761">[761]</a></sup> 'Iban employ three strategies of social control. First, from childhood, they are taught to avoid conflict, and for a majority, every effort is made to prevent it. Second, they are taught by story and drama of the existence of numerous spirits, who vigilantly ensure observation of numerous taboos; some spirits are interested in preserving the peace, while others are responsible for any strife that arises. In these ways, the stresses and conflicts of ordinary life, especially life in the longhouse, in which one is in more or less constant sight and sound of others, have been displaced onto the spirits. Third, the headman hears disputes between members of the same house, the regional chief, disputes between members of different houses, and government officers, hear those disputes that headmen and regional chiefs cannot resolve.' <sup id="cite_ref-762" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-762">[762]</a></sup> 'Traditionally Iban leaders sought to settle disputes, as far as possible, through negotiation and attempted to avert recourse to self-help and other means that might potentially lead to open violence. In this, they were greatly aided by the highly comprehensive nature of traditional adat itself, which, although unwritten gave systematic definition of offences and correct punishments. Also important in this connection was the role formerly played by go-betweens. Within a longhouse respected elders frequently intervened in disputes, restraining the two sides and acting with their consent as negotiating agents. Such intervention was strongly supported by Iban values, particularly by the notion that a breach of adat or unresolved contention posed a collective [Page xxiv] spiritual danger to the well-being of all community members. Public spirited elders, including the longhouse headman and friends of the disputants, might even agree to make token compensation themselves, called sa-uta iring manok . In doing so, a speedy settlement was often achieved that avoided acrimony and possible loss of face by the principals.' <sup id="cite_ref-763" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-763">[763]</a></sup> War-leaders and headmen attained prestige, but were not entitled to exceptional deference: '150. When a man does become a tuai rumah there is no kind of initiation ceremony, nor is he given any kind of honorific title. His kindred continue to use the ordinary terms of classificatory kinship ( anak, menyadi, apai , etc.). while strangers address him as wai (friend), or with his personal name (e.g. Nyala). Towards him there are no special attitudes of deference or respect, other than he is able to command by virtue of his own personal prowess and prestige. He receives no tribute of any kind, and is entitled to no special privileges -- except in his relations with Government officials. Unless he also is a tuai burong , he has no religious duties to perform, and no sort of ritual sanctity attaches to his person or the apartment be occupies. It frequently happens, of course, that a tuai rumah is also a man of considerable personal prestige. He may, for example, be a successful head-hunter, and have sealed his renown by performing a number of the great rituals ( gawai ), which rank so high in Iban estimation. Again, being a tuai rumah does mean that a man becomes widely known, for it is usual for an Iban community to be called after its tuai rumah (e.g. Rumah Nyala, etc.). and this is undoubtedly one of the main attractions which the office has for ambitions individuals. A tuai rumah is also presented with special opportunities for meeting Europeans, and, in Iban eyes, such meetings are likely to lead to all manner of desirable results. But here, we are primarily concerned with the jural status of a tuai rumah within his own long-house. Under Iban adat a tuai rumah has no authority to command other members of the community, nor are they, in any real sense, his subordinates. Were a tuai rumah so rash as to issue commands to others, he would at once be rebuffed, and sharply. Rather, such influence as he does exert is by a subtle mixture of persuasion and admonition, for he knows that his position is dependent on the continued goodwill and approval of his anembiak , as the other members of the house are called. In many ways his role is an unenviable one. I remember tuai rumah Nyala, remarking to me with some feeling that he only ever gave his opinion when it was asked for; he would be malu (ashamed), he said, to volunteer advice to any of his anembiak , and, in any case, no-one would ever listen to him if he did.' <sup id="cite_ref-764" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-764">[764]</a></sup> Accordingly, the Iban have been characterized as a traditionally acephalous society: 'Prior to the arrival of the Brookes, the Iban present a picture of an exceedingly energetic people, waring among themselves and with others, and constantly expanding territorially, absorbing and displacing other groups of people in the process. This pattern of aggressive outward expansion continued into the 1850's and, on a more peaceful basis, even later. Throughout this traditional period, social loyalties centered on major river systems. The watersheds dividing these rivers tended to delimit major regional groups, or “tribes”, and these groups, under the leadership of senior warriors and warleaders, the raja berani, tau kayau or tau serang , constituted the maximal units of traditional society organized for aggression and territorial defence. While regional leaders sought to minimize the dangers of fratricidal conflict among their followers, their formal powers were limited almost entirely to the context of warfare. Thus Iban society was traditionally “acephelous” and totally without a centralized, hierarchical political order. Political power was dispersed between basically sovereign local communities, longhouses and kindreds. It was in this turbulent setting that traditional Iban adat evolved, as an intricate system of social rules and sanctions, in independent, highly egalitarian communities without centralized authority, which, yet, for reasons of survival, required effective means for resolving contention and preserving internal order.' <sup id="cite_ref-765" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-765">[765]</a></sup> Rights in land were held by longhouse families: 'Rights to land are established by clearing and farming it, or by occupying it. Rights to the use of farmland are vested in the BILEK-family, and are held in perpetuity. These rights are maintained in the living memory of the residents of each longhouse. Boundaries are indicated by landforms or trees, or are marked by planting a row of bamboo. Except for the land overshadowed by the eaves of the longhouse, there is no land to which a community holds rights. With the introduction of surveys and titles to land in the early 1900s, Iban who lived closer to government centers obtained titles to their land, under which rights of individual families to land could be verified. As a result of increased population and the commercialization of land, some Iban have bought land for investment and speculation.' <sup id="cite_ref-766" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-766">[766]</a></sup> The Iban practiced both partible and nonpartible inheritance. Nonpartible property was transmitted within senior lineages attached to a continuous longhouse community: 'It is one of the axioms of Iban adat that the padi pun of a bilek is nonpartible. What then is the solution when a family sub-divides into two separate households? Briefly it is this: the senior section retains possession of the padi pun , while the seceding section is presented with one of the sangking , which is then elevated to become its padi pun . Here, clearly, we have a criterion of crucial importance for the study of the process of bilek family formation in Iban society. The senior section of a family is always definable by the fact that its padi pun was inherited as padi pun&nbsp;; while the padi pun of a seceding section is always inherited as sangking . By studying the inheritance of padi pun and sangking , therefore, it is possible to establish the main line of a family, and the various offshoots from it which have been brought about by partition.' <sup id="cite_ref-767" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-767">[767]</a></sup> 'A second non-partible object is the batu pemanggol , or ritual whetstone, which is the centre-piece of the rites that initiate the yearly farming cycle. Each bilek family possesses one of these stones which is cherished as a magical charm of most vital importance. A few Iban families, indeed, still have whetstones upon which human victims--captives taken in war--were once sacrificed. Such stones are called batu jaum , and are immeasurably valuable in Iban estimation. To divide a batu pemanggol would be to destroy it, and so, when partition takes place, it is always retained in the ancestral bilek . The seceding section, seeking an auspicious occasion, gathers a suitable-looking stone from the river bed. With a great show of solemnity, the new stone is touched on the old and then consecrated; tutelary spirits are invoked and offerings made, and finally a pig or cock is sacrificed and the blood allowed to run on the stone's surface. This stone then becomes the batu pemanggol of the seceding section.' <sup id="cite_ref-768" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-768">[768]</a></sup> 'When partition occurs then, the senior section of the family always retains the ancestral sacred rice and ritual whetstone. It may also happen that a bilek possesses some other unique magical or ritual object and, if this be the case, this too is retained by the senior section. With these exceptions, however, all the other property of the bilek is partible, and its apportionment is in accord with the relative size and the composition of the two sections resulting from the partition, following the general rule that siblings are parceners.' <sup id="cite_ref-769" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-769">[769]</a></sup> Both patrifiliation and matrifiliation were common: 'Further, membership of his (or her) natal bilek confers upon a child inheritance rights over its properties and lands, and these rights are retained as long as the individual remains a resident member. Among the Iban, then, filiation is of a special kind, for it may be either to an individual's mother's bilek or to an individual's father's bilek, but not to both at the same time. Moreover, in practice, both types of filiation occur to an approximately equal extent. We are here confronted with a fundamental principle of the Iban family system.' <sup id="cite_ref-770" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-770">[770]</a></sup> Given the practice of ambilocal residence, inheritance rights were thus determined by residence rather than membership in social classes: 'However, should a man, upon marriage, permanently leave his natal bilek , he thereby relinquishes his parcenary rights over its estate, but acquires rights in the bilek into which he marries and settles down. The same applies to a woman who marries out of her natal apartment. An affine, then, possesses parcenary rights within the bilek of which he (or she) is a resident member.' <sup id="cite_ref-771" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-771">[771]</a></sup> '10. Within the bilek family siblings have equivalent rights; in other words, they are parceners or co-heirs. If a sibling marries out he thereby relinquishes rights of inheritance in his natal bilek family, but acquires rights in the bilek family into which he marries. This rule applies equally to men and to women. When divorce occurs an individual returns to his or her natal bilek family and resumes rights there; but widows and widowers do not return to their natal bilek families. Thus, an analysis of 52 cases showed that there were 26 widows or widowers living as members of their natal bilek families, and 26 who were living in bilek families of which they were members by right of marriage and local residence.' <sup id="cite_ref-772" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-772">[772]</a></sup> 'In accordance with custom, an Iban who marries into another longhouse and joins his or her spouse's family is no longer entitled to inherit ancestral lands left behind in the former longhouse area. If such an individual has no siblings living in his or her original family bilek , these lands are left under the guardianship of the Tuai Rumah, who has authority to allow other members of the longhouse to make use of them until one of the former owner's heirs can re-establish the ancestral bilek and reclaim its lands. Only lands which are officially titled can be claimed wherever the owner lives in the country; otherwise rights of use are contigent upon the family's continual residence within the longhouse where the land is located. This means that if an Iban migrates from one river to another, he will automatically loose rights to all of his temuda lands which have no official title. If he has no sibling living in the village these lands will become available for use by the people of the longhouse he has left and are subject to reapportionment by the Tuai Rumah.' <sup id="cite_ref-773" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-773">[773]</a></sup> Freeman provides a general summary of the property system: 'Having briefly described the composition of the bilek family and the way in which its members are recruited, we may turn to an examination of the principles governing inheritance, for these, under the Iban system of filiation, are of particular significance. Let us begin by considering the position of the natal and adopted members of the family. As has already been stressed, children become members by right of birth of either their father's or their mother's bilek --but it is always one or the other. Thus, the children of a man practising uxorilocal residence are the members of their mother's natal bilek , and of this local group alone. They have no rights of inheritance within their father's natal bilek, of which they are not resident members. Similarly, the children of a woman practising virilocal residence are members of their father's local group, and have no rights of inheritance in their mother's natal bilek . Adopted children are members of the bilek into which they have been adopted, and of this bilek only.' <sup id="cite_ref-774" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-774">[774]</a></sup> 'The general rule for both natural and adopted children is this: as long as they remain resident members of their own bilek family, sons and daughters possess full and equal rights of inheritance over the family estate. In other words, within a bilek siblings are parceners or co-heirs. There is thus recognition of neither primogeniture nor ultimogeniture, and no differentiation [Page 32] between the sexes, nor between natural and adopted children. Instead, in matters of inheritance, siblings are equals. Their equivalence is well expressed in the phrase: ‘ menyadi tampong pala ’ which the Iban use to describe them. These words, which have the literal meaning: ‘siblings whose heads are joined’, symbolize aptly the kind of relationship in which siblings stand. Another much-used phrase is: ‘ menyadi begulai pemai ’ meaning ‘siblings of common inheritance’.' <sup id="cite_ref-775" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-775">[775]</a></sup> 'As long then, as an individual remains resident in a bilek , he (or she) is one of the group in which ownership and inheritance are vested.

In other words, the Iban bilek family is a corporation aggregate. Thus, no one of its members holds the right [Page 33] to disinherit another. In life the members of a bilek are parceners, and even in death each member is entitled to his share of the family estate--that last inheritance which he carries with him to the after-world. An elder looks to his children and to his grandchildren within the bilek family to care for him in his old age, and to perform conscientiously the elaborate mortuary rites which must accompany his passing from this world to the next. To the Iban these mortuary rites and the furnishing of grave goods are matters of supreme importance, and all the senior surviving members of the bilek family are expected to join in their faithful performance. As the Iban themselves phrase it: ‘As the mortuary rites are equally performed, so equally is the bilek estate inherited’ (‘ Enti blah ngelumbong, blah empu utai ’).' <sup id="cite_ref-776" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-776">[776]</a></sup> Given the absence of social classes in the pre-Brooke Raj period, this variable may be irrelevant to the pre-colonial Iban.

<dd><b>♠ Education is available to both males and females ♣ absent: 1841-1921 CE; present: 1922-1987 CE ♥</b> In the colonial period, Christian missionaries introduced Western schooling. The first mission schools were established in the 1920s, although small boarding schools were present before that date: 'As the story of Buda indicates, conversion to Christianity was linked to interest in education, and undoubtedly to the conviction that writing was somehow the key to European power, which the Rajah had made evident by his recent victories over Rentap. There was no mission school on the Saribas itself until 1921, but an unusually large number of Saribas children left their longhouses to attend the tiny S.P.G. boarding schools which operated at various times on the Krian, at Banting on the lower Batang Lupar, and at Sabu on the Undup near Simanggang. The Rev. E. H. Gomes, in charge of the Krian school for many years, remarked, “My schoolboys came from different Dayak villages, but the majority of them were boys from the Saribas. The Dayaks from that district are more anxious [Page 333] to improve themselves than other Dayak races.”' <sup id="cite_ref-777" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-777">[777]</a></sup> Missionaries taught the Roman alphabet: 'The Malays before their conversion to Mahomedanism may be presumed to have had no letters of their own. What they have now are made up out of the Arabic alphabet. To suit the tone of their language the letters are named accordingly. With reference to the Sea Dyaks, since the gospel of Christ has been preached to them, letters of the Roman character are used and pronounced accordingly to suit the tones of their pronunciation.' <sup id="cite_ref-778" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-778">[778]</a></sup> The Brooke Rajahs did not invest much in education: 'Initially controlled and exploited, later contained and suppressed, the Iban practice of head-hunting has, overall, declined since Europeans established a political presence in Iban areas well over a century ago. Despite pacification, the spread of formal education was slow. Charles Brooke, the Second Rajah, ‘believed that education was a worthwhile and growing force in the world, but he also knew that Western education was bound to erode the native cultures which he admired’ (Pringle 1970:139). His ambivalent attitude and his son Vyner's early attempts to continue his father's policies left Iban education entirely in the hands of the missions until well into the twentieth century (Pringle 1970:339). Nevertheless, education and other ‘modern’ forms of achievement have to some extent filled the breach in the Iban prestige system consequent on the final suppression of head-hunting. Masing explicitly compares the role of education in contemporary Iban society with the cult of head-hunting in traditional Iban communities: each in its own way could be said to open up to the individual a ‘vast new world of knowledge, skills and opportunities’ (1978:67). Furthermore, Sutlive has argued that Iban women are increasingly appropriating the traditionally male ‘cultural norm of mobility and assuming new roles’ (1977:163).' <sup id="cite_ref-779" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-779">[779]</a></sup> It appears that boys' schools were established before girls' schools and mixed schools. However, we are unsure when schools for girls were first established. We might have to modify the date of transition in the future.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Property can be owned by both males and females ♣ present ♥</b> Wealth was transmitted within longhouse families. eHRAF provides a general description of the kinship system: 'The fundamental unit of Iban society is the BILEK-family, a group of five or six persons defined by kinship and affinity. Depending upon negotiations at a couple's marriage, there is an almost even chance that their children will be born into the family of either the wife or the husband. Iban families are part of a widely ramifying kinship system which developed in response to Iban mobility. The SUKU JURU and KABAN BELAYAN correspond to the kindred. The former connotes kin ties originating with one's grandparents and includes persons to the degree of first cousin. The latter is any group of people who share rights of reciprocity with an Iban, and may include nonkin and even non-Iban. More inclusive groups include "the brotherhood" and "food-sharers", made up of distant kin who would be invited to one's festivals, or whose festivals an Iban would attend. Attachment is ambilateral and descent, ambilineal. Although some Iban are capable of reconstructing genealogies up to fifteen generations in depth, such reconstructions are selective and illustrate the Iban practice of "genealogizing" so as to establish ancestral ties with strangers.' <sup id="cite_ref-780" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-780">[780]</a></sup> 'Terms of reference are Eskimo and the terms of address, Hawaiian.' <sup id="cite_ref-781" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-781">[781]</a></sup> 'The BILEK-family is an autonomous unit, able to join with other units of a longhouse or to detach itself. Iban become members of a family through birth, adoption, marriage, or incorporation. The family is responsible for construction of its own unit, production of its own food, and management of its own affairs. In a sample of 1,051 families, 60 percent were comprised of parents and children, 40 percent included grandparents. The family is a kin-based, corporate group, holding in trust land, sacred rice, sacred charms, ritual formulas, taboos, and heirloom gongs and jars. Traditionally, one son or daughter has remained in the BILEK to ensure continuity over time. With urban migration, and mail service making possible postal remittances, an increasing number of parents have no adult child residing in the BILEK with them.' <sup id="cite_ref-782" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-782">[782]</a></sup> 'Rights to land are established by clearing and farming it, or by occupying it. Rights to the use of farmland are vested in the BILEK-family, and are held in perpetuity. These rights are maintained in the living memory of the residents of each longhouse. Boundaries are indicated by landforms or trees, or are marked by planting a row of bamboo. Except for the land overshadowed by the eaves of the longhouse, there is no land to which a community holds rights. With the introduction of surveys and titles to land in the early 1900s, Iban who lived closer to government centers obtained titles to their land, under which rights of individual families to land could be verified. As a result of increased population and the commercialization of land, some Iban have bought land for investment and speculation.' <sup id="cite_ref-783" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-783">[783]</a></sup> Both sons and daughters could inherit property: 'Male and female children share equally in rights to real and other property so long as they remain members of their natal BILEK. Children who move out of the BILEK at marriage or for any other reason receive a small portion of the family estate, and in theory relinquish all rights to family land. In fact, however, they retain the right to request land for farming at the annual meeting commencing the agricultural year.' <sup id="cite_ref-784" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-784">[784]</a></sup> 'Typically the ownership of the bilik apartment passes from parents to children. It is rare, however, for married siblings to share the same bilik , and so the apartment usually goes to just one child and his or her spouse. The remaining brothers and sisters will then marry into other bilik -families, or else establish a new bilik on their own. As will be evident from this last statement, residence patterns following marriage may be either virilocal or uxorilocal, with no particular preference being given for either one form of the other. Nor is there any formal principle - such as a rule of primogeniture - to decide which individual in a group of siblings gets to inherit the bilik in which they were born.' <sup id="cite_ref-785" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-785">[785]</a></sup> The Iban practiced both partible and nonpartible inheritance. Nonpartible property was transmitted within senior lineages attached to a continuous longhouse community: 'It is one of the axioms of Iban adat that the padi pun of a bilek is nonpartible. What then is the solution when a family sub-divides into two separate households? Briefly it is this: the senior section retains possession of the padi pun , while the seceding section is presented with one of the sangking , which is then elevated to become its padi pun . Here, clearly, we have a criterion of crucial importance for the study of the process of bilek family formation in Iban society. The senior section of a family is always definable by the fact that its padi pun was inherited as padi pun&nbsp;; while the padi pun of a seceding section is always inherited as sangking . By studying the inheritance of padi pun and sangking , therefore, it is possible to establish the main line of a family, and the various offshoots from it which have been brought about by partition.' <sup id="cite_ref-786" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-786">[786]</a></sup> 'A second non-partible object is the batu pemanggol , or ritual whetstone, which is the centre-piece of the rites that initiate the yearly farming cycle. Each bilek family possesses one of these stones which is cherished as a magical charm of most vital importance. A few Iban families, indeed, still have whetstones upon which human victims--captives taken in war--were once sacrificed. Such stones are called batu jaum , and are immeasurably valuable in Iban estimation. To divide a batu pemanggol would be to destroy it, and so, when partition takes place, it is always retained in the ancestral bilek . The seceding section, seeking an auspicious occasion, gathers a suitable-looking stone from the river bed. With a great show of solemnity, the new stone is touched on the old and then consecrated; tutelary spirits are invoked and offerings made, and finally a pig or cock is sacrificed and the blood allowed to run on the stone's surface. This stone then becomes the batu pemanggol of the seceding section.' <sup id="cite_ref-787" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-787">[787]</a></sup> 'When partition occurs then, the senior section of the family always retains the ancestral sacred rice and ritual whetstone. It may also happen that a bilek possesses some other unique magical or ritual object and, if this be the case, this too is retained by the senior section. With these exceptions, however, all the other property of the bilek is partible, and its apportionment is in accord with the relative size and the composition of the two sections resulting from the partition, following the general rule that siblings are parceners.' <sup id="cite_ref-788" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-788">[788]</a></sup> Both patrifiliation and matrifiliation were common: 'Further, membership of his (or her) natal bilek confers upon a child inheritance rights over its properties and lands, and these rights are retained as long as the individual remains a resident member. Among the Iban, then, filiation is of a special kind, for it may be either to an individual's mother's bilek or to an individual's father's bilek, but not to both at the same time. Moreover, in practice, both types of filiation occur to an approximately equal extent. We are here confronted with a fundamental principle of the Iban family system.' <sup id="cite_ref-789" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-789">[789]</a></sup> Given the practice of ambilocal residence, inheritance rights were thus determined by residence rather than gender: 'However, should a man, upon marriage, permanently leave his natal bilek , he thereby relinquishes his parcenary rights over its estate, but acquires rights in the bilek into which he marries and settles down. The same applies to a woman who marries out of her natal apartment. An affine, then, possesses parcenary rights within the bilek of which he (or she) is a resident member.' <sup id="cite_ref-790" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-790">[790]</a></sup> '10. Within the bilek family siblings have equivalent rights; in other words, they are parceners or co-heirs. If a sibling marries out he thereby relinquishes rights of inheritance in his natal bilek family, but acquires rights in the bilek family into which he marries. This rule applies equally to men and to women. When divorce occurs an individual returns to his or her natal bilek family and resumes rights there; but widows and widowers do not return to their natal bilek families. Thus, an analysis of 52 cases showed that there were 26 widows or widowers living as members of their natal bilek families, and 26 who were living in bilek families of which they were members by right of marriage and local residence.' <sup id="cite_ref-791" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-791">[791]</a></sup> 'In accordance with custom, an Iban who marries into another longhouse and joins his or her spouse's family is no longer entitled to inherit ancestral lands left behind in the former longhouse area. If such an individual has no siblings living in his or her original family bilek , these lands are left under the guardianship of the Tuai Rumah, who has authority to allow other members of the longhouse to make use of them until one of the former owner's heirs can re-establish the ancestral bilek and reclaim its lands. Only lands which are officially titled can be claimed wherever the owner lives in the country; otherwise rights of use are contigent upon the family's continual residence within the longhouse where the land is located. This means that if an Iban migrates from one river to another, he will automatically loose rights to all of his temuda lands which have no official title. If he has no sibling living in the village these lands will become available for use by the people of the longhouse he has left and are subject to reapportionment by the Tuai Rumah.' <sup id="cite_ref-792" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-792">[792]</a></sup> Both sons and daughters could initiate partition and out-marriage: '2. The bilek , with the exception of certain ritual objects, is a partible estate; and a sibling who remains in his (or her) natal bilek has the right to claim a proportionate share of the family inheritance, and set up a separate domestic unit. This is a common happening. Indeed, when two elementary families emerge [Page 8] within a bilek, partition always follows in due course. This precludes the development of joint or extended families, and nowhere in Sarawak did I encounter siblings--married and having adult children of their own--who were still living together as members of the same bilek. Again, my observations showed that partition always involves the break-up of a sibling group. When partition occurs one sibling and his (or her) family secedes from the ancestral bilek to found a new and independent household. Furthermore, this sibling is just as likely to be a man as a woman; thus, an analysis of 34 cases of partition showed that 17 founders of seceding families were males, while 17 were females. A fundamental feature of partition is that each part--after partition has occurred--is an autonomous unit in its own right, and not merely a constituent part of some wider corporate group. The partition of bilek families as it occurs in Iban society is thus a different process from segmentation as it occurs in societies based on unilineal principles.' <sup id="cite_ref-793" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-793">[793]</a></sup> Property could also be transferred to both male and female adopted children: 'If a man and his wife, after many years of marriage, are certain that they will have no child of their own, they are likely to adopt a child in order that he or she may inherit their property after they have passed away and perpetuate their bilek family. Most couples prefer to adopt a child of their closest relatives, such as a nephew or a niece. However, if their close relatives have no child whom they are willing or able to give in adoption, the couple may adopt the child of a distant cousin or an unrelated friend.' <sup id="cite_ref-794" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-794">[794]</a></sup> 'In order to make an adoption legal, the adopters must hold a formal ceremony called the Gawai Biru-iru, in which they publicly announce in the presences of guests, including at least two Tuai Rumah or a Penghulu, and their relatives who, otherwise, would inherit their property if they were to die childless, that the child is hereby adopted to be their own. By this proclamation the child is acknowledged as their legal heir with identical rights of inheritance, as if he or she were the couple's sole natural child. In future, if any argument arises over the disposal of the couple's property, the [Page 79] Tuai Rumah or Penghulu who were present at the Gawai Biru-iru, are responsible for safeguarding the rights of the adopted child in court. These rights, are identical whether the child is male or female.' <sup id="cite_ref-795" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-795">[795]</a></sup> 'We have now seen that the Iban bilek family is an autonomous, corporate group, all the resident members of which--natal, adopted and affinal--hold rights over its estate. As the Iban themselves put it: ‘Whoever stands by the bilek (i.e. remains a resident member), he (or she) possesses the belongings, possesses the valuables’ (‘ Sapa tan ka bilek, iya empu utai, empu keresa ’). This was an utterance made at Rumah Nyala in 1950 during the formal discussion of the conditions which were to govern the adoption of an infant boy, and it was made by one of the men of the adopting family. It was a public pledge that as long as the adopted child elected to remain resident in their apartment he would possess identical rights of inheritance with the other members of the family. This fundamental principle of inheritance was reiterated many times during the course of the discussion--as it always is on such occasions. finally, to clinch the matter, another of the adopting party put it even more trenclantly by abruptly asserting: ‘Whoever stands by the bilek , even be he a Kayan, a Bukitan, a Punan, an Ukit, it matters not, he is the one who inherits the property’ (‘ Sapa tan ka bilek, Kayan, Pakatan, Punan, Ukit, enda iboh, tya empu keresa ’) Now, the Kayans, the Bukitans, the Punans and the Ukits are neighbouring tribes of the Rejang headwaters; all are alien, and the Kayans and Ukits, in particular, are the bitter traditional enemies of the Iban. When this is realized, the force of the utterance just quoted will be appreciated. It affirms that even an enemy and an alien, should he come to live in an Iban bilek , would, if he maintained his residence, hold equal rights of inheritance with the other members of the family. For Iban ears there could be no more emphatic avowal than this of the principle we have been considering.' <sup id="cite_ref-796" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-796">[796]</a></sup> In-marrying affines of either sex became full members of their spouse's longhouse community: 'The position of the natal members of a bilek family in regard to inheritance is clear, for their prerogative depends on direct descent. Furthermore, as we have seen, an adopted child has conferred upon him exactly the same rights. But what of an affine whose membership dates only from the time of his (or her) marriage? By way of explanation let us consider the case of a man who marries out of his natal bilek . When such a man decides upon uxorilocal residence, and when, in the course of time, it becomes evident to all concerned that this marriage will be a lasting one, he receives from his natal bilek family a form of personal inheritance called pemai . The amount of pemai given to an out-marrying member varies considerably from case to case, for it depends largely on the degree to which the other senior members of the bilek family approve of the marriage that has been contracted. Cases do occur in which [Page 36] no pemai at all is given, while at the other extreme, planned marriages between members of wealthy families are often marked by a show of ostentation. Very commonly the pemai consists of a Chinese jar or a bronze gong, and of various smaller articles such as plates and bowls.' <sup id="cite_ref-797" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-797">[797]</a></sup> 'The giving of this pemai is an event of signal importance, for it constitutes the final fulfilling of a man's rights of inheritance as far as his natal bilek is concerned, and it further represents the formal termination of membership of his natal (or adoptive) bilek family. Henceforward, he is a full member of his wife's bilek . His pemai , or personal inheritance, becomes part of the estate of his wife's apartment, and all his energies are now devoted to the welfare of this new family; any valuables he may acquire (as, for example, on a bejalai , or journey) are the property-- meum et tuum --of this group. In other words, when a man marries out of his own apartment and into another, he has conferred upon him full jural membership of a new corporate group, with all its attendant privileges and obligations. And the same, of course, applies to a woman.' <sup id="cite_ref-798" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-798">[798]</a></sup> Freeman provides a general summary of the ineritance system: 'Having briefly described the composition of the bilek family and the way in which its members are recruited, we may turn to an examination of the principles governing inheritance, for these, under the Iban system of filiation, are of particular significance.

Despite pacification, the spread of formal education was slow. Charles Brooke, the Second Rajah, ‘believed that education was a worthwhile and growing force in the world, but he also knew that Western education was bound to erode the native cultures which he admired’ (Pringle 1970:139). His ambivalent attitude and his son Vyner's early attempts to continue his father's policies left Iban education entirely in the hands of the missions until well into the twentieth century (Pringle 1970:339). Nevertheless, education and other ‘modern’ forms of achievement have to some extent filled the breach in the Iban prestige system consequent on the final suppression of head-hunting. Masing explicitly compares the role of education in contemporary Iban society with the cult of head-hunting in traditional Iban communities: each in its own way could be said to open up to the individual a ‘vast new world of knowledge, skills and opportunities’ (1978:67). Furthermore, Sutlive has argued that Iban women are increasingly appropriating the traditionally male ‘cultural norm of mobility and assuming new roles’ (1977:163).' <sup id="cite_ref-804" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-804">[804]</a></sup></dd>

Depending upon negotiations at a couple's marriage, there is an almost even chance that their children will be born into the family of either the wife or the husband. Iban families are part of a widely ramifying kinship system which developed in response to Iban mobility. The SUKU JURU and KABAN BELAYAN correspond to the kindred. The former connotes kin ties originating with one's grandparents and includes persons to the degree of first cousin. The latter is any group of people who share rights of reciprocity with an Iban, and may include nonkin and even non-Iban. More inclusive groups include "the brotherhood" and "food-sharers", made up of distant kin who would be invited to one's festivals, or whose festivals an Iban would attend. Attachment is ambilateral and descent, ambilineal. Although some Iban are capable of reconstructing genealogies up to fifteen generations in depth, such reconstructions are selective and illustrate the Iban practice of "genealogizing" so as to establish ancestral ties with strangers.' <sup id="cite_ref-805" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-805">[805]</a></sup> 'Terms of reference are Eskimo and the terms of address, Hawaiian.' <sup id="cite_ref-806" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-806">[806]</a></sup> 'The BILEK-family is an autonomous unit, able to join with other units of a longhouse or to detach itself.

In a sample of 1,051 families, 60 percent were comprised of parents and children, 40 percent included grandparents. The family is a kin-based, corporate group, holding in trust land, sacred rice, sacred charms, ritual formulas, taboos, and heirloom gongs and jars.

In these ways, the stresses and conflicts of ordinary life, especially life in the longhouse, in which one is in more or less constant sight and sound of others, have been displaced onto the spirits.

It is rare, however, for married siblings to share the same bilik , and so the apartment usually goes to just one child and his or her spouse. The remaining brothers and sisters will then marry into other bilik -families, or else establish a new bilik on their own. As will be evident from this last statement, residence patterns following marriage may be either virilocal or uxorilocal, with no particular preference being given for either one form of the other. Nor is there any formal principle - such as a rule of primogeniture - to decide which individual in a group of siblings gets to inherit the bilik in which they were born.' <sup id="cite_ref-813" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-813">[813]</a></sup> The Iban practiced both partible and nonpartible inheritance. Nonpartible property was transmitted within senior lineages attached to a continuous longhouse community: 'It is one of the axioms of Iban adat that the padi pun of a bilek is nonpartible. What then is the solution when a family sub-divides into two separate households? Briefly it is this: the senior section retains possession of the padi pun , while the seceding section is presented with one of the sangking , which is then elevated to become its padi pun . Here, clearly, we have a criterion of crucial importance for the study of the process of bilek family formation in Iban society. The senior section of a family is always definable by the fact that its padi pun was inherited as padi pun&nbsp;; while the padi pun of a seceding section is always inherited as sangking . By studying the inheritance of padi pun and sangking , therefore, it is possible to establish the main line of a family, and the various offshoots from it which have been brought about by partition.' <sup id="cite_ref-814" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-814">[814]</a></sup> 'A second non-partible object is the batu pemanggol , or ritual whetstone, which is the centre-piece of the rites that initiate the yearly farming cycle. Each bilek family possesses one of these stones which is cherished as a magical charm of most vital importance. A few Iban families, indeed, still have whetstones upon which human victims--captives taken in war--were once sacrificed. Such stones are called batu jaum , and are immeasurably valuable in Iban estimation. To divide a batu pemanggol would be to destroy it, and so, when partition takes place, it is always retained in the ancestral bilek . The seceding section, seeking an auspicious occasion, gathers a suitable-looking stone from the river bed. With a great show of solemnity, the new stone is touched on the old and then consecrated; tutelary spirits are invoked and offerings made, and finally a pig or cock is sacrificed and the blood allowed to run on the stone's surface. This stone then becomes the batu pemanggol of the seceding section.' <sup id="cite_ref-815" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-815">[815]</a></sup> 'When partition occurs then, the senior section of the family always retains the ancestral sacred rice and ritual whetstone. It may also happen that a bilek possesses some other unique magical or ritual object and, if this be the case, this too is retained by the senior section. With these exceptions, however, all the other property of the bilek is partible, and its apportionment is in accord with the relative size and the composition of the two sections resulting from the partition, following the general rule that siblings are parceners.' <sup id="cite_ref-816" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-816">[816]</a></sup> Both patrifiliation and matrifiliation were common: 'Further, membership of his (or her) natal bilek confers upon a child inheritance rights over its properties and lands, and these rights are retained as long as the individual remains a resident member. Among the Iban, then, filiation is of a special kind, for it may be either to an individual's mother's bilek or to an individual's father's bilek, but not to both at the same time. Moreover, in practice, both types of filiation occur to an approximately equal extent. We are here confronted with a fundamental principle of the Iban family system.' <sup id="cite_ref-817" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-817">[817]</a></sup> Given the practice of ambilocal residence, inheritance rights were thus determined by residence rather than social class or gender: 'However, should a man, upon marriage, permanently leave his natal bilek , he thereby relinquishes his parcenary rights over its estate, but acquires rights in the bilek into which he marries and settles down. The same applies to a woman who marries out of her natal apartment. An affine, then, possesses parcenary rights within the bilek of which he (or she) is a resident member.' <sup id="cite_ref-818" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-818">[818]</a></sup> '10. Within the bilek family siblings have equivalent rights; in other words, they are parceners or co-heirs. If a sibling marries out he thereby relinquishes rights of inheritance in his natal bilek family, but acquires rights in the bilek family into which he marries. This rule applies equally to men and to women. When divorce occurs an individual returns to his or her natal bilek family and resumes rights there; but widows and widowers do not return to their natal bilek families. Thus, an analysis of 52 cases showed that there were 26 widows or widowers living as members of their natal bilek families, and 26 who were living in bilek families of which they were members by right of marriage and local residence.' <sup id="cite_ref-819" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-819">[819]</a></sup> 'In accordance with custom, an Iban who marries into another longhouse and joins his or her spouse's family is no longer entitled to inherit ancestral lands left behind in the former longhouse area. If such an individual has no siblings living in his or her original family bilek , these lands are left under the guardianship of the Tuai Rumah, who has authority to allow other members of the longhouse to make use of them until one of the former owner's heirs can re-establish the ancestral bilek and reclaim its lands. Only lands which are officially titled can be claimed wherever the owner lives in the country; otherwise rights of use are contigent upon the family's continual residence within the longhouse where the land is located. This means that if an Iban migrates from one river to another, he will automatically loose rights to all of his temuda lands which have no official title. If he has no sibling living in the village these lands will become available for use by the people of the longhouse he has left and are subject to reapportionment by the Tuai Rumah.' <sup id="cite_ref-820" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-820">[820]</a></sup> Freeman provides a general summary of the ineritance system: 'Having briefly described the composition of the bilek family and the way in which its members are recruited, we may turn to an examination of the principles governing inheritance, for these, under the Iban system of filiation, are of particular significance. Let us begin by considering the position of the natal and adopted members of the family. As has already been stressed, children become members by right of birth of either their father's or their mother's bilek --but it is always one or the other. Thus, the children of a man practising uxorilocal residence are the members of their mother's natal bilek , and of this local group alone. They have no rights of inheritance within their father's natal bilek, of which they are not resident members. Similarly, the children of a woman practising virilocal residence are members of their father's local group, and have no rights of inheritance in their mother's natal bilek . Adopted children are members of the bilek into which they have been adopted, and of this bilek only.' <sup id="cite_ref-821" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-821">[821]</a></sup> 'The general rule for both natural and adopted children is this: as long as they remain resident members of their own bilek family, sons and daughters possess full and equal rights of inheritance over the family estate. In other words, within a bilek siblings are parceners or co-heirs. There is thus recognition of neither primogeniture nor ultimogeniture, and no differentiation [Page 32] between the sexes, nor between natural and adopted children. Instead, in matters of inheritance, siblings are equals. Their equivalence is well expressed in the phrase: ‘ menyadi tampong pala ’ which the Iban use to describe them. These words, which have the literal meaning: ‘siblings whose heads are joined’, symbolize aptly the kind of relationship in which siblings stand. Another much-used phrase is: ‘ menyadi begulai pemai ’ meaning ‘siblings of common inheritance’.' <sup id="cite_ref-822" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-822">[822]</a></sup> 'As long then, as an individual remains resident in a bilek , he (or she) is one of the group in which ownership and inheritance are vested. Indeed, it is the family as a whole that holds common tenure of the conglomeration of property and other rights which constitute ‘the bilek ’. In other words, the Iban bilek family is a corporation aggregate. Thus, no one of its members holds the right [Page 33] to disinherit another. In life the members of a bilek are parceners, and even in death each member is entitled to his share of the family estate--that last inheritance which he carries with him to the after-world. An elder looks to his children and to his grandchildren within the bilek family to care for him in his old age, and to perform conscientiously the elaborate mortuary rites which must accompany his passing from this world to the next. To the Iban these mortuary rites and the furnishing of grave goods are matters of supreme importance, and all the senior surviving members of the bilek family are expected to join in their faithful performance. As the Iban themselves phrase it: ‘As the mortuary rites are equally performed, so equally is the bilek estate inherited’ (‘ Enti blah ngelumbong, blah empu utai ’).' <sup id="cite_ref-823" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-823">[823]</a></sup> Given the absence of social classes, this variable may not be relevant to the Iban, but we have decided to code 'present' in order to indicate that, in principle, all community members could own property.

In this, they were greatly aided by the highly comprehensive nature of traditional adat itself, which, although unwritten gave systematic definition of offences and correct punishments. Also important in this connection was the role formerly played by go-betweens. Within a longhouse respected elders frequently intervened in disputes, restraining the two sides and acting with their consent as negotiating agents. Such intervention was strongly supported by Iban values, particularly by the notion that a breach of adat or unresolved contention posed a collective [Page xxiv] spiritual danger to the well-being of all community members. Public spirited elders, including the longhouse headman and friends of the disputants, might even agree to make token compensation themselves, called sa-uta iring manok . In doing so, a speedy settlement was often achieved that avoided acrimony and possible loss of face by the principals.' <sup id="cite_ref-832" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-832">[832]</a></sup> War-leaders and headmen attained prestige, but were not entitled to exceptional deference: '150. When a man does become a tuai rumah there is no kind of initiation ceremony, nor is he given any kind of honorific title. His kindred continue to use the ordinary terms of classificatory kinship ( anak, menyadi, apai , etc.). while strangers address him as wai (friend), or with his personal name (e.g. Nyala). Towards him there are no special attitudes of deference or respect, other than he is able to command by virtue of his own personal prowess and prestige. He receives no tribute of any kind, and is entitled to no special privileges -- except in his relations with Government officials. Unless he also is a tuai burong , he has no religious duties to perform, and no sort of ritual sanctity attaches to his person or the apartment be occupies. It frequently happens, of course, that a tuai rumah is also a man of considerable personal prestige. He may, for example, be a successful head-hunter, and have sealed his renown by performing a number of the great rituals ( gawai ), which rank so high in Iban estimation. Again, being a tuai rumah does mean that a man becomes widely known, for it is usual for an Iban community to be called after its tuai rumah (e.g. Rumah Nyala, etc.). and this is undoubtedly one of the main attractions which the office has for ambitions individuals. A tuai rumah is also presented with special opportunities for meeting Europeans, and, in Iban eyes, such meetings are likely to lead to all manner of desirable results. But here, we are primarily concerned with the jural status of a tuai rumah within his own long-house. Under Iban adat a tuai rumah has no authority to command other members of the community, nor are they, in any real sense, his subordinates. Were a tuai rumah so rash as to issue commands to others, he would at once be rebuffed, and sharply. Rather, such influence as he does exert is by a subtle mixture of persuasion and admonition, for he knows that his position is dependent on the continued goodwill and approval of his anembiak , as the other members of the house are called. In many ways his role is an unenviable one. I remember tuai rumah Nyala, remarking to me with some feeling that he only ever gave his opinion when it was asked for; he would be malu (ashamed), he said, to volunteer advice to any of his anembiak , and, in any case, no-one would ever listen to him if he did.' <sup id="cite_ref-833" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-833">[833]</a></sup> Accordingly, the Iban have been characterized as an acephalous society: 'Prior to the arrival of the Brookes, the Iban present a picture of an exceedingly energetic people, waring among themselves and with others, and constantly expanding territorially, absorbing and displacing other groups of people in the process. This pattern of aggressive outward expansion continued into the 1850's and, on a more peaceful basis, even later. Throughout this traditional period, social loyalties centered on major river systems. The watersheds dividing these rivers tended to delimit major regional groups, or “tribes”, and these groups, under the leadership of senior warriors and warleaders, the raja berani, tau kayau or tau serang , constituted the maximal units of traditional society organized for aggression and territorial defence. While regional leaders sought to minimize the dangers of fratricidal conflict among their followers, their formal powers were limited almost entirely to the context of warfare. Thus Iban society was traditionally “acephelous” and totally without a centralized, hierarchical political order. Political power was dispersed between basically sovereign local communities, longhouses and kindreds. It was in this turbulent setting that traditional Iban adat evolved, as an intricate system of social rules and sanctions, in independent, highly egalitarian communities without centralized authority, which, yet, for reasons of survival, required effective means for resolving contention and preserving internal order.' <sup id="cite_ref-834" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-834">[834]</a></sup> Rights in land were held by longhouse families: 'Rights to land are established by clearing and farming it, or by occupying it.

The senior section of a family is always definable by the fact that its padi pun was inherited as padi pun&nbsp;; while the padi pun of a seceding section is always inherited as sangking . By studying the inheritance of padi pun and sangking , therefore, it is possible to establish the main line of a family, and the various offshoots from it which have been brought about by partition.' <sup id="cite_ref-836" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-836">[836]</a></sup> 'A second non-partible object is the batu pemanggol , or ritual whetstone, which is the centre-piece of the rites that initiate the yearly farming cycle. Each bilek family possesses one of these stones which is cherished as a magical charm of most vital importance. A few Iban families, indeed, still have whetstones upon which human victims--captives taken in war--were once sacrificed. Such stones are called batu jaum , and are immeasurably valuable in Iban estimation. To divide a batu pemanggol would be to destroy it, and so, when partition takes place, it is always retained in the ancestral bilek . The seceding section, seeking an auspicious occasion, gathers a suitable-looking stone from the river bed. With a great show of solemnity, the new stone is touched on the old and then consecrated; tutelary spirits are invoked and offerings made, and finally a pig or cock is sacrificed and the blood allowed to run on the stone's surface. This stone then becomes the batu pemanggol of the seceding section.' <sup id="cite_ref-837" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-837">[837]</a></sup> 'When partition occurs then, the senior section of the family always retains the ancestral sacred rice and ritual whetstone. It may also happen that a bilek possesses some other unique magical or ritual object and, if this be the case, this too is retained by the senior section. With these exceptions, however, all the other property of the bilek is partible, and its apportionment is in accord with the relative size and the composition of the two sections resulting from the partition, following the general rule that siblings are parceners.' <sup id="cite_ref-838" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-838">[838]</a></sup> Both patrifiliation and matrifiliation were common: 'Further, membership of his (or her) natal bilek confers upon a child inheritance rights over its properties and lands, and these rights are retained as long as the individual remains a resident member. Among the Iban, then, filiation is of a special kind, for it may be either to an individual's mother's bilek or to an individual's father's bilek, but not to both at the same time. Moreover, in practice, both types of filiation occur to an approximately equal extent. We are here confronted with a fundamental principle of the Iban family system.' <sup id="cite_ref-839" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-839">[839]</a></sup> Given the practice of ambilocal residence, inheritance rights were thus determined by residence rather than membership in social classes: 'However, should a man, upon marriage, permanently leave his natal bilek , he thereby relinquishes his parcenary rights over its estate, but acquires rights in the bilek into which he marries and settles down. The same applies to a woman who marries out of her natal apartment. An affine, then, possesses parcenary rights within the bilek of which he (or she) is a resident member.' <sup id="cite_ref-840" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-840">[840]</a></sup> '10. Within the bilek family siblings have equivalent rights; in other words, they are parceners or co-heirs. If a sibling marries out he thereby relinquishes rights of inheritance in his natal bilek family, but acquires rights in the bilek family into which he marries. This rule applies equally to men and to women. When divorce occurs an individual returns to his or her natal bilek family and resumes rights there; but widows and widowers do not return to their natal bilek families. Thus, an analysis of 52 cases showed that there were 26 widows or widowers living as members of their natal bilek families, and 26 who were living in bilek families of which they were members by right of marriage and local residence.' <sup id="cite_ref-841" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-841">[841]</a></sup> 'In accordance with custom, an Iban who marries into another longhouse and joins his or her spouse's family is no longer entitled to inherit ancestral lands left behind in the former longhouse area. If such an individual has no siblings living in his or her original family bilek , these lands are left under the guardianship of the Tuai Rumah, who has authority to allow other members of the longhouse to make use of them until one of the former owner's heirs can re-establish the ancestral bilek and reclaim its lands. Only lands which are officially titled can be claimed wherever the owner lives in the country; otherwise rights of use are contigent upon the family's continual residence within the longhouse where the land is located. This means that if an Iban migrates from one river to another, he will automatically loose rights to all of his temuda lands which have no official title. If he has no sibling living in the village these lands will become available for use by the people of the longhouse he has left and are subject to reapportionment by the Tuai Rumah.' <sup id="cite_ref-842" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-842">[842]</a></sup> Freeman provides a general summary of the property system: 'Having briefly described the composition of the bilek family and the way in which its members are recruited, we may turn to an examination of the principles governing inheritance, for these, under the Iban system of filiation, are of particular significance. Let us begin by considering the position of the natal and adopted members of the family. As has already been stressed, children become members by right of birth of either their father's or their mother's bilek --but it is always one or the other. Thus, the children of a man practising uxorilocal residence are the members of their mother's natal bilek , and of this local group alone. They have no rights of inheritance within their father's natal bilek, of which they are not resident members. Similarly, the children of a woman practising virilocal residence are members of their father's local group, and have no rights of inheritance in their mother's natal bilek . Adopted children are members of the bilek into which they have been adopted, and of this bilek only.' <sup id="cite_ref-843" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-843">[843]</a></sup> 'The general rule for both natural and adopted children is this: as long as they remain resident members of their own bilek family, sons and daughters possess full and equal rights of inheritance over the family estate. In other words, within a bilek siblings are parceners or co-heirs. There is thus recognition of neither primogeniture nor ultimogeniture, and no differentiation [Page 32] between the sexes, nor between natural and adopted children. Instead, in matters of inheritance, siblings are equals. Their equivalence is well expressed in the phrase: ‘ menyadi tampong pala ’ which the Iban use to describe them. These words, which have the literal meaning: ‘siblings whose heads are joined’, symbolize aptly the kind of relationship in which siblings stand. Another much-used phrase is: ‘ menyadi begulai pemai ’ meaning ‘siblings of common inheritance’.' <sup id="cite_ref-844" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-844">[844]</a></sup> 'As long then, as an individual remains resident in a bilek , he (or she) is one of the group in which ownership and inheritance are vested. Indeed, it is the family as a whole that holds common tenure of the conglomeration of property and other rights which constitute ‘the bilek ’. In other words, the Iban bilek family is a corporation aggregate. Thus, no one of its members holds the right [Page 33] to disinherit another. In life the members of a bilek are parceners, and even in death each member is entitled to his share of the family estate--that last inheritance which he carries with him to the after-world. An elder looks to his children and to his grandchildren within the bilek family to care for him in his old age, and to perform conscientiously the elaborate mortuary rites which must accompany his passing from this world to the next. To the Iban these mortuary rites and the furnishing of grave goods are matters of supreme importance, and all the senior surviving members of the bilek family are expected to join in their faithful performance. As the Iban themselves phrase it: ‘As the mortuary rites are equally performed, so equally is the bilek estate inherited’ (‘ Enti blah ngelumbong, blah empu utai ’).' <sup id="cite_ref-845" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-845">[845]</a></sup> Accordingly, we cannot characterize the Iban as organized in social classes. For information on enslavement see below.</dd></dl>
<p><b>♠ social mobility ♣ ♥</b>  The Iban were organized in relatively autonomous residential longhouse communities rather than social classes: 'The fundamental unit of Iban society is the BILEK-family, a group of five or six persons defined by kinship and affinity. Depending upon negotiations at a couple's marriage, there is an almost even chance that their children will be born into the family of either the wife or the husband. Iban families are part of a widely ramifying kinship system which developed in response to Iban mobility. The SUKU JURU and KABAN BELAYAN correspond to the kindred. The former connotes kin ties originating with one's grandparents and includes persons to the degree of first cousin. The latter is any group of people who share rights of reciprocity with an Iban, and may include nonkin and even non-Iban. More inclusive groups include "the brotherhood" and "food-sharers", made up of distant kin who would be invited to one's festivals, or whose festivals an Iban would attend. Attachment is ambilateral and descent, ambilineal. Although some Iban are capable of reconstructing genealogies up to fifteen generations in depth, such reconstructions are selective and illustrate the Iban practice of "genealogizing" so as to establish ancestral ties with strangers.' <sup id="cite_ref-846" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-846">[846]</a></sup> 'Terms of reference are Eskimo and the terms of address, Hawaiian.' <sup id="cite_ref-847" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-847">[847]</a></sup> 'The BILEK-family is an autonomous unit, able to join with other units of a longhouse or to detach itself. Iban become members of a family through birth, adoption, marriage, or incorporation. The family is responsible for construction of its own unit, production of its own food, and management of its own affairs. In a sample of 1,051 families, 60 percent were comprised of parents and children, 40 percent included grandparents. The family is a kin-based, corporate group, holding in trust land, sacred rice, sacred charms, ritual formulas, taboos, and heirloom gongs and jars. Traditionally, one son or daughter has remained in the BILEK to ensure continuity over time. With urban migration, and mail service making possible postal remittances, an increasing number of parents have no adult child residing in the BILEK with them.' <sup id="cite_ref-848" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-848">[848]</a></sup> 'Each longhouse, as each BILEK, is an autonomous unit. Traditionally the core of each house was a group of descendants of the founders. Houses near one another on the same river or in the same region were commonly allied, marrying among themselves, raiding together beyond their territories, and resolving disputes by peaceful means. Regionalism, deriving from these alliances, in which Iban distinguished themselves from other allied groups, persist in modern state politics. Essentially egalitarian, Iban are aware of long-standing status distinctions among themselves of RAJA BERANI (wealthy and brave), MENSI SARIBU (commoners), and ULUN (slaves). Prestige still accrues to descendants of the first status, disdain to descendants of the third.' <sup id="cite_ref-849" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-849">[849]</a></sup> Social control and authority were informal: 'Prior to the arrival of the British adventurer, James Brooke, there were no permanent leaders, but the affairs of each house were directed by consultations of family leaders. Men of influence included renowned warriors, bards, augurs and other specialists. Brooke, who became Rajah of Sarawak, and his nephew, Charles Johnson, created political positions -- headman (TUAI RUMAH), regional chief (PENGHULU), paramount chief (TEMENGGONG) -- to restructure Iban society for administrative control, especially for purposes of taxation and the suppression of head-hunting. The creation of permanent political positions and the establishment of political parties in the early 1960s have profoundly changed the Iban.' <sup id="cite_ref-850" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-850">[850]</a></sup> 'Iban employ three strategies of social control. First, from childhood, they are taught to avoid conflict, and for a majority, every effort is made to prevent it. Second, they are taught by story and drama of the existence of numerous spirits, who vigilantly ensure observation of numerous taboos; some spirits are interested in preserving the peace, while others are responsible for any strife that arises. In these ways, the stresses and conflicts of ordinary life, especially life in the longhouse, in which one is in more or less constant sight and sound of others, have been displaced onto the spirits. Third, the headman hears disputes between members of the same house, the regional chief, disputes between members of different houses, and government officers, hear those disputes that headmen and regional chiefs cannot resolve.' <sup id="cite_ref-851" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-851">[851]</a></sup> 'Traditionally Iban leaders sought to settle disputes, as far as possible, through negotiation and attempted to avert recourse to self-help and other means that might potentially lead to open violence. In this, they were greatly aided by the highly comprehensive nature of traditional adat itself, which, although unwritten gave systematic definition of offences and correct punishments. Also important in this connection was the role formerly played by go-betweens. Within a longhouse respected elders frequently intervened in disputes, restraining the two sides and acting with their consent as negotiating agents. Such intervention was strongly supported by Iban values, particularly by the notion that a breach of adat or unresolved contention posed a collective [Page xxiv] spiritual danger to the well-being of all community members. Public spirited elders, including the longhouse headman and friends of the disputants, might even agree to make token compensation themselves, called sa-uta iring manok . In doing so, a speedy settlement was often achieved that avoided acrimony and possible loss of face by the principals.' <sup id="cite_ref-852" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-852">[852]</a></sup> War-leaders and headmen attained prestige, but were not entitled to exceptional deference: '150. When a man does become a tuai rumah there is no kind of initiation ceremony, nor is he given any kind of honorific title. His kindred continue to use the ordinary terms of classificatory kinship ( anak, menyadi, apai , etc.). while strangers address him as wai (friend), or with his personal name (e.g. Nyala). Towards him there are no special attitudes of deference or respect, other than he is able to command by virtue of his own personal prowess and prestige. He receives no tribute of any kind, and is entitled to no special privileges -- except in his relations with Government officials. Unless he also is a tuai burong , he has no religious duties to perform, and no sort of ritual sanctity attaches to his person or the apartment be occupies. It frequently happens, of course, that a tuai rumah is also a man of considerable personal prestige. He may, for example, be a successful head-hunter, and have sealed his renown by performing a number of the great rituals ( gawai ), which rank so high in Iban estimation. Again, being a tuai rumah does mean that a man becomes widely known, for it is usual for an Iban community to be called after its tuai rumah (e.g. Rumah Nyala, etc.). and this is undoubtedly one of the main attractions which the office has for ambitions individuals. A tuai rumah is also presented with special opportunities for meeting Europeans, and, in Iban eyes, such meetings are likely to lead to all manner of desirable results. But here, we are primarily concerned with the jural status of a tuai rumah within his own long-house. Under Iban adat a tuai rumah has no authority to command other members of the community, nor are they, in any real sense, his subordinates. Were a tuai rumah so rash as to issue commands to others, he would at once be rebuffed, and sharply. Rather, such influence as he does exert is by a subtle mixture of persuasion and admonition, for he knows that his position is dependent on the continued goodwill and approval of his anembiak , as the other members of the house are called. In many ways his role is an unenviable one. I remember tuai rumah Nyala, remarking to me with some feeling that he only ever gave his opinion when it was asked for; he would be malu (ashamed), he said, to volunteer advice to any of his anembiak , and, in any case, no-one would ever listen to him if he did.' <sup id="cite_ref-853" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-853">[853]</a></sup> Accordingly, the Iban have been characterized as an acephalous society: 'Prior to the arrival of the Brookes, the Iban present a picture of an exceedingly energetic people, waring among themselves and with others, and constantly expanding territorially, absorbing and displacing other groups of people in the process. This pattern of aggressive outward expansion continued into the 1850's and, on a more peaceful basis, even later. Throughout this traditional period, social loyalties centered on major river systems. The watersheds dividing these rivers tended to delimit major regional groups, or “tribes”, and these groups, under the leadership of senior warriors and warleaders, the raja berani, tau kayau or tau serang , constituted the maximal units of traditional society organized for aggression and territorial defence. While regional leaders sought to minimize the dangers of fratricidal conflict among their followers, their formal powers were limited almost entirely to the context of warfare. Thus Iban society was traditionally “acephelous” and totally without a centralized, hierarchical political order. Political power was dispersed between basically sovereign local communities, longhouses and kindreds. It was in this turbulent setting that traditional Iban adat evolved, as an intricate system of social rules and sanctions, in independent, highly egalitarian communities without centralized authority, which, yet, for reasons of survival, required effective means for resolving contention and preserving internal order.' <sup id="cite_ref-854" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-854">[854]</a></sup> Rights in land were held by longhouse families: 'Rights to land are established by clearing and farming it, or by occupying it. Rights to the use of farmland are vested in the BILEK-family, and are held in perpetuity. These rights are maintained in the living memory of the residents of each longhouse. Boundaries are indicated by landforms or trees, or are marked by planting a row of bamboo. Except for the land overshadowed by the eaves of the longhouse, there is no land to which a community holds rights. With the introduction of surveys and titles to land in the early 1900s, Iban who lived closer to government centers obtained titles to their land, under which rights of individual families to land could be verified. As a result of increased population and the commercialization of land, some Iban have bought land for investment and speculation.' <sup id="cite_ref-855" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-855">[855]</a></sup> The Iban practiced both partible and nonpartible inheritance. Nonpartible property was transmitted within senior lineages attached to a continuous longhouse community: 'It is one of the axioms of Iban adat that the padi pun of a bilek is nonpartible. What then is the solution when a family sub-divides into two separate households? Briefly it is this: the senior section retains possession of the padi pun , while the seceding section is presented with one of the sangking , which is then elevated to become its padi pun . Here, clearly, we have a criterion of crucial importance for the study of the process of bilek family formation in Iban society.

<dl><dd> <b>♠ recruitment of chief executive ♣ ♥</b> Longhouse communities were headed by leaders doubling as village functionaries: 'In every Iban long-house there are two offices of great importance--one secular and the other ritual. They are the positions of tuai rumah   and tuai burong  . In most long-houses they are held by different individuals, but it is perfectly permissible for one man to hold both offices, and in some communities this does happen. Neither position is ever held by a woman. (c.f. Footnote No. 22). When used as an adjective, the word tuai   means old, or mature, but as a noun it refers to any senior and influential member of a community. Here, the emphasis is not primarily on age, but on the personal qualities of the individual concerned. Thus, a party of young men setting off on an expedition ( bejalai  ), to gather jungle produce, always has its leader, or tuai  , though he may be no more than in his early twenties. And in long-house communities, able, though only middle-aged men often come to exert very considerable authority and influence.

His kindred continue to use the ordinary terms of classificatory kinship ( anak, menyadi, apai , etc.). while strangers address him as wai (friend), or with his personal name (e.g. Nyala). Towards him there are no special attitudes of deference or respect, other than he is able to command by virtue of his own personal prowess and prestige. He receives no tribute of any kind, and is entitled to no special privileges -- except in his relations with Government officials. Unless he also is a tuai burong , he has no religious duties to perform, and no sort of ritual sanctity attaches to his person or the apartment be occupies. It frequently happens, of course, that a tuai rumah is also a man of considerable personal prestige. He may, for example, be a successful head-hunter, and have sealed his renown by performing a number of the great rituals ( gawai ), which rank so high in Iban estimation. Again, being a tuai rumah does mean that a man becomes widely known, for it is usual for an Iban community to be called after its tuai rumah (e.g. Rumah Nyala, etc.). and this is undoubtedly one of the main attractions which the office has for ambitions individuals. A tuai rumah is also presented with special opportunities for meeting Europeans, and, in Iban eyes, such meetings are likely to lead to all manner of desirable results. But here, we are primarily concerned with the jural status of a tuai rumah within his own long-house. Under Iban adat a tuai rumah has no authority to command other members of the community, nor are they, in any real sense, his subordinates. Were a tuai rumah so rash as to issue commands to others, he would at once be rebuffed, and sharply. Rather, such influence as he does exert is by a subtle mixture of persuasion and admonition, for he knows that his position is dependent on the continued goodwill and approval of his anembiak , as the other members of the house are called. In many ways his role is an unenviable one. I remember tuai rumah Nyala, remarking to me with some feeling that he only ever gave his opinion when it was asked for; he would be malu (ashamed), he said, to volunteer advice to any of his anembiak , and, in any case, no-one would ever listen to him if he did.' <sup id="cite_ref-870" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-870">[870]</a></sup> Headmanship was determined by individual ability rather than predetermined social status: 'It is also within these sectors that we find specialisation and whatever limited leadership there is above the bilek level. This is embodied in the tuai rumah (house headman) and the tuai burong (augur). The foremost accomplishment of the tuai rumah is a sound knowledge of Iban customary law, adat , but he should also possess oratorical skill and the ability to serve as a mediator. It should be remembered that the adat not only signifies law in our western sense as a set of rules ordering social interaction, it has a wider implication of relating Iban society to the supra-human sphere, and it is extremely vital that the balance between these two ‘worlds’ does not get upset. The tuai rumah is thus the expounder of the law and the arbitrator between opposing parties on one level but through his meting out ‘fines’, or rather atonements, he is instrumental in restoring harmony between this level and a higher one. He can resort to no sanctions to ascertain that his rulings are carried out and there is no need for this either as the pressure to rectify, originates in the spiritual sphere which if necessary could be implemented by social sanctions by other members of the community, who themselves face ritual danger because of the actions of the malfeasant. Thus the tuai rumah does not enact his role within a formal institution of leadership but attains his standing through knowledge of adat , shrewdness of judgment and eloquent skills. Should he lose any of these “charismatic” qualities, which I think would manifest itself through inter-community strife and possibly natural mishaps, the people will leave him and the longhouse that carries his name and seek out some other community which they could join by employing the wide net of kindred. Alternatively there is the possibility of rejecting a non-satisfactory tuai rumah and [Page 101] choosing a new one.' <sup id="cite_ref-871" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-871">[871]</a></sup> T'My suggestion then is that individual achievement and charismatic style had a sociological significance in the Iban social system. If we look at the Iban kinship system in relation to the local community it becomes apparent that kinship links, however highly valued, did not suffice to tie the individual family-unit, the bilek , to one longhouse community only. The bilek , which was, and is, an autonomous and jural entity of unlimited life, could at any stage detach itself from the longhouse and move elsewhere. The community was thus an aggregation of such individual units. This was further evident in the structure of the longhouse domicile itself, because a departing bilek could, after having paid the ritual fine ( pemali fine) literally cemove the building material of its bilek apartment when it left the house. If the removing bilek was not situated at either end of the house this would mean that the longhouse would be broken into two parts with a gap in between. In the prevailing social system there was no institutionalized way in which to apply coercion to prevent the departure of individual bilek in order to safeguard the continued life of the community. It is in this context that I think we have to consider the roles of the war-leader [Page 135] and/or house headman, whom I will simply refer to as the leader hereafter. His role was the embodiment of the various aspects of success and through this he supplied the “social cement” that Helped both in founding a community and in keeping it together.' <sup id="cite_ref-872" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-872">[872]</a></sup> There was no hereditary succession: 'The economic self-sufficiency of the bilik  -family is reflected in other areas of Iban social life. Unlike the Kayan, Kenyah, pagan Melanau and several other Bornean peoples, the Iban are not divided into social classes.  Nor is there any  form of institutionalized leadership based upon hereditary succession, or some other socially divisive principle. Instead Iban society is characterized by a strongly egalitarian ethos. In this respect, each bilik  -family jurally constitutes a discrete and autonomous social unit, which manages its own affairs and recognizes no higher authority than that of its own household head.' <sup id="cite_ref-873" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-873">[873]</a></sup> 'As there is no formal institution of headman-ship and there is the possibility of rejection by the community, it is logical that the position of tuai rumah can not be inherited. At times this might not be appreciated and when there are cases of this office remaining within the same bilek -family or being taken over by some very close relative outside the bilek one could easily be led to believe that the office was hereditary or semi-hereditary. This can probably be explained by seeing that the likelihood of a close male relative - women never hold this office - learning the adat and the much admired oratorical skills is much greater than for somebody else not so closely involved with the tuai rumah .' <sup id="cite_ref-874" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-874">[874]</a></sup> Accordingly, the Iban have been characterized as an acephalous society: 'Prior to the arrival of the Brookes, the Iban present a picture of an exceedingly energetic people, waring among themselves and with others, and constantly expanding territorially, absorbing and displacing other groups of people in the process. This pattern of aggressive outward expansion continued into the 1850's and, on a more peaceful basis, even later. Throughout this traditional period, social loyalties centered on major river systems. The watersheds dividing these rivers tended to delimit major regional groups, or “tribes”, and these groups, under the leadership of senior warriors and warleaders, the raja berani, tau kayau or tau serang , constituted the maximal units of traditional society organized for aggression and territorial defence. While regional leaders sought to minimize the dangers of fratricidal conflict among their followers, their formal powers were limited almost entirely to the context of warfare. Thus Iban society was traditionally “acephelous” and totally without a centralized, hierarchical political order. Political power was dispersed between basically sovereign local communities, longhouses and kindreds. It was in this turbulent setting that traditional Iban adat evolved, as an intricate system of social rules and sanctions, in independent, highly egalitarian communities without centralized authority, which, yet, for reasons of survival, required effective means for resolving contention and preserving internal order.' <sup id="cite_ref-875" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-875">[875]</a></sup>  The mediating abilities of headmen impacted the viability of longhouse communities: 'The number of bilek -families making up a longhouse community varies a great deal. There may be from just a few up to twenty, thirty or even more in a few cases. Many factors are included; the quality and quantity of land in the area, whether past harvests have been good or not, the stage of the development cycle of the bilek -families of the house, equally also the stage of the dampa system cycle in which the community finds itself, and whether it is in a pioneer area or in a long-settled district. The degree of communal strife, which indirectly reflects on the [Page 91] mediating ability of the tuai rumah is probably also a factor to be taken into account. After initial establishment in a new area by a core group of pioneering households, the house grows to its maximum size, at all times dependent on these variables, and in communities with a traditional type of agriculture the ecological factor will decide the upper limit after which one can expect a period of decrease until the community is no longer viable.' <sup id="cite_ref-876" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-876">[876]</a></sup> Historically, pioneers were charismatic war-leaders: 'From Benedict Sandin's ethnohistorical account it is clear that the pioneering leaders that came northwards from the Kapuas region were war-leaders as well as men of some wealth, and that their followers - kin-affiliation aside - were attracted to them for these very reasons. Former success in war meant that the followers would have confidence in their leader's ability both in attacking others and also in the defence of the home community, either through actual combat or through a reputation that would intimidate others. The wealth of the leader also would enable the payment of compensations should this become necessary (p. 155), and his ability to speak well would unite his followers against the outside and also aid in settling disputes or disagreements between members of the community. These various factors added up to the charisma of the leader and helped in binding the units together. Should his strength and ability lessen or even disappear this would immediately manifest itself in the lack of success and if this was a continuing trend, his followers, that is the different bilek entities, would seek to attach themselves to another longhouse or to establish a new one. There was also a possibility of ousting the leader and appointing someone else, believed to possess the qualities giving superior strength against others, good harvests and the absence of illness and death.' <sup id="cite_ref-877" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-877">[877]</a></sup> 'In Iban social crganisation there seem to be two opposing principles at work, one favouring cohesion of the local community, the other tending towards fragmentation by emphasising the autonomy of the primary unit, the bilek family. Factors working towards unity are to be sought in terms of kinship and ritual harmony, because there was as we have seen earlier, a high degree of local endogamy making for a close network and also the [Page 136] idea that decisions involving the whole community could only be reached after general discussion. Obedience to the adat and the observance of the omens also involved the whole community, because if the harmony became upset this would endanger the whole longhouse and show itself in misfortune and death. Although earlier writers on the Iban have remarked that the position of the “chief” was not a very strong one, because it did not correspond to the formal hierarchy of the Western world, I suggest that his role was of great importance in holding the local community together. His charisma and continuing success, which also was the success of the community, added to the centripetal forces and taken together meant that there could be lasting communities in spite of the atomistic character that the autonomy of the bilek imparts to Iban social organisation.' <sup id="cite_ref-878" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-878">[878]</a></sup> 'The question immediately springs to mind in this context: was the type of Iban leadership a function of the basic economy which necessitated continuous movement? If we compare the Iban with the Kayan it immediately becomes apparent that this was not the case. The Kayan had the same type of basic economy as the Iban, yet in their social organisation we find a rather rigid class structure and institutionalized leadership. There must have been other conditions that obtained for the Iban that account for this difference. I would suggest that the competition and warring that most likely started the Iban migrations into Sarawak would be conditions favouring the emergence of non-formalized leadership (if it did not obtain before, of which we know nothing). The charismatic leader would then be a prime agent in effecting communal cohesion, especially if the context was that of continuing disruption. It would also seem reasonable that there would be competition for leadership as every bilek unit was, in a sense, politically independent. Iban men, especially the younger males, would seek to display achievement within the fields constituting this success paradigm. They would try to excell in warring, raiding and head-taking, in amassing [Page 137] jungle-produce when on bejalai which could be converted into prestige items, and they would try to become skilled in oratory and the knowledge of the adat . Although this is a hypothetical discussion, such an interpretation seems to fit the historical and sociological facts and also helps to explain why the Iban men should have displayed an expressive life-style.' <sup id="cite_ref-879" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-879">[879]</a></sup> 'This, of course, is a process that easily leads to escalation and it is probable that the high degree of raiding, head-taking and “piracy” that made the Saribas and Skrang Iban so notorious at the middle of the last century, not only mirrored the prestige and its “inflationary spiral” that Morgan has discussed, but also was the logical consequence of an overextension of charismatic leadership and the competition for this position. Certain ecological considerations need also to be taken into account here; soils and climate together would have to be such that increasingly larger communities could be supported. If this was the case then increased strength both economically and as a fighting force would be favourable factors in any confrontation with outside adversaries. The large settlements seen by James Brooke and his companions in the down-river areas of the First and Second Division support such an argument. Whether centrifugal tendencies would have increased and again broken up these large longhouse communities had the Brooke raj not been created, is naturally impossible to say. The change of the ecology factor as well as the increased defence potential of a larger community might equally well have led to greater stability. It seems clear, however, that the introduction of “law and order”, the reorganization of warfare and head-hunting and the increased opportunities in the economic sector would have a direct effect on the leadership. It is against this background that I presume Sandin to be justified when he talks about leadership amongst the Saribas Iban as being hereditary, because these new conditions would favour the institutionalization of the leadership in a more formal shape.' <sup id="cite_ref-880" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-880">[880]</a></sup> Even after the formalization of offices undertaken in the colonial period, authority remained fluid in practice: 'With the coming of the Europeans a certain formalising of the role of the tuai rumah took place by investing it with legal and administrative powers as an agent of the government. In the same manner, influential leaders within territorial groupings, who often were war-leaders able to draw large followings, were elevated to district headmen ( penghulu ), a formal position with little correspondence to the factual and fluctuating basis for their authority. In fact the idea of leadership within Iban society appears so fluid and situational that an impromptu leader for any group undertaking, however small, is referred to as tuai .' <sup id="cite_ref-881" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-881">[881]</a></sup> Given the absence of social classes (see above) and the fluid nature of authority, this variable may not be applicable to the Iban.</dd>

<p><b>♠ occupational mobility ♣ absent ♥</b> Most Iban were subsistence horticulturalists: 'The primary activity of a majority of Iban is rice farming. In the hills, farmers practice swidden cultivation of fields averaging one hectare. Each family maintains its own seed bank of rice, and plants between one dozen and two dozen varieties in any year. At the center of its field they plant their sacred rice (PADI PUN), a gift of some spirit to an ancestor which has been retained over generations to recall the origins of that family. Given the uncertainties of rice farming in the hills, dozens of ritual acts are performed to ensure a successful crop. At the end of April, the head of the house holds a meeting of all family heads to discuss farm sites and an approximate date for the first rites. The meeting ensures that all residents coordinate their activities and that the rice matures at about the same time. Simultaneous maturation is critical because it helps reduce the losses of any one family to insects, birds, and wild animals who spread themselves over several fields rather than concentrate on just one. It also permits families to coordinate their harvest rituals. Auguries are taken in June, farms are cleared in June and July, and burned over in August or September. When the rice has ripened, it is informed through ritual that it is to be harvested and transported back to the longhouse. On the last day of harvest, farmers make an offering to the final stand of rice to ensure that the soul of the rice will return to the house with them, and not remain behind in the ground. In the plains, farmers practice farming of wet rice in permanent fields. Introduction of herbicides, pesticides and commercial fertilizers have permitted Iban to remove vegetation, control weeds and insects, and increase the yields of their farms. With much greater control over the success of their efforts, farmers rely much less on ritual.' <sup id="cite_ref-882" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-882">[882]</a></sup> 'In addition to rice, farmers plant gourds, pumpkins, cucumbers, maize and cassava. Rice is complemented with a variety of jungle vegetables and fruits collected by men and women for consumption with the evening and morning meals.' <sup id="cite_ref-883" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-883">[883]</a></sup> 'Fishing has provided the principal source of protein in the Iban diet, but logging and consequent silting of many streams and rivers have greatly reduced the numbers of fish. Techniques of fishing are sophisticated and adjusted according to the conditions of the waters. Fish traps are placed in constricted streams, and large nets inclined over larger streams. Fish are taken with the seine or with hooks. Hunting of wild pigs and deer, using dogs, traps, and nets, varies from community to community, according to the region, forest conditions, and animal population. Almost all families keep chickens and pigs, and every longhouse has dogs. Chickens, pigs and water buffalo are used in sacrifices, and eggs are an essential ingredient of any offering.' <sup id="cite_ref-884" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-884">[884]</a></sup> Seasonal piracy expeditions were common and were transformed into seasonal labour migrations in the colonial and post-colonial periods: 'As can be seen in the breakdown of the Iban agricultural year shown in Figure 1.4, there is a definite division of labor based on sex. During the period of time from roughly November through April each year Iban males  have no specific duties associated with farming and are free to engage in outside activities, such as cash cropping, hunting and fishing and temporary wage labor. It is hypothesized that what was at one time a practice limited to this time span has developed into the contemporary Iban custom of bejalai, a status-validating temporary migration which in the present day may extend over an entire year or more.' <sup id="cite_ref-885" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-885">[885]</a></sup> Even during the colonial period, wage labour was mostly temporary and practiced during the seasonal labour migrations of Iban men: 'The most important commercial activity for the largest number of Iban men has been the institutionalized BEJALAI, or journey to work for wages. In some longhouses almost all able-bodied men are away at any given time, working for a distant logging company or in the oilfields of northern Borneo. Wage-earning enabled men to buy jars, gongs, and other valuables for their families. Rubber and pepper have provided an unstable source of income, as has cocoa, a recent introduction. The attraction of salaried jobs is one of the principal reasons for Iban urban migration. Iban are employed in every major occupational category in Sarawak's cities.' <sup id="cite_ref-886" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-886">[886]</a></sup> Davison provides a generally summary of the economic system: 'The Iban are shifting agriculturalists, whose subsistence economy has traditionally been based upon the cultivation of hill rice, or padi . Each bilik -family is an economically independent land-owning unit, whose individual members hold joint and equal rights in the family estate. Land ownership is established by the felling of primary forest, with usufructury rights maintained for as long as the bilik -family continues to exist, or at least remains resident within the longhouse community. Most bilik will also own sago and cocoa plantations, wild or semi-wild fruit trees, rubber small holdings, pepper gardens, pigs and poultry. In addition, each family will also possess its own farming equipment, tools, weapons, shotguns, canoes and other essential items needed in everyday life. In more recent times, those who are better-off will have long-boats, outboard engines and luxury items such as videos, bedding, furniture and other modern conveniences.' <sup id="cite_ref-887" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-887">[887]</a></sup> 'Rice is also a source of disposable income - at least in those years when harvest yields exceed the annual rate of consumption. This “capital” may be exchanged for essential goods, such as salt and iron, or can alternatively be used to purchase luxury items - traditionally Chinese ceramics and local brasswares, but more recently, videos, cassette-players and other Western consumer products. Surplus rice supplies may also be put towards the sponsorship of a festival, or gawai , bringing prestige and social status to the families who do so.' <sup id="cite_ref-888" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-888">[888]</a></sup> Given the importance of subsistence horticulture, occupational mobility was probably absent.

<p><b>♠ Proportion of population enslaved ♣ unknown: 1841-1900 CE; 0%: 1901-1987 CE ♥</b> The Iban practiced war capture and debt peonage: 'The right to own slaves ( ulun ) and serfs ( jaum or pengurang ) was enjoyed by Iban leaders and warriors since time immemorial. Ulun are captives in war, whereas jaum are debt-servants who were unable to pay their debts due to poverty. The descendants of both ulun and jaum remain the property of their owners until they can free themselves by paying their debt or by holding a festival called a gawai betembang , in which they are freed with the mutual consent of their masters.' <sup id="cite_ref-889" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-889">[889]</a></sup> The Iban regularly enslaved captives taken on raids: 'The Iban trace their origins to the Kapuas Lake region of Kalimantan. With a growing population creating pressures on limited amounts of productive land, the Iban fought members of other tribes aggressively, practicing headhunting and slavery. Enslavement of captives contributed to the necessity to move into new areas. By the middle of the 19th century, they were well established in the First and Second Divisions, and a few had pioneered the vast Rejang River valley.' <sup id="cite_ref-890" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-890">[890]</a></sup> ‘Whether it was due to Malay inspiration or not, head-taking amongst the Saribas and Skrang Iban reached very high proportions, and Morgan has regarded this as a kind of inflationary spiral generated by the high prestige that accrued to success in warlike expeditions. On the other hand, it is evident that a division of plunder, that only gave the heads to the Iban and the rest of the booty to the Malay - as is maintained by some of the earlier writers - is somewhat simplistic, as the Iban also had an interest in arms and other prestige items. The older sources mention, however, that the Iban also took slaves on these raiding expeditions and that the captives were usually women and children. These captives were probably absorbed into the households of their captors where they provided additional labour. With an agricultural system of a type where the size of the area farmed depends very much on the labour available to carry out the arduous but very necessary weeding, it can be argued that the capture of additional women and children to help with the production of the basic staple - padi - will allow an inflation in masculine activities such as warfare and head-hunting since it allows the men to retract from the agricultural sphere.’ <sup id="cite_ref-891" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-891">[891]</a></sup> Slaves were sacrificed occasionally: '95. Throughout the Third Division, stories are told of the punishment meted out to an incestuous couple, in the old days before the coming of Rajah Brooke. On some prominent headland a pit was dug, and into it was cast the offending couple, still alive but trussed together, the woman supine and the man prone. Through their bodies a sharpened bamboo ( aur ) stake was driven, and prayers of expiation uttered. Then the pit was filled in, and the bamboo left to grow, as a sign to future generations. On a head-land at the mouth of Sungai Poi, for example, there stands a great clump of bamboos which are never cut. I seldom passed this point, on my journeys up and down the Rejang, without one of my Iban companions turning to remark, that here, not so many years ago, the rite of pantang , had been performed over the bodies of an incestuous couple. Tales are also told of slaves, captured in war, being sacrificed as part of the rites of expiation which always follow serious cases of incest. That this did occur there can be no doubt, for the second Rajah (then Tuan Muda), records that following the great expedition of 1863, an old Kayan woman was sacrificed by the Iban of the Katibas, the direct ancestors of the Iban now occupying the Baleh. Those responsible were severely reprimanded and fined 12 rusa jars. The blood of the sacrificial victim was smeared over the ritual whet-stones ( batu pemanggol ) of all the inhabitants of the region, for it was believed that this would offset the dire harm with which incestuous behaviour threatened their padi . Whet-stones which have had sacrificial human blood smeared upon them, are termed batu jaum , and rank extremely high among the inheritable ritual possessions of the Iban. Nowadays, when incest occurs, both individuals are heavily fined, and the man is often imprisoned. A proportion of the fine is always set aside as plasi menoa , literally, “in expiation of the land.” It is divided up among all the surrounding long-house communities, and used by them to buy a pig or fowl, the sacrifice of which is the main act in their separate rites of expiation.' <sup id="cite_ref-892" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-892">[892]</a></sup> Slaves could emancipate themselves by performing a special ceremony: 'In order to hold a Gawai Betembang, a slave is requested to brew a few jars of tuak tembang wine. In addition, he must produce a three-fathom lengthen of white calico cloth to be used as a hand rail by those who take part in [Page 82] the betembang procession at the end of the festival. Lastly, he must also produce one fat pig, the liver of which is examined by the augurs. The indication of the liver will foretell the future well-being of the freed slave.' <sup id="cite_ref-893" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-893">[893]</a></sup> 'The slave is always a poor man. It will normally take some months for him to acquire the essentials for the feast, but when these are ready, he will inform his master that he is now prepared to celebrate the betembang festival. As soon as he is told of the readiness of his slave to hold the ceremony, the master will call for a meeting of all the heads of the families of the longhouse to ask for assistance from the well-wishers to provide food for the celebration. The day for the feast is also fixed at this meeting.' <sup id="cite_ref-894" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-894">[894]</a></sup> 'A day or two before the festival day, the slave's master sends his trusted men to call his closest relatives and members of senior families of other villages to come to witness the freeing of his slave by the Gawai Betembang ceremony. They are asked to come in the evening, as the feast lasts throughout the night and ends only with the sacrifice of the pig early the next morning.' <sup id="cite_ref-895" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-895">[895]</a></sup> 'When the guests arrive, they are cordially received by the feasters with full respect. They are entertained lavishly with food and wine as at other festivals. In between the dinner, supper and the morning meal, the guests are free to converse with each other about their exploits in war as well as about their trading ventures overseas. The killing and capture of enemies was the principal topic of conversation at this time in the past.' <sup id="cite_ref-896" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-896">[896]</a></sup> 'Eventually at sunrise, a procession is formed for the slave master and his relatives to walk along the communal galleries of the longhouse. The leader of this procession is the slave master himself who carries a sharp tembang spear. Behind him comes an old aristocrat who carries a flag, and behind them both, another aristocrat who will kill the pig and finally the slave himself who is dressed in grand apparel. He is followed by a number of women and girls of influential families, and lastly the musicians who beat their gongs and drums.' <sup id="cite_ref-897" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-897">[897]</a></sup> 'After the procession has encircled the longhouse lower and upper galleries three times, a speaker at each gallery begins to ask why such a grand procession is held with men and women along the house.

The procession then proceeds to the open air verandah ( tanju ) where the pig is killed.' <sup id="cite_ref-899" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-899">[899]</a></sup> 'Once the pig is slain, its liver is removed and carefully placed on cordyline leaves inside a large bowl.

In such joy he serves all the guests and hosts alike with his tuak tembang wine at all family galleries of the longhouse.' <sup id="cite_ref-901" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-901">[901]</a></sup> Freeman also describes enfranchisement and the adoption of slave into the communities of their captors: 'According to Charles Brooke, the captives taken by the Iban were “generally ransomed”, being exchanged for jars ( tajau ) “each of which is supposed to represent the value of a man's life” (1866, I:245). If such a ransom could not be negotiated, then, as Brooke Low has recorded, the Iban, unlike the Kajang and Kayan whose custom it was to keep slaves “in a condition of perpetual servitude”, would adopt their captives into the tribe and “enfranchise them” (Ling Roth 1896, II:210).' <sup id="cite_ref-902" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-902">[902]</a></sup> 'The enfranchisement of captives taken in war is termed betembang by the Iban, and we are fortunate in having several contemporary accounts of this quite remarkable ritual. According to Brooke Low (Ling Roth 1896, II:210), the ritual of enfranchisement, or betembang , was usually performed during a feast, or gawai , when the owner of a captive would announce to all assembled that he had adopted him “as a brother”, whereupon he would present his new brother with a spear ( tembang ) telling him to slay, with this spear, whoever dared thereafter to “call him a slave” (Figure 8). Howell and Bailey give a somewhat different account (1900:170). “The tembang ”, they say, “was a spear given by the master to the slave when he freed and acknowledged him as his adopted [Page 46] son, and if at a subsequent date the master tried to again claim the released person as his slave, the spear was supposed to execute justice upon the said master...” According to Sandin (1964 b&nbsp;:193), all those attending the gawai betembang were told that if anyone thereafter called him “a slave or a person of low birth”, the enfranchised individual would be entitled to use the spear he had been given to “raid the houses” and “loot the property” ( ngerurok papan, ngerurok luan ) of those who had thus wronged him. The description that I was given in 1950 of ritual enfranchisement (which of course was at that time no longer being practised) was the same as that recorded by Brooke Low, though it was added that sometimes a valuable jar ( tajau ) or gong ( tawak ) would be displayed, with the pledge that if anyone thereafter referred to the adopted captive as a slave ( ulun ) he would, under Iban adat , be fined the equivalent of this piece of property.' <sup id="cite_ref-903" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-903">[903]</a></sup> It appears that most slaves were enfranchised eventually: 'We are still, however, left with the question of the extent to which ritual enfranchisement and adoption was actually practised by the Iban. As I have already mentioned, in 1949-1951 there were, to the best of my knowledge, no unenfranchised captives anywhere in the Baleh region, nor did I encounter such individuals anywhere else in my extensive travels among the Iban of Sarawak. Unenfranchised individuals did obviously exist in the past but, because of the custom of betembang , only in small numbers. Thus, Brooke Low, our best witness in this matter, makes specific mention of the “remarkable fact” that there were “so few slaves, or persons of servile descent” among the Iban (Ling Roth 1896, II:210). Further, even these few unenfranchised individuals did not constitute, as Rousseau has erroneously asserted, a work force of low status for Iban leaders, for, as Brooke Low's father (a trustworthy observer of the Iban) has noted (Low 1848:201), they were “not distinguishable from their masters and mistresses, as they live all together, and fare precisely the same, eating from the same dish and of the same food”. <sup id="cite_ref-904" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-904">[904]</a></sup> Slavery was suppressed in the colonial period: 'From the days of early Brooke rule, the government of Sarawak opposed slavery. In 1880 the second Rajah proclaimed that all slaves must be freed by their owners formally in the Gawai Betembang ceremony. By this decree, any slave who was able to redeem himself, was allowed to do so by compensating his owner with cash or with valuable jars and brass wares. Those who could not pay the compensation were allowed to free themselves by the Gawai Betembang ceremony. The last of these ceremonies took place during the 1890's after which time slavery was officially abolished. Today it is a fineable offence to refer publicly to another person's slave ancestry.' <sup id="cite_ref-905" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-905">[905]</a></sup> We have adopted 1900 as a provisional date of transition. We are unsure how many people were enslaved at any one point in time.

From the upland regions of Taiwan, as far west as Assam, and extending southwards to Sulawesi and the outer islands of the Indonesian archipelago, the purposeful taking of heads was a dominant feature amongst peoples such as the Bunun, Kalinga, Naga, Ifugao, Iban and Toraja. Above all, headhunting was identified with the island of Borneo' <sup id="cite_ref-907" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-907">[907]</a></sup> 'Recognition, as a successful warrior, was the ideal that Iban men aspired to, a cultural achievement that was endorsed in the myths and legends of headhunting heroes and gods. Great war leaders went by the title of tau serang (lit. “those who know how to make war”), and such men were accorded the highest status and honor among their fellows. In this respect, headhunting provided the means for male social mobility and ascendancy in what was an essentially egalitarian society (see below).' <sup id="cite_ref-908" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-908">[908]</a></sup> 'But headhunting was more than simply an institutionalized channel for native aggression and bloodlust. It was an important ritual activity that had to do with the promotion of fertility, particularly the fertility of crops and women.' <sup id="cite_ref-909" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-909">[909]</a></sup>   Slaves were sacrificed occasionally: 'A second non-partible object is the batu pemanggol , or ritual whetstone, which is the centre-piece of the rites that initiate the yearly farming cycle. Each bilek family possesses one of these stones which is cherished as a magical charm of most vital importance. A few Iban families, indeed, still have whetstones upon which human victims--captives taken in war--were once sacrificed. Such stones are called batu jaum , and are immeasurably valuable in Iban estimation. To divide a batu pemanggol would be to destroy it, and so, when partition takes place, it is always retained in the ancestral bilek . The seceding section, seeking an auspicious occasion, gathers a suitable-looking stone from the river bed. With a great show of solemnity, the new stone is touched on the old and then consecrated; tutelary spirits are invoked and offerings made, and finally a pig or cock is sacrificed and the blood allowed to run on the stone's surface. This stone then becomes the batu pemanggol of the seceding section.' <sup id="cite_ref-910" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-910">[910]</a></sup> '95.

An interesting point to note in this connection, however, is that the Brooke regime may itself, for a while, have been responsible for an intensification of Iban headhunting (Pringle 1970:322; Wagner 1972:passim). That is to say, it was government policy to exploit traditional tribal animosities as a means of extending their dominion over the interior. So-called “friendly tribes” - for example, the Lingga, Undup and Sebayau Iban - were deployed against up-river “rebels” who were resistant to Brooke rule. And in return for their participation in “punitive expeditions”, those who had sided with the White Raj were allowed to take heads. In this way the Brooke government managed to actively sustain, and even encourage, headhunting, while ostensibly being dedicated to its suppression.' <sup id="cite_ref-913" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-913">[913]</a></sup> But Davison also claims that the practice continued until the mid-20th century: 'Until the middle of this century, headhunting, as a cultural institution, was practiced widely by numerous tribal societies in Southeast Asia. From the upland regions of Taiwan, as far west as Assam, and extending southwards to Sulawesi and the outer islands of the Indonesian archipelago, the purposeful taking of heads was a dominant feature amongst peoples such as the Bunun, Kalinga, Naga, Ifugao, Iban and Toraja. Above all, headhunting was identified with the island of Borneo' <sup id="cite_ref-914" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-914">[914]</a></sup> 'After more than a decade of peace, anti-Government activities, mingled with headhunting and outlawry, broke out among the upriver Ibans of the Second and Third Divisions in 1931. Personal resentments played a part in the subsequent years of unrest, usually identified with ex-Penghulu Asun of Entabai, Kanowit, and so did the memory of Bantin and other heroes of the past. But there was a new factor involved in the Asun unrest, which began at a time when the depression-pinched Government was attempting to systematize collection of the one dollar per year door tax. According to the Ibans, the authorities demanded payment from widows and indigents, who in [Page 570] earlier times would have been informally exempted. The people believed that the Government was violating a long established customary relationship, and readily accepted wild rumors about all sorts of other new and fantastic taxes. The tax issue was really only one symptom of a much wider malaise. The upriver people did not understand the beginnings of bureaucracy, and when it made new and unwelcome demands upon them without giving them anything in return, they found it easy to fall back on a well established tradition of insurgency.' <sup id="cite_ref-915" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-915">[915]</a></sup> We have adopted the same rate of transition as the one for slavery above, but this probably applies only to human sacrifice of slaves, not to head-hunting.</dd></dl>

Iban of all divisions perform rituals of the first two categories. Ceremonies to honor warriors has assumed greater importance in the upper Rejang, and rituals for the dead have been much more elaborated in the First and Second Divisions of Sarawak.' <sup id="cite_ref-923" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-923">[923]</a></sup> Iban social organization was relatively egalitarian: 'Each longhouse, as each BILEK, is an autonomous unit. Traditionally the core of each house was a group of descendants of the founders. Houses near one another on the same river or in the same region were commonly allied, marrying among themselves, raiding together beyond their territories, and resolving disputes by peaceful means. Regionalism, deriving from these alliances, in which Iban distinguished themselves from other allied groups, persist in modern state politics. Essentially egalitarian, Iban are aware of long-standing status distinctions among themselves of RAJA BERANI (wealthy and brave), MENSI SARIBU (commoners), and ULUN (slaves). Prestige still accrues to descendants of the first status, disdain to descendants of the third.' <sup id="cite_ref-924" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-924">[924]</a></sup> 'The economic self-sufficiency of the bilik  -family is reflected in other areas of Iban social life. Unlike the Kayan, Kenyah, pagan Melanau and several other Bornean peoples, the Iban are not divided into social classes.  Nor is there any  form of institutionalized leadership based upon hereditary succession, or some other socially divisive principle. Instead Iban society is characterized by a strongly egalitarian ethos. In this respect, each bilik  -family jurally constitutes a discrete and autonomous social unit, which manages its own affairs and recognizes no higher authority than that of its own household head.' <sup id="cite_ref-925" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-925">[925]</a></sup> Longhouse communities were headed by informal leaders doubling as village functionaries: 'Prior to the arrival of the British adventurer, James Brooke, there were no permanent leaders, but the affairs of each house were directed by consultations of family leaders. Men of influence included renowned warriors, bards, augurs and other specialists. Brooke, who became Rajah of Sarawak, and his nephew, Charles Johnson, created political positions -- headman (TUAI RUMAH), regional chief (PENGHULU), paramount chief (TEMENGGONG) -- to restructure Iban society for administrative control, especially for purposes of taxation and the suppression of head-hunting. The creation of permanent political positions and the establishment of political parties in the early 1960s have profoundly changed the Iban.' <sup id="cite_ref-926" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-926">[926]</a></sup> 'In every Iban long-house there are two offices of great importance--one secular and the other ritual. They are the positions of tuai rumah   and tuai burong  . In most long-houses they are held by different individuals, but it is perfectly permissible for one man to hold both offices, and in some communities this does happen. Neither position is ever held by a woman. (c.f. Footnote No. 22). When used as an adjective, the word tuai   means old, or mature, but as a noun it refers to any senior and influential member of a community. Here, the emphasis is not primarily on age, but on the personal qualities of the individual concerned. Thus, a party of young men setting off on an expedition ( bejalai  ), to gather jungle produce, always has its leader, or tuai  , though he may be no more than in his early twenties. And in long-house communities, able, though only middle-aged men often come to exert very considerable authority and influence. In all contemporary long-houses however, there is one man who holds the title of tuai rumah  , or house headman.' <sup id="cite_ref-927" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-927">[927]</a></sup> Spirits factored into informal conventions of social control: 'Iban employ three strategies of social control. First, from childhood, they are taught to avoid conflict, and for a majority, every effort is made to prevent it. Second, they are taught by story and drama of the existence of numerous spirits, who vigilantly ensure observation of numerous taboos; some spirits are interested in preserving the peace, while others are responsible for any strife that arises. In these ways, the stresses and conflicts of ordinary life, especially life in the longhouse, in which one is in more or less constant sight and sound of others, have been displaced onto the spirits. Third, the headman hears disputes between members of the same house, the regional chief, disputes between members of different houses, and government officers, hear those disputes that headmen and regional chiefs cannot resolve.' <sup id="cite_ref-928" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-928">[928]</a></sup> The mediating capacities of headmen were considered to impact the ritual and spiritual health of the longhouse community: 'Inside the bilek is kept and displayed the most valuable property of the household: the sacred Chinese jars ( tajau ) that have or had magical or medicinal powers attributed to them, bronze gongs and guns and the fine hand-woven textiles that are used only on important occasions. The roofed gallery, the ruai , is probably the most interesting part of the longhouse, however, as most tasks and interactions take place here, from food-preparation, gossiping, news-exchange and story-telling [Page 90] to mourning rituals, invocations and other sacred rites. Here also the tuai rumah , or village head-man, mediates between disputing parties so that the ritual balance of the whole longhouse community will not be endangered, and discussions are carried on about ventures and ideas that are of joint interest to all bilek -families. The young, un-married men sleep here and up close to the ceiling hang the highly treasured antu pala , the smoke-dried, blackened heads taken from former enemies. Like most other possessions in Iban society these are owned by the bilek -family and are not the common property of the whole community. In fact there is only one part of the longhouse that is jointly owned and that is the notched ladder (-s) that lead up to the open tanju platform. The latter is mainly used as a drying place for a variety of things, the most noteworthy being padi , which ultimately gets stored in bark-tubs in the sadau . The whole house structure is placed on supporting posts to avoid the risk of flooding, to make the house safer from animals and, in former times, to make it easier to defend. The house should never be built across a stream nor should it be directly facing another across the river. The reason for the latter I do not know, but the former probably comes from streams being used as boundary marks between adjacent communities plus the fact that household refuse gets dropped through slits in the floor onto the ground under the house to feed the domestic pigs, which occupy this area.' <sup id="cite_ref-929" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-929">[929]</a></sup> 'It is also within these sectors that we find specialisation and whatever limited leadership there is above the bilek level. This is embodied in the tuai rumah (house headman) and the tuai burong (augur). The foremost accomplishment of the tuai rumah is a sound knowledge of Iban customary law, adat , but he should also possess oratorical skill and the ability to serve as a mediator. It should be remembered that the adat not only signifies law in our western sense as a set of rules ordering social interaction, it has a wider implication of relating Iban society to the supra-human sphere, and it is extremely vital that the balance between these two ‘worlds’ does not get upset. The tuai rumah is thus the expounder of the law and the arbitrator between opposing parties on one level but through his meting out ‘fines’, or rather atonements, he is instrumental in restoring harmony between this level and a higher one. He can resort to no sanctions to ascertain that his rulings are carried out and there is no need for this either as the pressure to rectify, originates in the spiritual sphere which if necessary could be implemented by social sanctions by other members of the community, who themselves face ritual danger because of the actions of the malfeasant. Thus the tuai rumah does not enact his role within a formal institution of leadership but attains his standing through knowledge of adat , shrewdness of judgment and eloquent skills. Should he lose any of these “charismatic” qualities, which I think would manifest itself through inter-community strife and possibly natural mishaps, the people will leave him and the longhouse that carries his name and seek out some other community which they could join by employing the wide net of kindred. Alternatively there is the possibility of rejecting a non-satisfactory tuai rumah and [Page 101] choosing a new one.' <sup id="cite_ref-930" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-930">[930]</a></sup> Accordingly, leadership was charismatic in style: 'My suggestion then is that individual achievement and charismatic style had a sociological significance in the Iban social system. If we look at the Iban kinship system in relation to the local community it becomes apparent that kinship links, however highly valued, did not suffice to tie the individual family-unit, the bilek , to one longhouse community only. The bilek , which was, and is, an autonomous and jural entity of unlimited life, could at any stage detach itself from the longhouse and move elsewhere. The community was thus an aggregation of such individual units. This was further evident in the structure of the longhouse domicile itself, because a departing bilek could, after having paid the ritual fine ( pemali fine) literally cemove the building material of its bilek apartment when it left the house. If the removing bilek was not situated at either end of the house this would mean that the longhouse would be broken into two parts with a gap in between. In the prevailing social system there was no institutionalized way in which to apply coercion to prevent the departure of individual bilek in order to safeguard the continued life of the community. It is in this context that I think we have to consider the roles of the war-leader [Page 135] and/or house headman, whom I will simply refer to as the leader hereafter. His role was the embodiment of the various aspects of success and through this he supplied the “social cement” that Helped both in founding a community and in keeping it together.' <sup id="cite_ref-931" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-931">[931]</a></sup> 'From Benedict Sandin's ethnohistorical account it is clear that the pioneering leaders that came northwards from the Kapuas region were war-leaders as well as men of some wealth, and that their followers - kin-affiliation aside - were attracted to them for these very reasons. Former success in war meant that the followers would have confidence in their leader's ability both in attacking others and also in the defence of the home community, either through actual combat or through a reputation that would intimidate others. The wealth of the leader also would enable the payment of compensations should this become necessary (p. 155), and his ability to speak well would unite his followers against the outside and also aid in settling disputes or disagreements between members of the community. These various factors added up to the charisma of the leader and helped in binding the units together. Should his strength and ability lessen or even disappear this would immediately manifest itself in the lack of success and if this was a continuing trend, his followers, that is the different bilek entities, would seek to attach themselves to another longhouse or to establish a new one. There was also a possibility of ousting the leader and appointing someone else, believed to possess the qualities giving superior strength against others, good harvests and the absence of illness and death.' <sup id="cite_ref-932" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-932">[932]</a></sup> 'In Iban social crganisation there seem to be two opposing principles at work, one favouring cohesion of the local community, the other tending towards fragmentation by emphasising the autonomy of the primary unit, the bilek family. Factors working towards unity are to be sought in terms of kinship and ritual harmony, because there was as we have seen earlier, a high degree of local endogamy making for a close network and also the [Page 136] idea that decisions involving the whole community could only be reached after general discussion. Obedience to the adat and the observance of the omens also involved the whole community, because if the harmony became upset this would endanger the whole longhouse and show itself in misfortune and death. Although earlier writers on the Iban have remarked that the position of the “chief” was not a very strong one, because it did not correspond to the formal hierarchy of the Western world, I suggest that his role was of great importance in holding the local community together. His charisma and continuing success, which also was the success of the community, added to the centripetal forces and taken together meant that there could be lasting communities in spite of the atomistic character that the autonomy of the bilek imparts to Iban social organisation.' <sup id="cite_ref-933" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-933">[933]</a></sup> Despite these characteristics, we have not found evidence of headmen being directly legitimated by spirit beings or controlling supernatural energy. More material may be needed.

<p><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of equality ♣ present ♥</b> The Iban were organized in relatively autonomous residential longhouse communities rather than social classes: 'The fundamental unit of Iban society is the BILEK-family, a group of five or six persons defined by kinship and affinity. Depending upon negotiations at a couple's marriage, there is an almost even chance that their children will be born into the family of either the wife or the husband. Iban families are part of a widely ramifying kinship system which developed in response to Iban mobility. The SUKU JURU and KABAN BELAYAN correspond to the kindred. The former connotes kin ties originating with one's grandparents and includes persons to the degree of first cousin. The latter is any group of people who share rights of reciprocity with an Iban, and may include nonkin and even non-Iban. More inclusive groups include "the brotherhood" and "food-sharers", made up of distant kin who would be invited to one's festivals, or whose festivals an Iban would attend. Attachment is ambilateral and descent, ambilineal. Although some Iban are capable of reconstructing genealogies up to fifteen generations in depth, such reconstructions are selective and illustrate the Iban practice of "genealogizing" so as to establish ancestral ties with strangers.' <sup id="cite_ref-934" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-934">[934]</a></sup> 'Terms of reference are Eskimo and the terms of address, Hawaiian.' <sup id="cite_ref-935" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-935">[935]</a></sup> 'The BILEK-family is an autonomous unit, able to join with other units of a longhouse or to detach itself. Iban become members of a family through birth, adoption, marriage, or incorporation. The family is responsible for construction of its own unit, production of its own food, and management of its own affairs. In a sample of 1,051 families, 60 percent were comprised of parents and children, 40 percent included grandparents. The family is a kin-based, corporate group, holding in trust land, sacred rice, sacred charms, ritual formulas, taboos, and heirloom gongs and jars. Traditionally, one son or daughter has remained in the BILEK to ensure continuity over time. With urban migration, and mail service making possible postal remittances, an increasing number of parents have no adult child residing in the BILEK with them.' <sup id="cite_ref-936" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-936">[936]</a></sup> 'Each longhouse, as each BILEK, is an autonomous unit. Traditionally the core of each house was a group of descendants of the founders. Houses near one another on the same river or in the same region were commonly allied, marrying among themselves, raiding together beyond their territories, and resolving disputes by peaceful means. Regionalism, deriving from these alliances, in which Iban distinguished themselves from other allied groups, persist in modern state politics. Essentially egalitarian, Iban are aware of long-standing status distinctions among themselves of RAJA BERANI (wealthy and brave), MENSI SARIBU (commoners), and ULUN (slaves). Prestige still accrues to descendants of the first status, disdain to descendants of the third.' <sup id="cite_ref-937" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-937">[937]</a></sup> Social control and authority were informal: 'Prior to the arrival of the British adventurer, James Brooke, there were no permanent leaders, but the affairs of each house were directed by consultations of family leaders. Men of influence included renowned warriors, bards, augurs and other specialists. Brooke, who became Rajah of Sarawak, and his nephew, Charles Johnson, created political positions -- headman (TUAI RUMAH), regional chief (PENGHULU), paramount chief (TEMENGGONG) -- to restructure Iban society for administrative control, especially for purposes of taxation and the suppression of head-hunting. The creation of permanent political positions and the establishment of political parties in the early 1960s have profoundly changed the Iban.' <sup id="cite_ref-938" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-938">[938]</a></sup> 'Iban employ three strategies of social control. First, from childhood, they are taught to avoid conflict, and for a majority, every effort is made to prevent it. Second, they are taught by story and drama of the existence of numerous spirits, who vigilantly ensure observation of numerous taboos; some spirits are interested in preserving the peace, while others are responsible for any strife that arises. In these ways, the stresses and conflicts of ordinary life, especially life in the longhouse, in which one is in more or less constant sight and sound of others, have been displaced onto the spirits. Third, the headman hears disputes between members of the same house, the regional chief, disputes between members of different houses, and government officers, hear those disputes that headmen and regional chiefs cannot resolve.' <sup id="cite_ref-939" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-939">[939]</a></sup> 'Traditionally Iban leaders sought to settle disputes, as far as possible, through negotiation and attempted to avert recourse to self-help and other means that might potentially lead to open violence. In this, they were greatly aided by the highly comprehensive nature of traditional adat itself, which, although unwritten gave systematic definition of offences and correct punishments. Also important in this connection was the role formerly played by go-betweens. Within a longhouse respected elders frequently intervened in disputes, restraining the two sides and acting with their consent as negotiating agents. Such intervention was strongly supported by Iban values, particularly by the notion that a breach of adat or unresolved contention posed a collective [Page xxiv] spiritual danger to the well-being of all community members. Public spirited elders, including the longhouse headman and friends of the disputants, might even agree to make token compensation themselves, called sa-uta iring manok . In doing so, a speedy settlement was often achieved that avoided acrimony and possible loss of face by the principals.' <sup id="cite_ref-940" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-940">[940]</a></sup> War-leaders and headmen attained prestige, but were not entitled to exceptional deference: '150. When a man does become a tuai rumah there is no kind of initiation ceremony, nor is he given any kind of honorific title. His kindred continue to use the ordinary terms of classificatory kinship ( anak, menyadi, apai , etc.). while strangers address him as wai (friend), or with his personal name (e.g. Nyala). Towards him there are no special attitudes of deference or respect, other than he is able to command by virtue of his own personal prowess and prestige. He receives no tribute of any kind, and is entitled to no special privileges -- except in his relations with Government officials. Unless he also is a tuai burong , he has no religious duties to perform, and no sort of ritual sanctity attaches to his person or the apartment be occupies. It frequently happens, of course, that a tuai rumah is also a man of considerable personal prestige. He may, for example, be a successful head-hunter, and have sealed his renown by performing a number of the great rituals ( gawai ), which rank so high in Iban estimation. Again, being a tuai rumah does mean that a man becomes widely known, for it is usual for an Iban community to be called after its tuai rumah (e.g. Rumah Nyala, etc.). and this is undoubtedly one of the main attractions which the office has for ambitions individuals. A tuai rumah is also presented with special opportunities for meeting Europeans, and, in Iban eyes, such meetings are likely to lead to all manner of desirable results. But here, we are primarily concerned with the jural status of a tuai rumah within his own long-house. Under Iban adat a tuai rumah has no authority to command other members of the community, nor are they, in any real sense, his subordinates. Were a tuai rumah so rash as to issue commands to others, he would at once be rebuffed, and sharply. Rather, such influence as he does exert is by a subtle mixture of persuasion and admonition, for he knows that his position is dependent on the continued goodwill and approval of his anembiak , as the other members of the house are called. In many ways his role is an unenviable one. I remember tuai rumah Nyala, remarking to me with some feeling that he only ever gave his opinion when it was asked for; he would be malu (ashamed), he said, to volunteer advice to any of his anembiak , and, in any case, no-one would ever listen to him if he did.' <sup id="cite_ref-941" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-941">[941]</a></sup> Accordingly, the Iban have been characterized as an acephalous society: 'Prior to the arrival of the Brookes, the Iban present a picture of an exceedingly energetic people, waring among themselves and with others, and constantly expanding territorially, absorbing and displacing other groups of people in the process. This pattern of aggressive outward expansion continued into the 1850's and, on a more peaceful basis, even later. Throughout this traditional period, social loyalties centered on major river systems. The watersheds dividing these rivers tended to delimit major regional groups, or “tribes”, and these groups, under the leadership of senior warriors and warleaders, the raja berani, tau kayau or tau serang , constituted the maximal units of traditional society organized for aggression and territorial defence. While regional leaders sought to minimize the dangers of fratricidal conflict among their followers, their formal powers were limited almost entirely to the context of warfare. Thus Iban society was traditionally “acephelous” and totally without a centralized, hierarchical political order. Political power was dispersed between basically sovereign local communities, longhouses and kindreds. It was in this turbulent setting that traditional Iban adat evolved, as an intricate system of social rules and sanctions, in independent, highly egalitarian communities without centralized authority, which, yet, for reasons of survival, required effective means for resolving contention and preserving internal order.' <sup id="cite_ref-942" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-942">[942]</a></sup> Rights in land were held by longhouse families: 'Rights to land are established by clearing and farming it, or by occupying it. Rights to the use of farmland are vested in the BILEK-family, and are held in perpetuity. These rights are maintained in the living memory of the residents of each longhouse. Boundaries are indicated by landforms or trees, or are marked by planting a row of bamboo. Except for the land overshadowed by the eaves of the longhouse, there is no land to which a community holds rights. With the introduction of surveys and titles to land in the early 1900s, Iban who lived closer to government centers obtained titles to their land, under which rights of individual families to land could be verified. As a result of increased population and the commercialization of land, some Iban have bought land for investment and speculation.' <sup id="cite_ref-943" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-943">[943]</a></sup> The Iban practiced both partible and nonpartible inheritance. Nonpartible property was transmitted within senior lineages attached to a continuous longhouse community: 'It is one of the axioms of Iban adat that the padi pun of a bilek is nonpartible. What then is the solution when a family sub-divides into two separate households? Briefly it is this: the senior section retains possession of the padi pun , while the seceding section is presented with one of the sangking , which is then elevated to become its padi pun . Here, clearly, we have a criterion of crucial importance for the study of the process of bilek family formation in Iban society. The senior section of a family is always definable by the fact that its padi pun was inherited as padi pun&nbsp;; while the padi pun of a seceding section is always inherited as sangking . By studying the inheritance of padi pun and sangking , therefore, it is possible to establish the main line of a family, and the various offshoots from it which have been brought about by partition.' <sup id="cite_ref-944" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-944">[944]</a></sup> 'A second non-partible object is the batu pemanggol , or ritual whetstone, which is the centre-piece of the rites that initiate the yearly farming cycle. Each bilek family possesses one of these stones which is cherished as a magical charm of most vital importance. A few Iban families, indeed, still have whetstones upon which human victims--captives taken in war--were once sacrificed. Such stones are called batu jaum , and are immeasurably valuable in Iban estimation. To divide a batu pemanggol would be to destroy it, and so, when partition takes place, it is always retained in the ancestral bilek . The seceding section, seeking an auspicious occasion, gathers a suitable-looking stone from the river bed. With a great show of solemnity, the new stone is touched on the old and then consecrated; tutelary spirits are invoked and offerings made, and finally a pig or cock is sacrificed and the blood allowed to run on the stone's surface. This stone then becomes the batu pemanggol of the seceding section.' <sup id="cite_ref-945" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-945">[945]</a></sup> 'When partition occurs then, the senior section of the family always retains the ancestral sacred rice and ritual whetstone. It may also happen that a bilek possesses some other unique magical or ritual object and, if this be the case, this too is retained by the senior section. With these exceptions, however, all the other property of the bilek is partible, and its apportionment is in accord with the relative size and the composition of the two sections resulting from the partition, following the general rule that siblings are parceners.' <sup id="cite_ref-946" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-946">[946]</a></sup> Both patrifiliation and matrifiliation were common: 'Further, membership of his (or her) natal bilek confers upon a child inheritance rights over its properties and lands, and these rights are retained as long as the individual remains a resident member. Among the Iban, then, filiation is of a special kind, for it may be either to an individual's mother's bilek or to an individual's father's bilek, but not to both at the same time. Moreover, in practice, both types of filiation occur to an approximately equal extent. We are here confronted with a fundamental principle of the Iban family system.' <sup id="cite_ref-947" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-947">[947]</a></sup> Given the practice of ambilocal residence, inheritance rights were thus determined by residence rather than membership in social classes: 'However, should a man, upon marriage, permanently leave his natal bilek , he thereby relinquishes his parcenary rights over its estate, but acquires rights in the bilek into which he marries and settles down. The same applies to a woman who marries out of her natal apartment. An affine, then, possesses parcenary rights within the bilek of which he (or she) is a resident member.' <sup id="cite_ref-948" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-948">[948]</a></sup> '10. Within the bilek family siblings have equivalent rights; in other words, they are parceners or co-heirs. If a sibling marries out he thereby relinquishes rights of inheritance in his natal bilek family, but acquires rights in the bilek family into which he marries. This rule applies equally to men and to women. When divorce occurs an individual returns to his or her natal bilek family and resumes rights there; but widows and widowers do not return to their natal bilek families. Thus, an analysis of 52 cases showed that there were 26 widows or widowers living as members of their natal bilek families, and 26 who were living in bilek families of which they were members by right of marriage and local residence.' <sup id="cite_ref-949" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-949">[949]</a></sup> 'In accordance with custom, an Iban who marries into another longhouse and joins his or her spouse's family is no longer entitled to inherit ancestral lands left behind in the former longhouse area. If such an individual has no siblings living in his or her original family bilek , these lands are left under the guardianship of the Tuai Rumah, who has authority to allow other members of the longhouse to make use of them until one of the former owner's heirs can re-establish the ancestral bilek and reclaim its lands. Only lands which are officially titled can be claimed wherever the owner lives in the country; otherwise rights of use are contigent upon the family's continual residence within the longhouse where the land is located. This means that if an Iban migrates from one river to another, he will automatically loose rights to all of his temuda lands which have no official title. If he has no sibling living in the village these lands will become available for use by the people of the longhouse he has left and are subject to reapportionment by the Tuai Rumah.' <sup id="cite_ref-950" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-950">[950]</a></sup> Freeman provides a general summary of the property system: 'Having briefly described the composition of the bilek family and the way in which its members are recruited, we may turn to an examination of the principles governing inheritance, for these, under the Iban system of filiation, are of particular significance. Let us begin by considering the position of the natal and adopted members of the family. As has already been stressed, children become members by right of birth of either their father's or their mother's bilek --but it is always one or the other. Thus, the children of a man practising uxorilocal residence are the members of their mother's natal bilek , and of this local group alone. They have no rights of inheritance within their father's natal bilek, of which they are not resident members. Similarly, the children of a woman practising virilocal residence are members of their father's local group, and have no rights of inheritance in their mother's natal bilek . Adopted children are members of the bilek into which they have been adopted, and of this bilek only.' <sup id="cite_ref-951" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-951">[951]</a></sup> 'The general rule for both natural and adopted children is this: as long as they remain resident members of their own bilek family, sons and daughters possess full and equal rights of inheritance over the family estate. In other words, within a bilek siblings are parceners or co-heirs. There is thus recognition of neither primogeniture nor ultimogeniture, and no differentiation [Page 32] between the sexes, nor between natural and adopted children. Instead, in matters of inheritance, siblings are equals. Their equivalence is well expressed in the phrase: ‘ menyadi tampong pala ’ which the Iban use to describe them. These words, which have the literal meaning: ‘siblings whose heads are joined’, symbolize aptly the kind of relationship in which siblings stand. Another much-used phrase is: ‘ menyadi begulai pemai ’ meaning ‘siblings of common inheritance’.' <sup id="cite_ref-952" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-952">[952]</a></sup> 'As long then, as an individual remains resident in a bilek , he (or she) is one of the group in which ownership and inheritance are vested. Indeed, it is the family as a whole that holds common tenure of the conglomeration of property and other rights which constitute ‘the bilek ’. In other words, the Iban bilek family is a corporation aggregate. Thus, no one of its members holds the right [Page 33] to disinherit another. In life the members of a bilek are parceners, and even in death each member is entitled to his share of the family estate--that last inheritance which he carries with him to the after-world. An elder looks to his children and to his grandchildren within the bilek family to care for him in his old age, and to perform conscientiously the elaborate mortuary rites which must accompany his passing from this world to the next. To the Iban these mortuary rites and the furnishing of grave goods are matters of supreme importance, and all the senior surviving members of the bilek family are expected to join in their faithful performance. As the Iban themselves phrase it: ‘As the mortuary rites are equally performed, so equally is the bilek estate inherited’ (‘ Enti blah ngelumbong, blah empu utai ’).' <sup id="cite_ref-953" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-953">[953]</a></sup> Accordingly, the Iban were very egalitarian.

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Ideological thought equates rulers and commoners ♣ present ♥</b> Longhouse communities were headed by leaders doubling as village functionaries: 'In every Iban long-house there are two offices of great importance--one secular and the other ritual. They are the positions of tuai rumah   and tuai burong  . In most long-houses they are held by different individuals, but it is perfectly permissible for one man to hold both offices, and in some communities this does happen. Neither position is ever held by a woman. (c.f. Footnote No. 22). When used as an adjective, the word tuai   means old, or mature, but as a noun it refers to any senior and influential member of a community. Here, the emphasis is not primarily on age, but on the personal qualities of the individual concerned. Thus, a party of young men setting off on an expedition ( bejalai  ), to gather jungle produce, always has its leader, or tuai  , though he may be no more than in his early twenties. And in long-house communities, able, though only middle-aged men often come to exert very considerable authority and influence. In all contemporary long-houses however, there is one man who holds the title of tuai rumah  , or house headman.' <sup id="cite_ref-954" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-954">[954]</a></sup> Social control and authority were informal: 'Prior to the arrival of the British adventurer, James Brooke, there were no permanent leaders, but the affairs of each house were directed by consultations of family leaders.

This is embodied in the tuai rumah (house headman) and the tuai burong (augur). The foremost accomplishment of the tuai rumah is a sound knowledge of Iban customary law, adat , but he should also possess oratorical skill and the ability to serve as a mediator. It should be remembered that the adat not only signifies law in our western sense as a set of rules ordering social interaction, it has a wider implication of relating Iban society to the supra-human sphere, and it is extremely vital that the balance between these two ‘worlds’ does not get upset. The tuai rumah is thus the expounder of the law and the arbitrator between opposing parties on one level but through his meting out ‘fines’, or rather atonements, he is instrumental in restoring harmony between this level and a higher one. He can resort to no sanctions to ascertain that his rulings are carried out and there is no need for this either as the pressure to rectify, originates in the spiritual sphere which if necessary could be implemented by social sanctions by other members of the community, who themselves face ritual danger because of the actions of the malfeasant. Thus the tuai rumah does not enact his role within a formal institution of leadership but attains his standing through knowledge of adat , shrewdness of judgment and eloquent skills. Should he lose any of these “charismatic” qualities, which I think would manifest itself through inter-community strife and possibly natural mishaps, the people will leave him and the longhouse that carries his name and seek out some other community which they could join by employing the wide net of kindred. Alternatively there is the possibility of rejecting a non-satisfactory tuai rumah and [Page 101] choosing a new one.' <sup id="cite_ref-959" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-959">[959]</a></sup> 'My suggestion then is that individual achievement and charismatic style had a sociological significance in the Iban social system. If we look at the Iban kinship system in relation to the local community it becomes apparent that kinship links, however highly valued, did not suffice to tie the individual family-unit, the bilek , to one longhouse community only. The bilek , which was, and is, an autonomous and jural entity of unlimited life, could at any stage detach itself from the longhouse and move elsewhere. The community was thus an aggregation of such individual units. This was further evident in the structure of the longhouse domicile itself, because a departing bilek could, after having paid the ritual fine ( pemali fine) literally cemove the building material of its bilek apartment when it left the house. If the removing bilek was not situated at either end of the house this would mean that the longhouse would be broken into two parts with a gap in between. In the prevailing social system there was no institutionalized way in which to apply coercion to prevent the departure of individual bilek in order to safeguard the continued life of the community. It is in this context that I think we have to consider the roles of the war-leader [Page 135] and/or house headman, whom I will simply refer to as the leader hereafter. His role was the embodiment of the various aspects of success and through this he supplied the “social cement” that Helped both in founding a community and in keeping it together.' <sup id="cite_ref-960" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-960">[960]</a></sup> There was no hereditary succession: 'The economic self-sufficiency of the bilik  -family is reflected in other areas of Iban social life. Unlike the Kayan, Kenyah, pagan Melanau and several other Bornean peoples, the Iban are not divided into social classes.  Nor is there any  form of institutionalized leadership based upon hereditary succession, or some other socially divisive principle. Instead Iban society is characterized by a strongly egalitarian ethos. In this respect, each bilik  -family jurally constitutes a discrete and autonomous social unit, which manages its own affairs and recognizes no higher authority than that of its own household head.' <sup id="cite_ref-961" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-961">[961]</a></sup> 'As there is no formal institution of headman-ship and there is the possibility of rejection by the community, it is logical that the position of tuai rumah can not be inherited. At times this might not be appreciated and when there are cases of this office remaining within the same bilek -family or being taken over by some very close relative outside the bilek one could easily be led to believe that the office was hereditary or semi-hereditary. This can probably be explained by seeing that the likelihood of a close male relative - women never hold this office - learning the adat and the much admired oratorical skills is much greater than for somebody else not so closely involved with the tuai rumah .' <sup id="cite_ref-962" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-962">[962]</a></sup> Accordingly, the Iban have been characterized as an acephalous society: 'Prior to the arrival of the Brookes, the Iban present a picture of an exceedingly energetic people, waring among themselves and with others, and constantly expanding territorially, absorbing and displacing other groups of people in the process. This pattern of aggressive outward expansion continued into the 1850's and, on a more peaceful basis, even later. Throughout this traditional period, social loyalties centered on major river systems. The watersheds dividing these rivers tended to delimit major regional groups, or “tribes”, and these groups, under the leadership of senior warriors and warleaders, the raja berani, tau kayau or tau serang , constituted the maximal units of traditional society organized for aggression and territorial defence. While regional leaders sought to minimize the dangers of fratricidal conflict among their followers, their formal powers were limited almost entirely to the context of warfare. Thus Iban society was traditionally “acephelous” and totally without a centralized, hierarchical political order. Political power was dispersed between basically sovereign local communities, longhouses and kindreds. It was in this turbulent setting that traditional Iban adat evolved, as an intricate system of social rules and sanctions, in independent, highly egalitarian communities without centralized authority, which, yet, for reasons of survival, required effective means for resolving contention and preserving internal order.' <sup id="cite_ref-963" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-963">[963]</a></sup>  The mediating abilities of headmen impacted the viability of longhouse communities: 'The number of bilek -families making up a longhouse community varies a great deal. There may be from just a few up to twenty, thirty or even more in a few cases. Many factors are included; the quality and quantity of land in the area, whether past harvests have been good or not, the stage of the development cycle of the bilek -families of the house, equally also the stage of the dampa system cycle in which the community finds itself, and whether it is in a pioneer area or in a long-settled district. The degree of communal strife, which indirectly reflects on the [Page 91] mediating ability of the tuai rumah is probably also a factor to be taken into account. After initial establishment in a new area by a core group of pioneering households, the house grows to its maximum size, at all times dependent on these variables, and in communities with a traditional type of agriculture the ecological factor will decide the upper limit after which one can expect a period of decrease until the community is no longer viable.' <sup id="cite_ref-964" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-964">[964]</a></sup> Historically, pioneers were charismatic war-leaders: 'From Benedict Sandin's ethnohistorical account it is clear that the pioneering leaders that came northwards from the Kapuas region were war-leaders as well as men of some wealth, and that their followers - kin-affiliation aside - were attracted to them for these very reasons. Former success in war meant that the followers would have confidence in their leader's ability both in attacking others and also in the defence of the home community, either through actual combat or through a reputation that would intimidate others. The wealth of the leader also would enable the payment of compensations should this become necessary (p. 155), and his ability to speak well would unite his followers against the outside and also aid in settling disputes or disagreements between members of the community. These various factors added up to the charisma of the leader and helped in binding the units together. Should his strength and ability lessen or even disappear this would immediately manifest itself in the lack of success and if this was a continuing trend, his followers, that is the different bilek entities, would seek to attach themselves to another longhouse or to establish a new one. There was also a possibility of ousting the leader and appointing someone else, believed to possess the qualities giving superior strength against others, good harvests and the absence of illness and death.' <sup id="cite_ref-965" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-965">[965]</a></sup> 'In Iban social crganisation there seem to be two opposing principles at work, one favouring cohesion of the local community, the other tending towards fragmentation by emphasising the autonomy of the primary unit, the bilek family. Factors working towards unity are to be sought in terms of kinship and ritual harmony, because there was as we have seen earlier, a high degree of local endogamy making for a close network and also the [Page 136] idea that decisions involving the whole community could only be reached after general discussion. Obedience to the adat and the observance of the omens also involved the whole community, because if the harmony became upset this would endanger the whole longhouse and show itself in misfortune and death. Although earlier writers on the Iban have remarked that the position of the “chief” was not a very strong one, because it did not correspond to the formal hierarchy of the Western world, I suggest that his role was of great importance in holding the local community together. His charisma and continuing success, which also was the success of the community, added to the centripetal forces and taken together meant that there could be lasting communities in spite of the atomistic character that the autonomy of the bilek imparts to Iban social organisation.' <sup id="cite_ref-966" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-966">[966]</a></sup> 'The question immediately springs to mind in this context: was the type of Iban leadership a function of the basic economy which necessitated continuous movement? If we compare the Iban with the Kayan it immediately becomes apparent that this was not the case. The Kayan had the same type of basic economy as the Iban, yet in their social organisation we find a rather rigid class structure and institutionalized leadership. There must have been other conditions that obtained for the Iban that account for this difference. I would suggest that the competition and warring that most likely started the Iban migrations into Sarawak would be conditions favouring the emergence of non-formalized leadership (if it did not obtain before, of which we know nothing). The charismatic leader would then be a prime agent in effecting communal cohesion, especially if the context was that of continuing disruption. It would also seem reasonable that there would be competition for leadership as every bilek unit was, in a sense, politically independent. Iban men, especially the younger males, would seek to display achievement within the fields constituting this success paradigm. They would try to excell in warring, raiding and head-taking, in amassing [Page 137] jungle-produce when on bejalai which could be converted into prestige items, and they would try to become skilled in oratory and the knowledge of the adat . Although this is a hypothetical discussion, such an interpretation seems to fit the historical and sociological facts and also helps to explain why the Iban men should have displayed an expressive life-style.' <sup id="cite_ref-967" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-967">[967]</a></sup> 'This, of course, is a process that easily leads to escalation and it is probable that the high degree of raiding, head-taking and “piracy” that made the Saribas and Skrang Iban so notorious at the middle of the last century, not only mirrored the prestige and its “inflationary spiral” that Morgan has discussed, but also was the logical consequence of an overextension of charismatic leadership and the competition for this position. Certain ecological considerations need also to be taken into account here; soils and climate together would have to be such that increasingly larger communities could be supported. If this was the case then increased strength both economically and as a fighting force would be favourable factors in any confrontation with outside adversaries. The large settlements seen by James Brooke and his companions in the down-river areas of the First and Second Division support such an argument. Whether centrifugal tendencies would have increased and again broken up these large longhouse communities had the Brooke raj not been created, is naturally impossible to say. The change of the ecology factor as well as the increased defence potential of a larger community might equally well have led to greater stability. It seems clear, however, that the introduction of “law and order”, the reorganization of warfare and head-hunting and the increased opportunities in the economic sector would have a direct effect on the leadership. It is against this background that I presume Sandin to be justified when he talks about leadership amongst the Saribas Iban as being hereditary, because these new conditions would favour the institutionalization of the leadership in a more formal shape.' <sup id="cite_ref-968" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-968">[968]</a></sup> Even after the formalization of offices undertaken in the colonial period, authority remained fluid in practice: 'With the coming of the Europeans a certain formalising of the role of the tuai rumah took place by investing it with legal and administrative powers as an agent of the government. In the same manner, influential leaders within territorial groupings, who often were war-leaders able to draw large followings, were elevated to district headmen ( penghulu ), a formal position with little correspondence to the factual and fluctuating basis for their authority. In fact the idea of leadership within Iban society appears so fluid and situational that an impromptu leader for any group undertaking, however small, is referred to as tuai .' <sup id="cite_ref-969" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-969">[969]</a></sup></dd>

Iban become members of a family through birth, adoption, marriage, or incorporation. The family is responsible for construction of its own unit, production of its own food, and management of its own affairs. In a sample of 1,051 families, 60 percent were comprised of parents and children, 40 percent included grandparents. The family is a kin-based, corporate group, holding in trust land, sacred rice, sacred charms, ritual formulas, taboos, and heirloom gongs and jars. Traditionally, one son or daughter has remained in the BILEK to ensure continuity over time. With urban migration, and mail service making possible postal remittances, an increasing number of parents have no adult child residing in the BILEK with them.' <sup id="cite_ref-970" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-970">[970]</a></sup> 'Preferred and proscribed marriages are commonly recognized. Though parents prefer to arrange their children's marriages, especially educated young people would rather choose their own mates. Marriage is preferably with a person between the degree of first and fifth cousin. Distinctions are made between parallel and cross cousins; marriages between the former are avoided. Although most Iban marriages are monogamous, isolated instances of sororal and nonsororal polygyny occur. Marriage between a man and a woman who are related as member of adjacent generations is not approved, but propitiatory rites can be performed if, for example, an aunt and nephew insist on marrying. Marriage within the kin group is preferred in order to protect property rights, and to avoid union with a descendant of slaves or a person of ill fortune. Residence is ambilocal or neolocal. Divorce may be initiated by either partner and, if with mutual consent, is relatively easy.' <sup id="cite_ref-971" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-971">[971]</a></sup> Residence was ambilocal: 'Now, as already remarked, among the Iban virilocal marriage and uxorilocal marriage are equally permissible, for in Iban culture there are no beliefs or values which result in either form of marriage being given any sort of special preference. However, in all cases of permanent marriage a definite choice between the two possibilities must in the end be made, for there is no longterm system of alternate residence. Often, it is true, a newly married couple will follow first one form of domicile and then the other before finally settling down. Marrying into another apartment means permanently departing from one's natal or adoptive bilek family, and it is almost always an occasion of stress and sorrow, particularly for the parents of the seceding son or daughter. Conflicts of interest very frequently arise, but if a marriage is to endure a compromise is always reached, and, sooner or later, the couple permanently adopt either virilocal or uxorilocal residence.' <sup id="cite_ref-972" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-972">[972]</a></sup> 'Marriage then, is an event of great moment, and particularly for the spouse who is leaving his (or her) natal apartment. Out-marriage, as we have seen, involves a radical change in jural status. It is also an occasion of psychological stress for the out-marrying spouse, since she (or he) is, in a sense, abandoning her natal family. Thus, one informant remarked that out-marriage ( ngugi ka orang ) meant ‘the casting away of one's father and mother’ (‘ itong udah buai apai indai ’). However, about 75% of Iban marriages are within the kindred, and so the stresses of out-marriage are often allayed by the fact that the out-marrying spouse is entering the household of fairly close kin.' <sup id="cite_ref-973" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-973">[973]</a></sup> Both sons and daughters could inherit wealth: 'Male and female children share equally in rights to real and other property so long as they remain members of their natal BILEK. Children who move out of the BILEK at marriage or for any other reason receive a small portion of the family estate, and in theory relinquish all rights to family land. In fact, however, they retain the right to request land for farming at the annual meeting commencing the agricultural year.' <sup id="cite_ref-974" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-974">[974]</a></sup> Conjugal relations were relatively egalitarian: 'Among the Dyaks no man has more than one wife. Polygamy is considered very displeasing to the gods, and [Page 129] conjugal affection is rare among the Dyaks. On the contrary, a great deal of it exists, and the men very often love their wives and think a great deal of their opinion. They will not decide upon any important course of action without consulting them. Where there are children, the husbands very often help their wives in doing more than their share of the man's work, and I have often seen the men nursing and fondling their naked babies when the mothers were busy.' <sup id="cite_ref-975" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-975">[975]</a></sup> 'The first point to be made is one of sexual equality and mutual respect. This principle is evident in a number of different areas of Iban life. We have already mentioned the bilateral kinship system and the “utrolateral” (Freeman 1970:14) patterns of residence following marriage. It can also be seen in the sharing of economic responsibilities and the even distribution of jural rights and obligations. Similarly, in terms of decision-making, due consideration is given to the views of women as well as those of men. Furthermore, although menstruation, pregnancy and childbearing are considered to be polluting, or ritually dangerous situations (Gana 1988:15 seq.), the “otherness” of women in this respect is not something that is unduly emphasized (see below). In short, Iban society is characterized by a remarkable equity between the sexes.' <sup id="cite_ref-976" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-976">[976]</a></sup> However, the Iban followed a gendered division of labour: 'Domestic chores, such as cooking and tending to the BILEK, are performed primarily by women. Both men and women collect wild foods for family consumption and, among Iban living near towns, for sale. Men fell trees and do the heavier farm work, fish, hunt, and take on contracts with logging and oil companies. In urban contexts, both men and women perform office jobs.' <sup id="cite_ref-977" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-977">[977]</a></sup> Accordingly, sons and daughters were socialized differently: 'At birth the infant becomes the center of attention and the subject of numerous rituals. Weaning is casual and discipline relaxed. During the farming season, children are left in the care of older people. By age 5, children wash their own clothes and by 8, girls help with domestic chores. Traditionally adolescent males would undertake "the initiate's journey", a trip of several months or years, from which they were expected to return with trophies. Adolescent females demonstrate their maturity with diligence and in the weaving of ceremonial cloths, baskets, and mats.' <sup id="cite_ref-978" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-978">[978]</a></sup> It appears that male adulterers were treated more leniently than female ones: 'The factors outlined above -- the high social valuation and ritual elaboration of specifically male achievements, together with an implicit recognition of men's dependence on women's cooperation -- inform certain behavioural and ideational complexes [Page 107] found amongst the Iban. Men's anxiety about their own adequacy and potency is evident in assertive boasting about the size of their penises (Heppell 1975:115), in castration dreams (Freeman 1968:372), and in the practice of wearing a penis pin ( palang ) (Freeman 1968:388). Their vulnerability, should their women be seduced away from them, is expressed in their violent reaction to being cuckolded (Heppell 1976) and is reified in the customary law forbearance of male, but condemnation of female, adultery when spouses are apart (Freeman 1967:335). Tension between the sexes finds expression in women's mockery of men and male pretensions. Freeman reports that the mockery of men is one of the favourite pastimes of Iban women and describes it occurring in both a social and a ritual context' <sup id="cite_ref-979" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-979">[979]</a></sup> Women did not have access to prestige acquired through head-hunting: 'The egalitarian nature of male and female relationships in Iban society has often been remarked upon in the past (Gomes 1911:86). There is (or was), however, one important area of traditional Iban society which was denied to Iban women, and this was the cult of headhunting. Certainly Iban women played an important ritual role in connection with headhunting - particularly with regard to the ceremonial reception of newly-taken heads into the longhouse (see below). But as non-combatants, they were automatically disqualified from participating in this system of prestige and status acquisition.' <sup id="cite_ref-980" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-980">[980]</a></sup> 'Sather comments: “From their display of skill and leadership in warfare, men alone derived the highest honours and achieved positions of status and power in Iban society, further symbolized by praise-names and ritual distinctions, from which women, as a sex, were totally excluded” (1978:343). He adds that “[w]arfare as an institution and its attendant glorification of male aggressiveness thus directly conflicted with the principles of sexual equality and egalitarianism otherwise inherent in traditional Iban society structure” (1978:343).' <sup id="cite_ref-981" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-981">[981]</a></sup> However, women could attain prestige in other ways: 'But if women were unable to compete with men in the arena of headhunting, this does not mean that the acquisition of prestige and status was altogether denied them. On the contrary, women were able to claim honor and positions of influence in Iban society through their skill at weaving and their ritual mastery of the art of dyeing cloth. These activities were traditionally identified as the female equivalent of headhunting (see below, and also Mashman in this volume). In this respect Iban women were compensated - at least in part - for their exclusion from the exclusively male domain of headhunting. In the end, however, it was to those who had taken heads that the highest honors in Iban society went, and in this respect Iban women were socially disadvantaged.' <sup id="cite_ref-982" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-982">[982]</a></sup> According to Davison, the result of this was gender complementary rather than inequality: 'The result of this, it has been suggested, was a conflict of interests between Iban men and women. Certainly there is evidence for this in the explicit sexual mockery of men, by women, which occurs at specified points during major Iban headhunting rituals. On such occasions, Iban women dress up as men - in the past sporting grotesquely carved wooden penises - to ridicule the pretentious posturings of their menfolk as warriors (Freeman 1968:388-90). Freeman reports that Iban men frequently become incensed by this mockery, retaliating in kind with crude jests at the expense of women which leave little to the imagination.' <sup id="cite_ref-983" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-983">[983]</a></sup> 'No doubt tensions and antagonisms do exist between Iban men and women, just as in any society. To see this, however, as evidence for a collective envy of men, on the part of Iban women, is perhaps to go a little too far (Freeman 1968:388). Contemporary Iban describe the sexual banter at headhunting festivals as “play” ( main-main ), and men themselves willingly participate n the role reversal farce, collecting firewood and forest vegetables, which they then cook, in imitation of the domestic duties of Iban women. Furthermore, one finds that many Iban women express little interest in the status-seeking self-aggrandizement of their menfolk, preferring instead to concentrate on achieving recognition in their own domain as expert weavers and ritual specialists in the art of dyeing cloth (Gavin; private communication). The latter attitude can, of course, be interpreted as symptomatic of a suppressed rivalry between men and women, where by thwarted women reject a dominant male ideology and replace it with a value system of their own. It is quite possible that this may be true in [Page 165] individual instances; to argue, however, that Iban society as a whole is characterized by sexual rivalry and conflict would be to overstate the case. At the same time, it should also be pointed out that if the institution of headhunting can be identified as a major source of conflict between the sexes, nevertheless both men and women alike had an interest in the taking of heads which were ritually portrayed as a source of fertility for the longhouse community. In this respect if should be noted that women actively encouraged their menfolk to go on the warpath and scorned those who were not able to live up to the warrior ideal (see below).' <sup id="cite_ref-984" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-984">[984]</a></sup> We have provisionally chosen to follow Davison's interpretation of gender relations.

The conjugal tie, as we have already seen, is basic to the structure of the bilek family, and of crucial significance to the kinship system as a whole. Monogamy is reflected in the fact that the terms laki (husband) and bini (wife) can be applied to only one person at a time. Between husband and wife there is no clearly structured pattern of superordination-subordination; although there is a sharply demarcated sexual division of labour, and a differentiation of ritual and other roles, a husband and wife, in their family life, are equals. Again, marriage among the Iban rests not on status, class, clan membership, or any other kind of prescriptive structural consideration but on the affection and regard which a husband and wife have for one another. It is understandable, therefore, that the bond between husband and wife, in the opinion of the Iban is, ideally, closer than that between siblings.' <sup id="cite_ref-987" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-987">[987]</a></sup> Conjugal relations were relatively egalitarian: 'Among the Dyaks no man has more than one wife.

Full membership of a bilek family may also be attained by marrying into it. Marriage, indeed, is a crucial determinant of bilek family membership. As already remarked, the Iban are a rigorously monogamous people, and [Page 30] further, the Iban bilek family--by adat --is a strictly exogamous unit. Iban custom does ordinarily permit the marriage of first cousins ( petunggal diri menyadi ), but incest rules prescribe that marriage between first cousins who are resident members of the same bilek should never take place. From this fact that marriage never occurs within the confines of a single bilek family it follows that every marriage necessitates one of the partners leaving his or her natal or adoptive bilek .' <sup id="cite_ref-991" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-991">[991]</a></sup> The relative frequency of outmarriage and partition was associated with the size of the sibling group: 'A special problem with which one has to deal in attempting to explain the working of the Iban family system is the differential incidence of out-marriage and partition. An obvious way of coping with this question is to examine a series of different sibling groups and to determine, for each of them, the relative incidence of outmarriage, adoption out of the bilek , and bilek partition. One necessary condition for a survey of this kind is that all the sibling groups considered should have reached a stage at which all of the processes to be examined had reached a state of completion. Accordingly, I extracted from my collection of genealogies for R. Nyala, R. Sibat and R. Tungku, all the available cases of this kind. This gave me ninety-eight sibling groups in all--ranging in size from one to nine members. For all of these ninety-eight groups I noted the instances of out-marriage, adoption out, and partition--where they occurred--and then tabulated the results. The results for out-marriage and partition are tabulated in the diagram opposite. Along the horizontal axis of the graph the ninety-eight sibling groups of the sample are arranged in order of size from one to nine; and along the vertical axis frequencies are shown as percentages, cases of out-marriage, as they occurred, as a percentage of all possible cases; cases of partition, as they occurred, as percentage of the total number of cases of partition which might have occurred.' <sup id="cite_ref-992" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-992">[992]</a></sup> 'The diagram can be summarized verbally, as follows: Size of sibling group ref.: out-marriage and partition: 1: Partition never occurs; out-marriage is exceedingly rare (5% of cases); (i.e. sole heir always remains in natal bilek , except in highly rare and unusual circumstances). 2: Out-marriage and partition about equal (e.g. 47%:44%). 3: Out-marriage slightly more common than partition (e.g. 53%:37%). 4: Out-marriage about twice as common as partition (e.g. 66%:29%). 5: Out-marriage remains markedly more common than partition (e.g. about twice as common).' <sup id="cite_ref-993" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-993">[993]</a></sup> 'Let us now glance at the phenomenon of out-marriage. We can, I think, on the evidence from our sample of ninety-eight sibling groups, make a generalization something of this kind: The incidence of marriage out of natal bilek families (i.e. into other bilek families) exhibits a slight tendency to progressive increase as the size of sibling groups (in bilek families) progressively increases.' <sup id="cite_ref-994" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-994">[994]</a></sup> '(E.g. from an average incidence of 48% in the case of sibling groups of two members to an average incidence of 60% in the cases of sibling groups of five and over.) (1) As a sibling group increases in numbers the potential share of any one individual of the bilek estate decreases. (E.g. sole heir inherits whole of estate, two children inherit half each, three one-third each, and so on.) This means that as a sibling group increases in size it becomes increasingly less ‘worth while’ for any member of the group to remain in his natal bilek , with the intention of claiming his share of the bilek estate. In other words, it is more ‘worth while’ (i.e. in his material, social and other interests) for any member of a large sibling group to marry out of his natal bilek and into another with only one or two members in its sibling group. He thus tends to inherit more property; and to acquire, as a result of this, greater social and ritual standing and influence. (2) The male members of large sibling groups are presented with greater opportunities for going on bejalai because their services in farming are not so vitally [Page 50] required. This presents them with greater opportunities for meeting nubile females and settling down in other areas. The inducement for such males to return to a large bilek family is not so great.' <sup id="cite_ref-995" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-995">[995]</a></sup> '(3) All Iban apartments are of about the same size. As a large family grows up living in this confined space becomes increasingly uncongenial. For members of large families out-marriage is the easiest avenue of escape. (Partition is a much more difficult operation, for other members of the sibling group may offer opposition, etc.) (4) The aim of most Iban men and women is to possess a bilek of their own. This confers the independence which is dear to every Iban's heart. Out-marriage is an easier avenue to this independence than partition.' <sup id="cite_ref-996" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-996">[996]</a></sup> 'The incidence of partition exhibits a tendency to progressive decrease as the size of sibling groups progressively increases. (E.g. from an average incidence of 44% in the case of sibling groups of two to three members to an average incidence of 21% in the case of sibling groups of five and over.) These, in general, are the converse of what has been said for out-marriage. When a sibling group is small in size (two to three members) the share of the family estate available to a sibling is sufficiently large (i.e. one-half to one-third) to provide strong inducement. As a sibling group increases in size, however, the share available to a sibling desiring partition becomes progressively less, so offering less inducement towards partition. Because of this, out-marriage offers stronger inducements as the size of the sibling group increases. So the incidence of partition decreases and the incidence of out-marriage increases as the size of the sibling group increases.' <sup id="cite_ref-997" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-997">[997]</a></sup> Howell provides a description of courtship and wedding practices: 'When a young man has been successful in his wooing, and has made an alliance with a maiden, he leaves her a ring as a pledge of his betrothal to her. After visiting her for some little time and finding her faithful to him, he asks for his parent's consent to marry. If his parents have no objection to his choice they go to see the girl's parents and take a cup with them to ask for their daughter. If the girl's parents approve of the contract they accept the cup. The cup is the final pledge of a marriage contract between the two parties. They then fix the day when the bride is to be fetched.' <sup id="cite_ref-998" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-998">[998]</a></sup> 'The marriage ceremony is very simple and is celebrated in the bride's house. It consists of splitting a pinang or areca nut into seven pieces and these are put on a brass tray with seven serih leaves, seven pieces of gambier and seven small lumps of lime. All the friends and relations gather round the tray and eat it's contents, at the same time talking over the binding nature of the marriage contract. It is to this effect. If a man leaves or puts away his wife unless she commits adultery or on account of an unlucky dream, or a bad omen. or inhospitality to stranger, or bad temper, he will be fined according to the law laid down by their forefathers. Similar things are also said about the woman. The binding nature of a Dyak marriage in itself is good, if it be carried out. There are other rules connected with marriage among Dyaks, such as, if the wife in the natural course of things becomes blind, or diseased, and the husband puts her away, he must incur a heavy fine. 8imilar rules also are binding on the wife.' <sup id="cite_ref-999" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-999">[999]</a></sup> Low claims that permarital sexual relations were common in some groups: 'Though from their friendly intercourse with the Malays they have adopted some of the customs, and have borrowed considerably from the language of that [Page 195] people, they have not introduced polygamy, or, with the exception of slavery, any other of their reprehensible practices. The ceremony of marriage, as far as I have learnt, is very simple, and consists merely in the persons, who have previously agreed upon the point, living together, and a feast being made on the occasion to which all who choose may repair. Their marriage feasts, like all the others, usually end in the whole of the persons assembled becoming intoxicated with a fermented beverage which they make from rice, and which they affirm they were taught by the Chinese. The state of morality amongst the Sakarran and Sambas Dyaks is strangely more lax than in any of the other tribes. It is affirmed, and they themselves have frequently told me, that it is the common custom for the unmarried women to have amongst the similarly situated of the other sex, lovers to whom they are liberal of their favours: this proceeds with the knowledge and consent of the parents for some time, but if the girl should prove pregnant, the father of the child must take the mother for his wife; but if the connexion should long continue without the attainment of this desired result, the acquaintance is discontinued, and they each seek new sharers of their loves. Should they not be constant to each other during this stage of their intimacy, the offence, though public, never becomes an occasion of scandal to either person concerned, and nothing is said of it except, perhaps, by the one who has been deceived. [Page 196] Though virtue before marriage is thus little respected, faithlessness after the marriage feast has taken place is a grave and serious offence in which the whole village is concerned. I believe it is punished by fine, but the offence is of such rare occurrence that no person to my knowledge ever incurred the penalty. The license granted to the young women appears amongst these people only to extend to their own nation, but it is probable, and in fact certain, in some tribes, that their favours are liberally extended to the Malays, should any happen to reside in their vicinity. This laxity of manners has been carried so far, that I have been assured that should a chief, or distinguished warrior of another tribe, travelling through the country, rest for a night at a village, it is a necessary part of their hospitality to provide a girl for his companion; but my information on this particular is derived from the Malays. I, however, think it correct, as a similar custom is always followed by the Kyans.' <sup id="cite_ref-1000" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1000">[1,000]</a></sup> Iban notions of incest included a 'generation taboo' that if broken was in need of ritual redress. Sandin provides a description: 'If the bridegroom's parents agree to pay the marriage price, then a genealogist ( tukang tusut ) will recite the bride's and the bridegroom's family trees to see whether the marriage is incestuous or not. Incestuous means in this connection that the couple are kin of different generations. If their union is incestous to this sense then the bridal parents should infrom the Penghulu (district chief) that the coming marriage ceremony of their children will be celebrated with besapat ka ai or bekalih didarat depending on the category of the incest as discussed earlier (cf, pp. 29-30).'  <sup id="cite_ref-1001" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1001">[1,001]</a></sup> 'In addition, he also recites the customs regarding marriage in defiance of the generation taboo which is disastrous, following Sengalang Burong's advice which he gave to his grandson, Sera Gunting who committed incest with his mother's sister, Endu Dara Chempaka Tempurong Alang alias Dayang Patri Langit. After he has related those customs, he then begins to set forth his pedigree further and gives information regarding his forefathers' expensive dowries as they were rich and chivalrous. On reaching the generation of the bride and bridegroom, he then discloses their relationship. The people will discuss the appropriate customs to remedy the marriage which might happen to be in defiance of the generation [Page 35] taboo, after the genealogist has set forth his pedigree up to that stage. If their relationship is calculated from their parents, and is in the ratio of one to two (which means that he is married to his auntie or niece), then the water is being partitioned for them, and two pigs will be slaughtered: one is to be killed in the water while the other will be butchered on land. They are requested to bathe themselves with the water that has been saturated with the blood of the pigs. The pigs to be slaughtered must be the ones that have had litters, and the jar that the bridegroom produces must be equivalent to the monetary value of nine dollars while the bride pays seven dollars. (Other customs are obtainable from a book entitled “Sengalang Burong”.)' <sup id="cite_ref-1002" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1002">[1,002]</a></sup> 'If their generation ratio is at two to three, the water is being partitioned for them and the number of pigs that have had litters is the same. But the amount of money paid decreases. A pig is slaughtered to smear the land if their generation ratio is at three to four. They are forced to cut down fruit trees if their marriage is at the generation gap of four to five ratio. When their generation ratio is five to six, they are only asked to bite on a piece of iron. The bride and bridegroom are requested to bite grains of salt if their marriage is at the generation ratio of six to seven. This is to protect their bodies and souls.' <sup id="cite_ref-1003" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1003">[1,003]</a></sup> 'Later, the guests are asked to take their seats to consume breakfast. After the breakfast the newly-wedded couple will undergo another ceremony to release them from taboo if they are married in defiance of it. They are brought to a river where they will be bathed with the blood of a pig together with river water. If their marriage does not cause disaster, the ceremonial cutting of betel nuts into slices, which is the actual marriage session, ends upon the child's awakening.' <sup id="cite_ref-1004" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1004">[1,004]</a></sup> 'Arriving at the river, the appointed man proceeds to make an invocation, calling for God and all members of the marine supernaturals, so that they will know about the ceremony of releasing the couple who are married in defiance of the taboo. He also appeals to [Page 37] God and the marine supernaturals not to cause disaster because the error of human beings getting married in defiance of the generation taboo has been corrected in accordance with the customs laid down by Sengalang Burong. The person who has been appointed to slaughter the pig then kills it with a sword. Its blood flows downriver to the place where the couple, who are to be released from the taboo, are taking their ceremonial bath.' <sup id="cite_ref-1005" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1005">[1,005]</a></sup> 'While the pig is being slaughtered, the man who has been assigned to act as a ghost across river shouts at the people on the other side of the river as to why they are making such a lot of noise. In response to this question, an elder from this side of the river answers: “We are releasing so and so from the generation taboo as they are married in defiance of it. In accordance with our old customs, we are, therefore, smearing lands with the blood of a pig ceremonially, in order to prevent disasters such as earthquakes, and tidal waves. In addition to this, we are also harmonising the water with the following: [...] After the appointed man has killed the pig at the river, he slaughters another one to smear the land with the blood. The blood of the pig is then buried, while some is sent to farms to prevent disaster. This marks the end of the ceremony to release the couple from the generation taboo.' <sup id="cite_ref-1006" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1006">[1,006]</a></sup> Incest in general was considered to be spiritually dangerous: 'Wrongful acts contrary to adat evoke disapproval and in many instances are punished. The Iban concept of adat also refers to the ways in which people customarily deal with such acts. When the Iban discuss adat they very often use the term to describe, in any given situation, both the rules of behaviour that apply and also the correct punishment to be meted out should these rules be transgressed. The term adat applies to both. For many transgressions punishment takes the form of fines, or reparations of value. The notion of fines ( tunggu ) is closely associated with adat and written codifications of adat are characteristically described as tusun tunggu , or “fine lists” (cf. Richards 1963). Traditionally tunggu is a reparation payable to the injured party and mutually agreed to by both disputants. This is distinguished from the more recent ukum , an imposed fine or penalty, retained all or in part by the government or presiding authority. After the arrival of the Brookes in 1841, Iban fines were systematized and assigned monetary equivalents. In the first chapter of this study the author describes the major scale of fines used today by Iban judicial authorities in the Second Division of Sarawak. Later, in listing specific rules of adat , he stipulates in each case the appropriate class of fines levied in the event of its violation. Generally these fines are stated as maxima and may be reduced depending on circumstances. Many wrontful acts have also spiritual implications and so require ritual propitiation. Some are [Page xiv] thought to disturb relations with the spiritual world and unless repaired by ritual means are believed to provoke supernatural retaliation. For serious offences, such as incest, supernatural danger may extend to the whole community to which the transgress or belongs. In such cases, ritual redress is aimed at preserving the group's collective well-being. In addition, violations, of adat that cause personal injury, or result in damage or loss of possessions, are perceived by the Iban as an attack upon the victim's soul, or spiritual personality. Such acts therefore require ritual redress aimed at reviving the victim's soul, either by itself or in addition to fines. Thus wrongful acts often have spiritual consequences, or are thought to invite supernatural punishment, and these notions further reinforce the moral authority of adat , and the application of fines and more diffuse social sanctions in maintaining compliance.' <sup id="cite_ref-1007" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1007">[1,007]</a></sup> Adultery also required redress through sacrifice: 'On most occasions the victim of the sacrifice, be it pig or fowl, is afterwards eaten. But if the sacrifice be to Pulang Gana at the commencement of the farming, the pig and other offerings are conveyed with the beating of gongs to the land prepared for receiving the seed. The pig is killed, its liver and gall examined for divination, the body and other offerings put in the ground, and some tuak (native spirit) poured upon them; a long invocation is then made to Pulang Gana, the god of the land. If a [Page 204] fowl be sacrificed for adultery, its body is thrown away in the jungle.' <sup id="cite_ref-1008" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1008">[1,008]</a></sup> Adulterers were liable to fines and could not officiate at certain ritual activities: 'The women, as a rule, are faithful to their husbands, and adultery is uncommon when we consider the density of the population. If a woman commit adultery with a husband his wife may fine that woman whoever she may be, or if she prefer it she may waylay her on the ground and thrash her; but if she does this she must forego one-half the fine she would otherwise be entitled to demand. If her husband deserts her she may fine him or require him to provide for her children. If he forsake her in order to marry some other person, she has a right to fine her rival in his affection for enticing him away from her. If either wish to separate from the other and there is no issue to the marriage, nothing is simpler; it is merely necessary to allege a bad dream or adverse omen, and both are free to marry again; but if the dream or omen be a reality, and the pair are not desirous of parting company, they can avert any evil consequences from neglecting to do so by sacrificing a pig.' <sup id="cite_ref-1009" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1009">[1,009]</a></sup> 'When all the guests have arrived and have seated themselves a live fowl is waved over their heads, and then the fowl is killed and the forehead of everybody is touched with the blood. The toddy is distributed and the cheers begin. Quiet again reigns when food is served out. After everybody has eaten an elderly man is asked to make the sacrifice and the offering to Pulang Gana, Ini Andan , and Manang Jaban . The man that is selected to officiate must necessarily be free from the stain of adultery. He takes his position on the platform ( tanju ) just below the eaves of the roof; two or three mats are spread one above the other and he [Page [p.38]] sits on them; above him home-made blankets ( pua kumbu ) are suspended like an awning; a wooden trough is put before him and in it the whetstones are put; above the whetstones a pig is placed and the man takes a spear and pierces the heart of the pig and the blood is made to run into the wooden trough to besmear the whetstones. After the sacrifice is over the man commences to make an offering of pinang, sireh , black pulut rice, and barley cooked in leaves, smoked fish, eggs, sweet cakes, and smoked keli . This offering is put into the wooden trough with the whetstones. The man then invokes Pulang Gana Raja Sua, Ini Andan , and Manang Jaban , beseeching them to look and behold and to turn their faces towards them; he requests them to listen to their petitions, protect them, and show favour to them.' <sup id="cite_ref-1010" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1010">[1,010]</a></sup> But it appears that seasonal migrations by men occasionally led to adultery: 'The lengthy absence of males on bejalai clearly affects their home communities, particularly their wives and children. Although most children apparently miss their fathers, they support bejalai as a means of earning money for the family. Batang Ai women approve the institution and yet complain about their husbands' absences. In some cases, absences due to bejalai result in adultery, separation, and/or broken marriages.' <sup id="cite_ref-1011" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1011">[1,011]</a></sup> 'In addition to the problems of sickness and farm work, women mentioned the loss of companionship with their spouse. About one-third of those interviewed emphasized their loneliness while their husbands were on bejalai. In some extreme instances, the lack of companionship led to adultery and separation. Cases of divorce or separation because of bejalai were often brought to court. The Simanggang Court Case Books record proceedings of hearings to request or contest divorce as early as 1879. Women interviewed knew of 11 cases of adultery in the study area that resulted from bejalai.' <sup id="cite_ref-1012" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1012">[1,012]</a></sup> 'Jealousy is the trait most commonly attributed to Iban women by Iban men. The Iban word for jealousy, ninding , is instructive, because it derives from dinding or “wall”. The inference I draw from the word is that women in traditional Iban society attempted to secure or “wall” in their outgoing men, but with little apparent success. There was the expectation--indeed, the legitimization by men--of husbands philandering while on bejalai certainly one of the motives for men undertaking their travels. According to some of my informants, husbands reverted to the status of bachelor and might take another wife in addition to the one he left behind. This happened in the extended travels of Tun Jugah etween 1918 and 1921. Though he was married, both Jugah and his brother Tedong took wives in a Kenyah community. Upon their return to their home community, they left their Kenyah wives and Jugah returned to find that his own young bride had divorced him and had gone back to her parents.' <sup id="cite_ref-1013" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1013">[1,013]</a></sup> Graham claims that male adulterers were treated more leniently than female ones: 'The factors outlined above -- the high social valuation and ritual elaboration of specifically male achievements, together with an implicit recognition of men's dependence on women's cooperation -- inform certain behavioural and ideational complexes [Page 107] found amongst the Iban. Men's anxiety about their own adequacy and potency is evident in assertive boasting about the size of their penises (Heppell 1975:115), in castration dreams (Freeman 1968:372), and in the practice of wearing a penis pin ( palang ) (Freeman 1968:388). Their vulnerability, should their women be seduced away from them, is expressed in their violent reaction to being cuckolded (Heppell 1976) and is reified in the customary law forbearance of male, but condemnation of female, adultery when spouses are apart (Freeman 1967:335). Tension between the sexes finds expression in women's mockery of men and male pretensions. Freeman reports that the mockery of men is one of the favourite pastimes of Iban women and describes it occurring in both a social and a ritual context' <sup id="cite_ref-1014" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1014">[1,014]</a></sup> Divorce could be either temporary or permanent: 'Much as the Dyak marriage ceremony seems to be binding, yet when it comes to the question of divorce it reveals the whole secret, and lowers it's rite before the eyes of civilization.

<dl><dd><b>♠ charity ♣ absent ♥</b> Prosocial behavior was based on mutual assistance and self-help within residential and kin groups rather than charity. eHRAF provides a general description of the kinship system: 'The fundamental unit of Iban society is the BILEK-family, a group of five or six persons defined by kinship and affinity. Depending upon negotiations at a couple's marriage, there is an almost even chance that their children will be born into the family of either the wife or the husband. Iban families are part of a widely ramifying kinship system which developed in response to Iban mobility. The SUKU JURU and KABAN BELAYAN correspond to the kindred. The former connotes kin ties originating with one's grandparents and includes persons to the degree of first cousin. The latter is any group of people who share rights of reciprocity with an Iban, and may include nonkin and even non-Iban. More inclusive groups include "the brotherhood" and "food-sharers", made up of distant kin who would be invited to one's festivals, or whose festivals an Iban would attend. Attachment is ambilateral and descent, ambilineal. Although some Iban are capable of reconstructing genealogies up to fifteen generations in depth, such reconstructions are selective and illustrate the Iban practice of "genealogizing" so as to establish ancestral ties with strangers.' <sup id="cite_ref-1025" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1025">[1,025]</a></sup> 'Terms of reference are Eskimo and the terms of address, Hawaiian.' <sup id="cite_ref-1026" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1026">[1,026]</a></sup> 'The BILEK-family is an autonomous unit, able to join with other units of a longhouse or to detach itself. Iban become members of a family through birth, adoption, marriage, or incorporation. The family is responsible for construction of its own unit, production of its own food, and management of its own affairs. In a sample of 1,051 families, 60 percent were comprised of parents and children, 40 percent included grandparents. The family is a kin-based, corporate group, holding in trust land, sacred rice, sacred charms, ritual formulas, taboos, and heirloom gongs and jars. Traditionally, one son or daughter has remained in the BILEK to ensure continuity over time. With urban migration, and mail service making possible postal remittances, an increasing number of parents have no adult child residing in the BILEK with them.' <sup id="cite_ref-1027" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1027">[1,027]</a></sup> 'Each longhouse, as each BILEK, is an autonomous unit. Traditionally the core of each house was a group of descendants of the founders. Houses near one another on the same river or in the same region were commonly allied, marrying among themselves, raiding together beyond their territories, and resolving disputes by peaceful means. Regionalism, deriving from these alliances, in which Iban distinguished themselves from other allied groups, persist in modern state politics. Essentially egalitarian, Iban are aware of long-standing status distinctions among themselves of RAJA BERANI (wealthy and brave), MENSI SARIBU (commoners), and ULUN (slaves). Prestige still accrues to descendants of the first status, disdain to descendants of the third.' <sup id="cite_ref-1028" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1028">[1,028]</a></sup> Prior to the colonial period, leadership was informal: 'Prior to the arrival of the British adventurer, James Brooke, there were no permanent leaders, but the affairs of each house were directed by consultations of family leaders. Men of influence included renowned warriors, bards, augurs and other specialists. Brooke, who became Rajah of Sarawak, and his nephew, Charles Johnson, created political positions -- headman (TUAI RUMAH), regional chief (PENGHULU), paramount chief (TEMENGGONG) -- to restructure Iban society for administrative control, especially for purposes of taxation and the suppression of head-hunting. The creation of permanent political positions and the establishment of political parties in the early 1960s have profoundly changed the Iban.' <sup id="cite_ref-1029" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1029">[1,029]</a></sup> Social control was exercised by headmen and elders; spirit beliefs were also important: 'Iban employ three strategies of social control. First, from childhood, they are taught to avoid conflict, and for a majority, every effort is made to prevent it. Second, they are taught by story and drama of the existence of numerous spirits, who vigilantly ensure observation of numerous taboos; some spirits are interested in preserving the peace, while others are responsible for any strife that arises. In these ways, the stresses and conflicts of ordinary life, especially life in the longhouse, in which one is in more or less constant sight and sound of others, have been displaced onto the spirits. Third, the headman hears disputes between members of the same house, the regional chief, disputes between members of different houses, and government officers, hear those disputes that headmen and regional chiefs cannot resolve.' <sup id="cite_ref-1030" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1030">[1,030]</a></sup></dd>

For this ceremony the feast chief appoints the longhouse elders to make offerings to God and to the particular deity or spirit who has asked him to hold the feast. After the offerings have been made, one of the elders recites a long prayer ( sampi ) to beseech God and the deities and their followers to bless the feast chief so that he can successfully do his future work in good health.

According to custom the feast chief should be a man whose deceased kinsman was the eldest in the longhouse among those who are being honoured by the gawai , provided that the deceased was not a person of low rank. If the oldest of these being honoured was a person of low rank, a man whose deceased was next in age will be appointed to become the feast chief. After a feast chief has been appointed, it is his duty to direct the people of the longhouse in making preparations for the festival.' <sup id="cite_ref-1069" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1069">[1,069]</a></sup> 'That same night the feast chief and others will set the day for the beban . Once the day has been agreed upon, the chief asks the members of every family in the longhouse to cook glutinous rice for brewing tuak wine. After the tuak has been made, invitations are sent to all of those whom the hosts wish to attend the beban ramu sungkup celebration. On the morning of the beban day, that is the day on which the materials are collected and fashioned ready for use in erecting the sungkup huts, the feast chief will first make an offering to the spirits. Half of this offering is left in the longhouse while the other half is brought by him to the place where he will prepare the materials for the sungkup in the jungle. This offering is made so that the spirits of the dead may not hinder the progress of the work in the jungle. 6 The people of other families also make individual offerings to the spirits in the jungle at the same time, but it is not necessary for them to make offerings in the longhouse, as this has been done collectively by the feast chief. While working in the jungle the workers enjoy themselves with tuak wine and food. After all the materials have been collected and fashioned, they are taken back to the longhouse. They must not be carried into the building before the materials of the feast chief have been smeared with the blood of two chickens or the blood of a young pig at the foot of the longhouse ladder and have been brought into the house. The materials brought by the other man must follow the same route as taken by the feast chief, but need not be smeared with blood. The consequence of failure to observe this rule is said to be angat , or “heat”, causing ill-health in the community, and the offender is fined by the feast chief according to the Gawai Antu adat .' <sup id="cite_ref-1070" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1070">[1,070]</a></sup> 'While the men prepare sungkup materials in the jungle, the women collect bamboo for making the garong baskets into which the bamboo containers filled with holy wine are put during the Gawai Antu festival. After sufficient bamboo has been collected by the women, they bring it home along the same path as was used by the men in bringing the other materials into the house. It is not necessary that these bamboo materials be smeared with blood, as they are considered part of the things given to the dead after the Gawai Antu is over. After all the materials for the sungkup hut and garong baskets are ready, the feast chief holds another meeting to set a day for ngeretok and the weaving of the garong baskets. After the day is fixed, the feast chief and others start to brew their tuak wine and begin to buy or look for chickens and other necessities, other than pigs, from their relatives and friends in other villages. Three days before the ngeretok takes place, a few men carry invitations to other villages up and down the river requesting their attendance at the feast.' <sup id="cite_ref-1071" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1071">[1,071]</a></sup> 'A day prior to the ngeretok day, at about 9 a.m.the feast chief waves a chicken along the longhouse galleries to ask the people of every family to make their pantar seats at the outermost part of the family upper galleries for the guests to sit on during the ngeretok day. When this is done, the men make the duran platform and the frames for cooking glutinous rice at the river bank. While the men are making their pantar, duran and frames, gendang rayah are beaten by people in the longhouse. At about 4 p.m. the feast chief again waves a chicken to ask the women to soak their glutinous rice in the river. When the women have completed soaking their rice, the older men of each family make their rugan (altar) at the tempuan passage of their family bilek . Here daily offerings are made from that evening onward until the end of the Gawai Antu. These offerings consist of smoked blau fish, smoked keli fish, smoked udun fish, a few slices of janggat fruit and terong (brinjals). Without the inclusion of the latter, according to Iban belief, the tuak wines of the feast will be turned sour by the goddess Indai Billai, who is thought to visit the longhouse from her home in the other world during the Gawai Antu preparations from that day onward. At sunset the first ngalu antu music is performed by men of each family in the longhouse; it is performed at every sunset and sunrise from this day until the celebration of the Gawai Antu. This practice was originated by Sera Gunting, the grandson of Singalang Burong, when he held a Gawai Antu celebration for his grandfather, following the teaching of Bujang Langgah Lenggan, the prince of the other world. Bujang Langgah Lenggan is thought to be the husband of Dara Rambai Geruda, the daughter of Raja Niram and Ini Inan of Sebayan. When the ngalu antu music is in the air, the Ibans believe that the spirits of the dead are present and are thronging around to eat the offerings and witness the festival preparations.' <sup id="cite_ref-1072" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1072">[1,072]</a></sup> 'After dinner that night, the feast chief makes offerings to the spirits of the dead. After he has made his offerings, other people in the longhouse make their's. These offerings are placed by each owner at the spot where materials for the sungkup will be assembled by the carpenters on the ngeretok day. Before dawn men and women start to cook glutinous rice at the river bank. The women fill the bamboo containers with rice while the men cook [Page 54] them on the frames. At this time the feast chief sits near the offering on the duran platform till the cooking of rice is ended. As the cooking starts, the people in the longhouse perform their gendang rayah music five times successively.' <sup id="cite_ref-1073" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1073">[1,073]</a></sup> 'After the rice has been cooked and brought back to the longhouse, the morning meal is eaten. After this meal, the ngalu antu music is performed by men of every family. As soon as ngalu antu is over, the festival cock fights take place on the section of the lower gallery belonging to the feast chief, in order to please the spirits of the dead who are believed to be lingering around in the longhouse. In particular, the cock fighting leaders of the Sabayan world, Ensing Jara and Kedawa, are believed to be present. Shortly after the cock fights are ended, the feast chief waves a chicken to ask that persons from each family to spread new mats along their section of the gallery. Having done this, he waves a chicken again to ask the hosts to arrange the seats of guests who have begun to arrive in a row ( bedijir ). along the family galleries. After the seating of the guests is in order, the feast chief waves a chicken to ask the hosts to offer nyibor the tuak wine to the guests. After the guests have drunk their tuak wine, the feast chief waves a chicken to inform the celebrants that the ngeretok and nganyam are to start. At this time all the carpenters and selected weavers cut and plan the materials for a sungkup hut and weave the smooth pieces of bamboo for the baskets.' <sup id="cite_ref-1074" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1074">[1,074]</a></sup> 'The garong baskets given to women were mostly gelayan type. The ordinary weavers of pua kumbu blankets and tikai bebuah mats were given garong tunggal type, while the leading weavers were given a red painted basket called lebor api . They were not to be given the garong beranggong , i.e. one placed upon the other as given to men, as they were not warriors and naturally have never killed enemies. The garong basket given to women thus could not be decorated with the hair of slain enemies. The weavers of garong baskets must be women of good character. They must not be adulterous or thieves for the hands of such persons are considered to be “unclean” and so their work is not recognised by the spirits of the dead. This also applies to those who are asked to hand the holy wine ( ai jalong timang ) to the warriors who drink it as mention below. The work of ngeretok should be finished by evening. But if either the making of sungkup huts or the weaving of garong baskets is not completed that day, the carpenters and weavers are permitted to finish their work on the following day.' <sup id="cite_ref-1075" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1075">[1,075]</a></sup> 'After the ngeretok is done, the feasters are free to visit their friends and neighbours, other than their relatives, to inform them that they are now preparing a Gawai Antu festival to discharge their obligations toward the members of their family who have died since the last feast was held by making a sungkup tomb-hut. They also announce that a ngempi'e ceremony is soon to be held for the people of that longhouse to brew tuak wine for the coming Gawai Antu celebration. The people visited give them chickens, money and beras pulut (glutinous rice). Some days after the feasters return from visiting their neighbours, the feast chief calls a meeting to set the day for brewing ngempi'e tuak wine. If the families of the longhouse agree to hold it a day later, then the feast chief asks all of the women to pound sufficient rice for the wine.' <sup id="cite_ref-1076" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1076">[1,076]</a></sup> 'At noon of the ngempi'e day, the feast chief waves a chicken along the galleries of the house to ask the women to begin their initial pounding of glutinous rice for tuak wine. Gawai adat stipulates that the woman who first pounds her rice be the wife of the feast chief and that she does the pounding at the tempuan passage outside her family room. The pounding must be done here as it is at the tempuan passage that the goddess Indai Bilai will sit close to the offerings on the Rugan altar during the night of the Gawai Antu festival. After the feast chief's wife has pounded her rice, the other women in the longhouse follow suit, each at her respective passage. Only a little rice is pounded on this occasion as most has already been pounded weeks in advance. Shortly after the women start to pound their rice, the feast chief waves his chicken to ask the people to make or repair the frames ( raran ) they will use for cooking the glutinous rice and also the duran platforms at the river bank. At 4 p.m. the feast chief again waves a chicken to ask the women to soak their rice in the river. As the women carry their rice to the river landing five men perform gendang rayah in the longhouse. This music ends when the women finish soaking their rice in the river.' <sup id="cite_ref-1077" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1077">[1,077]</a></sup> 'At 6 p.m. the feast chief waves his chicken again to ask every family to spread their mats over all the galleries of the longhouse, as a sign that the [Page 56] ngempi'e feast is to begin. After the mats have been spread over the floor of the galleries a ceremony of ngalu antu is started with the music of gongs and a fire is lit at the rugan altar near the daily offerings.' <sup id="cite_ref-1078" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1078">[1,078]</a></sup> 'That night all the relatives and friends who were invited to help with the work of ngempi'e are entertained by their hosts with food and tuak wine. At around 4 a.m. the next morning the feast chief waves a chicken to ask the men and women to start cooking the glutinous rice for the Gawai Antu tuak . As these people are going down to the river bank led by the feast chief himself, other men in the longhouse perform gendang rayah . This music ends when all the rice has been cooked. After the rice has been cooked its owners bring the bamboo containers back to their family rooms. On their arrival, the morning ngalu antu starts, followed by a morning meal along the communal lower galleries. After this, both men and women remove the rice from the containers and lay it out on clean mats. After they have done this, the rice is fermented and put in tepayan jars. In a fortnight's time the tuak is drinkable. After the ngempi'e feast is over, the women and their female relatives from other villages start to make various kinds of buns, such as penganan sarang semut, penganan chuan , and penganan sepit , for the coming Gawai Antu. Each family makes at least ten to twelve tins of buns.' <sup id="cite_ref-1079" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1079">[1,079]</a></sup> 'While the women are making buns, the men are busy with other work, such as buying bulls, oxen and pigs to be consumed together with the numerous chickens they have reared themselves for the occasion. After the feasters are satisfied with the number of bulls, oxen and pigs they have bought the feast chief calls a meeting to fix a day for the Gawai Antu to be held. After a day has been agreed upon seven days before the festival day, four trustworthy men are asked to carry the invitation to every longhouse up and down the river. The day prior to the celebration of Gawai Antu is called hari mantar , -- a day the hosts make new seats between the communal galleries and the tempuan passage of the longhouse. At the present time, as the floors of most longhouse are made of hardwood planks, pantar seats are no longer necessary, as they were fifty or more years ago. The waving of a chicken by the feast chief to ask that the pantar be made is nowadays done to symbolise that the hari mantar is celebrated in accordance with the festival rules. Instead of making the pantar seats in the house as in the old days, the workers only repair the old duran platform and the cooking frames ( raran ) at the river bank, if they are no longer serviceable.' <sup id="cite_ref-1080" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1080">[1,080]</a></sup> 'Early on hari mantar day close relatives of the feasters come before the other guests, who will arrive on the Gawai Antu day, in order to help their relatives to kill bulls, oxen and pigs, while the women help with the cooking. Most of the chickens are roasted for the guests to eat during the reception ceremony. That night shortly after the ngalu antu ceremony, the feast chief waves a chicken to ask the women to soak their glutinous rice. As the latter are doing this, men in the house play the gendang rayah . The music continues until the soaking of rice is finished. The dinner takes place along the lower galleries at about 8 p.m. It lasts for about an hour and the hosts serve their relatives with meats and wines of high quality. After the dinner is over, each family invites its relatives to eat [Page 57] many kinds of food in the family room. As they enjoy themselves with food and drink, the hosts tell their relatives that they are very happy to be able to fulfil their duty in holding the Gawai Antu and build the sungkup tomb huts for their departed parents or grandparents and in making the garong baskets.' <sup id="cite_ref-1081" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1081">[1,081]</a></sup> 'In answering their hosts, the relatives present will say that the spirits of the departed will, after the Gawai Antu is held, bless the feasters with good luck in all the work they do, as they have not failed to respect their dead with a grand festival. They also pray that the spirits of their ancestors will not fail to give prosperity to the successive generations of their descendants in this world. At around 4 a.m. the feast chief waves a chicken to ask the men and women to cook their glutinous rice at the river bank. 8 After this, the feast chief himself leads the others down to the river bank to do their rice cooking. As he reaches the duran platform the feast chief spreads a mat on the platform where he will sit near the offering he brings from the house. As he sits here the gendang rayah music is booming in the air. It continues until all the rice has been cooked. The cooking of rice is a very merry time, as many young men and maidens participate in the work. Shortly before sunrise the rice is finally cooked and brought back to the house in bamboo containers.' <sup id="cite_ref-1082" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1082">[1,082]</a></sup> 'Shortly after the rice has been brought home, the hosts and their relatives take their morning meal along the lower galleries of the longhouse.

As soon as the cock fighting is over, the feast chief waves a chicken along the communal longhouse galleries to ask every family to spread new mats on the gallery and to decorate the ceiling and walls of their upper gallery with the best woven blankets hung from ropes. Along the upper gallery ( panggau ) carpets are spread over the ordinary mats by the richer families, and a number of mattresses rolled with coloured carpets are carefully placed at the outermost part of the panggau for guests to lean their backs on during the feast. The poorer families cover the floor of their panggau with mats of various patterns, while their mattresses are rolled with bekuang mats or woven blankets. Above the heads of the guests along the upper galleries are hung the gold embroidered woven blankets by the rich and ordinary pua kumbu blankets by the poorer families.' <sup id="cite_ref-1083" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1083">[1,083]</a></sup> 'Shortly after the longhouse has been decorated with mats and other valuables as mentioned above, the reception of the warriors who have been asked to drink the holy garong wine starts with a waving of a chicken along the galleries by the feast chief. As soon as the chicken has been waved, the feast chief leads a procession of a few men and women while other men play gendang panjai music with drums and gongs. The feast chief is followed by the Tuai Rumah. Behind them walk two women who carry popped rice ( letup ) and a plate of offerings. They are followed by those who perform the music. When the procession reaches the warriors at the space outside the longhouse building, the feast chief invites them to take their seats with him and the Tuai Rumah on a mat which has been spread for the occasion. As they sit here, the feast chief asks the warriors whether they have heard any un- [Page 58] favourable omens on their way to attend the feast. If no omens were heard, good or bad, then the Tuai Rumah only waves a cock above the heads of the warriors with a prayer for a prosperous and peaceful festival. If the warriors have heard or seen bad omens on their way to the feast, then the feast chief appeases them with offerings and wine. But if they have seen the cobra ( tedong ) or a coral snake ( kendawang ) gliding across their way to the feast, then a special reception will be made for them in the longhouse.

As they sit in a row at the lower gallery they are received by the hosts in the following way. First a glass of tuak wine is given to them, known as ai aus , to quench their thirst. After this, each warrior drinks ai untong wine, -- fifteen small glasses of wine each in honour of their attending the festival. After they drink their individual share of wine, a man stands up to wave a cock above the warriors' heads, with the following prayers: “On behalf of the feasters in this house, I wave this cock above your heads to pray to your personal guardian spirits ( tua' ) for the prosperity of our festival. This cock I am holding in my hands will wipe away your unsatisfactory dreams and the omens which you have encountered on your way to this feast.

As the procession ends the young men pour their tuak wine into the glass in the hand of the maidens for them to offer to the warriors and others who accompany them. The drinking of this wine is enlivened by jokes and laughter. After this ceremony is over, curried and roasted meat of pigs and chickens is brought out from the rooms for the warriors to eat with wines of various kinds. This reception lasts an hour. Shortly after the reception of these warriors, another reception takes place for the hosts to receive a group of warriors ( orang ngirup ai jalong timang ) who will drink the wine blessed by the bards. This reception is similar, only that thirteen, rather than fifteen glasses of wine are given to each warrior.

He admits that these spirits are invisible, but says that the guests present may have been divinely inspired to give them blessings on behalf of the spirits of their ancestors Saang and Bedilang, Kaya and Bana, Linggir and Kadir and Rentap and Minggat respectively. 9 “These past chiefs”, he says “were immortally famous in leading their followers in doing prosperous work of all kinds in our country.”' <sup id="cite_ref-1089" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1089">[1,089]</a></sup> 'In answering the speaker, the spokesmen for the guests reply that the spirits of their ancestors are truly present. “They come here to bless your feast so that all of you can become prosperous in doing your future farming and trading.

After the [Page 62] holy wine has been drunk by the drinker, a warrior who heads the next procession hands his holy garong wine to any of the three drinkers to drink. These processions last several hours and are accompanied by men, women and maidens in their best modern and traditional dress. Behind them walk the musicians who beat their gongs and drums.' <sup id="cite_ref-1095" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1095">[1,095]</a></sup> 'As soon as the nganjong garong procession is ended, a beranggap ceremony is held along the lower gallery for the guests to receive presents of glutinous rice, buns, meat and money from the hosts. These foods are eaten by the guests on their way home, so that none will be hungry. After the beranggap is over, the feast chief waves a chicken to inform the guests that the Gawai Antu festival has now come to an end. The sungkup erected on the tanju for display are now dismantled and taken to a place out-side the longhouse to be later set up. As the festival is ended, the guests from far away villages start for home, while the rest linger with the hosts to drink tuak wine in their family rooms. They will return later in the evening. The close relatives and well wishers stay, in order to help the feasters erect their sungkup tomb huts at the graveyard early next day. That night nothing of importance is done in the longhouse, other than for the tired and sleepless hosts to entertain their relatives and friends with food and wine.' <sup id="cite_ref-1096" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1096">[1,096]</a></sup> 'Early next day, all the able-bodied men, women and youngsters carry the sungkup materials, food, cakes and drinks to the cemetery in boats or overland, depending on the location of the graveyard. Upon their arrival, the sungkup materials are first smeared with the blood of a chicken before they are erected over the graves. As men erect the sungkup huts, women and maidens serve food to the workers in the cemetery. At this time a number of heavy drinkers are drunk and a lot of noise is made. This is a happy occasion particularly for those sponsoring the feast, because they have now fulfilled their duty toward the dead. Finally, after all the sungkup huts are erected, the garong baskets are hung either inside the huts or from carved poles called tiang jegada planted closely to each of the sungkup huts. All the participants then return home. That evening most of the relatives return to their own houses, after having helped their relatives for a number of days.' <sup id="cite_ref-1097" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1097">[1,097]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b>♠ Ideology forbids slavery universally ♣ absent ♥</b> The Iban practiced war capture and debt peonage: 'The right to own slaves ( ulun ) and serfs ( jaum or pengurang ) was enjoyed by Iban leaders and warriors since time immemorial. Ulun are captives in war, whereas jaum are debt-servants who were unable to pay their debts due to poverty. The descendants of both ulun and jaum remain the property of their owners until they can free themselves by paying their debt or by holding a festival called a gawai betembang , in which they are freed with the mutual consent of their masters.' <sup id="cite_ref-1098" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1098">[1,098]</a></sup> The Iban regularly enslaved captives taken on raids: 'The Iban trace their origins to the Kapuas Lake region of Kalimantan. With a growing population creating pressures on limited amounts of productive land, the Iban fought members of other tribes aggressively, practicing headhunting and slavery. Enslavement of captives contributed to the necessity to move into new areas. By the middle of the 19th century, they were well established in the First and Second Divisions, and a few had pioneered the vast Rejang River valley.' <sup id="cite_ref-1099" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1099">[1,099]</a></sup> ‘Whether it was due to Malay inspiration or not, head-taking amongst the Saribas and Skrang Iban reached very high proportions, and Morgan has regarded this as a kind of inflationary spiral generated by the high prestige that accrued to success in warlike expeditions. On the other hand, it is evident that a division of plunder, that only gave the heads to the Iban and the rest of the booty to the Malay - as is maintained by some of the earlier writers - is somewhat simplistic, as the Iban also had an interest in arms and other prestige items. The older sources mention, however, that the Iban also took slaves on these raiding expeditions and that the captives were usually women and children. These captives were probably absorbed into the households of their captors where they provided additional labour. With an agricultural system of a type where the size of the area farmed depends very much on the labour available to carry out the arduous but very necessary weeding, it can be argued that the capture of additional women and children to help with the production of the basic staple - padi - will allow an inflation in masculine activities such as warfare and head-hunting since it allows the men to retract from the agricultural sphere.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1100" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1100">[1,100]</a></sup> Slaves were sacrificed occasionally: '95. Throughout the Third Division, stories are told of the punishment meted out to an incestuous couple, in the old days before the coming of Rajah Brooke. On some prominent headland a pit was dug, and into it was cast the offending couple, still alive but trussed together, the woman supine and the man prone. Through their bodies a sharpened bamboo ( aur ) stake was driven, and prayers of expiation uttered. Then the pit was filled in, and the bamboo left to grow, as a sign to future generations. On a head-land at the mouth of Sungai Poi, for example, there stands a great clump of bamboos which are never cut. I seldom passed this point, on my journeys up and down the Rejang, without one of my Iban companions turning to remark, that here, not so many years ago, the rite of pantang , had been performed over the bodies of an incestuous couple. Tales are also told of slaves, captured in war, being sacrificed as part of the rites of expiation which always follow serious cases of incest. That this did occur there can be no doubt, for the second Rajah (then Tuan Muda), records that following the great expedition of 1863, an old Kayan woman was sacrificed by the Iban of the Katibas, the direct ancestors of the Iban now occupying the Baleh. Those responsible were severely reprimanded and fined 12 rusa jars. The blood of the sacrificial victim was smeared over the ritual whet-stones ( batu pemanggol ) of all the inhabitants of the region, for it was believed that this would offset the dire harm with which incestuous behaviour threatened their padi . Whet-stones which have had sacrificial human blood smeared upon them, are termed batu jaum , and rank extremely high among the inheritable ritual possessions of the Iban. Nowadays, when incest occurs, both individuals are heavily fined, and the man is often imprisoned. A proportion of the fine is always set aside as plasi menoa , literally, “in expiation of the land.” It is divided up among all the surrounding long-house communities, and used by them to buy a pig or fowl, the sacrifice of which is the main act in their separate rites of expiation.' <sup id="cite_ref-1101" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1101">[1,101]</a></sup> Slaves could emancipate themselves by performing a special ceremony: 'In order to hold a Gawai Betembang, a slave is requested to brew a few jars of tuak tembang wine. In addition, he must produce a three-fathom lengthen of white calico cloth to be used as a hand rail by those who take part in [Page 82] the betembang procession at the end of the festival. Lastly, he must also produce one fat pig, the liver of which is examined by the augurs. The indication of the liver will foretell the future well-being of the freed slave.' <sup id="cite_ref-1102" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1102">[1,102]</a></sup> 'The slave is always a poor man. It will normally take some months for him to acquire the essentials for the feast, but when these are ready, he will inform his master that he is now prepared to celebrate the betembang festival. As soon as he is told of the readiness of his slave to hold the ceremony, the master will call for a meeting of all the heads of the families of the longhouse to ask for assistance from the well-wishers to provide food for the celebration. The day for the feast is also fixed at this meeting.' <sup id="cite_ref-1103" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1103">[1,103]</a></sup> 'A day or two before the festival day, the slave's master sends his trusted men to call his closest relatives and members of senior families of other villages to come to witness the freeing of his slave by the Gawai Betembang ceremony. They are asked to come in the evening, as the feast lasts throughout the night and ends only with the sacrifice of the pig early the next morning.' <sup id="cite_ref-1104" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1104">[1,104]</a></sup> 'When the guests arrive, they are cordially received by the feasters with full respect. They are entertained lavishly with food and wine as at other festivals. In between the dinner, supper and the morning meal, the guests are free to converse with each other about their exploits in war as well as about their trading ventures overseas. The killing and capture of enemies was the principal topic of conversation at this time in the past.' <sup id="cite_ref-1105" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1105">[1,105]</a></sup> 'Eventually at sunrise, a procession is formed for the slave master and his relatives to walk along the communal galleries of the longhouse. The leader of this procession is the slave master himself who carries a sharp tembang spear. Behind him comes an old aristocrat who carries a flag, and behind them both, another aristocrat who will kill the pig and finally the slave himself who is dressed in grand apparel. He is followed by a number of women and girls of influential families, and lastly the musicians who beat their gongs and drums.' <sup id="cite_ref-1106" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1106">[1,106]</a></sup> 'After the procession has encircled the longhouse lower and upper galleries three times, a speaker at each gallery begins to ask why such a grand procession is held with men and women along the house.

The procession then proceeds to the open air verandah ( tanju ) where the pig is killed.' <sup id="cite_ref-1108" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1108">[1,108]</a></sup> 'Once the pig is slain, its liver is removed and carefully placed on cordyline leaves inside a large bowl.

If such a ransom could not be negotiated, then, as Brooke Low has recorded, the Iban, unlike the Kajang and Kayan whose custom it was to keep slaves “in a condition of perpetual servitude”, would adopt their captives into the tribe and “enfranchise them” (Ling Roth 1896, II:210).' <sup id="cite_ref-1111" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1111">[1,111]</a></sup> 'The enfranchisement of captives taken in war is termed betembang by the Iban, and we are fortunate in having several contemporary accounts of this quite remarkable ritual. According to Brooke Low (Ling Roth 1896, II:210), the ritual of enfranchisement, or betembang , was usually performed during a feast, or gawai , when the owner of a captive would announce to all assembled that he had adopted him “as a brother”, whereupon he would present his new brother with a spear ( tembang ) telling him to slay, with this spear, whoever dared thereafter to “call him a slave” (Figure 8). Howell and Bailey give a somewhat different account (1900:170). “The tembang ”, they say, “was a spear given by the master to the slave when he freed and acknowledged him as his adopted [Page 46] son, and if at a subsequent date the master tried to again claim the released person as his slave, the spear was supposed to execute justice upon the said master...” According to Sandin (1964 b&nbsp;:193), all those attending the gawai betembang were told that if anyone thereafter called him “a slave or a person of low birth”, the enfranchised individual would be entitled to use the spear he had been given to “raid the houses” and “loot the property” ( ngerurok papan, ngerurok luan ) of those who had thus wronged him. The description that I was given in 1950 of ritual enfranchisement (which of course was at that time no longer being practised) was the same as that recorded by Brooke Low, though it was added that sometimes a valuable jar ( tajau ) or gong ( tawak ) would be displayed, with the pledge that if anyone thereafter referred to the adopted captive as a slave ( ulun ) he would, under Iban adat , be fined the equivalent of this piece of property.' <sup id="cite_ref-1112" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1112">[1,112]</a></sup> It appears that most slaves were enfranchised eventually: 'We are still, however, left with the question of the extent to which ritual enfranchisement and adoption was actually practised by the Iban. As I have already mentioned, in 1949-1951 there were, to the best of my knowledge, no unenfranchised captives anywhere in the Baleh region, nor did I encounter such individuals anywhere else in my extensive travels among the Iban of Sarawak. Unenfranchised individuals did obviously exist in the past but, because of the custom of betembang , only in small numbers. Thus, Brooke Low, our best witness in this matter, makes specific mention of the “remarkable fact” that there were “so few slaves, or persons of servile descent” among the Iban (Ling Roth 1896, II:210). Further, even these few unenfranchised individuals did not constitute, as Rousseau has erroneously asserted, a work force of low status for Iban leaders, for, as Brooke Low's father (a trustworthy observer of the Iban) has noted (Low 1848:201), they were “not distinguishable from their masters and mistresses, as they live all together, and fare precisely the same, eating from the same dish and of the same food”. <sup id="cite_ref-1113" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1113">[1,113]</a></sup> Slavery was suppressed in the colonial period: 'From the days of early Brooke rule, the government of Sarawak opposed slavery. In 1880 the second Rajah proclaimed that all slaves must be freed by their owners formally in the Gawai Betembang ceremony. By this decree, any slave who was able to redeem himself, was allowed to do so by compensating his owner with cash or with valuable jars and brass wares. Those who could not pay the compensation were allowed to free themselves by the Gawai Betembang ceremony. The last of these ceremonies took place during the 1890's after which time slavery was officially abolished. Today it is a fineable offence to refer publicly to another person's slave ancestry.' <sup id="cite_ref-1114" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1114">[1,114]</a></sup> We are unsure whether this was followed by an ideological shift within the Iban population.</dd></dl>

Throughout the Third Division, stories are told of the punishment meted out to an incestuous couple, in the old days before the coming of Rajah Brooke. On some prominent headland a pit was dug, and into it was cast the offending couple, still alive but trussed together, the woman supine and the man prone. Through their bodies a sharpened bamboo ( aur ) stake was driven, and prayers of expiation uttered. Then the pit was filled in, and the bamboo left to grow, as a sign to future generations. On a head-land at the mouth of Sungai Poi, for example, there stands a great clump of bamboos which are never cut. I seldom passed this point, on my journeys up and down the Rejang, without one of my Iban companions turning to remark, that here, not so many years ago, the rite of pantang , had been performed over the bodies of an incestuous couple. Tales are also told of slaves, captured in war, being sacrificed as part of the rites of expiation which always follow serious cases of incest.

<p><b>Supernatural Enforcement of Morality</b>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement against harm ♣ present ♥</b> 'Wrongful acts contrary to adat evoke disapproval and in many instances are punished. The Iban concept of adat also refers to the ways in which people customarily deal with such acts. When the Iban discuss adat they very often use the term to describe, in any given situation, both the rules of behaviour that apply and also the correct punishment to be meted out should these rules be transgressed. The term adat applies to both. [...] Many wrongful acts have also spiritual implications and so require ritual propitiation. Some are [Page xiv] thought to disturb relations with the spiritual world and unless repaired by ritual means are believed to provoke supernatural retaliation. For serious offences, such as incest, supernatural danger may extend to the whole community to which the transgress or belongs. In such cases, ritual redress is aimed at preserving the group's collective well-being. In addition, violations, of adat that cause personal injury, or result in damage or loss of possessions, are perceived by the Iban as an attack upon the victim's soul, or spiritual personality. Such acts therefore require ritual redress aimed at reviving the victim's soul, either by itself or in addition to fines.

<dd><b>♠ in-group loyalty ♣ present ♥</b> The in-group coincided with the kin group or residential community. eHRAF provides a general introduction to the kinship and residence system: 'The fundamental unit of Iban society is the BILEK-family, a group of five or six persons defined by kinship and affinity. Depending upon negotiations at a couple's marriage, there is an almost even chance that their children will be born into the family of either the wife or the husband. Iban families are part of a widely ramifying kinship system which developed in response to Iban mobility. The SUKU JURU and KABAN BELAYAN correspond to the kindred. The former connotes kin ties originating with one's grandparents and includes persons to the degree of first cousin. The latter is any group of people who share rights of reciprocity with an Iban, and may include nonkin and even non-Iban. More inclusive groups include "the brotherhood" and "food-sharers", made up of distant kin who would be invited to one's festivals, or whose festivals an Iban would attend. Attachment is ambilateral and descent, ambilineal. Although some Iban are capable of reconstructing genealogies up to fifteen generations in depth, such reconstructions are selective and illustrate the Iban practice of "genealogizing" so as to establish ancestral ties with strangers.' <sup id="cite_ref-1173" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1173">[1,173]</a></sup> 'Terms of reference are Eskimo and the terms of address, Hawaiian.' <sup id="cite_ref-1174" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1174">[1,174]</a></sup> 'The BILEK-family is an autonomous unit, able to join with other units of a longhouse or to detach itself. Iban become members of a family through birth, adoption, marriage, or incorporation. The family is responsible for construction of its own unit, production of its own food, and management of its own affairs. In a sample of 1,051 families, 60 percent were comprised of parents and children, 40 percent included grandparents. The family is a kin-based, corporate group, holding in trust land, sacred rice, sacred charms, ritual formulas, taboos, and heirloom gongs and jars. Traditionally, one son or daughter has remained in the BILEK to ensure continuity over time. With urban migration, and mail service making possible postal remittances, an increasing number of parents have no adult child residing in the BILEK with them.' <sup id="cite_ref-1175" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1175">[1,175]</a></sup> Resident members of longhouse families shared rights in arable land: 'Rights to land are established by clearing and farming it, or by occupying it. Rights to the use of farmland are vested in the BILEK-family, and are held in perpetuity. These rights are maintained in the living memory of the residents of each longhouse. Boundaries are indicated by landforms or trees, or are marked by planting a row of bamboo. Except for the land overshadowed by the eaves of the longhouse, there is no land to which a community holds rights. With the introduction of surveys and titles to land in the early 1900s, Iban who lived closer to government centers obtained titles to their land, under which rights of individual families to land could be verified. As a result of increased population and the commercialization of land, some Iban have bought land for investment and speculation.' <sup id="cite_ref-1176" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1176">[1,176]</a></sup> Accordingly, residence was paramount in the structuring of resoure-sharing and cooperation: 'Male and female children share equally in rights to real and other property so long as they remain members of their natal BILEK. Children who move out of the BILEK at marriage or for any other reason receive a small portion of the family estate, and in theory relinquish all rights to family land. In fact, however, they retain the right to request land for farming at the annual meeting commencing the agricultural year.' <sup id="cite_ref-1177" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1177">[1,177]</a></sup> 'In accordance with custom, an Iban who marries into another longhouse and joins his or her spouse's family is no longer entitled to inherit ancestral lands left behind in the former longhouse area. If such an individual has no siblings living in his or her original family bilek , these lands are left under the guardianship of the Tuai Rumah, who has authority to allow other members of the longhouse to make use of them until one of the former owner's heirs can re-establish the ancestral bilek and reclaim its lands. Only lands which are officially titled can be claimed wherever the owner lives in the country; otherwise rights of use are contigent upon the family's continual residence within the longhouse where the land is located. This means that if an Iban migrates from one river to another, he will automatically loose rights to all of his temuda lands which have no official title. If he has no sibling living in the village these lands will become available for use by the people of the longhouse he has left and are subject to reapportionment by the Tuai Rumah.' <sup id="cite_ref-1178" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1178">[1,178]</a></sup> 'Typically the ownership of the bilik apartment passes from parents to children. It is rare, however, for married siblings to share the same bilik , and so the apartment usually goes to just one child and his or her spouse. The remaining brothers and sisters will then marry into other bilik -families, or else establish a new bilik on their own. As will be evident from this last statement, residence patterns following marriage may be either virilocal or uxorilocal, with no particular preference being given for either one form of the other. Nor is there any formal principle - such as a rule of primogeniture - to decide which individual in a group of siblings gets to inherit the bilik in which they were born.' <sup id="cite_ref-1179" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1179">[1,179]</a></sup> '10. Within the bilek family siblings have equivalent rights; in other words, they are parceners or co-heirs. If a sibling marries out he thereby relinquishes rights of inheritance in his natal bilek family, but acquires rights in the bilek family into which he marries. This rule applies equally to men and to women. When divorce occurs an individual returns to his or her natal bilek family and resumes rights there; but widows and widowers do not return to their natal bilek families. Thus, an analysis of 52 cases showed that there were 26 widows or widowers living as members of their natal bilek families, and 26 who were living in bilek families of which they were members by right of marriage and local residence.' <sup id="cite_ref-1180" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1180">[1,180]</a></sup> '2. The bilek , with the exception of certain ritual objects, is a partible estate; and a sibling who remains in his (or her) natal bilek has the right to claim a proportionate share of the family inheritance, and set up a separate domestic unit. This is a common happening. Indeed, when two elementary families emerge [Page 8] within a bilek, partition always follows in due course. This precludes the development of joint or extended families, and nowhere in Sarawak did I encounter siblings--married and having adult children of their own--who were still living together as members of the same bilek. Again, my observations showed that partition always involves the break-up of a sibling group. When partition occurs one sibling and his (or her) family secedes from the ancestral bilek to found a new and independent household. Furthermore, this sibling is just as likely to be a man as a woman; thus, an analysis of 34 cases of partition showed that 17 founders of seceding families were males, while 17 were females. A fundamental feature of partition is that each part--after partition has occurred--is an autonomous unit in its own right, and not merely a constituent part of some wider corporate group. The partition of bilek families as it occurs in Iban society is thus a different process from segmentation as it occurs in societies based on unilineal principles.' <sup id="cite_ref-1181" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1181">[1,181]</a></sup> 'Further, membership of his (or her) natal bilek confers upon a child inheritance rights over its properties and lands, and these rights are retained as long as the individual remains a resident member. Among the Iban, then, filiation is of a special kind, for it may be either to an individual's mother's bilek or to an individual's father's bilek, but not to both at the same time. Moreover, in practice, both types of filiation occur to an approximately equal extent. We are here confronted with a fundamental principle of the Iban family system.' <sup id="cite_ref-1182" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1182">[1,182]</a></sup> Freeman provides a comprehensive summary of the property and resouce-sharing system: 'Having briefly described the composition of the bilek family and the way in which its members are recruited, we may turn to an examination of the principles governing inheritance, for these, under the Iban system of filiation, are of particular significance. Let us begin by considering the position of the natal and adopted members of the family. As has already been stressed, children become members by right of birth of either their father's or their mother's bilek --but it is always one or the other. Thus, the children of a man practising uxorilocal residence are the members of their mother's natal bilek , and of this local group alone. They have no rights of inheritance within their father's natal bilek, of which they are not resident members. Similarly, the children of a woman practising virilocal residence are members of their father's local group, and have no rights of inheritance in their mother's natal bilek . Adopted children are members of the bilek into which they have been adopted, and of this bilek only.' <sup id="cite_ref-1183" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1183">[1,183]</a></sup> 'The general rule for both natural and adopted children is this: as long as they remain resident members of their own bilek family, sons and daughters possess full and equal rights of inheritance over the family estate. In other words, within a bilek siblings are parceners or co-heirs. There is thus recognition of neither primogeniture nor ultimogeniture, and no differentiation [Page 32] between the sexes, nor between natural and adopted children. Instead, in matters of inheritance, siblings are equals. Their equivalence is well expressed in the phrase: ‘ menyadi tampong pala ’ which the Iban use to describe them. These words, which have the literal meaning: ‘siblings whose heads are joined’, symbolize aptly the kind of relationship in which siblings stand. Another much-used phrase is: ‘ menyadi begulai pemai ’ meaning ‘siblings of common inheritance’.' <sup id="cite_ref-1184" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1184">[1,184]</a></sup> 'However, should a man, upon marriage, permanently leave his natal bilek , he thereby relinquishes his parcenary rights over its estate, but acquires rights in the bilek into which he marries and settles down. The same applies to a woman who marries out of her natal apartment. An affine, then, possesses parcenary rights within the bilek of which he (or she) is a resident member.' <sup id="cite_ref-1185" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1185">[1,185]</a></sup> 'We have now seen that the Iban bilek family is an autonomous, corporate group, all the resident members of which--natal, adopted and affinal--hold rights over its estate. As the Iban themselves put it: ‘Whoever stands by the bilek (i.e. remains a resident member), he (or she) possesses the belongings, possesses the valuables’ (‘ Sapa tan ka bilek, iya empu utai, empu keresa ’). This was an utterance made at Rumah Nyala in 1950 during the formal discussion of the conditions which were to govern the adoption of an infant boy, and it was made by one of the men of the adopting family. It was a public pledge that as long as the adopted child elected to remain resident in their apartment he would possess identical rights of inheritance with the other members of the family. This fundamental principle of inheritance was reiterated many times during the course of the discussion--as it always is on such occasions. finally, to clinch the matter, another of the adopting party put it even more trenclantly by abruptly asserting: ‘Whoever stands by the bilek , even be he a Kayan, a Bukitan, a Punan, an Ukit, it matters not, he is the one who inherits the property’ (‘ Sapa tan ka bilek, Kayan, Pakatan, Punan, Ukit, enda iboh, tya empu keresa ’) Now, the Kayans, the Bukitans, the Punans and the Ukits are neighbouring tribes of the Rejang headwaters; all are alien, and the Kayans and Ukits, in particular, are the bitter traditional enemies of the Iban. When this is realized, the force of the utterance just quoted will be appreciated. It affirms that even an enemy and an alien, should he come to live in an Iban bilek , would, if he maintained his residence, hold equal rights of inheritance with the other members of the family. For Iban ears there could be no more emphatic avowal than this of the principle we have been considering.' <sup id="cite_ref-1186" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1186">[1,186]</a></sup> 'As long then, as an individual remains resident in a bilek , he (or she) is one of the group in which ownership and inheritance are vested. Indeed, it is the family as a whole that holds common tenure of the conglomeration of property and other rights which constitute ‘the bilek ’. In other words, the Iban bilek family is a corporation aggregate. Thus, no one of its members holds the right [Page 33] to disinherit another. In life the members of a bilek are parceners, and even in death each member is entitled to his share of the family estate--that last inheritance which he carries with him to the after-world. An elder looks to his children and to his grandchildren within the bilek family to care for him in his old age, and to perform conscientiously the elaborate mortuary rites which must accompany his passing from this world to the next. To the Iban these mortuary rites and the furnishing of grave goods are matters of supreme importance, and all the senior surviving members of the bilek family are expected to join in their faithful performance. As the Iban themselves phrase it: ‘As the mortuary rites are equally performed, so equally is the bilek estate inherited’ (‘ Enti blah ngelumbong, blah empu utai ’).' <sup id="cite_ref-1187" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1187">[1,187]</a></sup> See also marriage and property/inheritance variables for more information. Cooperation among longhouse communities in warfare coalesced around senior war-leaders: 'Prior to the arrival of the Brookes, the Iban present a picture of an exceedingly energetic people, waring among themselves and with others, and constantly expanding territorially, absorbing and displacing other groups of people in the process. This pattern of aggressive outward expansion continued into the 1850's and, on a more peaceful basis, even later. Throughout this traditional period, social loyalties centered on major river systems. The watersheds dividing these rivers tended to delimit major regional groups, or “tribes”, and these groups, under the leadership of senior warriors and warleaders, the raja berani, tau kayau or tau serang , constituted the maximal units of traditional society organized for aggression and territorial defence. While regional leaders sought to minimize the dangers of fratricidal conflict among their followers, their formal powers were limited almost entirely to the context of warfare.

Houses near one another on the same river or in the same region were commonly allied, marrying among themselves, raiding together beyond their territories, and resolving disputes by peaceful means. Regionalism, deriving from these alliances, in which Iban distinguished themselves from other allied groups, persist in modern state politics. Essentially egalitarian, Iban are aware of long-standing status distinctions among themselves of RAJA BERANI (wealthy and brave), MENSI SARIBU (commoners), and ULUN (slaves).

Men of influence included renowned warriors, bards, augurs and other specialists. Brooke, who became Rajah of Sarawak, and his nephew, Charles Johnson, created political positions -- headman (TUAI RUMAH), regional chief (PENGHULU), paramount chief (TEMENGGONG) -- to restructure Iban society for administrative control, especially for purposes of taxation and the suppression of head-hunting.

First, from childhood, they are taught to avoid conflict, and for a majority, every effort is made to prevent it. Second, they are taught by story and drama of the existence of numerous spirits, who vigilantly ensure observation of numerous taboos; some spirits are interested in preserving the peace, while others are responsible for any strife that arises. In these ways, the stresses and conflicts of ordinary life, especially life in the longhouse, in which one is in more or less constant sight and sound of others, have been displaced onto the spirits. Third, the headman hears disputes between members of the same house, the regional chief, disputes between members of different houses, and government officers, hear those disputes that headmen and regional chiefs cannot resolve.' <sup id="cite_ref-1194" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1194">[1,194]</a></sup> Charismatic headmen and war-leaders attained prestige: 'Prior to the arrival of the Brookes, the Iban present a picture of an exceedingly energetic people, waring among themselves and with others, and constantly expanding territorially, absorbing and displacing other groups of people in the process. This pattern of aggressive outward expansion continued into the 1850's and, on a more peaceful basis, even later. Throughout this traditional period, social loyalties centered on major river systems. The watersheds dividing these rivers tended to delimit major regional groups, or “tribes”, and these groups, under the leadership of senior warriors and warleaders, the raja berani, tau kayau or tau serang , constituted the maximal units of traditional society organized for aggression and territorial defence. While regional leaders sought to minimize the dangers of fratricidal conflict among their followers, their formal powers were limited almost entirely to the context of warfare. Thus Iban society was traditionally “acephelous” and totally without a centralized, hierarchical political order. Political power was dispersed between basically sovereign local communities, longhouses and kindreds. It was in this turbulent setting that traditional Iban adat evolved, as an intricate system of social rules and sanctions, in independent, highly egalitarian communities without centralized authority, which, yet, for reasons of survival, required effective means for resolving contention and preserving internal order.' <sup id="cite_ref-1195" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1195">[1,195]</a></sup> 'Traditionally Iban leaders sought to settle disputes, as far as possible, through negotiation and attempted to avert recourse to self-help and other means that might potentially lead to open violence. In this, they were greatly aided by the highly comprehensive nature of traditional adat itself, which, although unwritten gave systematic definition of offences and correct punishments. Also important in this connection was the role formerly played by go-betweens. Within a longhouse respected elders frequently intervened in disputes, restraining the two sides and acting with their consent as negotiating agents. Such intervention was strongly supported by Iban values, particularly by the notion that a breach of adat or unresolved contention posed a collective [Page xxiv] spiritual danger to the well-being of all community members. Public spirited elders, including the longhouse headman and friends of the disputants, might even agree to make token compensation themselves, called sa-uta iring manok . In doing so, a speedy settlement was often achieved that avoided acrimony and possible loss of face by the principals.' <sup id="cite_ref-1196" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1196">[1,196]</a></sup> However, they were not owed expectional deference: '150. When a man does become a tuai rumah there is no kind of initiation ceremony, nor is he given any kind of honorific title. His kindred continue to use the ordinary terms of classificatory kinship ( anak, menyadi, apai , etc.). while strangers address him as wai (friend), or with his personal name (e.g. Nyala). Towards him there are no special attitudes of deference or respect, other than he is able to command by virtue of his own personal prowess and prestige. He receives no tribute of any kind, and is entitled to no special privileges -- except in his relations with Government officials. Unless he also is a tuai burong , he has no religious duties to perform, and no sort of ritual sanctity attaches to his person or the apartment be occupies. It frequently happens, of course, that a tuai rumah is also a man of considerable personal prestige. He may, for example, be a successful head-hunter, and have sealed his renown by performing a number of the great rituals ( gawai ), which rank so high in Iban estimation. Again, being a tuai rumah does mean that a man becomes widely known, for it is usual for an Iban community to be called after its tuai rumah (e.g. Rumah Nyala, etc.). and this is undoubtedly one of the main attractions which the office has for ambitions individuals. A tuai rumah is also presented with special opportunities for meeting Europeans, and, in Iban eyes, such meetings are likely to lead to all manner of desirable results. But here, we are primarily concerned with the jural status of a tuai rumah within his own long-house. Under Iban adat a tuai rumah has no authority to command other members of the community, nor are they, in any real sense, his subordinates. Were a tuai rumah so rash as to issue commands to others, he would at once be rebuffed, and sharply. Rather, such influence as he does exert is by a subtle mixture of persuasion and admonition, for he knows that his position is dependent on the continued goodwill and approval of his anembiak , as the other members of the house are called. In many ways his role is an unenviable one. I remember tuai rumah Nyala, remarking to me with some feeling that he only ever gave his opinion when it was asked for; he would be malu (ashamed), he said, to volunteer advice to any of his anembiak , and, in any case, no-one would ever listen to him if he did.' <sup id="cite_ref-1197" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1197">[1,197]</a></sup> Discipline was relaxed for young children: 'At birth the infant becomes the center of attention and the subject of numerous rituals. Weaning is casual and discipline relaxed. During the farming season, children are left in the care of older people. By age 5, children wash their own clothes and by 8, girls help with domestic chores. Traditionally adolescent males would undertake "the initiate's journey", a trip of several months or years, from which they were expected to return with trophies. Adolescent females demonstrate their maturity with diligence and in the weaving of ceremonial cloths, baskets, and mats.' <sup id="cite_ref-1198" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1198">[1,198]</a></sup> But young people were expected to respect elders: 'When some youths are going abroad with the elders, it is improper on their part if they do not wish to become bowmen or steermen. The elders are supposed to be at the section of the boat where the bailing is done. On arrival at the landing-place, the youth who is the bowman gets down to fasten the cord of their boat. If there is not much luggage to be unloaded, the youths will not ask the elders to help them. Later, they will look for timber for their huts, and foodstuffs eaten to accompany their rice. They will also cut some firewood. When these tasks are done, some of them do the cooking while the others build the huts. The elders tell the younger ones what to do if they have not had sufficient knowledge regarding their respective work. The elders only watch them if they know what to do. With regard to the cooking on board the boat, the youths will not let the elders do this. The reason behind this is that they wish to be reputed as being polite and respectful. Through politeness, consideration and hard work they, too, wish to be respected by the younger generation when they themselves are elderly, and would want these youngsters to do similar work for them.' <sup id="cite_ref-1199" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1199">[1,199]</a></sup> Generations were clearly marked in the kinship terminology: 'Both Sutlive (1978:98) and Freeman (1960:86-87) point out the generational aspects of Iban kin terminology. For instance, Iban terms of address not only allow cousins and friends to be addressed as ‘siblings’ ( menyadi ), but also allow all aunts and uncles, cognatic and affinal, to be addressed as ‘mothers’ ( indai ) and ‘fathers’ ( apai ) respectively. There is, thus, a clear demarcation of kin according to generation, in that a single term is used to all the males and another single term is used to all the females of each ascending generation and just one term is used to all the members of each descending generation. Freeman associates this with a relationship of authority and its reciprocal, deference and respect, between the members of adjacent superordinate and subordinate generations (1960:80). Furthermore, the use of teknonymous names defines a sociocentric categorization of society into generational levels as [Page 140] children, parents, and grandparents respectively (Geertz and Geertz 1964). Not only that, but teknonymous names (according to which a parent is called ‘father of so-and-so’ or ‘mother of so-and-so’) refer to a kinship tie and are therefore relational terms. As such, they define an individual by reference to another, that is, identify the Self in terms of an Other (cf.Levi-Strauss 1966:191-192).' <sup id="cite_ref-1200" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1200">[1,200]</a></sup> 'Inter-generational prohibitions suggest something of the broader concerns which may inform all Iban notions of incest. Sexual relations with a first or second cousin once removed is termed besapat , literally ‘having partition walls’, and involves a heavy fine. Sexual relations with a third or fourth cousin once removed is called bekalih , literally ‘reversed’ or ‘inside out’, and carries a lesser fine (Jensen 1974:39; Richards 1981:324,136). Besapat I interpret as transgressing the generational categories of Iban kinship, a system in which ‘genealogical level’ takes precedence over any considerations of relative age (cf. Needham 1966). Besapat and bekalih are, thus, thought to ‘reverse’ the flow of life between these articulated categories which the Iban conceptualize as forming a three generation cycle. This cycle is delineated as a synchronic unit which encapsulates, and a diachronic process which effects the transmission of life from generation to generation.' <sup id="cite_ref-1201" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1201">[1,201]</a></sup> This was reflected in the deference and support that children owed their parents: 'Another feature of the Iban system of kinship terminology is the clear demarcation of kin by generation. No term is used in more than one generation level; there are no inter-generation reciprocals. This leads us to a principal regularity in Iban kinship behaviour&nbsp;: all cognates at any generation level stand in a subordinate relationship to all those of the immediately senior generation, and in a superordinate relationship to all those of the immediately junior generation. This is expressed most clearly in the relationship between parent and child. It is the duty of parents to care for their children and to instruct them in the traditional ways of the Iban; in these as in other matters they have authority over their children who are expected to show them deference and respect. For example, there should be no undue levity between child and parent; again a child must not address a parent by his (or her) personal name, nor by the familiar term wai . The terms apai (father) and indai (mother) as terms of reference apply to an individual's own parents; as terms of address, however, apai and indai are extended within the personal kindred to embrace all males and females of the parental generation. It is common practice, for example, to address uncles on both sides of the kindred as apai , and aunts as indai&nbsp;; and the same practice holds for the cousins of both parents. Similarly, all cognates on the same generation as one's own children may be addressed as anak . The [Page 28] general superordination-subordination relationship of parent and child is also extended to all of these classificatory categories, though its force diminishes as genealogical distance increases. It can be said, therefore, that the classificatory terms of address&nbsp;: apai, indai and anak serve as indicators of kinship behaviour. This is seen most clearly in the regulation of sexual relations between cognates. The prohibition of relations between siblings as also between members of the same bilek is made so obvious as a child grows up as to be taken for granted; these are rules, moreover, the application of which is most plain. The prohibition of relations between cognates who are not on the same generation level is a pervasive rule applying, in theory, to all such cognatic kin. Parents make no attempt to nominate for their children all of the individuals in this prohibited category; instead; as they grow up, children are told that they may not jadi (marry) anyone they address as (a) apai or indai and (b) as anak . In this way the prohibition is unequivocally expressed and in a readily comprehensible way.' <sup id="cite_ref-1202" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1202">[1,202]</a></sup> 'Domestic affection between the different members of [Page 71] one family is very great. Especially is this the case between parents and children. An old father or mother need never work unless they like. Their children will provide for them.' <sup id="cite_ref-1203" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1203">[1,203]</a></sup> However, Sutlive claims that solidarity with the peer group was more important: 'The absence of physical restraint and the assurance of an approving response to most of his activities, encourages the Iban to be a selfreliant and confident individual. No greater offense can be committed against the Iban than bringing him to shame ( malu ), and members of the society learn means both of eschewing speech and actions which may shame another, and of rationalizing any feelings of shame or guilt which they may have. A hierarchical order forms in which hostilities are exercised and expressed against weaker members in the form of teasing and scolding, and a solidarity develops between the majority-strong vis-a-vis the minor-ity-weak. This solidarity supports the child against elders, and he finds that the opinion of peers is to be more highly valued than any rebuffs from his parents. After all, he spends much more time with peers than with parents, and he quickly ceases to be dependent on his parents, who, in turn, are afraid of alienating the child.' <sup id="cite_ref-1204" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1204">[1,204]</a></sup> Accordingly, we have provisionally coded the variable 'absent'.

<dd><b>♠ purity ♣ present ♥</b> Incest was considered to be spiritually dangerous and therefore required ritual redress: 'Wrongful acts contrary to adat evoke disapproval and in many instances are punished. The Iban concept of adat also refers to the ways in which people customarily deal with such acts. When the Iban discuss adat they very often use the term to describe, in any given situation, both the rules of behaviour that apply and also the correct punishment to be meted out should these rules be transgressed. The term adat applies to both. For many transgressions punishment takes the form of fines, or reparations of value. The notion of fines ( tunggu ) is closely associated with adat and written codifications of adat are characteristically described as tusun tunggu , or “fine lists” (cf. Richards 1963). Traditionally tunggu is a reparation payable to the injured party and mutually agreed to by both disputants. This is distinguished from the more recent ukum , an imposed fine or penalty, retained all or in part by the government or presiding authority. After the arrival of the Brookes in 1841, Iban fines were systematized and assigned monetary equivalents. In the first chapter of this study the author describes the major scale of fines used today by Iban judicial authorities in the Second Division of Sarawak. Later, in listing specific rules of adat , he stipulates in each case the appropriate class of fines levied in the event of its violation. Generally these fines are stated as maxima and may be reduced depending on circumstances. Many wrontful acts have also spiritual implications and so require ritual propitiation. Some are [Page xiv] thought to disturb relations with the spiritual world and unless repaired by ritual means are believed to provoke supernatural retaliation. For serious offences, such as incest, supernatural danger may extend to the whole community to which the transgress or belongs. In such cases, ritual redress is aimed at preserving the group's collective well-being. In addition, violations, of adat that cause personal injury, or result in damage or loss of possessions, are perceived by the Iban as an attack upon the victim's soul, or spiritual personality. Such acts therefore require ritual redress aimed at reviving the victim's soul, either by itself or in addition to fines. Thus wrongful acts often have spiritual consequences, or are thought to invite supernatural punishment, and these notions further reinforce the moral authority of adat , and the application of fines and more diffuse social sanctions in maintaining compliance.' <sup id="cite_ref-1205" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1205">[1,205]</a></sup> The notion of incest included a 'generation taboo' that if breached had to be redressed through sacrifice: 'If the bridegroom's parents agree to pay the marriage price, then a genealogist ( tukang tusut ) will recite the bride's and the bridegroom's family trees to see whether the marriage is incestuous or not. Incestuous means in this connection that the couple are kin of different generations. If their union is incestous to this sense then the bridal parents should infrom the Penghulu (district chief) that the coming marriage ceremony of their children will be celebrated with besapat ka ai or bekalih didarat depending on the category of the incest as discussed earlier (cf, pp. 29-30).'  <sup id="cite_ref-1206" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1206">[1,206]</a></sup> 'In addition, he also recites the customs regarding marriage in defiance of the generation taboo which is disastrous, following Sengalang Burong's advice which he gave to his grandson, Sera Gunting who committed incest with his mother's sister, Endu Dara Chempaka Tempurong Alang alias Dayang Patri Langit. After he has related those customs, he then begins to set forth his pedigree further and gives information regarding his forefathers' expensive dowries as they were rich and chivalrous. On reaching the generation of the bride and bridegroom, he then discloses their relationship. The people will discuss the appropriate customs to remedy the marriage which might happen to be in defiance of the generation [Page 35] taboo, after the genealogist has set forth his pedigree up to that stage.

They are requested to bathe themselves with the water that has been saturated with the blood of the pigs.

Rights to the use of farmland are vested in the BILEK-family, and are held in perpetuity. These rights are maintained in the living memory of the residents of each longhouse. Boundaries are indicated by landforms or trees, or are marked by planting a row of bamboo. Except for the land overshadowed by the eaves of the longhouse, there is no land to which a community holds rights. With the introduction of surveys and titles to land in the early 1900s, Iban who lived closer to government centers obtained titles to their land, under which rights of individual families to land could be verified. As a result of increased population and the commercialization of land, some Iban have bought land for investment and speculation.' <sup id="cite_ref-1215" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1215">[1,215]</a></sup> Accordingly, residence was paramount in the structuring of resoure-sharing and cooperation: 'Male and female children share equally in rights to real and other property so long as they remain members of their natal BILEK. Children who move out of the BILEK at marriage or for any other reason receive a small portion of the family estate, and in theory relinquish all rights to family land.

Only lands which are officially titled can be claimed wherever the owner lives in the country; otherwise rights of use are contigent upon the family's continual residence within the longhouse where the land is located. This means that if an Iban migrates from one river to another, he will automatically loose rights to all of his temuda lands which have no official title.

The remaining brothers and sisters will then marry into other bilik -families, or else establish a new bilik on their own. As will be evident from this last statement, residence patterns following marriage may be either virilocal or uxorilocal, with no particular preference being given for either one form of the other.

When divorce occurs an individual returns to his or her natal bilek family and resumes rights there; but widows and widowers do not return to their natal bilek families. Thus, an analysis of 52 cases showed that there were 26 widows or widowers living as members of their natal bilek families, and 26 who were living in bilek families of which they were members by right of marriage and local residence.' <sup id="cite_ref-1219" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1219">[1,219]</a></sup> '2. The bilek , with the exception of certain ritual objects, is a partible estate; and a sibling who remains in his (or her) natal bilek has the right to claim a proportionate share of the family inheritance, and set up a separate domestic unit. This is a common happening. Indeed, when two elementary families emerge [Page 8] within a bilek, partition always follows in due course. This precludes the development of joint or extended families, and nowhere in Sarawak did I encounter siblings--married and having adult children of their own--who were still living together as members of the same bilek. Again, my observations showed that partition always involves the break-up of a sibling group. When partition occurs one sibling and his (or her) family secedes from the ancestral bilek to found a new and independent household. Furthermore, this sibling is just as likely to be a man as a woman; thus, an analysis of 34 cases of partition showed that 17 founders of seceding families were males, while 17 were females. A fundamental feature of partition is that each part--after partition has occurred--is an autonomous unit in its own right, and not merely a constituent part of some wider corporate group. The partition of bilek families as it occurs in Iban society is thus a different process from segmentation as it occurs in societies based on unilineal principles.' <sup id="cite_ref-1220" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1220">[1,220]</a></sup> 'Further, membership of his (or her) natal bilek confers upon a child inheritance rights over its properties and lands, and these rights are retained as long as the individual remains a resident member. Among the Iban, then, filiation is of a special kind, for it may be either to an individual's mother's bilek or to an individual's father's bilek, but not to both at the same time. Moreover, in practice, both types of filiation occur to an approximately equal extent. We are here confronted with a fundamental principle of the Iban family system.' <sup id="cite_ref-1221" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1221">[1,221]</a></sup> Freeman provides a comprehensive summary of the property and resouce-sharing system: 'Having briefly described the composition of the bilek family and the way in which its members are recruited, we may turn to an examination of the principles governing inheritance, for these, under the Iban system of filiation, are of particular significance. Let us begin by considering the position of the natal and adopted members of the family. As has already been stressed, children become members by right of birth of either their father's or their mother's bilek --but it is always one or the other. Thus, the children of a man practising uxorilocal residence are the members of their mother's natal bilek , and of this local group alone. They have no rights of inheritance within their father's natal bilek, of which they are not resident members. Similarly, the children of a woman practising virilocal residence are members of their father's local group, and have no rights of inheritance in their mother's natal bilek . Adopted children are members of the bilek into which they have been adopted, and of this bilek only.' <sup id="cite_ref-1222" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1222">[1,222]</a></sup> 'The general rule for both natural and adopted children is this: as long as they remain resident members of their own bilek family, sons and daughters possess full and equal rights of inheritance over the family estate. In other words, within a bilek siblings are parceners or co-heirs. There is thus recognition of neither primogeniture nor ultimogeniture, and no differentiation [Page 32] between the sexes, nor between natural and adopted children. Instead, in matters of inheritance, siblings are equals. Their equivalence is well expressed in the phrase: ‘ menyadi tampong pala ’ which the Iban use to describe them. These words, which have the literal meaning: ‘siblings whose heads are joined’, symbolize aptly the kind of relationship in which siblings stand. Another much-used phrase is: ‘ menyadi begulai pemai ’ meaning ‘siblings of common inheritance’.' <sup id="cite_ref-1223" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1223">[1,223]</a></sup> 'However, should a man, upon marriage, permanently leave his natal bilek , he thereby relinquishes his parcenary rights over its estate, but acquires rights in the bilek into which he marries and settles down. The same applies to a woman who marries out of her natal apartment. An affine, then, possesses parcenary rights within the bilek of which he (or she) is a resident member.' <sup id="cite_ref-1224" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1224">[1,224]</a></sup> 'We have now seen that the Iban bilek family is an autonomous, corporate group, all the resident members of which--natal, adopted and affinal--hold rights over its estate. As the Iban themselves put it: ‘Whoever stands by the bilek (i.e. remains a resident member), he (or she) possesses the belongings, possesses the valuables’ (‘ Sapa tan ka bilek, iya empu utai, empu keresa ’). This was an utterance made at Rumah Nyala in 1950 during the formal discussion of the conditions which were to govern the adoption of an infant boy, and it was made by one of the men of the adopting family. It was a public pledge that as long as the adopted child elected to remain resident in their apartment he would possess identical rights of inheritance with the other members of the family. This fundamental principle of inheritance was reiterated many times during the course of the discussion--as it always is on such occasions. finally, to clinch the matter, another of the adopting party put it even more trenclantly by abruptly asserting: ‘Whoever stands by the bilek , even be he a Kayan, a Bukitan, a Punan, an Ukit, it matters not, he is the one who inherits the property’ (‘ Sapa tan ka bilek, Kayan, Pakatan, Punan, Ukit, enda iboh, tya empu keresa ’) Now, the Kayans, the Bukitans, the Punans and the Ukits are neighbouring tribes of the Rejang headwaters; all are alien, and the Kayans and Ukits, in particular, are the bitter traditional enemies of the Iban. When this is realized, the force of the utterance just quoted will be appreciated. It affirms that even an enemy and an alien, should he come to live in an Iban bilek , would, if he maintained his residence, hold equal rights of inheritance with the other members of the family. For Iban ears there could be no more emphatic avowal than this of the principle we have been considering.' <sup id="cite_ref-1225" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1225">[1,225]</a></sup> 'As long then, as an individual remains resident in a bilek , he (or she) is one of the group in which ownership and inheritance are vested. Indeed, it is the family as a whole that holds common tenure of the conglomeration of property and other rights which constitute ‘the bilek ’. In other words, the Iban bilek family is a corporation aggregate. Thus, no one of its members holds the right [Page 33] to disinherit another. In life the members of a bilek are parceners, and even in death each member is entitled to his share of the family estate--that last inheritance which he carries with him to the after-world. An elder looks to his children and to his grandchildren within the bilek family to care for him in his old age, and to perform conscientiously the elaborate mortuary rites which must accompany his passing from this world to the next. To the Iban these mortuary rites and the furnishing of grave goods are matters of supreme importance, and all the senior surviving members of the bilek family are expected to join in their faithful performance. As the Iban themselves phrase it: ‘As the mortuary rites are equally performed, so equally is the bilek estate inherited’ (‘ Enti blah ngelumbong, blah empu utai ’).' <sup id="cite_ref-1226" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1226">[1,226]</a></sup> See also marriage and property/inheritance variables for more information. Cooperation among longhouse communities in warfare coalesced around senior war-leaders: 'Prior to the arrival of the Brookes, the Iban present a picture of an exceedingly energetic people, waring among themselves and with others, and constantly expanding territorially, absorbing and displacing other groups of people in the process. This pattern of aggressive outward expansion continued into the 1850's and, on a more peaceful basis, even later. Throughout this traditional period, social loyalties centered on major river systems. The watersheds dividing these rivers tended to delimit major regional groups, or “tribes”, and these groups, under the leadership of senior warriors and warleaders, the raja berani, tau kayau or tau serang , constituted the maximal units of traditional society organized for aggression and territorial defence. While regional leaders sought to minimize the dangers of fratricidal conflict among their followers, their formal powers were limited almost entirely to the context of warfare. Thus Iban society was traditionally “acephelous” and totally without a centralized, hierarchical political order. Political power was dispersed between basically sovereign local communities, longhouses and kindreds. It was in this turbulent setting that traditional Iban adat evolved, as an intricate system of social rules and sanctions, in independent, highly egalitarian communities without centralized authority, which, yet, for reasons of survival, required effective means for resolving contention and preserving internal order.' <sup id="cite_ref-1227" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1227">[1,227]</a></sup> Incest was considered to be spiritually dangerous (see 'purity' for more information).</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ bravery ♣ present ♥</b> The Iban practiced head-hunting. Warfare was associated with notions of masculinity and bravery: 'WARFARE is an important element among all savage races, and the Dyaks are no exception to the rule. But it would be wrong to suppose that they are naturally abnormally bloodthirsty because head-hunting was such a regular practice with them. Mere love of fighting is not the only reason for the terrible custom of head-hunting which at one time prevailed to such a great extent among the Dyaks, but which at present, under the rule of Rajah Brooke, is fast dying out. There are many other causes. Theft committed by one tribe against another, revenge for the murder of some of their friends, and a thousand other minor pretexts, are often the origin of an expedition of one tribe against another. The Dyaks are faithful, hospitable, just, and honest to their friends, and, being so, it naturally follows that they avenge any act of injustice or cruelty to them, [Page 73] and they are consequently bloodthirsty and revengeful against their enemies, and willing to undergo fatigue, hunger, want of sleep, and other privations when on the war-path. I have often been told by Dyaks that the reason why the young men are so anxious to bring home a human head is because the women have so decided a preference for a man who has been able to give proof of his bravery by killing one of the enemy.' <sup id="cite_ref-1228" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1228">[1,228]</a></sup> 'Though cannibalism is not practised by the Dyaks, yet I have heard that sometimes a man who has taken a head eats a small piece from the cheek, in the hope of acquiring the bravery and virtues of the man killed. A Dyak in the Saribas district told me he attempted to eat a little of the brain of an enemy he had killed, but was unable to do so. Deep in the mind of the primitive man of every country lies the idea that he can acquire [Page 84] the attributes of another by eating his flesh or drinking his blood. The Dacota Indian, I am told, eats the heart of his slain enemy, and the New Zealander his eyes. It would appear that the Dyaks have the same idea.' <sup id="cite_ref-1229" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1229">[1,229]</a></sup> Prestige could be attained through warfare and head-taking: 'A man nampoks for one of two reasons. Either he is fired with great ambition to shine in deeds of strength and bravery, and to attain the position of a Chief, and hopes to receive some charm ( pengaroh ) from the spirits, or he is suffering from some obstinate disease, and hopes to be told by some kindly spirit what he must do in order to be cured. It can easily be understood how the desire would in many cases bring about its own fulfilment. The unusual surroundings, the expected arrival of some super-natural being, the earnest wish acting upon a credulous and superstitious imagination in the solemn solitude of the jungle--all would help to make the man dream of some spirit or mythical hero.' <sup id="cite_ref-1230" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1230">[1,230]</a></sup> Accordingly, individuals renowned for bravery were considered to be spiritually strong and acquired some ritual privileges: 'The professional wailer sings her song of mourning (see p.228), beginning in the evening. The journey from Hades is so long that the dead do not arrive till early dawn. And then occurs an action in which the dead and living are supposed to join. A portion of tuak (rice spirit) has been reserved in a bamboo as the peculiar portion of the dead. It is now drunk by some old man renowned for bravery, who is not afraid of so near a contact with the spirits of the dead. This “drinking of the bamboo,” as it is called, is an important part of the festival, and is greeted with shouts of joy.' <sup id="cite_ref-1231" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1231">[1,231]</a></sup> Heads were displayed in the longhouse: 'From all that has been said, it will be seen how the Dyaks value the heads taken in war. They hang them over the fireplaces in the long open veranda of their houses, they make offerings to them, and they believe that the souls of those whom they have slain will be their slaves in the other world. I look upon it as a remarkable fact worthy of record that two great Dyak Chiefs who became Christians--one the Orang Kaya of Padih, Saribas, and the other, Tarang of Krian--should have taken such a decided step as to refuse to treasure their enemies' heads any more. They were both men of position, with a great reputation for bravery. The Orang Kaya buried all the heads he possessed, and gave out [Page 85] that none of his followers in a war expedition should bring back heads. Two of his grandchildren were at my school in Temudok for some years. A son of Tarang, Tujoh by name, worked as my catechist in Krian for some years. I asked him what his father did with the old heads he possessed when he refused to keep them himself. He told me that he did not think his father acted wisely in that matter. His relatives begged for the heads, and he gave them to them, and they did just what his father did not wish--made a feast in honour of these heads, and treasured them!' <sup id="cite_ref-1232" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1232">[1,232]</a></sup> The Iban god of war was thought to inspire bravery: 'On the second day of the feast the painted figures of the rhinoceros hornbill are first of all timanged, or sung to [Page 213] in a monotonous manner. This is looked upon as a kind of consecration of them. They are now ready to be fixed on the top of the poles which are planted in a row. Sacrifices are made to Singalang Burong, whom these figures are supposed to represent. Balls of rice are thrown up to these carved tenyalang, and the blood of pigs and fowls is shed in honour of the great Singalang Burong, the god of war and the inspirer of bravery. When seen this god takes, as I have said, the form of the white and brown hawk so common in Borneo. Why the figure made to represent him is that of the rhinoceros hornbill, and not that of the hawk, is an inconsistency for which the Dyaks have no explanation.' <sup id="cite_ref-1233" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1233">[1,233]</a></sup></dd>
<dd> <b>♠ respect for property ♣ present ♥</b> Damage to or destruction of another person's property was considered to be spiritually dangerous and therefore in need of ritual redress: 'Wrongful acts contrary to adat evoke disapproval and in many instances are punished. The Iban concept of adat also refers to the ways in which people customarily deal with such acts. When the Iban discuss adat they very often use the term to describe, in any given situation, both the rules of behaviour that apply and also the correct punishment to be meted out should these rules be transgressed. The term adat applies to both. For many transgressions punishment takes the form of fines, or reparations of value. The notion of fines ( tunggu ) is closely associated with adat and written codifications of adat are characteristically described as tusun tunggu , or “fine lists” (cf. Richards 1963). Traditionally tunggu is a reparation payable to the injured party and mutually agreed to by both disputants. This is distinguished from the more recent ukum , an imposed fine or penalty, retained all or in part by the government or presiding authority. After the arrival of the Brookes in 1841, Iban fines were systematized and assigned monetary equivalents. In the first chapter of this study the author describes the major scale of fines used today by Iban judicial authorities in the Second Division of Sarawak. Later, in listing specific rules of adat , he stipulates in each case the appropriate class of fines levied in the event of its violation. Generally these fines are stated as maxima and may be reduced depending on circumstances. Many wrontful acts have also spiritual implications and so require ritual propitiation. Some are [Page xiv] thought to disturb relations with the spiritual world and unless repaired by ritual means are believed to provoke supernatural retaliation. For serious offences, such as incest, supernatural danger may extend to the whole community to which the transgress or belongs. In such cases, ritual redress is aimed at preserving the group's collective well-being. In addition, violations, of adat that cause personal injury, or result in damage or loss of possessions, are perceived by the Iban as an attack upon the victim's soul, or spiritual personality. Such acts therefore require ritual redress aimed at reviving the victim's soul, either by itself or in addition to fines. Thus wrongful acts often have spiritual consequences, or are thought to invite supernatural punishment, and these notions further reinforce the moral authority of adat , and the application of fines and more diffuse social sanctions in maintaining compliance.' <sup id="cite_ref-1234" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1234">[1,234]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd> <b>♠ Moralistic punishment by human religious agents ♣ present ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. Shamans and augurs played important ritual roles. eHRAF provides a general summmary of the religious system: 'Religious beliefs and behavior pervade every part of Iban life. In their interpretations of their world, nature, and society, they refer to remote creator gods who brought the elements and structured order into existence; the bird-god SENGALANG BURONG who directs their lives through messages borne by his seven sons-in-law, and the popular gods who provide models for living. Iban religion is a product of a holistic approach to life, in which attention is paid to all events in the waking and sleeping states. The religion involves an all-embracing causality, born of the Iban conviction that "nothing happens without cause." The pervasiveness of their religion has sensitized them to every part of their world, and created an elaborate otherworld (SEBAYAN), in which everything is vested with the potential for sensate thought and action. In Iban beliefs and narratives trees talk, crotons walk, macaques become incubi, jars moan for lack of attention, and the sex of the human fetus is determined by a cricket, the metamorphized form of a god.' <sup id="cite_ref-1235" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1235">[1,235]</a></sup> 'Though the gods live in PANGGAU LIBAU, a remote and godly realm, they are unseen, ubiquitous presences. In contrast to the exclusive categories of Judaism and Christianity, "supernaturals" and "mortals" interact in all activities of importance. In contrast to the gods who are more benevolently inclined towards mortals, Iban believe in and fear a host of malevolent spirits. These spirits are patent projections onto a cosmic screen of anxieties and stresses suffered by Iban: the menacing father figure, the vengeful mother, the freeloader, and becoming lost in the forest. Iban strive to maintain good life and health by adherence to customary laws, avoidance of taboos, and the presentation of offerings and animal sacrifices.' <sup id="cite_ref-1236" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1236">[1,236]</a></sup> 'There are three religious practitioners: the bard (LEMAMBANG), the augur (TUAI BURONG), and the shaman (MANANG). Individually or in teams, bards are invited to chant at all major rituals. They are highly respected men, capable of recalling and adapting as appropriate, chants that go on for hours. The augur is employed for critical activities, such as farming or travelling. The shaman is a psychotherapist, who is consulted for unusual or persistent ailments.' <sup id="cite_ref-1237" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1237">[1,237]</a></sup> 'Iban rituals (GAWA, GAWAI) may be grouped into four major categories: (1) one dozen major and three dozen minor ones agricultural festivals; (2) healing rituals, performed by the shaman, commencing in the BILEK and progressing to the outer veranda; (3) ceremonies for the courageous, commemorating warfare and headhunting; and (4) rituals for the dead. Iban of all divisions perform rituals of the first two categories. Ceremonies to honor warriors has assumed greater importance in the upper Rejang, and rituals for the dead have been much more elaborated in the First and Second Divisions of Sarawak.' <sup id="cite_ref-1238" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1238">[1,238]</a></sup> Freeman also provides a general description of ritual offices and informal leadership among the Iban: 'Because of the high ritual significance that the Iban attach to the maintenance of concord within a long-house, it was not possible for a new long-house community to be formed without a pun rumah&nbsp;; without, that is, the presence of an individual who was the custodian of certain charms ( penchelap rumah ) and who possessed the ritual skills deemed essential for safeguarding the welfare of the new community. It was the belief of pagan Iban that a long-house, in a cosmos in which malevolent spirits and other injurious powers are abroad, was ever susceptible to invasion by these alien [Page 33] forces, or to disruption from within, in which case the house became angat or heated, with dangerously harmful consequences for all its members. It was, therefore, imperative ( enda alah nadai ) for every community to have among its members an individual with an assortment of charms ( penchelap rumah ) that were believed to ward off evil forces and so keep the longhouse in a cool and benign state (Figure 5). It was also essential for the individual possessing these penchelap rumah to be a tuai burong (lit. bird elder), skilled in augury, which was intensively practised to preserve the spiritual welfare of a community.' <sup id="cite_ref-1239" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1239">[1,239]</a></sup> 'In addition to the pun rumah there were also, in every long-house, several men, usually of mature age, who were recognized as having a sufficient knowledge of adat to mediate in the settlement of disputes within the community. While their views on other issues of moment would be duly listened to, they were primarily mediators and custodians of the adat law; their authority was essentially personal. Again, the position of tuai was not hereditary; instead, men were chosen by their peers for their individual abilities. As the Iban themselves put it: “Whoever ‘knows words’ was selected by the community as a mediator” ( Sapa nemu jako, ngambi orang [Page 35] nyadi tuai ). As a safeguard against partiality, disputes were heard by two or more mediators, and issues that concerned the community as a whole were dealt with by way of consensus at a general meeting ( baum ) in which all bilek -families (including both males and females) participated. These, then, were the pivotal positions in a traditional Iban long-house community: those of pun rumah and tuai burong , which were essentially ritual, and those of the tuai , or mediators, who were the custodians of the adat law.' <sup id="cite_ref-1240" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1240">[1,240]</a></sup> It seems that augury did not incorporate moralistic elements per se, as this activity was primarily concerned with omens: 'The practice of seeking deliberate auguries is called beburong . Auguries may be taken before any undertaking is embarked upon, should the individual or group of persons involved wish to do so. The primary purpose in taking deliberate auguries is to determine whether an undertaking is likely to succeed or not. Some major occasions for beburong are just before a new farm is cleared, prior to the construction of a new longhouse, and, in the past, at the departure of a war party for enemy territory. For deliberate [Page xxxix] auguries the knowledge of an expert augur is usually sought. If the undertaking involves the efforts of the whole community, as, for example, house-building, responsibility for seeking omens generally falls on the tuai burong , or community augur. The latter is a man generally recognized for his experience and skill as an augur. In practice, beburong ordinarily precedes a great many lesser occasions, aside from the major ones mentioned, and responsibility for taking auguries normally rests with tuai burong or with the person who leads the undertaking. Because of the importance of augury, any man traditionally aspiring to leadership within the community, as a longhouse headman or senior family head, or within the wider region, as a war chief, migrational leader, or the head of a trading venture, was expected to possess a proficient knowledge of augury. The position of the tuai burong was traditionally one of considerable influence in Iban society and a knowledge of practical augury was an important requirement of leadership more generally.' <sup id="cite_ref-1241" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1241">[1,241]</a></sup> 'Auguries may be sought by anyone with the necessary experience, ideally the tuai burong , a senior family head, or the leader of the particular activity for which auguries are sought. In taking deliberate omens, the augur ordinarily rises before dawn and retires to a predetermined site to listen for a particular sequence of omens that assures the success of the venture he has planned. The moment he hears a desired augury, the augur cuts a branch or pulls up a sapling nearby. This is taken from the right or left, depending on the direction from which the call is heard. The sapling or branch taken is called an “augural stick”, a tampak or kayu burong . It represents a tangible symbol of the augury and is a major ritual object, carefully kept and used in ritual observances connected with the particular activity to which the augury relates. The procedure is repeated on subsequent mornings until a suitable sequence of auguries is obtained. There is always a danger, in the course of beburong , that an inauspicious omen will be encountered. When this occurs, the augur may have to begin all over again. Because of this, and the uncertainty of encountering desired omens in a suitable sequence, the whole procedure is sometimes lengthy and occasionally requires a week or longer to complete. It should be added that tampak burong may also be taken when particularly auspicious omens are encountered by chance. These are also important ritual objects and are often preserved for many years for further use as charms.' <sup id="cite_ref-1242" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1242">[1,242]</a></sup> 'Through beburong , the Iban seek, not to impute meaning to signs which they inadvertently encounter, but to enlist the direct guidance of the augural gods in commencing an important activity and to gain their assurance of its success. Here the augur takes an active hand in establishing communication with the gods. Rather than wait for the augural birds to present themselves, he purposefully seeks them out. But more than this, he ordinarily continues to take auguries until an auspicious sequence is obtained, repeating his observations again and again, if necessary, and so, in this way, makes certain favourable indications and thus by implication the support of the gods.' <sup id="cite_ref-1243" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1243">[1,243]</a></sup> 'In other ways, too, an experienced augur may purposefully manipulate omens to increase their potency, render them harmless, or alter their meaning in such a way as to make them better serve sought-after human ends. It is in this area of augury that Mr. Sandin adds importantly to our understanding of its practice. In Chapter Eight and in later sections of this study, he describes a number of specific ritual measures used to strengthen or neutralize omens encountered in different situations. Some auguries are open to opposing interpretation and it is believed that a skilled augur can manipulate them to assure a favourable outcome (cf. Freeman 1960:89). This is done by making offerings and presenting prayers to the augural gods concerned. In a similar manner, the efficacy of auspicious omens may be enhanced by offerings and by prayers acknowledging gratitude for the blessings prophesized. Some potentially auspicious omens, such as the laba auguries associated with the animal slaves of Simpulang Gana, must be respected with offerings or other wise, it is believed, the observer will suffer harm. Depending on the occasion, a highly favourable omen may require a mudas feast, a small celebration held in the observer's farm. After the feast is over a pig or piglet is sacrificed and its liver is generally used for further divination. A mudas feast may also be held to influence the meaning of a dubious omen or, less often, to neutralize an unfavourable augury. In the event that an inauspicious omen is encountered, the observer may, depending on the circumstances, postpone or abandon the undertaking he is engaged in, or else he may consult experienced augurs, including the tuai burong , to determine the appropriate ritual measures he should take to forestall the ill-consequences it foretells.' <sup id="cite_ref-1244" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1244">[1,244]</a></sup> But augury experts also consulted with the headman in matters of adat or customary law: 'The principal guardian of customary adat is the longhouse headman, or tuai rumah . Most longhouse headmen are descended from the pioneers of past migrations who originally settled the area in which the community over which they have authority is located. The responsibility of the headman is to look after the affairs of his anak-biak , or followers, and, as a matter of course, he is expected to know every aspect of customary adat . If a dispute is referred to the headman, he will attempt to settle it with the help of the Tuai Umai or Tuai Burong (the farm leader or augury expert, respectively), and other village members who are well versed in customary adat . The Tuai Burong is an expert in various kinds of augury as well as being well versed in the genealogies and history of his community.' <sup id="cite_ref-1245" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1245">[1,245]</a></sup> Headmen were the primary arbiters of adat: '20. Further, each long-house community possesses two important officiants. First comes the tuai burong or augur, who takes auguries on all occasions of moment and who is generally responsible for the ritual well-being of the long-house. Every long-house community also has a tuai rumah or house headman, whose principal duty is the safeguarding and administering of the customary law. Within his community the tuai rumah is the custodian of adat , its juridicial warden and principal arbiter. In all other matters however--political, economic and ritual--his arthority is negligible, and he is in no sense a chief. For neither of these positions is there any rigid dogma of succession: to both any male cognate may succeed.' <sup id="cite_ref-1246" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1246">[1,246]</a></sup> Given the role of augurs in supporting the headman in adat, we have decided to code 'present' for the time being, but this is in need of confirmation.

</p>
<dl><dd> <b>♠ physical punishment ♣ present ♥</b> Disputes and offences were adjudicated by headmen and elders (see also material on legal system and informal justice above). Traditionally, ordeals were applied in difficult cases: 'In particularly intractable cases resort was sometimes made in the past to legal contests or ordeals in which the outcome was believed to be supernaturally determined. These ordeals are also described in the chapter that follows and consisted of diving contests, cock fights, and the thrusting of hands into boiling water or into a fire. As a general rule, these procedures were used, as tests of innocence or ways of choosing between conflicting claims, particularly those of ownership, in situations where there exists no possible way to arrive at an infallible human judgment. Like betempoh , ordeals were conducted according to strict rules, were judged by impartial witnesses, and were supervised, and compliance with their outcome upheld, by regional leaders. Ordeals had the advantage of giving a clear-cut verdict which other forms of legal action might not be able to achieve because of a lack of evidence or demonstrable proof.

However, there appears to have been some difference here between major regional groups in the relative importance in the past of the baum as a judicial institution. In the Saribas local and regional leaders appear to have exercised greater authority than was generally true among Iban elsewhere. Consequently they seem to have enjoyed greater success in compelling disputants to accept negotiation in face-to-face hearings and the decisions made by the baum appear to have carried greater force traditionally than may have been the case elsewhere. Thus these hearings functioned as a nascent court system well before the arrival of the Brookes. However, Heppell is right when he points out (1975:227) that their nature was profoundly altered when decisions were backed by the formal authority of the state.

Most importantly, the Brookes introduced courts to the Iban and elevated and ultimately backed the judicial role of indigenous leaders. At the level of the longhouse, the traditional longhouse forum ( baum ) was restructed, as a court ( bechara ), as we shall see presently, and the longhouse headman was formally impowered through its use to settle disputes among his followers according to the principles of adat . In contrast to traditional society, his legal authority, and the binding force of adat itself were thus sanctioned by the state, government magistrates and police. Judicial decisions were enforceable and non-compliance or resort to force was strictly punishable. Indeed, many instances of such punishment occurred during the early years of Brooke rule. At the regional level, the status of regional leaders was similarly formalized in the creation of salaried Penghulus or native chiefs. These leaders assumed responsibility for their own bechara . Moreover, the Penghulu courts were not only granted special areas of jurisdiction, but were formally instituted as superior courts of appeal vis-a-vis the longhouse bechara .

Several aspects of Iban custom were ultimately proscribed, including the death penalty for incest, the right of an aggrieved husband to take the lives of an adulterous pair caught in flagrante delicto , rights of forceable seizure of property, and head hunting. In the case of adultery and forceable seizure, their proscription coincided with the efforts of Iban leaders themselves to avert recourse to these measures. Forced appropriation of property, called ngerampas , was an important element of traditional Iban law, and was only gradually suppressed through the substitution of effective means of judicial redress and the enforcement of monetary fines. Head hunting was even more important and was the focus of a complex religious cult bearing importantly on political leadership. Its suppression was also gradual, and indeed, during the early days of the Raj its practice was sometimes fostered as a punitive measure in extending control over recalcitrant tribal groups (cf. Wagner 1972). Two other institutions, though officially disapproved, were only gradually eliminated: slavery and legal contests. Both are described in some detail later in this study. As Pringle (1970:176) observes, the first two Rajahs liked to think of themselves as acting always within a traditional framework, even when they introduced changes in the customs of the country.

Resistance to the elimination of slavery came not so much from the Iban and other interior communities as from the Malay aristocracy. Although the Iban formerly kept slaves, whose status was theoretically heritable, slaves, in fact, usually enjoyed eventual emancipation. As a consequence, the Iban [Page xvii] preserved their basic egalitarianism and there never developed a significant slave class in Iban society. The final elimination of slavery was brought about, as Mr. Sandin indicates here, by means of the traditional Iban procedure of manumission through adoption ( betembang ) and the descendants of former slaves were protected from formal disability by Iban rules against personal defamation. In suppressing slavery, the Brookes thus showed considerable insight, bringing it about largely through the inner workings of indigenous institutions. Similarly legal contests were only gradually eliminated, and not totally disallowed until alternative judicial procedures become generally accepted. Ordeals by fire and boiling water were disliked by the Iban themseves and were allowed to die a natural death. Legal contests involving the use of wooden weapons were seen as a dangerous convention by the Iban themselves and their suppression, again, coincided with the efforts of indigenous leaders to avert their use.

<p><b>State Intervention in Economy</b>
</p>
<dl><dd> <b>♠ The state regulates banking ♣ present ♥</b> Note: Most Iban were subsistence horticulturalists: 'The primary activity of a majority of Iban is rice farming. In the hills, farmers practice swidden cultivation of fields averaging one hectare. Each family maintains its own seed bank of rice, and plants between one dozen and two dozen varieties in any year. At the center of its field they plant their sacred rice (PADI PUN), a gift of some spirit to an ancestor which has been retained over generations to recall the origins of that family. Given the uncertainties of rice farming in the hills, dozens of ritual acts are performed to ensure a successful crop. At the end of April, the head of the house holds a meeting of all family heads to discuss farm sites and an approximate date for the first rites. The meeting ensures that all residents coordinate their activities and that the rice matures at about the same time. Simultaneous maturation is critical because it helps reduce the losses of any one family to insects, birds, and wild animals who spread themselves over several fields rather than concentrate on just one. It also permits families to coordinate their harvest rituals. Auguries are taken in June, farms are cleared in June and July, and burned over in August or September. When the rice has ripened, it is informed through ritual that it is to be harvested and transported back to the longhouse. On the last day of harvest, farmers make an offering to the final stand of rice to ensure that the soul of the rice will return to the house with them, and not remain behind in the ground. In the plains, farmers practice farming of wet rice in permanent fields. Introduction of herbicides, pesticides and commercial fertilizers have permitted Iban to remove vegetation, control weeds and insects, and increase the yields of their farms. With much greater control over the success of their efforts, farmers rely much less on ritual.' <sup id="cite_ref-1261" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1261">[1,261]</a></sup> 'In addition to rice, farmers plant gourds, pumpkins, cucumbers, maize and cassava. Rice is complemented with a variety of jungle vegetables and fruits collected by men and women for consumption with the evening and morning meals.' <sup id="cite_ref-1262" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1262">[1,262]</a></sup> 'Fishing has provided the principal source of protein in the Iban diet, but logging and consequent silting of many streams and rivers have greatly reduced the numbers of fish. Techniques of fishing are sophisticated and adjusted according to the conditions of the waters. Fish traps are placed in constricted streams, and large nets inclined over larger streams. Fish are taken with the seine or with hooks. Hunting of wild pigs and deer, using dogs, traps, and nets, varies from community to community, according to the region, forest conditions, and animal population. Almost all families keep chickens and pigs, and every longhouse has dogs. Chickens, pigs and water buffalo are used in sacrifices, and eggs are an essential ingredient of any offering.' <sup id="cite_ref-1263" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1263">[1,263]</a></sup> Seasonal piracy expeditions were common and were transformed into seasonal labour migrations in the colonial and post-colonial periods: 'As can be seen in the breakdown of the Iban agricultural year shown in Figure 1.4, there is a definite division of labor based on sex. During the period of time from roughly November through April each year Iban males  have no specific duties associated with farming and are free to engage in outside activities, such as cash cropping, hunting and fishing and temporary wage labor. It is hypothesized that what was at one time a practice limited to this time span has developed into the contemporary Iban custom of bejalai, a status-validating temporary migration which in the present day may extend over an entire year or more.' <sup id="cite_ref-1264" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1264">[1,264]</a></sup> Even during the colonial period, wage labour was mostly temporary and practiced during the seasonal labour migrations of Iban men: 'The most important commercial activity for the largest number of Iban men has been the institutionalized BEJALAI, or journey to work for wages. In some longhouses almost all able-bodied men are away at any given time, working for a distant logging company or in the oilfields of northern Borneo. Wage-earning enabled men to buy jars, gongs, and other valuables for their families. Rubber and pepper have provided an unstable source of income, as has cocoa, a recent introduction. The attraction of salaried jobs is one of the principal reasons for Iban urban migration. Iban are employed in every major occupational category in Sarawak's cities.' <sup id="cite_ref-1265" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1265">[1,265]</a></sup> Davison provides a generally summary of the economic system: 'The Iban are shifting agriculturalists, whose subsistence economy has traditionally been based upon the cultivation of hill rice, or padi . Each bilik -family is an economically independent land-owning unit, whose individual members hold joint and equal rights in the family estate. Land ownership is established by the felling of primary forest, with usufructury rights maintained for as long as the bilik -family continues to exist, or at least remains resident within the longhouse community. Most bilik will also own sago and cocoa plantations, wild or semi-wild fruit trees, rubber small holdings, pepper gardens, pigs and poultry. In addition, each family will also possess its own farming equipment, tools, weapons, shotguns, canoes and other essential items needed in everyday life. In more recent times, those who are better-off will have long-boats, outboard engines and luxury items such as videos, bedding, furniture and other modern conveniences.' <sup id="cite_ref-1266" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1266">[1,266]</a></sup> 'Rice is also a source of disposable income - at least in those years when harvest yields exceed the annual rate of consumption. This “capital” may be exchanged for essential goods, such as salt and iron, or can alternatively be used to purchase luxury items - traditionally Chinese ceramics and local brasswares, but more recently, videos, cassette-players and other Western consumer products. Surplus rice supplies may also be put towards the sponsorship of a festival, or gawai , bringing prestige and social status to the families who do so.' <sup id="cite_ref-1267" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1267">[1,267]</a></sup> Accordingly, some of the below variables might not apply to the Iban.****According to SCCS variable 17 'Money (Media of Exchange) and Credit', 'No media of exchange or money' or 'Domestically used articles as media of exchange' or 'Tokens of conventional value as media of exchange' or 'Foreign coinage or paper coinage', or 'Indigenous coinage or paper currency'. According to SCCS variable 18 'Credit Source' only 'Personal loans between friends or relatives' were present, not 'Internal money lending specialists', 'External money lending specialists, or 'Banks or comparable institutions'. The trade economy was monetized during the Brooke Raj and colonial periods only, with the associated introduction of cash crops: ‘Another factor that appears to have been favourably regarded by the Iban, as well as other indigenous groups, was the opportunities that trade offered in acquiring a reserve capital and various prestige items. Trade, which was part of the rationale for pacification, was concerned in Iban areas with jungle produce like rattan and wild rubber which were shipped down-river in return for a counter-stream of items like salt, steel, iron, brass wire and gongs, crockery ware and the highly valued sacred jars of Chinese origin. After this trade had reached some bulk in the 1870's and until the introduction of cultivated rubber it provided around thirty per cent of the state's total exports. Rubber, which started to be grown in considerable quantities in the first decade of this century, became the most important of the small-holder cash-crops for the indigenous peoples. To begin with it was planted by many Iban communities in both the Second and the Third Division, but around the middle or late 1920's non-Christian communities began cutting down their rubber trees. […] Prior to rubber, another cash-crop, coffee, had been grown with some success in the Second Division, notably amongst the Saribas Iban. The overproduction that completely upset the world market in 1897 and the drastic fall in prices, however, put an abrupt end to this endeavour.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1268" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1268">[1,268]</a></sup> But articles were used in small-scale exchanges even then: 'The Dayaks paid for these items with padi. One pelaga   bead cost them a pasu   of padi. At this time the Chinese did not yet want to buy resins or other jungle produce. They remained in their boats. Chinese traders would not risk building houses in the Saribas river for another two generations, until after the arrival of James Brooke.' <sup id="cite_ref-1269" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1269">[1,269]</a></sup> 'What does an Iban family do when it finds itself in such a situation? If there is only a small deficit, a family may elect to part with one or more of its gongs (or some other kind of property) in exchange for padi  . Brass gongs ( tawak, bebendai,   etc.) are the principal form of property in which the Iban invest their savings. These gongs have the great advantage of being untouched by the Borneo climate and are virtually indestructible; further they have marked prestige value, and can be displayed and used on ceremonial occasions. In good  years, when a surplus of padi   has been gained, it is exchanged for gongs, which are then available in years of shortage. Each season, some families succeed in producing a surplus, while others find themselves with a deficit; and so, year by year in an area like the Baleh, scores of different families exchange gongs for padi,   or padi   for gongs. Jars ( tajau  ), though to a much lesser extent, are used in the same way. Again, money--obtained from the marketing of jungle produce--is often used to purchase padi;   and of recent years, cash crops--particularly rubber--have become increasingly important.' <sup id="cite_ref-1270" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1270">[1,270]</a></sup> We have therefore assumed that most exchanges took the form of barter prior to WW II. But the sale of cash crops allowed for the acquisition of reserve capital: ‘Another factor that appears to have been favourably regarded by the Iban, as well as other indigenous groups, was the opportunities that trade offered in acquiring a reserve capital and various prestige items.

The overproduction that completely upset the world market in 1897 and the drastic fall in prices, however, put an abrupt end to this endeavour.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1271" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1271">[1,271]</a></sup> In the colonial period, financial resources were occasionally invested with Chinese traders. Abuse facilitated the establishment of government-approved savings schemes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries: 'In 1885 the Rajah felt it necessary to issue an Order requiring that all loans from Ibans to Chinese be registered with the Government, to protect the Ibans from defaulters.  In 1902, a year when the price of gutta percha reached an alltime high,  the Resident of the Third Division registered sixty such loans amounting to over $10,000. The total sum of money which the shopkeepers of Kapit owed to the still far from pacified upper Rejang Ibans at the same period was double that figure.  Over the years, transactions of this kind became entirely customary, so much so that when the Third Rajah inaugurated a postal savings scheme in 1926, an official report complained of the competition encountered in bidding for Iban business: “...the temptation to Dayaks to ‘invest’ their savings with Chinese at a high rate of interest is at present too great to allow them to take the safer course of investing at 3%.”' <sup id="cite_ref-1272" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1272">[1,272]</a></sup> We have treated these measures as state regulations of the banking system.</dd>

Iban 'government chiefs' were salaried: 'The appointment to Penghulu   is salaried. Before the Japanese occupation it was made by the government for life; Penghulus   are now appointed for a limited period (of five years) on the basis of a local election. Although the office is not hereditary, it is not uncommon for the Penghulu   to be succeeded by his son or other relative.  This is especially true when a Penghulu   has been  conspicuously successful in office. Since profound knowledge of customary law and precedent, respected judgement, and wide acquaintance with the area administered are prerequisites, the son, son-in-law, or other close relative of a retiring Penghulu   is considered more likely to possess these than any other person. The tendency is, therefore, to look first for suitable candidates among the Penghulu's   immediate relatives, and only if these are found wanting, to seek elsewhere. Where a particular Penghulu   has lost public respect, a rival leader for the area may evolve, and he naturally becomes a strong candidate for the succession.' <sup id="cite_ref-1273" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1273">[1,273]</a></sup> However, we have found no evidence indicating the payment of state pensions to government chiefs. More information may be needed.</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Standardization of weights/measures ♣ absent ♥</b> Some colonial-era sources mention abstract measurements for length: 'There are two kinds of pig traps, peti ngelanchar and peti panga . These traps are very powerful, and seldom miss the vital parts of pigs of a certain size. They are carefully set aud measured with their measurements called tuntun . These measurements (tuntun) are got up handsomely, decorated with the figures of men sitting on the tops of them.' <sup id="cite_ref-1274" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1274">[1,274]</a></sup> 'The depth of the actual bilek is necessarily fairly constant in any one longhouse and is agreed before construction at a general meeting. Eighteen to twenty feet is average. The Iban indicate the ‘size’ of a bilek (and the entire family section of the longhouse) by referring to its width, and this may vary considerably even between bileks in the same longhouse. A common expression is pemuka tiga depa, meaning a width of three fathoms, that is, approximately eighteen feet. This is considered normal. Less than tiga depa is thought small; more than three is regarded as spacious and an indication of standing and comparative wealth in the community.' <sup id="cite_ref-1275" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1275">[1,275]</a></sup> But measurements derived from human physiology are also described: 'Neither should the twigs used have any water in them; consequently they are always shaken a little before plucking. The size varies slightly but the sticks are normally smaller than a pencil, although they may on occasion be up to ‘the size of a toe’ ( mesai tunjok kaki ); they are most often about eight inches long--the Iban use the measure sa-jingkal , a hand span. When the augural series is complete piring sacrifices are offered on both the left and right sides of the site.' <sup id="cite_ref-1276" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1276">[1,276]</a></sup> It is unclear from the following description whether it refers to measures of length only or includes measures of area as well: 'Another general meeting is thereupon convened to determine the question of the tuah or chieftainship, the measurement of the timbers, and the sequence of the rooms. It is customary to place the richest people in the centre of the village that they may exercise hospitality to all comers, and the boldest at either extremity so that they may defend the approaches if called upon to do so. The next move is to appoint an evening for the people to meet at the site of the new village. The ground is then cleared and measured out and pegs are put in where the posts are to stand.' <sup id="cite_ref-1277" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1277">[1,277]</a></sup> Padoch mentions gallons: 'A gantang or gallon equals 4.04 liters; a gantang of unhusked rice or padi weighs approximately 2.4 kilograms.' <sup id="cite_ref-1278" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1278">[1,278]</a></sup> Freeman and Kedit refer to 'bushels' and 'basketfuls' instead: 'In the best years on the other hand, remarkably heavy crops are sometimes produced. Here I am relying mainly on Iban testimony, but in a number of instances I was able to calculate the capacity of the bins which had been filled in previous years, and so obtain rough estimates. The Iban themselves measure padi by the basketful. An average basket ( baka ) holds about one pasu, or bushel. About 20 pasu make one dunjong. (The term dunjong refers to a heap of padi left on the tanju after winnowing; it is only a rough measure and undoubtedly varies a good deal; but I estimate 20 pasu to be fairly typical). Four dunjong make one lumpong --a measure containing approximately 80 bushels. The Iban expression for the obtaining of an exceptionally good crop is “ bulih padi ” (literally, “got padi ”); it is used to describe a heavy yield, and always carries the implication of a substantial surplus. According to the Iban, a bilek family may be said to have “ bulih padi ”, when it has achieved a crop of more than one lumpong. If two lumpong (160 bushels) are obtained, this is said to be “ bulih padi amat ” (“a truly heavy crop”). A number of families of Rumah Nyala claimed to have attained yields of two lumpong in former years.' <sup id="cite_ref-1279" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1279">[1,279]</a></sup> 'The Lubuk Antu Iban cultivate mainly on the hillsides, which over the course of several generations, are showing signs of losing their fertility. Secondary growth fails to establish itself in the face of weeds and brackens: after a five year fallow trees grew less than a foot in diameter. As cultivation is done on steep terrain, there is a lot of padi wastage during sowing. According to one informer, it usually takes five to four pasu (Iban dry grain measurement equivalent to one bushel) for an average thirty to forty acres of family plot. A good harvest will yield about sixty pikuls (about 3.5 tons, as a pikul is equivalent to 133 1/3 lbs), from that amount of seed (that is four to five bushels), while a bad harvest would return about twenty pikuls.' <sup id="cite_ref-1280" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1280">[1,280]</a></sup> Some of the measurements provided in the sources are of Malaysian origin. The relevant measurements were probably common due to shared conventions rather than a formal process of standardization, given the absence of a state structure. Accordingly, we have chosen to code the variable 'absent', despite the presence of some agreed-upon measurements.</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Guarantee stability of coin value ♣ ♥</b> According to SCCS variable 17 'Money (Media of Exchange) and Credit', 'No media of exchange or money' or 'Domestically used articles as media of exchange' or 'Tokens of conventional value as media of exchange' or 'Foreign coinage or paper coinage', or 'Indigenous coinage or paper currency'. According to SCCS variable 18 'Credit Source' only 'Personal loans between friends or relatives' were present, not 'Internal money lending specialists', 'External money lending specialists, or 'Banks or comparable institutions'. The trade economy was monetized during the Brooke Raj and colonial periods only, with the associated introduction of cash crops: ‘Another factor that appears to have been favourably regarded by the Iban, as well as other indigenous groups, was the opportunities that trade offered in acquiring a reserve capital and various prestige items. Trade, which was part of the rationale for pacification, was concerned in Iban areas with jungle produce like rattan and wild rubber which were shipped down-river in return for a counter-stream of items like salt, steel, iron, brass wire and gongs, crockery ware and the highly valued sacred jars of Chinese origin. After this trade had reached some bulk in the 1870's and until the introduction of cultivated rubber it provided around thirty per cent of the state's total exports. Rubber, which started to be grown in considerable quantities in the first decade of this century, became the most important of the small-holder cash-crops for the indigenous peoples. To begin with it was planted by many Iban communities in both the Second and the Third Division, but around the middle or late 1920's non-Christian communities began cutting down their rubber trees. […] Prior to rubber, another cash-crop, coffee, had been grown with some success in the Second Division, notably amongst the Saribas Iban. The overproduction that completely upset the world market in 1897 and the drastic fall in prices, however, put an abrupt end to this endeavour.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1281" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1281">[1,281]</a></sup> But articles were used in small-scale exchanges even then: 'The Dayaks paid for these items with padi. One pelaga   bead cost them a pasu   of padi. At this time the Chinese did not yet want to buy resins or other jungle produce. They remained in their boats. Chinese traders would not risk building houses in the Saribas river for another two generations, until after the arrival of James Brooke.' <sup id="cite_ref-1282" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1282">[1,282]</a></sup> 'What does an Iban family do when it finds itself in such a situation? If there is only a small deficit, a family may elect to part with one or more of its gongs (or some other kind of property) in exchange for padi  . Brass gongs ( tawak, bebendai,   etc.) are the principal form of property in which the Iban invest their savings. These gongs have the great advantage of being untouched by the Borneo climate and are virtually indestructible; further they have marked prestige value, and can be displayed and used on ceremonial occasions. In good  years, when a surplus of padi   has been gained, it is exchanged for gongs, which are then available in years of shortage. Each season, some families succeed in producing a surplus, while others find themselves with a deficit; and so, year by year in an area like the Baleh, scores of different families exchange gongs for padi,   or padi   for gongs. Jars ( tajau  ), though to a much lesser extent, are used in the same way. Again, money--obtained from the marketing of jungle produce--is often used to purchase padi;   and of recent years, cash crops--particularly rubber--have become increasingly important.' <sup id="cite_ref-1283" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1283">[1,283]</a></sup> We are unsure whether there was 'guaranteed stability of coin value' for the currency used under the Brooke Raj administration.</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Public markets ♣ present ♥</b> In the colonial period, Iban farmers traded cash crops at local markets and trading centres: 'Although the price of rubber has slumped, some Iban are still tapping their trees and selling them unsmoked at twenty eight cents per kati   in the up river areas, and forty to forty five cents in the bazaar. According to one informer it is not worth the trouble to work the family rubber trees, since the cost of processing the rubber comes to about the same as the price (for example, the cost for diluted acid for coagulating rubber latex is $1.50 per bottle). Most Iban have small holdings of rubber, the usual size is between 200-300 trees per family. The government assistance is by way of providing planting schemes (called RPS or Rubber Planting Schemes) to replant old trees with high yielding rubber. Under this scheme in 1971, over 300 acreas of rubber were to be replanted (ARLAD 1971). The Iban's gardens include both ‘RPS’ and old ones. The total district rubber sheet production for 1970 was 10,000 pikuls  . The rubber is bought by Chinese retailers in Engkilili and Lubuk Antu bazaars who then smoke the sheets and transport them to Kuching for shipment overseas. Iban in the district sell only unsmoked rubber (ARLAD 1970).' <sup id="cite_ref-1284" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1284">[1,284]</a></sup> Trade relations were frequently channelled through non-tribal middlemen: 'Chinese and Iban economic relations characteristically have been of a patron-client nature. In early trading contacts, the Chinese were dependent upon Ibans and other indigenes for the supply of jungle produce on which their livelihood was based. With the establishment of trading centers such as the Sibu pasar, exchange tended to become fixed between the Iban client and his Chinese patron ( towkay  ), rather than an Iban dealing with a number of different businessmen. The patron-client relationship has proved to be of mutual advantage to both parties. In time of need ( maya suntok  ), the Iban can obtain credit or even a cash advance from his towkay. When he has marketable goods, he is assured of  an outlet through the trader. When he comes to the pasar   on business, because of an illness, or just to see the town ( ngalu diri'  ) he can usually find lodging over or behind his towkay's   shophouse. From the towkay's   perspective, he has an assurance of produce, as well as first choice on anything the client brings to market. Whereas the client usually has but one towkay  , the patron has a number of clients, all of whom are bound to him by credit relations. These relations are built upon trust and friendship which is honored in a majority of cases.' <sup id="cite_ref-1285" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1285">[1,285]</a></sup> Some Iban leaders also formally owned bazaar shops: 'By 1900 it was not uncommon for Third Division Iban leaders to own bazaar shophouses.  Since the Ibans never took part in the operation of the business, which remained entirely in the hands of the Chinese, “owning” a shop in this manner was really no more than a form of loan, with rental substituted for interest and the shophouse serving as security. In the Second Division, where the Ibans did not enjoy such close proximity to an enormous hinterland rich in jungle produce, there is less evidence of cash wealth on such a scale at so early a period. But with the advent of cultivated rubber, the Saribas Ibans in particular caught up with and passed their migrated brethren in the Rejang. In the boom years during and following World War I, they too began to invest in Chinese shops, until nearly half the shops in Betong Bazaar, and more than half of those in some smaller outstations such as Spaoh on the Paku, were Iban owned. This trend, which was always restricted to the Saribas, has not continued since World War II, but in 1966 more than twenty of the sixty-six shophouses in Betong were still wholly or partially owned by Ibans.' <sup id="cite_ref-1286" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1286">[1,286]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<p><b>♠ Drinking water ♣ absent ♥</b> Some sources provide general descriptions of longhouses: 'The large covered shed or verandah above described is the place where all the in-door occupations of the men and women are carried on, and when not engaged in out-door occupations, they may be all seen here together pursuing their varied avocations; the men in preparing weapons of the chase or war, or instruments of agriculture, the women in cleaning rice from the husk, making mats, baskets, &amp;c. As the inhabitants [Page 171] of the different villages combine to repair or rebuild them all at the same time, their houses and terraces have always an uniform appearance, and are all of the same size. In the interior arrangements of their houses the fire-places, of which there are two, are placed on each side of the principal entrance; each is formed of a kind of shallow box, or framework, of strong pieces of wood filled with clay; this is supported on strong wooden posts reaching through the flooring to the ground, and extending to the top of the house. On the clay are four or five stones of a convenient size, which serve for sustaining the cooking pot over the fire, which is placed in the space left between them, and is always of wood, a large supply of which, split and ready, is always kept dry on another framework above the fire-place, and supported by the same posts. This it is the duty of the women constantly to replenish from the trees which have been felled in clearing the ground, and which are strewed abundantly all over their farms. As the roofs are high in the centre, and slope at a sharp angle, much room in the top of the house is rendered available by the Dyaks, who erect another flooring over the one they constantly use; thus they have a large and useful loft where they stow their baskets, mats, and implements of agriculture during the season they are not in use. As may be supposed, people in their state of barbarity have little need of furniture, which for the most part is used to administer to the purposes [Page 172] of luxury. The Dyaks eat their food from the ground for a table; each having taken a portion of rice which he considers sufficient for him, this, if he be not provided with a plate, which many of them are, is placed upon a clean leaf of the Dillenia speciosa, and he dips his hand into the common stock of salt which is placed in the centre of the group. If they have flesh to their repast it is partaken of in a similar manner to the salt. They never drink during their meal, but on rising wash their hands and mouths, and afterwards take a draught of water from the bamboos, which are always kept full near the fire-place. Though they eat from the ground or floor of their houses, they rarely sit cross-legged upon it like the Malays, but have each a small block of wood about three inches in thickness, which they use as a seat by day and a pillow by night.' <sup id="cite_ref-1295" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1295">[1,295]</a></sup> 'Iban settlements are still predominantly in the form of longhouses. During the time when headhunting was endemic, the longhouse provided a sound strategy of defense. It continues to be a ritual unit, and all residents share responsibility for the health of the community. A longhouse is an attenuated structure of attached family units, each unit built by a separate family. The selection of different building materials and the uneven skills of Iban men who build their own houses are apparent in the appearance of family units, some with floors of split bamboo, others with planed and highly polished hardwood floors. The average width of a family unit is 3.5 meters, but the depth, that is, from front to back, varies widely. A longhouse may include as few as four families with 25 residents in a structure less than 15 meters long, or as many as 80 families with 500 residents in a house about 300 meters long. Access to a longhouse is by a notched-log ladder or stairs. At the top of the ladder is an uncovered porch (TANJU') on which clothing, rice, and other produce may be dried. Inside the outer wall is a covered veranda (RUAI), which is the thoroughfare for traffic within the house, where women and old men sit during the daytime weaving or carving, and where families gather in the evening to recount the days events or to listen to folklore told by story-tellers. Beyond the inner wall is the family apartment (BILEK), where the family cooks and eats its meals, stores its heirlooms, and sleeps. Above the BILEK and extending halfway over the RUAI is a loft (SADAU) where the family's rice is stored in a large bark bin and where unmarried girls sleep. The longhouse is constructed with its front to the water supply and preferably facing east. The core of each longhouse community is a group of siblings or their descendants. Through interethnic marriages, members of other societies may become part of Iban settlements to be assimilated as "Iban" in a generation or two. Until the past quarter-century, all Iban lived in or were related to longhouse settlements. Life in the longhouse was considered "normal", and those few people who lived in single-family dwellings apart from the longhouse were thought to be possessed by an evil spirit. Within the past 25 years, through a process of social and economic differentiation, many affluent Iban have built single-family houses. In the towns to which Iban are moving, they live scattered among Chinese and Malays in squatters communities.' <sup id="cite_ref-1296" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1296">[1,296]</a></sup> Longhouse settlements relied on the proximity of natural springs and rivers: Near the cooking range is a kitchen cabinet in which [Page 57] food is stored. Also, there are some shelves for the dishes and a large earthenware jar containing water for cooking and drinking. The women bring the water from the river in metal or plastic buckets, although in some houses water is still carried in gourds. These gourds are dried, hollowed-out and a rattan handle is attached to them. The water is always boiled before it is used for drinking and is stored in glass bottles. Because of the temperature in Sarawak, always between 80°F. and 90°F., the drinking water never gets really cold.' <sup id="cite_ref-1297" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1297">[1,297]</a></sup> '86. The number of apartments which a long-house can contain, is limited then, by these two factors. In some areas suitable sites are so rare that houses have to be built on steep spurs, several hundred feet above the river from which the unfortunate women have to fetch, in gourds, all the water required for domestic purposes. Even Rumah Nyala, in the not intractable lower reaches of the Sut, is now hemmed in by a small stream at one end, and by a sudden falling away of the ground at the other. The usual solution when a community finds itself in this position is for additional bileks to be built directly on to the front of the long-house. This results in two parallel rows of apartments each abutting on to a common open platform, or tanju . In the case of Rumah Nyala, for example, there were 20 family apartments in the main part of the longhouse, giving it a total length of 301 feet. Two other families had built on to the tanju , and three others, who were sharing apartments in the main house, planned to do so in 1951. Rumah Tungku, to take another example, is most favourably situated in the wide basin of the Tiau, one of the tributaries of the Sungai Mujong. Here the moderately flat land has enabled 39 apartments to be built in one line, giving the house a length of a little over 300 yards. The house, has however, been constructed in a very slight curve, so that it is not possible to see from one end of the ruai right through to the other, lying just over a sixth of a mile away. In addition to these 39 apartments in one line, there were five more built on to the tanju , and one protruding from the back of the house. The five remaining families of the total community of 50 bileks , were either recent arrivals from other areas, or the junior sections resulting from bilek partition; and although all of them had constructed farming huts ( dampa ) of their own, none had, in 1950, built on to the main long-house.' <sup id="cite_ref-1298" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1298">[1,298]</a></sup> According to Padoch, water control was absent or uncommon: 'Distinguishing the paya methods from the more elaborated forms of wet rice cultivation found in more densely populated regions of Southeast Asia, is the almost total lack of water control. The cultivators as Sungai Pelai built no bunds or irrigation works; only a few haphazard attempts at temporary water flow diversion with rather flimsy dams were made. The level of water in any field essentially rose and fell with the rains and the water level of neighboring streams.' <sup id="cite_ref-1299" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1299">[1,299]</a></sup> This appears to be true of both the colonial and pre-colonial periods.

<p><b>♠ Irrigation works ♣ absent ♥</b> The Iban practiced shifting cultivation: 'The primary activity of a majority of Iban is rice farming. In the hills, farmers practice swidden cultivation of fields averaging one hectare. Each family maintains its own seed bank of rice, and plants between one dozen and two dozen varieties in any year. At the center of its field they plant their sacred rice (PADI PUN), a gift of some spirit to an ancestor which has been retained over generations to recall the origins of that family. Given the uncertainties of rice farming in the hills, dozens of ritual acts are performed to ensure a successful crop. At the end of April, the head of the house holds a meeting of all family heads to discuss farm sites and an approximate date for the first rites. The meeting ensures that all residents coordinate their activities and that the rice matures at about the same time. Simultaneous maturation is critical because it helps reduce the losses of any one family to insects, birds, and wild animals who spread themselves over several fields rather than concentrate on just one. It also permits families to coordinate their harvest rituals. Auguries are taken in June, farms are cleared in June and July, and burned over in August or September. When the rice has ripened, it is informed through ritual that it is to be harvested and transported back to the longhouse. On the last day of harvest, farmers make an offering to the final stand of rice to ensure that the soul of the rice will return to the house with them, and not remain behind in the ground. In the plains, farmers practice farming of wet rice in permanent fields. Introduction of herbicides, pesticides and commercial fertilizers have permitted Iban to remove vegetation, control weeds and insects, and increase the yields of their farms. With much greater control over the success of their efforts, farmers rely much less on ritual.' <sup id="cite_ref-1300" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1300">[1,300]</a></sup> 'In addition to rice, farmers plant gourds, pumpkins, cucumbers, maize and cassava. Rice is complemented with a variety of jungle vegetables and fruits collected by men and women for consumption with the evening and morning meals.' <sup id="cite_ref-1301" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1301">[1,301]</a></sup> 'Fishing has provided the principal source of protein in the Iban diet, but logging and consequent silting of many streams and rivers have greatly reduced the numbers of fish. Techniques of fishing are sophisticated and adjusted according to the conditions of the waters. Fish traps are placed in constricted streams, and large nets inclined over larger streams. Fish are taken with the seine or with hooks. Hunting of wild pigs and deer, using dogs, traps, and nets, varies from community to community, according to the region, forest conditions, and animal population. Almost all families keep chickens and pigs, and every longhouse has dogs. Chickens, pigs and water buffalo are used in sacrifices, and eggs are an essential ingredient of any offering.' <sup id="cite_ref-1302" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1302">[1,302]</a></sup> Dry cultivation does not rely on irrigation systems: 'Since the unirrigated cultivation of padi (rice) in hilly areas requires less labor than the irrigated cultivation ( sawah ) of padi during the growing season per se , shifting cultivators are free to engage to a much greater extent in wage-cropping, lumbering, hunting and fishing, and a variety of other subsidiary activities such as, in the case of the Iban, temporary employment with the Sarawak Shell Berhad petroleum company, while maintaining cultivation sites at their homes (on a level generally above subsistence). This being the case, shifting cultivators constitute a valuable source of casual labor, a point of particular importance for development efforts in the sparsely populated states of Borneo. Thus comparison of the two systems of agriculture should be stated in terms of labor, cash and material inputs per capita and total crop and capital yields per capita, rather than simply yields of one crop per unit of area. With such a measure, the efficiency of shifting cultivation is certainly no longer open to question.' <sup id="cite_ref-1303" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1303">[1,303]</a></sup> The downriver swamps used for wet rice cultivation relied on naturally rather than artificially flooded fields: 'I have stressed that the methods of land clearing and crop production in the various areas of Iban settlement that were studied, including Freeman's Baleh region, differ little. An exception to this generalization is found when naturally flooded or swampy areas are farmed. The type of rice culture found in such regions is known as padi paya , and should not be confused with the far more sophisticated, land and labor intensive forms of wet rice production found in the densely populated delta regions of Southeast Asia, and characterized by the precise control of water levels, considerable soil preparation and often by terracing. While some Iban today may indeed by planting wet rice in irrigated, bunded fields (Pringle 1970:27n), they, I believe are quite few, whereas paya cultivators are numerous in many downriver areas of Iban settlement.' <sup id="cite_ref-1304" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1304">[1,304]</a></sup> 'The cultivation of padi paya typically takes place along the banks of rivers, using strains of rice different from those grown on hill plots. The rice is first planted in seedbeds and then transferred to the field where it matures, as is the case with conventional wet rice. But there the resemblance ends. The Iban padi paya farmer uses no plough or draft animal. He, or more frequently she, first clears the ground of its rough, marsh grass cover and then burns this off, or as much of it as will burn. The seedbeds are located somewhat haphazardly, usually in a moister portion of the uneven, swampy terrain. The seedlings are transplanted to holes which the farmer makes with her dibble stick ( tugal ), just as would be the case with hill rice seeds. No attempt is made at leveling, bunding, irrigation or any other form of water control. Nor are the swampy fields normally farmed for more than two or three years in succession, although the reason for shifting is not clear and the fallow period allowed may be a good deal shorter than that required for hill rice ( padi bukit ).' <sup id="cite_ref-1305" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1305">[1,305]</a></sup> 'Distinguishing the paya methods from the more elaborated forms of wet rice cultivation found in more densely populated regions of Southeast Asia, is the almost total lack of water control.

This kind of farming falls neatly between the two classical academic models, built around dry “hill farms” and wet “padi fields” which, it is widely believed, typify two generally antithetical types of societies in Southeast Asia at large.' <sup id="cite_ref-1307" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1307">[1,307]</a></sup> While some down-river communities picked up wet cultivation in the colonial period, most remained shifting cultivators: 'Formerly, all of the Iban of Sarawak were shifting cultivators growing their padi on hillside clearings in the tropical rain-forest. To-day, there are a number of Iban communities (particularly in the lower reaches of the Lupar, Saribas and Rejang rivers) who derive their livelihood from the cultivation of wet padi in [Page vii] riverain and deltaic swamps into which they moved following the establishment of Brooke rule. Some of these down-river communities have been subjected to prolonged European contact which has profoundly modified their way of life. However, the majority of the Iban still live from fifty to a hundred miles from the coast in hilly country that is drained by fast-flowing rivers. Most of these hill tribes have been little influenced by the West and remain pagan and pre-literate. It is with these Iban of the hinterland that this report is chiefly concerned.' <sup id="cite_ref-1308" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1308">[1,308]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Health infrastructure ♣ absent ♥</b>  Traditionally, illness was thought to be caused by wandering souls: 'Life and health are dependent upon the condition of the soul (SAMENGAT). Some illnesses are attributed to the wandering of one of an Iban's seven souls, and the shaman undertakes a magical flight to retrieve and return the patient's soul. Boundaries between life and death are vague, and at death, the soul must be informed by a shaman that it must move on to SEBAYAN. Crossing "The Bridge of Anxiety," the soul is treated to all imaginable pleasures, many of which are proscribed to the living. After an undetermined period of revelry, the soul is transformed into spirit, then into dew, in which form it reenters the realm of the living by nourishing the growing rice. As rice is ingested, the cycle of the soul is complete in return to human form. GAWAI ANTU, the Festival of the Dead, may be held from a few years to 50 years after the death of a member of the community. The main part of the festival occurs over a three-day period, but takes months or even years to plan. The primary purpose of the festival is to honor all the community's dead, who are invited to join in the ritual acts. The festival dramatizes the dependence of living and dead upon each other.' <sup id="cite_ref-1309" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1309">[1,309]</a></sup> Shamans performed healing rituals: 'Iban rituals (GAWA, GAWAI) may be grouped into four major categories: (1) one dozen major and three dozen minor ones agricultural festivals; (2) healing rituals, performed by the shaman, commencing in the BILEK and progressing to the outer veranda; (3) ceremonies for the courageous, commemorating warfare and headhunting; and (4) rituals for the dead. Iban of all divisions perform rituals of the first two categories. Ceremonies to honor warriors has assumed greater importance in the upper Rejang, and rituals for the dead have been much more elaborated in the First and Second Divisions of Sarawak.' <sup id="cite_ref-1310" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1310">[1,310]</a></sup> 'Though they have a limited ethnopharmacology, Iban have developed an elaborate series of psychotherapeutic rituals.' <sup id="cite_ref-1311" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1311">[1,311]</a></sup> 'There are three religious practitioners: the bard (LEMAMBANG), the augur (TUAI BURONG), and the shaman (MANANG). Individually or in teams, bards are invited to chant at all major rituals. They are highly respected men, capable of recalling and adapting as appropriate, chants that go on for hours. The augur is employed for critical activities, such as farming or travelling. The shaman is a psychotherapist, who is consulted for unusual or persistent ailments.' <sup id="cite_ref-1312" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1312">[1,312]</a></sup> Accordingly, there was no public health infrastructure prior to the colonial period. The White Rajahs did not invest much in medical services either. Instead, missionaries and Malay medics provided some care: 'Owing in part to continued reliance on local skills and labor of all sorts, the Sarawak Government learned to live within its limited means. In 1880 a Singapore newspaper observed with wonder that the Brooke administration spent less than one dollar per year per head of population, compared to figures ranging from $6 to $19.46 for the various states of Malaya. It should be borne in mind, however, that the Rajah made no effective effort to exert himself in numerous fields which were already the ordinary business of Government in Malaya. Epidemics of smallpox and cholera continued to take a heavy toll of lives in Sarawak. When smallpox threatened, [Page 270] the Government ordered Malay vaccinators to work, and missionaries cooperated in treating the downriver people, but their combined efforts were crude and ineffective. “The smallpox continues to hang about and there were outbreaks in various places during the month,” Bailey reported from Simanggang in April, 1905, adding that a police constable, a Sarawak Ranger, and various Chinese and Malay children had been among the fatalities.' <sup id="cite_ref-1313" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1313">[1,313]</a></sup> 'There was no trained Government medical staff beyond Kuching, nor did the Rajah feel an urgent need for any.

There is a dispensary run by a medical assistant in a converted house by the river bank. Iban from the districts visit the house, bringing their sick by boats to be attended by the trim white coated medico. There is a police and customs post beside the fort. Every morning, barter traders with baskets full of local products from the other side of the border have to pass through this post before they are allowed to exchange their goods with the Chinese in the bazaar.

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Control of infectious disease ♣ present ♥</b> Individuals who suffered from infectious diseases were isolated; however, this was based on community self-help rather than a public health infrastructure: 'Leprosy is not unknown among the Dyaks, and occasionally cases of it are met with. There used to be a village in the Krian where there were several suffering from leprosy. When the disease is so far advanced as to make it unsafe to let them live with others in the long Dyaks house, a separate little hut is put up for them at some distance away. I remember seeing a poor woman who lived by herself in this way. The people from the house would often go and see her, and take her food and water, but sometimes she would be left for days. She told me that once her fire went out, and as no one came to see her for two days, she was unable to cook any food, and bad to live as best she could during that time.

The reasons given by them for this [Page 101] cruel act being, that it was the cause of the mother's death, and that there was no one to nurse and care for it. No woman would dare to suckle such an orphan, lest it should bring misfortune upon her own children. Therefore the poor child was very often placed alive in the coffin with the dead mother, and both were buried together.

Iban 'government chiefs' were salaried: 'The appointment to Penghulu   is salaried. Before the Japanese occupation it was made by the government for life; Penghulus   are now appointed for a limited period (of five years) on the basis of a local election. Although the office is not hereditary, it is not uncommon for the Penghulu   to be succeeded by his son or other relative.  This is especially true when a Penghulu   has been  conspicuously successful in office. Since profound knowledge of customary law and precedent, respected judgement, and wide acquaintance with the area administered are prerequisites, the son, son-in-law, or other close relative of a retiring Penghulu   is considered more likely to possess these than any other person. The tendency is, therefore, to look first for suitable candidates among the Penghulu's   immediate relatives, and only if these are found wanting, to seek elsewhere. Where a particular Penghulu   has lost public respect, a rival leader for the area may evolve, and he naturally becomes a strong candidate for the succession.' <sup id="cite_ref-1327" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1327">[1,327]</a></sup> However, we have found no evidence indicating the payment of state pensions to government chiefs.

Having done this, he waves a chicken again to ask the hosts to arrange the seats of guests who have begun to arrive in a row ( bedijir ). along the family galleries. After the seating of the guests is in order, the feast chief waves a chicken to ask the hosts to offer nyibor the tuak wine to the guests. After the guests have drunk their tuak wine, the feast chief waves a chicken to inform the celebrants that the ngeretok and nganyam are to start. At this time all the carpenters and selected weavers cut and plan the materials for a sungkup hut and weave the smooth pieces of bamboo for the baskets.' <sup id="cite_ref-1371" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1371">[1,371]</a></sup> 'The garong baskets given to women were mostly gelayan type. The ordinary weavers of pua kumbu blankets and tikai bebuah mats were given garong tunggal type, while the leading weavers were given a red painted basket called lebor api . They were not to be given the garong beranggong , i.e. one placed upon the other as given to men, as they were not warriors and naturally have never killed enemies. The garong basket given to women thus could not be decorated with the hair of slain enemies. The weavers of garong baskets must be women of good character. They must not be adulterous or thieves for the hands of such persons are considered to be “unclean” and so their work is not recognised by the spirits of the dead. This also applies to those who are asked to hand the holy wine ( ai jalong timang ) to the warriors who drink it as mention below. The work of ngeretok should be finished by evening. But if either the making of sungkup huts or the weaving of garong baskets is not completed that day, the carpenters and weavers are permitted to finish their work on the following day.' <sup id="cite_ref-1372" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1372">[1,372]</a></sup> 'After the ngeretok is done, the feasters are free to visit their friends and neighbours, other than their relatives, to inform them that they are now preparing a Gawai Antu festival to discharge their obligations toward the members of their family who have died since the last feast was held by making a sungkup tomb-hut. They also announce that a ngempi'e ceremony is soon to be held for the people of that longhouse to brew tuak wine for the coming Gawai Antu celebration. The people visited give them chickens, money and beras pulut (glutinous rice). Some days after the feasters return from visiting their neighbours, the feast chief calls a meeting to set the day for brewing ngempi'e tuak wine. If the families of the longhouse agree to hold it a day later, then the feast chief asks all of the women to pound sufficient rice for the wine.' <sup id="cite_ref-1373" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1373">[1,373]</a></sup> 'At noon of the ngempi'e day, the feast chief waves a chicken along the galleries of the house to ask the women to begin their initial pounding of glutinous rice for tuak wine. Gawai adat stipulates that the woman who first pounds her rice be the wife of the feast chief and that she does the pounding at the tempuan passage outside her family room. The pounding must be done here as it is at the tempuan passage that the goddess Indai Bilai will sit close to the offerings on the Rugan altar during the night of the Gawai Antu festival. After the feast chief's wife has pounded her rice, the other women in the longhouse follow suit, each at her respective passage. Only a little rice is pounded on this occasion as most has already been pounded weeks in advance. Shortly after the women start to pound their rice, the feast chief waves his chicken to ask the people to make or repair the frames ( raran ) they will use for cooking the glutinous rice and also the duran platforms at the river bank. At 4 p.m. the feast chief again waves a chicken to ask the women to soak their rice in the river. As the women carry their rice to the river landing five men perform gendang rayah in the longhouse.

At around 4 a.m. the next morning the feast chief waves a chicken to ask the men and women to start cooking the glutinous rice for the Gawai Antu tuak . As these people are going down to the river bank led by the feast chief himself, other men in the longhouse perform gendang rayah . This music ends when all the rice has been cooked. After the rice has been cooked its owners bring the bamboo containers back to their family rooms. On their arrival, the morning ngalu antu starts, followed by a morning meal along the communal lower galleries. After this, both men and women remove the rice from the containers and lay it out on clean mats. After they have done this, the rice is fermented and put in tepayan jars. In a fortnight's time the tuak is drinkable. After the ngempi'e feast is over, the women and their female relatives from other villages start to make various kinds of buns, such as penganan sarang semut, penganan chuan , and penganan sepit , for the coming Gawai Antu. Each family makes at least ten to twelve tins of buns.' <sup id="cite_ref-1376" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1376">[1,376]</a></sup> 'While the women are making buns, the men are busy with other work, such as buying bulls, oxen and pigs to be consumed together with the numerous chickens they have reared themselves for the occasion. After the feasters are satisfied with the number of bulls, oxen and pigs they have bought the feast chief calls a meeting to fix a day for the Gawai Antu to be held. After a day has been agreed upon seven days before the festival day, four trustworthy men are asked to carry the invitation to every longhouse up and down the river. The day prior to the celebration of Gawai Antu is called hari mantar , -- a day the hosts make new seats between the communal galleries and the tempuan passage of the longhouse. At the present time, as the floors of most longhouse are made of hardwood planks, pantar seats are no longer necessary, as they were fifty or more years ago. The waving of a chicken by the feast chief to ask that the pantar be made is nowadays done to symbolise that the hari mantar is celebrated in accordance with the festival rules. Instead of making the pantar seats in the house as in the old days, the workers only repair the old duran platform and the cooking frames ( raran ) at the river bank, if they are no longer serviceable.' <sup id="cite_ref-1377" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1377">[1,377]</a></sup> 'Early on hari mantar day close relatives of the feasters come before the other guests, who will arrive on the Gawai Antu day, in order to help their relatives to kill bulls, oxen and pigs, while the women help with the cooking. Most of the chickens are roasted for the guests to eat during the reception ceremony. That night shortly after the ngalu antu ceremony, the feast chief waves a chicken to ask the women to soak their glutinous rice. As the latter are doing this, men in the house play the gendang rayah . The music continues until the soaking of rice is finished. The dinner takes place along the lower galleries at about 8 p.m. It lasts for about an hour and the hosts serve their relatives with meats and wines of high quality. After the dinner is over, each family invites its relatives to eat [Page 57] many kinds of food in the family room. As they enjoy themselves with food and drink, the hosts tell their relatives that they are very happy to be able to fulfil their duty in holding the Gawai Antu and build the sungkup tomb huts for their departed parents or grandparents and in making the garong baskets.' <sup id="cite_ref-1378" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1378">[1,378]</a></sup> 'In answering their hosts, the relatives present will say that the spirits of the departed will, after the Gawai Antu is held, bless the feasters with good luck in all the work they do, as they have not failed to respect their dead with a grand festival. They also pray that the spirits of their ancestors will not fail to give prosperity to the successive generations of their descendants in this world. At around 4 a.m. the feast chief waves a chicken to ask the men and women to cook their glutinous rice at the river bank. 8 After this, the feast chief himself leads the others down to the river bank to do their rice cooking. As he reaches the duran platform the feast chief spreads a mat on the platform where he will sit near the offering he brings from the house. As he sits here the gendang rayah music is booming in the air. It continues until all the rice has been cooked. The cooking of rice is a very merry time, as many young men and maidens participate in the work.

As soon as the cock fighting is over, the feast chief waves a chicken along the communal longhouse galleries to ask every family to spread new mats on the gallery and to decorate the ceiling and walls of their upper gallery with the best woven blankets hung from ropes. Along the upper gallery ( panggau ) carpets are spread over the ordinary mats by the richer families, and a number of mattresses rolled with coloured carpets are carefully placed at the outermost part of the panggau for guests to lean their backs on during the feast. The poorer families cover the floor of their panggau with mats of various patterns, while their mattresses are rolled with bekuang mats or woven blankets.

As soon as the chicken has been waved, the feast chief leads a procession of a few men and women while other men play gendang panjai music with drums and gongs. The feast chief is followed by the Tuai Rumah. Behind them walk two women who carry popped rice ( letup ) and a plate of offerings. They are followed by those who perform the music. When the procession reaches the warriors at the space outside the longhouse building, the feast chief invites them to take their seats with him and the Tuai Rumah on a mat which has been spread for the occasion. As they sit here, the feast chief asks the warriors whether they have heard any un- [Page 58] favourable omens on their way to attend the feast. If no omens were heard, good or bad, then the Tuai Rumah only waves a cock above the heads of the warriors with a prayer for a prosperous and peaceful festival. If the warriors have heard or seen bad omens on their way to the feast, then the feast chief appeases them with offerings and wine. But if they have seen the cobra ( tedong ) or a coral snake ( kendawang ) gliding across their way to the feast, then a special reception will be made for them in the longhouse.

As they sit in a row at the lower gallery they are received by the hosts in the following way. First a glass of tuak wine is given to them, known as ai aus , to quench their thirst. After this, each warrior drinks ai untong wine, -- fifteen small glasses of wine each in honour of their attending the festival. After they drink their individual share of wine, a man stands up to wave a cock above the warriors' heads, with the following prayers: “On behalf of the feasters in this house, I wave this cock above your heads to pray to your personal guardian spirits ( tua' ) for the prosperity of our festival. This cock I am holding in my hands will wipe away your unsatisfactory dreams and the omens which you have encountered on your way to this feast.

As the procession ends the young men pour their tuak wine into the glass in the hand of the maidens for them to offer to the warriors and others who accompany them. The drinking of this wine is enlivened by jokes and laughter. After this ceremony is over, curried and roasted meat of pigs and chickens is brought out from the rooms for the warriors to eat with wines of various kinds. This reception lasts an hour. Shortly after the reception of these warriors, another reception takes place for the hosts to receive a group of warriors ( orang ngirup ai jalong timang ) who will drink the wine blessed by the bards. This reception is similar, only that thirteen, rather than fifteen glasses of wine are given to each warrior. After these two receptions are ended, a midday meal ( merarau ) is served along the lower gallery.

After all the guests from each longhouse have been received by the hosts, the feast chief waves a chicken along the lower galleries to inform the people that the dinner will soon be served. At this time the hosts arrange the seats of the guests along the galleries. After this, food is brought out from the family rooms and arranged in a row in front of the guests.

In answer, the speaker replies that they are welcoming the spirits of their ancestors from the other world who they have invited to come to the feast. “We hope”, he says, “that they do not come with empty hands, but bring for us various kinds of [Page 60] charms so that we can easily acquire riches and live in good health in the future”. He admits that these spirits are invisible, but says that the guests present may have been divinely inspired to give them blessings on behalf of the spirits of their ancestors Saang and Bedilang, Kaya and Bana, Linggir and Kadir and Rentap and Minggat respectively. 9 “These past chiefs”, he says “were immortally famous in leading their followers in doing prosperous work of all kinds in our country.”' <sup id="cite_ref-1386" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1386">[1,386]</a></sup> 'In answering the speaker, the spokesmen for the guests reply that the spirits of their ancestors are truly present. “They come here to bless your feast so that all of you can become prosperous in doing your future farming and trading.

No young man, or individual lacking special spiritual habit may do this because, according to Iban belief, it can cause a person who is not old or who lacks such power to become an idiot ( mamau ). After the rugan have been thrown to the ground, a morning meal called bebungkar ruang is served to the guests along the lower gallery.

Sometimes even more elaborate rites are staged. The most important of these is the gawai engkune  , in which all bilek-families   join. It is commonly held a few weeks after first occupation of the new house. A temporary shrine ( ranyai  ), containing offerings, omen-sticks, charms and pieces of wood termed engkune, is erected on the tuai of the tuai burong. For one whole night, a party of four men skilled in the task, encircle the spot, chanting an invocation ( timang  ) to the gods. In magical and poetic words, they describe the arrival of the gods, who, at the behest of the Iban, build for them a wonderful new house. Especially prominent is Apai Nendak (the father of the omen bird, Nendak), who brings most of the materials for this house built by the gods, and furnishes it with charms potent against all manner of evils. The gods, it is believed, enter the shrine charging the objects stored there with supernaturai power, and to conclude the ritual, the shrine is dismantled, and its contents shared out by the tuai-families   of the long-house.

Each of these rooms is connected by a hinged door (which may be barred from within) to the great gallery ( ruai  ) of the long-house, which serves as a kind of general thoroughfare and is the principal venue of the community's social and ritual life. Of this gallery each family possesses its own section, and although the whole of the ruai   is ordinarily open to all members of the long-house, each family retains the prescriptive right to cordon off its own part whenever, for ritual reasons, the need arises. Here and there, in about the centre of the ruai, in smoke-blackened clusters, hang the trophy heads or antu pala, with which so many of the most cherished values and beliefs of the Iban are associated. But each cluster is always the private property of the family on whose section of the gallery it hangs, for trophy heads are never owned by the long-house as a whole.' <sup id="cite_ref-1397" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1397">[1,397]</a></sup> During the colonial period, no permanent sacrifical sites were built: 'The Dyak has no temple erected in honour of some god to which, like the ancients of the Western World, he can make a pilgrimage. He has no altar before which he can spend the night in order to receive revelations in dreams, but he goes instead to the lonely mountain-top, or the cemetery where so many heroes of the past have been buried, and makes his offering and lies to rest beside it.

In it deities and ancestors, including pioneer settlers, are summoned from the spirit world to attend the festivities. Those portions of the pengap in which the famous ancestors are summoned are the same for many of the major gawai .' <sup id="cite_ref-1403" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1403">[1,403]</a></sup> 'Timang include two specialised songs of invocation performed at the gawai antu , the greatest of all Iban festivals in many parts of Sarawak, and at the gawai burong , of equal importance in other areas. The timang is similar in form and function to the pengap . The renong is a form of song performed by men only, frequently dealing with themes of love or war, and requiring anything from twelve hours to seven nights for a complete performance. There are many sub-categories. Some renong follow a specific memorised pattern; others are improvised. The kana is similar to the renong , but much shorter.' <sup id="cite_ref-1404" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1404">[1,404]</a></sup> 'There are many other forms of Iban oral literature. Some are primarily ritual in nature, such as the sugi , performed at a special healing ceremony. Others emphasise the ability of the narrator to improvise and may be entertainment pure and simple. One such is the ensera , which is always fictional and frequently hilarious nonsense. There is a good deal of regional variation in the various Iban oral forms. Since Mr Harrisson's curatorship started in 1947, the Sarawak Museum, and the author of this study in particular, have collected many Iban texts; this work is continuing, and in the future a complete study of this tremendous subject may be possible. Meanwhile, the Special Monograph of 1966 published by the Museum is a major first step.' <sup id="cite_ref-1405" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1405">[1,405]</a></sup> Ritual incantations were performed by bards: 'There are three religious practitioners: the bard (LEMAMBANG), the augur (TUAI BURONG), and the shaman (MANANG). Individually or in teams, bards are invited to chant at all major rituals. They are highly respected men, capable of recalling and adapting as appropriate, chants that go on for hours. The augur is employed for critical activities, such as farming or travelling. The shaman is a psychotherapist, who is consulted for unusual or persistent ailments.' <sup id="cite_ref-1406" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1406">[1,406]</a></sup> 'Iban religious functionaries are those individuals who have specific roles in relation to rice cultivation, augury, social order, and ritual life (Jensen 1974:59-64). They include the tuai burong (augur), the tuai rumah (house headman), the lemambang (bard), and the manang (shaman). More than one of these functions may be vested in the same person. The tuai burong is called on to guide the community through seeking and interpreting auguries, especially those concerning rice cultivation. The tuai rumah administers customary law ( adat ). The lemambang intones the ritual invocations ( timang or pengap ) which form a central part of major ceremonies ( gawai ). The manang , a healer of individuals, is the subject of this study and his/her role is explored in the chapters that follow.' <sup id="cite_ref-1407" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1407">[1,407]</a></sup>  'The lemambang may perhaps be called a priest but he is not the ultimate authority on Iban religion. His concern is with intoning the ritual incantations, called pengap , which form a central part of major ceremonies ( gawai ). These occur intermittently. Although extremely important, they are not as significant in the context of day-to-day religion as are omens, dreams, and social ordinances. They are, however, extraordinarily interesting since they comprise long versified accounts of personalities and life in the spirit world. They provide the dramatic, personified background to the code governing agriculture and social conduct.' <sup id="cite_ref-1408" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1408">[1,408]</a></sup> 'The incantations include the full names, honorifics, and nick-names of the spirits. These are unfamiliar in detail to Iban other than the lemambang&nbsp;; even the tuai burong rarely knows them fully. The lemambang , however, does not necessarily understand the precise role of the named spirits in augury or other rites, and does not, qua lemambang , participate in these. Less than being a priest, since he does not perform ritual acts, it is probably truer to say, as Scott (1956, 103) does in his dictionary, that the lemambang is the ‘bard’ of Iban society, albeit the liturgical bard or cantor.' <sup id="cite_ref-1409" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1409">[1,409]</a></sup> Dreams played an important role in the selection of bards: Ritual offices -- manang (shaman), lemambang (bard), tuai burong (augur) -- are likewise assumed only after appropriate dream experiences, which command or confirm the calling. Finally, dream experiences are the usual source of potent charms ( pengaroh ), which the spirits direct the dreamer to find, in a certain location, in a later waking state (Jensen 1974:121). Many former Iban leaders have recounted dreams in which they met, or sought out, one or more of the Iban culture heroes ( orang Panggau ) who bestowed charms upon them and foretold their future achievements (Sandin 1966:91-123).' <sup id="cite_ref-1410" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1410">[1,410]</a></sup> 'To become a fully recognized lemambang presupposes in the first place a vocation, a call experienced and confirmed in a dream. It also takes a lengthy period of training. This is not so much a question of ‘initiation’, but a process of apprenticeship and practice which culminates in general acceptance as a qualified lemambang . During the first stage one or two interested young men (or women) spend a series of long evenings with an experienced lemambang . They endeavour to memorize choruses and repeated passages. At the next gawai festival, the novices follow the lemambang as a chorus ( ngelambong ), repeating appropriate sections after him. In [Page 63] time, if they persevere, and have the facility for remembering by heart many hours' worth of verse, they graduate to officiating as lemambang themselves. Although a few lemambang are acquainted with incantations used in different contexts and on different occasions, it is normal to specialize in one or possibly two.'  <sup id="cite_ref-1411" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1411">[1,411]</a></sup> 'A very clear indication of the different kind of powers attributed to the manang and the lemambang in traditional Iban society is the nature of the training deemed essential for each role. The manang vocation is obliged by the command of a spirit or deity in dreams; disobedience to the call is thought to result in madness or death (Richards 1981:204). Elaborate rites of initiation follow. These are deemed to confer on the candidate the special powers peculiar to the manang (Perham 1887:100-102; Richards 1981:204-205). Intending lemambang are not obliged to the role, but do seek the sanction of the gods, revealed in dreams, for their aspiration. Without this, a person cannot hope to succeed beyond the status of a minor bard ( lemambang mit ), who has mastered only certain categories of the ritual chants (Masing 1981:137, 151-152).'  <sup id="cite_ref-1412" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1412">[1,412]</a></sup> Sandin describes a performance: 'After the women and maidens who participate in the bedenjang ceremony have taken their seats, the senior bard starts to sing his denjang song to the feast chief's wife. In it he says that she sits between Raja Simpulang Gana's wife and her eldest daughter who present to her various kinds of charms so that she may become expert in weaving blankets of highest quality and mats of many patterns. After the bard has ended his song, the feast chief's wife offers him a glass of tuak wine and, at the same time presents him with a few dollars of money in appreciation of what he said in his song.' <sup id="cite_ref-1413" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1413">[1,413]</a></sup> 'Shortly after the senior bard has sung his song to the feast chief's wife, another bard next to him in seniority sings his song to the wife of the longhouse headman.

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Life expectancy ♣ ♥</b> Reliable data on life expectancy are hard to come by: 'The reproductive histories which were gathered yielded some estimate of infant and childhood mortality; however, no attempt was made to collect comprehensive data on mortality. The principal reason for the making of this decision was that the probability of getting accurate and complete information on the age at death of a substantial number of adults was judged to be very slight.' <sup id="cite_ref-1436" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1436">[1,436]</a></sup></dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Infant mortality ♣ [40-50%] ♥</b> Freeman and Sutlive claim an infant mortality rate of around 40-50%: 'Inquiries at Rumah Nyala showed an infant mortality rate (i.e. death at birth or within the first five years of life) of approximately 0.4; and from investigations carried out at all the long-houses of our sample it would appear that about 18% of women reach menopause without having raised children of their own. These are the women who, lacking issue of their own, have recourse to adoption.' <sup id="cite_ref-1437" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1437">[1,437]</a></sup> 'Infant mortality averaged about 50 per cent, and there were numerous other contributing factors besides diet. Iban had no midwives and often a shaman, with little or no knowledge of obstetrics, was pressed into service in difficult deliveries. If the birthing went well, women attending the mother took the infant to the hearth where the umbilical cord was cut with a bamboo sliver, and ask rubbed into the navel. In this way, tetanus was introduced, and within two weeks, many a newborn was dead.' <sup id="cite_ref-1438" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1438">[1,438]</a></sup> We have provided a range. Birthing practices and post-natal care were major causes of this phenomenon: 'A second way by which membership in the bilik-family is effected is through adoption ( iru or ambu '; v.f., ngiru ' ngambu '). Adoption is a fairly common practice among the Iban for four main reasons. First, although there is a high rate of marriage among the Iban, there also is a high rate of childlessness. Being without children gives rise to shame, and is interpreted as a curse. Many Iban women are childless due to dietary problems. Some miscarry ( kelebuan ) because of improper ante-natal care and excessively heavy work. Others deliver successfully, but inadequate facilities in the longhouse, together with heavy-handed procedures in achieving the passage of the baby, result in the death of the infant and, sometimes, the mother as well. (During labor, women press upon a board placed across the abdomen of the woman delivering to help passage of the baby. In one case reported by a hospital surgeon, difficulty was encountered and a woman seized the arm of the infant, wrenching it from the socket, resulting in the death of both baby and mother.) Post-partum practices account for a high infant mortality rate. (Tetanus, caused by cutting the umbilical cord with a bamboo sliver and then rubbing ash from the hearth into the naval, has been a major cause of early infant deaths.) These factors and others contribute to the high incidence of childlessness among the Iban.' <sup id="cite_ref-1439" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1439">[1,439]</a></sup> According to Padoch, it is difficult to pin down a single medical reason for the low fertility rate among the Iban: 'As no medical examinations were carried out among the censused populations, little can be said with any degree of certainty about any involuntary causes of infecundity. Poor diet, prevalence of gonorrhea, and of pelvic infections, which have been suggested as causes of the extremely low fecundity of other Bornean populations (Shircore 1937:30; Polunin 1958), have never been diagnosed as particularly important problems among any Iban populations. Although some cursory field examinations suggested that the nutritional intake of Engkari Iban may be less adequate than that of their Bintulu counterparts, both groups probably eat better than many populations having much higher fertility.' <sup id="cite_ref-1440" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1440">[1,440]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<dd> <b>♠ Endemic malnutrition ♣ present ♥</b> Seasonal malnutrition was common: 'One of the most obvious needs of Iban even in the midtwentieth century was a dependable food supply. In good years, families had enough rice to last from one harvest to the next. In average years, however, the supply of rice ran out six to eight weeks before the next harvest, and if the family had no money from rubber-tapping or wages, they were forced to borrow or to use sago palm, or worse, to subsist on rice and salt.' <sup id="cite_ref-1453" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1453">[1,453]</a></sup> 'Malnutrition was a serious and unevenly distributed problem. Many Iban diets were unbalanced and deficient. For example, [Page 162] when their rice supplies ran out, many Iban were forced to make do with what they could collect or hunt. Pregnant women, who should have been eating for two, often did not eat enough for one. Post-partum taboos, in particular dietary taboos which restricted a nursing mother to rice and salt for one month after her delivery, weakened the woman and her child.' <sup id="cite_ref-1454" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1454">[1,454]</a></sup> Bedford conducted nutritional surveys, revealing deficiencies in protein and fat intake: 'As a sufficient proportion of the population of the house were able to write, each room was asked to keep a diary of everything they ate and drank at every meal for one week, starting on the 23rd March, 1958. At the end of this period the results were collected and the weight likely to be consumed by an average adult male was assigned to each food commodity. The estimate for rice was the most accurate since it is customary at this longhouse to measure the rice used for each meal in cigarette tins full. A portion of rice cooked for each meal is wasted but as this must be very variable no allowance was made for it; so that as rice forms usually a high proportion of the daily food intake (see below) the results will tend to err on the high side. An attempt was made to estimate the weight of other food commodities consumed without bias, so that errors would be mutually exclusive and not cumulative.' <sup id="cite_ref-1455" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1455">[1,455]</a></sup> 'Having estimated the weight of each food commodity, its protein, fat, carbohydrate and calorie content was calculated from [Page 207] one food table (F.A.O. Nutritional Studies No. 3) and its iron content from another (McChance and Widdowson, 1946). An exception was the iron content of rice which was give the value reported by Rosedale for hulled Malayan rice (Rosedale, 1939). The food values for peculiar local foods were calculated from the nearest equivalent in the tables. Where this was not possible (e.g. for certain fruits and vegetables) the values under unspecified food (tropical areas) and unspecified fresh vegetables were used.' <sup id="cite_ref-1456" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1456">[1,456]</a></sup> 'The daily intake of protein, fat, carbohydrate, iron and calories was then estimated for each of the seven days for an average adult male of each door and from this the average daily intake of protein, fat, carbohydrate, iron and calories and the range for each value was estimated.' <sup id="cite_ref-1457" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1457">[1,457]</a></sup> 'Finally the percentage protein, fat, carbohydrate, iron and calorie intake obtained from rice was calculated.' <sup id="cite_ref-1458" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1458">[1,458]</a></sup> 'The results obtained from 25 rooms were accepted for analysis.

This, however, leaves a further deficit in the 11 diets which is probably real and undesirable. The cause of this suboptimal calorie intake is probably the low fat content of the diet. The attempt to acquire calories in the form of carbohydrate is limited by the bulk of the food and is not completely successful. It is interesting that the only diet which exceeded the average daily British calorie intake also slightly exceeded the average daily British fat intake (Door 5, Table IV).' <sup id="cite_ref-1468" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1468">[1,468]</a></sup> 'A normal woman and a growing child require 15 mgs. of iron daily.

Adoption is a fairly common practice among the Iban for four main reasons. First, although there is a high rate of marriage among the Iban, there also is a high rate of childlessness. Being without children gives rise to shame, and is interpreted as a curse. Many Iban women are childless due to dietary problems. Some miscarry ( kelebuan ) because of improper ante-natal care and excessively heavy work. Others deliver successfully, but inadequate facilities in the longhouse, together with heavy-handed procedures in achieving the passage of the baby, result in the death of the infant and, sometimes, the mother as well. (During labor, women press upon a board placed across the abdomen of the woman delivering to help passage of the baby. In one case reported by a hospital surgeon, difficulty was encountered and a woman seized the arm of the infant, wrenching it from the socket, resulting in the death of both baby and mother.) Post-partum practices account for a high infant mortality rate. (Tetanus, caused by cutting the umbilical cord with a bamboo sliver and then rubbing ash from the hearth into the naval, has been a major cause of early infant deaths.) These factors and others contribute to the high incidence of childlessness among the Iban.' <sup id="cite_ref-1472" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1472">[1,472]</a></sup> 'As no medical examinations were carried out among the censused populations, little can be said with any degree of certainty about any involuntary causes of infecundity. Poor diet, prevalence of gonorrhea, and of pelvic infections, which have been suggested as causes of the extremely low fecundity of other Bornean populations (Shircore 1937:30; Polunin 1958), have never been diagnosed as particularly important problems among any Iban populations. Although some cursory field examinations suggested that the nutritional intake of Engkari Iban may be less adequate than that of their Bintulu counterparts, both groups probably eat better than many populations having much higher fertility.' <sup id="cite_ref-1473" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1473">[1,473]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<p><b>♠ Volunteering ♣ absent ♥</b>
</p><p><b>♠ Charity ♣ absent ♥</b> Prosocial behavior was based on mutual assistance and self-help within residential and kin groups rather than charity. eHRAF provides a general description of the kinship system: 'The fundamental unit of Iban society is the BILEK-family, a group of five or six persons defined by kinship and affinity. Depending upon negotiations at a couple's marriage, there is an almost even chance that their children will be born into the family of either the wife or the husband. Iban families are part of a widely ramifying kinship system which developed in response to Iban mobility. The SUKU JURU and KABAN BELAYAN correspond to the kindred. The former connotes kin ties originating with one's grandparents and includes persons to the degree of first cousin. The latter is any group of people who share rights of reciprocity with an Iban, and may include nonkin and even non-Iban. More inclusive groups include "the brotherhood" and "food-sharers", made up of distant kin who would be invited to one's festivals, or whose festivals an Iban would attend. Attachment is ambilateral and descent, ambilineal. Although some Iban are capable of reconstructing genealogies up to fifteen generations in depth, such reconstructions are selective and illustrate the Iban practice of "genealogizing" so as to establish ancestral ties with strangers.' <sup id="cite_ref-1478" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1478">[1,478]</a></sup> 'Terms of reference are Eskimo and the terms of address, Hawaiian.' <sup id="cite_ref-1479" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1479">[1,479]</a></sup> 'The BILEK-family is an autonomous unit, able to join with other units of a longhouse or to detach itself. Iban become members of a family through birth, adoption, marriage, or incorporation. The family is responsible for construction of its own unit, production of its own food, and management of its own affairs. In a sample of 1,051 families, 60 percent were comprised of parents and children, 40 percent included grandparents. The family is a kin-based, corporate group, holding in trust land, sacred rice, sacred charms, ritual formulas, taboos, and heirloom gongs and jars. Traditionally, one son or daughter has remained in the BILEK to ensure continuity over time. With urban migration, and mail service making possible postal remittances, an increasing number of parents have no adult child residing in the BILEK with them.' <sup id="cite_ref-1480" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1480">[1,480]</a></sup> 'Each longhouse, as each BILEK, is an autonomous unit. Traditionally the core of each house was a group of descendants of the founders. Houses near one another on the same river or in the same region were commonly allied, marrying among themselves, raiding together beyond their territories, and resolving disputes by peaceful means. Regionalism, deriving from these alliances, in which Iban distinguished themselves from other allied groups, persist in modern state politics. Essentially egalitarian, Iban are aware of long-standing status distinctions among themselves of RAJA BERANI (wealthy and brave), MENSI SARIBU (commoners), and ULUN (slaves). Prestige still accrues to descendants of the first status, disdain to descendants of the third.' <sup id="cite_ref-1481" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1481">[1,481]</a></sup> Local leadership was informal: 'Prior to the arrival of the British adventurer, James Brooke, there were no permanent leaders, but the affairs of each house were directed by consultations of family leaders. Men of influence included renowned warriors, bards, augurs and other specialists. Brooke, who became Rajah of Sarawak, and his nephew, Charles Johnson, created political positions -- headman (TUAI RUMAH), regional chief (PENGHULU), paramount chief (TEMENGGONG) -- to restructure Iban society for administrative control, especially for purposes of taxation and the suppression of head-hunting. The creation of permanent political positions and the establishment of political parties in the early 1960s have profoundly changed the Iban.' <sup id="cite_ref-1482" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1482">[1,482]</a></sup> Social control was exercised by headmen and elders; spirit beliefs were also important: 'Iban employ three strategies of social control. First, from childhood, they are taught to avoid conflict, and for a majority, every effort is made to prevent it. Second, they are taught by story and drama of the existence of numerous spirits, who vigilantly ensure observation of numerous taboos; some spirits are interested in preserving the peace, while others are responsible for any strife that arises. In these ways, the stresses and conflicts of ordinary life, especially life in the longhouse, in which one is in more or less constant sight and sound of others, have been displaced onto the spirits. Third, the headman hears disputes between members of the same house, the regional chief, disputes between members of different houses, and government officers, hear those disputes that headmen and regional chiefs cannot resolve.' <sup id="cite_ref-1483" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1483">[1,483]</a></sup> We have found no material on philanthropic foundations or other charitable organizations with Iban members. More information on the relationship between Iban and Christian missionaries may be needed. So far, we have found no clear evidence of Iban joining Christian organizations, although this cannot be ruled out.

<p><b>♠ Tribute ♣ absent ♥</b> In the 16th and 17th centuries, the sultanate of Brunei attempted to extract tribute from the Iban: 'The Iban country is nowhere mentioned in the slight amount of information available concerning the sixteenth and seventeenth century Sultanate. A Brunei document dating from the reign of Sultan Muaddin, probably early in the eighteenth century, described the tributes which the ruler collected from his southwestern dependencies, including Saribas and Batang Lupar in the Second Division. The annual Saribas tribute, collected by locally appointed Malay chiefs, consisted of one war boat and 800 pasu of padi, as well as contributions on certain special occasions such as the death or marriage of a Sultan. The Batang Lupar and Skrang Rivers paid tribute only in cotton. It is quite likely that these tribute payments affected only the primarily Malay settlements nearest the coast.' <sup id="cite_ref-1484" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1484">[1,484]</a></sup> 'Rice was also more directly involved in the political relationship between Moslem and pagan. The Saribas Malays attemped to collect a tax of one pasu (about four gallons) of padi per Iban family per year, acting in the name of the Sultan of Brunei. It is by no means certain to what extent they succeeded, but the Brookes later regarded this tax as traditional, and collected it throughout the Iban country themselves. In Saribas Iban tradition, several famous warriors are remembered for having successfully defied the tax collectors. It is not always made clear in the stories that these Malays, who are portrayed as abusing their tax-gathering powers, are the same chiefs who accompanied the Ibans on raids.' <sup id="cite_ref-1485" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1485">[1,485]</a></sup> But obligatory payments by native communities to the Brooke Raj government were coded under 'taxation' below.

<p><b>♠ Degree of taxation ♣ present ♥</b> The Brooke Raj administration collected a 'door tax' from its Iban subjects: 'William Brereton, the young man whom the Rajah soon sent to Skrang Fort, was the first Englishman ever to be stationed outside of Kuching. Brooke told the Iban headmen that they would have to support their new chief by paying the vaguely customary “door tax” in rice, which the Malays had sometimes collected in the past in the name of the Sultan of Brunei. This revenue would be supplemented by income from a salt duty. ' <sup id="cite_ref-1486" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1486">[1,486]</a></sup> In practice, this tax was collected by headmen and government chiefs: 'The Government expected a penghulu to convey its wishes to the longhouses in his district, and to discourage his people from illegal migration and headhunting. The penghulu supervised the collection of the yearly family or “door” tax, which will be discussed shortly, by distributing tax papers ( surat pupu or daun pupu ) to the longhouse headmen. The function of the papers was purely symbolic, since few headmen could read or write and all were already well aware of the tax obligation. Sometimes the penghulu actually collected the tax and brought it to the fort, but more often the longhouse headman did this job. In either case, however, it was the penghulu and never the headman who received a commission of ten percent on all taxes paid, as well as on fines which he was empowered to levy [Page 260] for minor offenses. The penghulu saw to it that warriors turned out for military service at the appointed time, and in areas remote from Government influence he was expected to organize the defense of his people against hostile attack, and in some cases to lead retaliatory war parties against the attackers.' <sup id="cite_ref-1487" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1487">[1,487]</a></sup> Pringle describes the taxation system. Iban, Chinese and Malays paid different types of taxes: 'The main sources of Second Division revenue were head and door taxes levied on the Malay and Iban population, spirits and gambling farms sold at auction in each Chinese bazaar of any size, light import duties levied on some items imported directly to Simanggang, including salt and Iban luxuries such as old jars and brassware, and a tax assessed on Chinese shophouses in the bazaars. The Government also took a traditional percentage of the birds' nests gathered by Ibans in the caves of the Klingklang Range, which formed the border with Dutch Borneo in the southwestern portion of the Division, and collected an inheritance tax from members of all the ethnic groups.' <sup id="cite_ref-1488" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1488">[1,488]</a></sup> 'The door and head taxes paid by the Ibans and by some Malays were more than a mere source of revenue. They symbolized the political responsibilities of these two groups within the Brooke State. Most Malays in the Second Division paid no direct taxes whatever. Instead they remained liable for Government service, including duty on punitive expeditions, which were frequent until about 1910.' <sup id="cite_ref-1489" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1489">[1,489]</a></sup> 'As late as 1912, 2,100 out of an estimated 3,000 Malay men in the Second Division paid no taxes and were subject to such calls.' <sup id="cite_ref-1490" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1490">[1,490]</a></sup> 'In more peaceful districts, however, the majority of the Malays paid an annual tax of two dollars per adult male, known as “exemption tax” because it freed them from the obligation to serve on expeditions, and from all other unpaid Government service. This tax was first levied in 1861 [...].' <sup id="cite_ref-1491" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1491">[1,491]</a></sup>  'For a time the Chinese also paid exemption tax, but during the majority of Charles Brooke's reign they paid no direct taxes at all, except for a modest assessment on their shophouses. As a general rule, the Government respected the exemption from service which payment of this tax provided. In the Second Division, where some Malays paid the tax and others did not, Residents knew that they could not demand labor from taxpayers without giving them wages. In 1898, the Rajah instructed an officer newly posted to Lundu in the First Division, “The inhabitants may occasionally be called upon to assist [in making paths and roads] though this is rarely to be done as they pay their yearly tax.”' <sup id="cite_ref-1492" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1492">[1,492]</a></sup> 'In later years most of the pagan tribes except the Ibans (including Kenyahs, Kayans, Land Dayaks and many Melanaus) also paid the exemption tax of two dollars per year. Although there was a general trend toward standardization through the years, the details of taxation continued to vary somewhat from district to district. For some reason the Land Dayaks of the Sarawak River, the people James Brooke had allegedly saved from Malay “oppression,” submitted to two increases in taxes, until they were paying three dollars a year per adult male, more than anyone else in the country. Then, in 1885, the Rajah reduced their rate to conform with the exemption tax paid by others.' <sup id="cite_ref-1493" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1493">[1,493]</a></sup> 'The majority of the Ibans, including all those in the Second and Third Divisions, received special treatment. They paid a “door tax” of one dollar per family ( bilek ) per year, less than half the exemption tax rate, but they were still obligated to serve on Government expeditions. “...this they would I imagine rather regard in the light of an amusement than a burden,” the first British consul posted to Kuching observed with some reason in 1864.' <sup id="cite_ref-1494" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1494">[1,494]</a></sup> 'The Iban door tax was originally set at one pasu of padi per year, as noted in an earlier chapter. According to a somewhat vague tradition already mentioned, Brunei sanctioned chiefs had levied this amount in the days before Brooke rule. By 1870, or perhaps somewhat earlier, an Iban family could pay the cash equivalent of one pasu of padi , originally [Page 266] calculated to be eighty cents. By 1880 the price of padi had gone up, and the cash equivalent was raised to one dollar per door. Soon after this date, the Resident of the Second Division decreed that in future the door tax could be paid in cash only. Although the dollar price of rice continued to rise, the yearly tax remained fixed at one dollar per door down to the end of Brooke rule and beyond. In later years the in-kind origin of this tax was completely forgotten. Although it was not uncommon, especially in times of hardship, for Ibans to pay in goods or labor, their tax was always computed in terms of dollars, never in terms of far more valuable pasu of padi.' <sup id="cite_ref-1495" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1495">[1,495]</a></sup> 'Soon after the Trusan River became part of Sarawak in 1884, the local Muruts, who had learned that the Ibans paid only one dollar per year, objected to paying the two dollar exemption tax themselves. On the Rajah's next visit to the Trusan, he gave them a lecture on the theory behind Sarawak taxation.' <sup id="cite_ref-1496" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1496">[1,496]</a></sup> 'Ibans migrating to areas beyond the Second and Third Divisions sometimes had to pay the higher exemption tax. In [Page 267] 1891 the Rajah founded an Iban colony in the Baram, in order to have a source of military manpower close to Brunei Bay. By 1908, however, there was no longer any likelihood that Iban warriors would be needed in this area. The Resident of the Fourth Division concluded that there was no reason why the contentious newcomers should continue to pay at only half the rate demanded of the original inhabitants of the Baram. “They certainly cause the government more trouble than all the Kayans put together,” he observed. He eventually raised Iban taxes to the two dollar level, drawing angry protests from the Baram Iban penghulu , whom the Rajah dismissed on his next visit to the Fourth Division.' <sup id="cite_ref-1497" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1497">[1,497]</a></sup> 'Upriver Ibans have traditionally displayed acute sensitivity on the subject of taxation, rather like the Scotch-Irish mountaineers of America's Appalachian highlands. In later years they were prone to view with deep suspicion any attempt by the Government to alter what they came to regard as the customary door tax rate of one dollar per year, and misunderstanding over taxes was a major cause of the Asun unrest which commenced in 1931. By paying their door taxes, the Ibans were acknowledging the sovereignty of the Rajah, a fact which was well understood by all. Those who failed to pay were by definition in a state of rebellion, a not uncommon situation in upriver areas of both the Second and Third Divisions, as we shall see.' <sup id="cite_ref-1498" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1498">[1,498]</a></sup> The government also extracted labour service from the population: 'In addition to the taxes and other revenues which it collected, the Government depended heavily on contributions of labor and services from the population. In any year when expeditions did not take place, Residents would normally “call out” the Ibans to maintain and repair footpaths. In many lowlying areas of the Second Division these consisted of logs laid end to end over mud, continually rotting away or being rooted up by wild pigs. The people also provided materials and labor for the construction of Government buildings. In 1894, when the fort at Kabong needed rebuilding for the second time in thirty years, the Krian Ibans supplied all the timber and shingles, and the Kabong Malays (who did not pay exemption tax) supplied unskilled labor. The total expense to the Government was $307.94, of which $185.92 went to pay the wages of Chinese carpenters and $122.02 was expended on nails and other hardware. ' <sup id="cite_ref-1499" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1499">[1,499]</a></sup> Iban men could serve in the Brooke military in exchange for a lower tax rate: 'The vital function of the Ibans within the Brooke State was military. The lower tax rate which the great majority of them paid implied a special obligation to fight in the service of the Rajah. Their most important single leader in the era of Charles Brooke, Penghulu Dalam Munan of Sibu, was a war leader of extraordinary skill and stature. The entire history of Sarawak down to 1861 may be interpreted as a contest between the Brookes and the old, as yet unreformed Malay ruling class, for control of a predominantly Iban population. There were other pagan and Malay groups at stake in the contest as well, but the Ibans were of critical political importance because they enjoyed fighting, and in those early years little cared whom they fought. After the Brookes had subdued or expelled their Malay rivals, the Ibans remained useful primarily for service against rebel Ibans equally fond of fighting. But the realization that Iban levies would respond to the Rajah's call undoubtedly exerted a quieting effect on potential subversives of all ethnic shades.' <sup id="cite_ref-1500" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1500">[1,500]</a></sup> The Brooke Raj administration sought to establish Baram as an Iban military colony before reverting to charging its population the normal tax rate: 'The Baram and Trusan districts, acquired in 1882 and 1884 respectively, accrued a total deficit of $94, 135 in the period down to 1889. The sum was not insignificant for a State whose total annual income at this time was only about four times this figure. The Sarawak Gazette commented piously, “If His Highness the Rajah likes to lose money in the interest of suffering humanity, far be it from us to gainsay his will or carp at his action.” However there is no reason to believe that the Rajah was resigned to the deficits. He was by no means primarily an economically motivated ruler, but he was always aware that Sarawak could not tolerate financial losses, since there was no European treasury to make them good. His naturally frugal disposition, and his concept of each river as a separate political and economic entity, further inclined him to insist that each should pay its own way. In most of the newly acquired districts, trade in jungle produce, at this period still of major importance to the Sarawak economy, was the only potential source of revenue. If this trade could be stimulated in each outstation, income from export duties would rise, and the population of a growing Chinese bazaar would yield additional income from the usual spirits, opium and gambling farms.' <sup id="cite_ref-1501" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1501">[1,501]</a></sup> 'Along the much larger Baram River and its tributaries there was similar friction between the inhabitants and itinerant Iban produce seekers, with the Government again initially on the side of the Ibans. In 1884 the first Baram Resident, C. C. de Crespigny, told a reluctant Kenyah chief that he could either allow the Ibans to work produce in his area, in which case the Government would allow him to levy a toll of one-tenth of whatever they collected, or that the Rajah might well order them to work there anyway without further reference to him. De Crespigny was irked when the Tinjar Sebob chief [Page 446] Aban Jau refused to allow a party of forty-five Ibans from Banting to work produce in his area. The Resident noted with approval that at this time over 200 more Second Division Ibans were reported enroute to the Baram for the same purpose. ' <sup id="cite_ref-1502" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1502">[1,502]</a></sup> 'As things turned out, there was never any need for a military colony in the Baram, which remained a far more placid [Page 451] area than those districts from which the Ibans themselves had come. Conditions in the area around Brunei Bay slowly stabilized, and the appointment of a British Resident to the Sultanate in 1906 eliminated any possibility of further disruptive political rivalry between Brunei, Sarawak and North Borneo. The Rajah indirectly acknowledged these changed conditions four years later, when he raised the tax rate of the Baram Ibans from one dollar to two dollars per year, thus indicating that they were no longer expected to serve as unpaid soldiers.' <sup id="cite_ref-1503" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1503">[1,503]</a></sup> The government also charged import duties on some items: 'In 1895, Bantin and certain other upriver headmen went on a trading venture to the Kapuas. When they returned from Dutch Borneo, bringing with them old jars and brassware, they failed to pay an import duty which the Sarawak Government levied on such items. In fact, the upriver people were not accustomed to pay this tax on what the Government considered to be Iban luxuries. It was normally collected only at Simanggang and other downriver points, and was not applied to the small amount of trade crossing the land frontier. But Bailey, in a court session at Lubok Antu, nevertheless fined all the members of Bantin's party. He made Bantin himself pay ten katties ($7.20) and confiscated his brassware. It was a costly [Page 371] blunder. “Bantin became an enemy on this account,” the Rajah later wrote, and tradition in the upper river, where the incident is well remembered, agrees with his judgment.' <sup id="cite_ref-1504" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1504">[1,504]</a></sup> But the bulk of early state revenue was provided by Chinese farmers and traders rather than Iban communities: 'But the Chinese were not only traders; they played a second economic role in the Brooke State as well. They were the industrious cash crop farmers whose labors transformed the countryside from a wilderness of scrub and swamp to a neat and productive landscape of pepper vines or rubber gardens, depending on the area. No matter what occupation they followed, the Chinese always in one way or another accounted for the majority of Sarawak revenues from the very beginning of Brooke rule.' <sup id="cite_ref-1505" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1505">[1,505]</a></sup> 'Charles Brooke never ceased to encourage Chinese agricultural immigration, even when it led to friction with Ibans and other natives. He admired Chinese culture, and proved it by inaugurating State education in the medium of Mandarin. After five years residence, any Chinese could apply for “privileges of Naturalization.” If the Government approved his application, he then paid a fee of fifty dollars and was henceforth “deemed a natural born subject of His Highness, as if he had been born within the said State.” The fact that the Chinese paid no capitation taxes, however, indicates that they were never regarded in quite the same light as the Malays, Ibans and others, for whom such “head” and “door” taxes symbolized the obligation of the citizen to serve his ruler. Even more signficant, no Chinese was ever given a seat on the [Page 552] triennial Council Negri. Chinese political activity, which in the years before the Revolution of 1911 inevitably took the form of secret society activity, remained not only suspect, but strictly illegal.' <sup id="cite_ref-1506" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1506">[1,506]</a></sup> Disputes over taxation contributed to political unrest in the 20th century: 'After more than a decade of peace, anti-Government activities, mingled with headhunting and outlawry, broke out among the upriver Ibans of the Second and Third Divisions in 1931. Personal resentments played a part in the subsequent years of unrest, usually identified with ex-Penghulu Asun of Entabai, Kanowit, and so did the memory of Bantin and other heroes of the past. But there was a new factor involved in the Asun unrest, which began at a time when the depression-pinched Government was attempting to systematize collection of the one dollar per year door tax. According to the Ibans, the authorities demanded payment from widows and indigents, who in [Page 570] earlier times would have been informally exempted. The people believed that the Government was violating a long established customary relationship, and readily accepted wild rumors about all sorts of other new and fantastic taxes. The tax issue was really only one symptom of a much wider malaise. The upriver people did not understand the beginnings of bureaucracy, and when it made new and unwelcome demands upon them without giving them anything in return, they found it easy to fall back on a well established tradition of insurgency.' <sup id="cite_ref-1507" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1507">[1,507]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Wages ♣ ♥</b> Note: Most Iban were subsistence horticulturalists: 'The primary activity of a majority of Iban is rice farming. In the hills, farmers practice swidden cultivation of fields averaging one hectare. Each family maintains its own seed bank of rice, and plants between one dozen and two dozen varieties in any year. At the center of its field they plant their sacred rice (PADI PUN), a gift of some spirit to an ancestor which has been retained over generations to recall the origins of that family. Given the uncertainties of rice farming in the hills, dozens of ritual acts are performed to ensure a successful crop. At the end of April, the head of the house holds a meeting of all family heads to discuss farm sites and an approximate date for the first rites. The meeting ensures that all residents coordinate their activities and that the rice matures at about the same time. Simultaneous maturation is critical because it helps reduce the losses of any one family to insects, birds, and wild animals who spread themselves over several fields rather than concentrate on just one. It also permits families to coordinate their harvest rituals. Auguries are taken in June, farms are cleared in June and July, and burned over in August or September. When the rice has ripened, it is informed through ritual that it is to be harvested and transported back to the longhouse. On the last day of harvest, farmers make an offering to the final stand of rice to ensure that the soul of the rice will return to the house with them, and not remain behind in the ground. In the plains, farmers practice farming of wet rice in permanent fields. Introduction of herbicides, pesticides and commercial fertilizers have permitted Iban to remove vegetation, control weeds and insects, and increase the yields of their farms. With much greater control over the success of their efforts, farmers rely much less on ritual.' <sup id="cite_ref-1508" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1508">[1,508]</a></sup> 'In addition to rice, farmers plant gourds, pumpkins, cucumbers, maize and cassava. Rice is complemented with a variety of jungle vegetables and fruits collected by men and women for consumption with the evening and morning meals.' <sup id="cite_ref-1509" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1509">[1,509]</a></sup> 'Fishing has provided the principal source of protein in the Iban diet, but logging and consequent silting of many streams and rivers have greatly reduced the numbers of fish. Techniques of fishing are sophisticated and adjusted according to the conditions of the waters. Fish traps are placed in constricted streams, and large nets inclined over larger streams. Fish are taken with the seine or with hooks. Hunting of wild pigs and deer, using dogs, traps, and nets, varies from community to community, according to the region, forest conditions, and animal population. Almost all families keep chickens and pigs, and every longhouse has dogs. Chickens, pigs and water buffalo are used in sacrifices, and eggs are an essential ingredient of any offering.' <sup id="cite_ref-1510" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1510">[1,510]</a></sup> Seasonal piracy expeditions were common and were transformed into seasonal labour migrations in the colonial and post-colonial periods: 'As can be seen in the breakdown of the Iban agricultural year shown in Figure 1.4, there is a definite division of labor based on sex. During the period of time from roughly November through April each year Iban males  have no specific duties associated with farming and are free to engage in outside activities, such as cash cropping, hunting and fishing and temporary wage labor. It is hypothesized that what was at one time a practice limited to this time span has developed into the contemporary Iban custom of bejalai, a status-validating temporary migration which in the present day may extend over an entire year or more.' <sup id="cite_ref-1511" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1511">[1,511]</a></sup> Even during the colonial period, wage labour was mostly temporary and practiced during the seasonal labour migrations of Iban men: 'The most important commercial activity for the largest number of Iban men has been the institutionalized BEJALAI, or journey to work for wages. In some longhouses almost all able-bodied men are away at any given time, working for a distant logging company or in the oilfields of northern Borneo. Wage-earning enabled men to buy jars, gongs, and other valuables for their families. Rubber and pepper have provided an unstable source of income, as has cocoa, a recent introduction. The attraction of salaried jobs is one of the principal reasons for Iban urban migration. Iban are employed in every major occupational category in Sarawak's cities.' <sup id="cite_ref-1512" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1512">[1,512]</a></sup> Davison provides a generally summary of the economic system: 'The Iban are shifting agriculturalists, whose subsistence economy has traditionally been based upon the cultivation of hill rice, or padi . Each bilik -family is an economically independent land-owning unit, whose individual members hold joint and equal rights in the family estate. Land ownership is established by the felling of primary forest, with usufructury rights maintained for as long as the bilik -family continues to exist, or at least remains resident within the longhouse community. Most bilik will also own sago and cocoa plantations, wild or semi-wild fruit trees, rubber small holdings, pepper gardens, pigs and poultry. In addition, each family will also possess its own farming equipment, tools, weapons, shotguns, canoes and other essential items needed in everyday life. In more recent times, those who are better-off will have long-boats, outboard engines and luxury items such as videos, bedding, furniture and other modern conveniences.' <sup id="cite_ref-1513" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1513">[1,513]</a></sup> 'Rice is also a source of disposable income - at least in those years when harvest yields exceed the annual rate of consumption. This “capital” may be exchanged for essential goods, such as salt and iron, or can alternatively be used to purchase luxury items - traditionally Chinese ceramics and local brasswares, but more recently, videos, cassette-players and other Western consumer products. Surplus rice supplies may also be put towards the sponsorship of a festival, or gawai , bringing prestige and social status to the families who do so.' <sup id="cite_ref-1514" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1514">[1,514]</a></sup> Accordingly, the below variables might not apply to the Iban. We are unsure what kind of wages men earned during labour migrations and trading expeditions.
