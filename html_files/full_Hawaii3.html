<dl><dd>Hawai'i, also known as the Big Island, is the largest island of the Hawaiian archipelago. Our 'Hawaii 3' refers to the period from 1580 to 1778 CE. 1580 is the approximate date of the formation of the first island-wide unitary kingdom, while 1778 is the date of first European contact ‒ the arrival of Captain Cook.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<dl><dd>By about 1580, 'Umi had become the first true 'king' (<i>ali'i nui</i>) of the entire Big Island.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> In contrast with the chiefs who came before him, he is said to have exerted greater control over land tenure, instituted a system of territorial administration based on <i>ahupua'a</i> land parcels, intensified food production, and elaborated the religious system.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>After 'Umi, the island alternated several times between being split into two or more smaller polities, and being united under one ruler.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> In times of greater integration, the kingdom was divided into districts (<i>moku</i>) which were each under the control of a major chief called an <i>ali'i-'ai-moku</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> Within districts were territories called <i>ahupua'a</i>, ruled by chiefs called <i>ali'i-'ai-ahupua'a</i>.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>2. Dispersed households</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>"Hawai'i lacked anything approaching urban centers, and although there were substantial differences in population density corresponding to an uneven topographic distribution of soil and hydrologic resources (see discussion that follows), the general trend was of dispersed households, each occupying and farming its own adjacent plots. Moreover, while the commoners were sedentary on their lands, the ali'i were known to move about in relation to available food stocks. This peripatetic pattern of chiefly movement is well described, and underlies the metaphor of the chief as a “shark who travels on the land” (He manōholo ̒āina ke ali'i; Pukui 1983:87: Proverb 799). Nonetheless, there were distinct chiefly and royal centers, marked by concentrations of larger residences adjacent to temples of the main state cults of Kū and Lono. [...] Surrounding the king's own extensive household compound were the residential courts of several principal ali'i and advisors, the houses of warriors, and the main Hale o Lono or temple to the god in whose name the annual tribute was collected. While this settlement plan has certain innovations reflecting Western contact (notably the gun drilling (p.51) field and the shipyard), in most respects it was probably typical of royal courtly centers in the late precontact era." <sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup></dd></dl>

Among his chief duties was to oversee the royal storehouses 'in which to collect food, fish, tapa [barkcloth], malo [loincloths], pa-u [female skirts], and all sorts of goods' (Malo 1951:195). Only the kālaimoku had the regular privilege of holding secret meetings with the king, and he controlled the access of other al'i to royal audiences." <sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>__Provincial administration__
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>2. Ali'i-'ai-moku
<dl><dd>"The districts (moku) into which the kingdom was divided were each under the control of a major chief of high rank, called the ali'i-'ai-moku. The operative term 'ai in this compound term has the core meaning of both 'food' and 'eat' but with metaphoric extensions connoting to 'consume,' 'grasp,' or 'hold onto' (Pukui and Elbert 1986:9). Thus the figurative extension of 'ai includes 'to rule, reign, or enjoy the privileges and exercise the responsibilities of rule.' The term ali'i-'ai-moku might thus be simply translated 'ruler of the moku,' but as in many Hawaiian expressions there are layers of kaona, 'hidden meanings', folded in. He is as well the chief who 'eats' the district (recall the metaphor of the chief as land shark), and literally 'eats from' its productions." <sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

Rather, the administration of the ahupua'a, including its various ̒ili subdivisions, was put into the hands of a konohiki, a resident “land manager” who acted on behalf of the ali'i-'ai-ahupua'a. Konohiki were, in fact, often lower-ranked members of the al'i class (such as kaukau ali'i), frequently junior collaterals of the ahupua'a chiefs themselves." <sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36">[36]</a></sup></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd>"The districts (moku) into which the kingdom was divided were each under the control of a major chief of high rank, called the ali'i-'ai-moku. The operative term 'ai in this compound term has the core meaning of both 'food' and 'eat' but with metaphoric extensions connoting to 'consume,' 'grasp,' or 'hold onto' (Pukui and Elbert 1986:9). Thus the figurative extension of 'ai includes 'to rule, reign, or enjoy the privileges and exercise the responsibilities of rule.' The term ali'i-'ai-moku might thus be simply translated 'ruler of the moku,' but as in many Hawaiian expressions there are layers of kaona, 'hidden meanings', folded in. He is as well the chief who 'eats' the district (recall the metaphor of the chief as land shark), and literally 'eats from' its productions." <sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

Three other proposed laws, against rum selling, prostitution, and gambling, were drawn up, to be explained and taught to the people before they should be adopted. It was agreed that the chiefs should meet six months later to continue their consultation upon the subject. The three laws adopted and the three proposed were printed together on one sheet, which bears the date December 8, 1827. On December 14, the people were assembled in a coconut grove near the fort; the three enacted laws were formally proclaimed, and the king, Kaahumanu, and Boki exhorted the people, both native and foreign, to obey the three laws which had been adopted and to give attention to the three which were not yet enacted." <sup id="cite_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ kapu Makahiki sensu stricto ♥</b> "On the evening of the twenty-third day [of the year and of the Makahiki cycle], after the god is decorated, everyone gets dressed in his best. Nobles and commoners chant aloud prayer called <i>kauwō</i> (K. Kamaku 1919-20, 41; cf. PE, 129). Pigs are cooked in the oven for the men and dogs for the women. Then the celebration begins. Everywhere cries of people drunk on 'awa can be heard, as well as blasphemous, reviling, and cursing songs (<i>kūamuamu</i>). Everyone enjoys himself. Halfway through the night, nobles and commoners together go to bathe in the ocean. The Makahiki gods are placed in the sand on the beach, and everywhere fires are lighted. This bathing, called hi'uwai, lasts until dawn (K. Kamaku 1919-20, 41; Malo MS, 149). "This night, particularly the bathing period, is the occasion for a sexual orgy and verbal obscenities. As Kepelino writes, 'The effect of holding his hi'uwai at night was that the crowd were [sic] excited as if with rum by the beauty of the ornaments, the splendor of the whale-tooth pendants, bracelets of sea-shells, feather wreaths and the fragrance of different tapa garments; one person was attracted to another and the result was by no means good. [1932, 96, cf. 193-95]' "At dawn of the twenty-fourth day all the people leave the sea, which, from that moment, just like any water, belongs to the god Lono (see below) and is forbidden to man. "For four days one only has to eat well and have a good time; working and even cooking are forbidden (Fornander 1916-20, 6:204). This period is the <i>kapu Makahiki</i> senseu stricto. K. Kamakau lists all the prohibitions in force during this time: 'And the deity [Lono Makua--V.V.] had decreed his law that man was prohibited not [sic] to kill; war was prohibited and no [sic] fighting, the ocean was prohibited, not a canoe was to sail; the <i>kapa</i> block was prohibited and no cloth was to be beaten; the drum was prohibited to be beaten; the horn was prohibited to be blown; the land prohibited to be loosened {<i>e kapu ka aina, aole, e hemo</i>, "the land is taboo, without exception"]; [...].'

Here one also enters into relation with another aspect of the 'outside,' of the world that transcends the household: the gods.

However, the haipule temple rites only occurred on a weekly basis, and, following discussions with the ritual editor, it has been decided that the "official cult" actually includes any ritual that is "mainstream" within the polity, and that distinguishes one polity from the next (within reason), regardless of whether it is performed by elites or commoners.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ daily offering ♥</b> "Shrines where offerings were made daily to Lono and to the ancestral deities ('aumākua) were a part of every household.

Here one also enters into relation with another aspect of the 'outside,' of the world that transcends the household: the gods.

However, the haipule temple rites only occurred on a weekly basis, and, following discussions with the ritual editor, it has been decided that the "official cult" actually includes any ritual that is "mainstream" within the polity, and that distinguishes one polity from the next (within reason), regardless of whether it is performed by elites or commoners.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ kapu Makahiki sensu stricto ♥</b> "On the evening of the twenty-third day [of the year and of the Makahiki cycle], after the god is decorated, everyone gets dressed in his best. Nobles and commoners chant aloud prayer called <i>kauwō</i> (K. Kamaku 1919-20, 41; cf. PE, 129). Pigs are cooked in the oven for the men and dogs for the women. Then the celebration begins. Everywhere cries of people drunk on 'awa can be heard, as well as blasphemous, reviling, and cursing songs (<i>kūamuamu</i>). Everyone enjoys himself. Halfway through the night, nobles and commoners together go to bathe in the ocean. The Makahiki gods are placed in the sand on the beach, and everywhere fires are lighted. This bathing, called hi'uwai, lasts until dawn (K. Kamaku 1919-20, 41; Malo MS, 149). "This night, particularly the bathing period, is the occasion for a sexual orgy and verbal obscenities. As Kepelino writes, 'The effect of holding his hi'uwai at night was that the crowd were [sic] excited as if with rum by the beauty of the ornaments, the splendor of the whale-tooth pendants, bracelets of sea-shells, feather wreaths and the fragrance of different tapa garments; one person was attracted to another and the result was by no means good. [1932, 96, cf. 193-95]' "At dawn of the twenty-fourth day all the people leave the sea, which, from that moment, just like any water, belongs to the god Lono (see below) and is forbidden to man. "For four days one only has to eat well and have a good time; working and even cooking are forbidden (Fornander 1916-20, 6:204). This period is the <i>kapu Makahiki</i> senseu stricto. K. Kamakau lists all the prohibitions in force during this time: 'And the deity [Lono Makua--V.V.] had decreed his law that man was prohibited not [sic] to kill; war was prohibited and no [sic] fighting, the ocean was prohibited, not a canoe was to sail; the <i>kapa</i> block was prohibited and no cloth was to be beaten; the drum was prohibited to be beaten; the horn was prohibited to be blown; the land prohibited to be loosened {<i>e kapu ka aina, aole, e hemo</i>, "the land is taboo, without exception"]; [...].' Moreover, human sacrifices, sacrifices of pigs, bananas, or coconuts--that is, those consecrated in the temples in the so-called <i>haipule</i> rites--are forbidden (Malo 1951, 141; MS, 145-146; Kamakau 1964, 19). This is the time for 'games', 'play', and 'jokes'--all designated by the word pa'ani--for all but the king, the priests, and the <i>kahu akua</i> (Malo MS, 146; cf. Kepelino 1932, 94), who should not take part in them." <sup id="cite_ref-321" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-321">[321]</a></sup> "Naturally, the hi'uwai is also a rite of passage. The seawater is supposed to 'purify' the bathers of all ritual impurities contracted during the year just ended (Beckwith (1932, 194). [...] "Scatological or obscene songs are improvised that reveal sins and faults and provoke laughter, which is a form of castigation (Ii 1963, 72-73). Thus people 'purify' one another through play instead of purifying themselves, as normally happens, through sacrifice. "Undoubtedly this is also the time when hundreds (Vancouver 1801, 5: 128-129), or even thousands (Stewart 1839, 95), of people participate in dances that enact mythological and historical episodes (Ellis 1917, 59, 74, 78-80; Beechey 1831, 2: 105-6; Stewart 1839, 145). These dances often have an erotic character, especially since it is permitted, and even prescribed, to go on from words to deeds: the dancers, whatever their sex, cannot refuse the sexual advances of the spectators they have aroused (cf. Pukui [1942] in Barrére, Pukui, and Kelly 1980, 78).]" <sup id="cite_ref-322" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-322">[322]</a></sup></dd>

<p>Another candidate for “most dysphoric collective ritual” is the actions that follow the death of a king, before the new king has taken the throne<sup id="cite_ref-365" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-365">[365]</a></sup>. This involves self-mutilation as well as violence towards others. But I do not consider this to be the most dysphoric collective ritual for two reason: 1) According to Valeri it is hardly a ritual at all, since it is extremely chaotic and follows no particular script, 2) While there are significant dysphoric elements (grief, self-mutilation, violence, fear, probably rape, etc.) there are also euphoric elements (debauchery, extreme sexual license, flatterning of hierarchies, intoxication, etc.). - PRG

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ hono ♥</b> "After the Hoowilimoo rites were over, the ritual of the dreaded <i>hono</i> ceremony was observed. This began the following day or on the second day. On that day, all the chiefs and men went bathing to rid themselves of the odor and grease of the pigs that they had eaten shortly before and, perhaps, in order to be purified. There were three or four pigs to be cooked that day for those who were to take part in the ceremony.</dd>
<dd>"After bathing, the participants in the <i>hono</i> were seated. The few who participated did so only in the expectation of receiving some pork from the three or four pigs cooked especially for the ceremony. The men sat crosslegged in rows in line with each of the images that stood from one end to the other before the 'anu'u tower, each man erect, one behind the other. Both elbows rested on the upper part of the thighs, the left wrist under the fight one. The participants waited to be told to 'put up the hands, up above.' Whoever wished to could raise both hands, but that was optional. Those who raised only the right hand rested the left one on the right knee, assuming as humble a posture as he saw fit. It was forbidden to shift one's position or move more than his arm while the kahuna of the <i>hono</i> uttered his prayers, which lasted a whole hour. When one of the company felt his upraised arms growing tired, he lowered them slowly to rest upon his thighs. But none dared to raise his head, lest he dies.</dd>
<dd>"In this ceremony, a person who kept both his hands upraised until the time was up made a decided impression. One who held the thumb of his upraised right hand erect was called a 'catcher of flies' (po'i nalo). When the ceremony was over, it was common to hear someone who had participated boast overt the steadiness of his upraised arms and his immobility, even when some thing he dreaded, such as a lizard or a rat, climbed onto his body." <sup id="cite_ref-366" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-366">[366]</a></sup></dd>

At European contact, land was divided into territorial units, each under the control of a chief; commoners, the <i>maka'āinana</i>, validated their rights to land by annual payment of tribute to chiefs'.<sup id="cite_ref-697" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-697">[697]</a></sup> Valeri has compared this to 'European feudalism, in particular the <i>seigneurie</i>.'<sup id="cite_ref-698" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-698">[698]</a></sup> The Board of Commissioners to Quiet Land Titles, appointed by Kamehameha III in 1846 as part of the Māhele land reforms, conducted a 'careful examination of the traditional system of land rights'.<sup id="cite_ref-699" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-699">[699]</a></sup> They wrote (in a report published decades later) that: 'When the islands were conquered by Kamehameha I, he followed the example of his predecessors, and divided out the lands among his principal warrior chiefs, retaining however, a portion in his hands, to be cultivated or managed by his own immediate servants or attendants. Each principal chief divided his lands anew, and gave them out to an inferior order of chiefs, or persons of rank, by whom they were subdivided again and again, after passing through the hands of four, five or six persons, from the King down to the lowest class of tenants.

The proportions of these rights were not very clearly defined, but were nevertheless universally acknowledged'.<sup id="cite_ref-700" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-700">[700]</a></sup> So here we have a complex system of land tenure, in which multiple chiefs at different layers in the hierarchy had nested claims to 'ownership' of any given piece of land, and commoners were considered to be tenants with labour and tribute obligations to their 'landlords'.<sup id="cite_ref-701" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-701">[701]</a></sup> <i>Ali'i</i> or <i>konohiki</i> (land managers) at various levels could revoke their sub-tenants' rights to the land and redistribute plots among their followers.<sup id="cite_ref-702" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-702">[702]</a></sup>

'Some families worked plots of land under different chiefs (or on different islands) as insurance against both arbitrary behavior by their landlord and local famine or drought'.<sup id="cite_ref-714" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-714">[714]</a></sup> Alternatively, they could (and often did) mount a rebellion.<sup id="cite_ref-715" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-715">[715]</a></sup></dd></dl></dd>

<dd><b>♠ primogeniture inheritance by males and females ♣ ♥</b> Hommon tells us that 'among both commoners and chiefs of Hawai'i and Polynesia generally, the separate term for elder sibling reflects the principle of primogeniture, the superior status of the firstborn'.<sup id="cite_ref-720" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-720">[720]</a></sup> Likewise, Goldman discusses the importance of primogeniture among Hawaiian commoners and chiefs: 'All first-born, male or female, were ritually honored; and even though men were preferred as actual chiefs and as family heads, the rule of primogeniture finally outweighed the sex consideration'. In commoner families, the first-born was designated <i>mua</i>, a term referring to the 'forward end of the canoe'.<sup id="cite_ref-721" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-721">[721]</a></sup> However, these authors are discussing the superior rank of first-born children rather than patterns of wealth inheritance.</dd>

<dd> <b>♠ Formal Elite Polygamy ♣ present ♥</b> Elites of both sexes could have multiple officially recognized 'spouses'.

<dd> <b>♠ Elite Concubinage ♣ present ♥</b> Kirch says in his discussion of 'Late Hawaiian society' that 'In principle, if not wholly in practice, the classes were endogamous; the major exceptions consisted of the appropriation of exceptionally beautiful young women of the commoner class by elite males, but only as secondary wives or concubines'.<sup id="cite_ref-730" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-730">[730]</a></sup> The distinction between wives and concubines may have been more blurry in 16th- to 18th-century Hawaii than in European contexts: 'marriage as is understood in the Western sense was not a feature of pre-contact Hawaiian culture'.<sup id="cite_ref-731" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-731">[731]</a></sup> However, it seems that we can make a distinction between 'principal' and 'secondary' elite marriage. Kirch says that 'officially sanctioned unions were class endogamous',<sup id="cite_ref-732" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-732">[732]</a></sup> and Linnekin distinguishes between 'principal' chiefly marriages between two highly ranked partners, often close blood-relatives, and the 'secondary' unions of male chiefs with commoners. The latter were desirable because they could surround the chiefs/kings with lower ranked but loyal retainers: 'The chief's child by a commoner should be the perfect retainer, destined to serve by virtue of low birth and enjoined to loyalty by close kinship. Through hypogamous unions chiefs attempt to constitute their retinue as a kindred'.<sup id="cite_ref-733" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-733">[733]</a></sup> I think we can consider the commoner women who became the lovers of <i>ali'i</i> (and bore them children) as meeting the criteria for 'concubines'.</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Typical number of extramarital partners ♣ few ♥</b> Malo claimed that traditionally, 'It was a common thing for a chief to have children by this and that woman with whom he had enjoyed secret amours. Some of these children were recognized and some were not recognized'.<sup id="cite_ref-734" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-734">[734]</a></sup> I have coded 'few' because there is no indication that the number of elite extramarital unions that produced children routinely exceeded ten.</dd></dl>

<p><b>♠ Rulers are gods ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> "Clearly, the highest ranks of alii shared a number of attributes with the gods, and indeed were explicitly called alii akua or 'god-kings' (Valeri 1985a:143; Malo 1951:54; Kamakau 1961:4). Valeri (1985a: 142-53) discusses the ethnographic evidence for divine kingship in late Hawai'i, and I will reiterate only a few key points. As the ritual leader of his people, who intercedes with the gods to assure the flow of mana, the king 'instantiates different major gods or groups of their particularizations according to a precise ritual calendar' (1985a:142). Thus when he goes to war, the king offers a human sacrifice at the luakini temple of Ku, but at other times he consecrates temples to the agricultural gods Lono and Kāne. The king shares with these gods the right to the kapu moe, the prostrating kapu. Another sign of their divinity is the capacity of high-ranked alii to practice incestuous marriage, something that the gods provide the model for (as in the creation myth of Wākea and Papa, Beckwith [1940]). Gods and kings share other material insignia as well: the puloulou staff, and the wrapping of their bodies in feathered garments (see below). Holding the power of life or death over ordinary humans, the king is frequently described as the ultimate devourer, a shark (in particular, the tiger shark, Galeocerdo cuvieri). [...] By the time of initial contact with Europeans, Hawaiians had taken the older Polynesian concepts of chiefship and rank, and subjected them to a form of hypertrophy, the logical extension of which was that their rulers, their kings, were now held to be divine." <sup id="cite_ref-820" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-820">[820]</a></sup> NB This descriptive text refers to the period following European contact.

This form of marriage, in which each took a single mate, originated as a command from the god to Hulihonua and his wife Keakahulilani, and lasted from their time down to that of Kahiko Luamea, 27 generations later. It was Wakea ['son' of Kahiko Luamea] who introduced the 'sin' (<i>hewa</i>) of mating with many women (<i>moe lehulehu</i>). Wakea took three wives, and his wife Papa in revenge took eight new husbands: Lua, Makea, Waia, Hinanalo, Kakahili, Wailoa, and a couple of others. After Wakea's time the unions of succeeding generations divided into two kinds, those in which men took many wives and women many husbands, and those in which there were but one wife or one husband.

[...] It should be noted that the totality of deities is defined by the expression - often placed at the beginning of prayers (cf. Beckwith 1940, 82) - i kini o ke akua, ka lehu o ke akua, ka mano o ke akua, 'the 40,000 deities, the 400,000 deities, the 4,000 deities' (Emerson 1965, 21). [...] The relationship between the major and minor gods is presented in a somewhat confused and contradictory manner in the literature (Emerson 1892, 5-24; Handy and Pukui 1972, 117-31; NK, 1: 35-43; Kamakau 1961, 200). According to one Hawaiian author the relationship is identical to that of the eldest brother and his younger brothers; the first reigns over the group, and the younger ones rule over special domains assigned to them (kuleana) (Anonymous 1927, 76). For Kamakau, on the contrary, subordinate gods are produced by a 'segmentation' (mahae'ana) of the major gods."<sup id="cite_ref-856" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-856">[856]</a></sup> NB This descriptive text refers to the period following European contact.

But, based on the fact that people prayed to him in temples, asking him to grant them things like wisdom and prosperity, perhaps it is reasonable to code him as "active". Admittedly, however, things are somewhat complicated by the fact that Kane was also assisted by the gods Ku and Lono during creation (though he himself played the dominant role), and that, when people prayed to Kane, they often prayed "through" lesser gods, e.g. family gods ('aumakua).

Anyone failing to perform the kapu moe was subject to immediate death. The only persons exempt from the kapu moe were alii of the next two categories (naha and wohi chiefs), who nonetheless were required to sit in the presence of the niaupio and pio alii." <sup id="cite_ref-870" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-870">[870]</a></sup> NB This descriptive text refers to the period following European contact.

<dd><b>♠ purity ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> "Although our information is often scanty on this point, it appears that Hawaiians classify a variety of states as 'pure' and 'impure'. [...] The most impure bodily process is menstruation. [...] Along with menstrual blood, all shed blood is impure to different degrees. [...] Loss of grease (which is apparently believed to embody life) also produces pollution (Kamaku 1964, 37). [...] Also impure is anything organic that putrefies, such as corpses or excrement--and everybody who comes in contact with these things or even worships them [...] Finally, aborted fetuses, deformed individuals, dwarfs and cretings are also impure and polluting (Stewart 1838, 191; cf. Ii 1963, 101).//All these are impure because they manifest a loss of integrity, of life (examples: loss of blood or of grease, corruption) or the nonachievement of a normal form, of a perfectly functioning life (examples: aborted fetuses, monsters). These phenomena do not simply imply a contrast with the divine type that they should instantiate; they also involve a contrast with the group constituted by the people who correctly instantiate that type. Any lack of bodily integrity therefore entails a lack of social integrity, a state of disorder in the relationship between afflicted person and group. Thus a dead person or a menstruating woman produces disorder, a weakness, in the group that must be resolved by purification." <sup id="cite_ref-871" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-871">[871]</a></sup> "The kapu enveloping the most sacred Hawaiian chiefs and kings were elaborated and intensified to a greater degree than elsewhere in Polynesia (except, perhaps, Tonga). Their premises, their clothing, their food, and their bodies were all subject to and regulated by a complex set of prescriptions and prohibitions, designed to protect their mana and keep them from contact with polluting influences (noa)." <sup id="cite_ref-872" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-872">[872]</a></sup> NB This descriptive text refers to the period following European contact.

One was for stealing, 'aihue [...]. The punishment of a thief when he was caught stealing by the owner of the property was a stern one--his flesh was stripped off his bones (<i>holehole</i>) until he died. This is a saying of the people of old, 'A thief denies his guilt until his bones are stripped of flesh,' I  ka ho'ole no ka 'aihue a pau na iwi i ka holehole. [...] For these sins there was bitter punishment and cruelty before death, and the bones of their perpetrators could not be hidden away.

Goldman writes that '[m]en and women were separated because they came under the jurisdiction of different classes of gods ... Insofar as they came under the jurisdiction of their own class of deities, among them Pele, the goddess of fire and volcanoes, women had access to mana and came under their own order of sanctity.
