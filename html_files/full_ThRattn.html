<dl><dd>After the destruction of the city of Ayutthaya by the Burmese in 1767, the Chao Phraya Basin was briefly ruled by Phaya Taksin, a charismatic warrior-king of obscure origins who chose Thonburi as his capital, near Bangkok, an old Chinese trading settlement. In 1782, what remained of the old Ayutthaya aristocracy staged a coup and put their leader on the throne. This leader took the name of Rama I Chakri and moved the capital to Bangkok, known at the time as Rattanakosin or Krungthep.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> Under Rama I, the kingdom rapidly expanded to the south (where it extended its control to the Malay peninsula), the north (where Chiang Mai became a new tributary), and the east (taking control of Vientiane and much of Cambodia).<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> It could be said to have reached its peak between 1793 and 1810, when it found new stability, regained control over important Asian trade networks, and witnessed a literary florescence, with the translation of several classics from different Asian languages.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> Our 'ThRattn' polity spans the 89 years between 1782 and 1873, when Rama V began a comprehensive series of modernizing reforms.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p><i>Population and political organization</i>
</p>
<dl><dd>The Rattanakosin kingdom was ruled by the Thai aristocracy. The king was simply a <i>primus inter pares</i> ‒ indeed, some kings, such as Rama II and Rama IV, actually retreated into a ritual role and left the administration of the kingdom entirely to the nobility. Even during the reign of more active kings, such as Rama I and Rama III, the aristocracy still monopolized the key posts in the central administration.  However, the king always led the country in spiritual matters: he was seen as a <i>bodhisattva</i>, a spiritually superior superhuman being tasked with preserving Buddhism and aiding his subjects in their ascent toward <i>nirvana</i>, for example through moral laws banning sinful pursuits.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>Evidence for the size of this polity's population before 1911, the year of the first census, is sparse and unreliable. However, a reasonable estimate would be that, following slow growth beginning in the 1780s, the population reached just below 5 million by the middle of the 19th century.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> It is not clear whether this estimate includes tributary states and cities.</dd></dl>

<p><b> ♠ Polity territory ♣ 513,120 ♥ </b> in squared kilometers. A map provided by Wyatt <sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> suggests that the territory governed by Rattanakosin, tributary states included, corresponded roughly to modern-day Thailand, Laos and Cambodia.

"Evidence for the size and distribution of the population before the first census in 1911 is sparse and far from reliable.

<p>The first period of the Rattanakosin era (1781-1868) maintained a similar administrative hierarchy to that of the 4-tiered pattern of the Ayutthaya kingdom: 1. Royal Capital; 2. Four towns under the administration of the king (muang luk-luang); 3. Other towns under administration of governors (muang phraya-maha-nakhon); 4. Outlying towns or colonies (muang prathetsarat) which sent tributes to the king.

<p><b> ♠ Occupational complexity ♣  ♥ </b>
</p><p><b> ♠ Professional military officers ♣ inferred absent ♥ </b> Referring to the early modern period, Charney <sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> writes that "[c]ontemporary European accounts also sometimes refer to what appear to be highly organized command hierarchies. The Siamese army command in the 1680s, for example, was described by Gervaise as consisting of a 'commander-in-chief, a deputy general, several captains with their lieutenants and some subalterns.' In actuality, members of the nobility through ad hoc appointments led Southeast Asian armies. These men were usually personal favorites of the ruler or one of his relatives, or were outlying lords obligated to bring local levies to participate in campaigns. One reason for this was the concern that otherwise a regular officer class on a permanent footing would become part of the court and ministerial politics that plagued early modern Southeast Asian states."

These operators were also charged with the maintenance of order, and with the settlement of all problems regarding counterfeit money and the falsification of gambling chips. As in the situation in nineteenth-century China, the gambling houses in Siam were also supposed to open only during the New Year period. The reality may have been different, since visitors to nineteenth-century Bangkok found many such establishments open for business at all times. The Chinese Khun Phatthanasombat supervised not only gambling activities, but also transactions in drinks, and obviously other forms of recreation for the leisured and the rich.

"'It is impossible to compare the beauty of the immense procession with two hundred boats,' wrote a European visitor to 17th-century Ayutthaya. 'The Royal barges travelled in twos in the front. All oarsmen have been trained to an admirable proficiency, dressed uniformly in gold-trimmed hats, tunic, knee and armbands. All rowing is in synchronized movement and rhythm. The oars, also of gold, touch the water with a sound that harmonizes with the boat song sung in praise of the King.'" <sup id="cite_ref-144" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-144">[144]</a></sup> According to the earliest European to describe the ritual, again in the seventeenth century, 350 to 400 barges took part, and 20,000 to 25,000 people: "This is probably no great exaggeration, for in those days Ayudhya was very rich, and the king's outward show of magnificence was of the utmost social importance; and we must not forget that the queens and members of the harem accompanied the king in their barges." <sup id="cite_ref-145" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-145">[145]</a></sup> The official purpose of the Kathina was to donate robes to the capital's monasteries, but, it was also an opportunity for the king to demonstrate his immense wealth and increase his mystique in the eyes of the commoners <sup id="cite_ref-146" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-146">[146]</a></sup>; moreover, because the ceremony made use of war barges, it was also a way of displaying the country's military strength <sup id="cite_ref-147" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-147">[147]</a></sup>.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ daily almsgiving ♥</b> Young <sup id="cite_ref-191" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-191">[191]</a></sup> writes in the nineteenth-century that "the people believe that in order to make merit during this life to save themselves from misery in some future existence, they must among other things follow 'the religion which teaches alms-giving.' 'Make merit.' That is the sum and substance of their religious faith and worship. As every reader of Buddhism knows, the soul is said to pass through many stages of existence before it reaches the mysterious region of Nirvana, and that it is possible for any soul to pass even beyond the shadowy confines of this debatable territory and finally attain the perfect condition of Buddhahood. At death, the merit and demerit of the soul are balanced, and the next condition of the wandering soul determined according to a system of debit and credit. The wicked king may be re-born as a slave or even pass into the body of a toad. The soul of a slave may be re-born in one of royal degree or may even ascend to an habitation in the celestial spheres. Hence it behoves every living being during this life upon earth to make as much merit as it possibly can, and as the custom of alms-giving is held to be a very profitable method of investment for the future, it is widely practised by king". More specifically, "One of the commonest sights in any part of Siam is the procession of priests, soon after sunrise, seeking their daily bread. They carry a bowl, basin or bag, and go straight on from house to house, each in the district appointed him. They stand outside the houses, but make no request for alms. If anything is given to them they bless the giver; if they receive nothing they pass silently on their way. Having collected their food, they return to the monastery to eat, and to meditate meanwhile upon the perishableness of the body." <sup id="cite_ref-192" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-192">[192]</a></sup> Almsgiving is a sufficiently simple ritual that contemporary descriptions may well broadly correspond to how it was carried out in the past as well: starting 6 a.m. every morning in modern-day Thailand,  "[m]onks walk at a steady pace, in line and in order of seniority, their bowls held in front of them or just below waist level, and their eyes on the road or path a few steps ahead of them. A monk carries his bowl in a cloth sling, whereas a novice does not use a sling but carries the bowl in both hands in front of him. While walking, a monk is not supposed to be anticipating the food he will be offered, but reflecting on the essentials of the monastic life: the robes, the <i>kuti</i> or other shelter, medicine, and the alms bowl which is his means of obtaining food to support his life rather than for pleasurable consumption" <sup id="cite_ref-193" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-193">[193]</a></sup>. NOTE: Making a daily offering to one's "spirit house" may have more of a "local flavour" as a ritual--that is, it might be more polity-specific--but, from the descriptions <sup id="cite_ref-194" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-194">[194]</a></sup>, it does not appear to be a collective ritual.</dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ daily almsgiving ♥</b> Young <sup id="cite_ref-233" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-233">[233]</a></sup> writes in the nineteenth-century that "the people believe that in order to make merit during this life to save themselves from misery in some future existence, they must among other things follow 'the religion which teaches alms-giving.' 'Make merit.' That is the sum and substance of their religious faith and worship. As every reader of Buddhism knows, the soul is said to pass through many stages of existence before it reaches the mysterious region of Nirvana, and that it is possible for any soul to pass even beyond the shadowy confines of this debatable territory and finally attain the perfect condition of Buddhahood. At death, the merit and demerit of the soul are balanced, and the next condition of the wandering soul determined according to a system of debit and credit. The wicked king may be re-born as a slave or even pass into the body of a toad. The soul of a slave may be re-born in one of royal degree or may even ascend to an habitation in the celestial spheres. Hence it behoves every living being during this life upon earth to make as much merit as it possibly can, and as the custom of alms-giving is held to be a very profitable method of investment for the future, it is widely practised by king". More specifically, "One of the commonest sights in any part of Siam is the procession of priests, soon after sunrise, seeking their daily bread. They carry a bowl, basin or bag, and go straight on from house to house, each in the district appointed him. They stand outside the houses, but make no request for alms. If anything is given to them they bless the giver; if they receive nothing they pass silently on their way. Having collected their food, they return to the monastery to eat, and to meditate meanwhile upon the perishableness of the body." <sup id="cite_ref-234" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-234">[234]</a></sup> Almsgiving is a sufficiently simple ritual that contemporary descriptions may well broadly correspond to how it was carried out in the past as well: starting 6 a.m. every morning in modern-day Thailand, "[m]onks walk at a steady pace, in line and in order of seniority, their bowls held in front of them or just below waist level, and their eyes on the road or path a few steps ahead of them. A monk carries his bowl in a cloth sling, whereas a novice does not use a sling but carries the bowl in both hands in front of him. While walking, a monk is not supposed to be anticipating the food he will be offered, but reflecting on the essentials of the monastic life: the robes, the <i>kuti</i> or other shelter, medicine, and the alms bowl which is his means of obtaining food to support his life rather than for pleasurable consumption" <sup id="cite_ref-235" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-235">[235]</a></sup>. NOTE: Making a daily offering to one's "spirit house" may have more of a "local flavour" as a ritual--that is, it might be more polity-specific--but, from the descriptions <sup id="cite_ref-236" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-236">[236]</a></sup>, it does not appear to be a collective ritual.</dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Swinging Festival ♥</b> "The harvest-festival ceremonies are of Brahminical origin and are known to the people under the name of 'Lo Ching Cha'. The first word 'Lo' means 'to pull' Aching cha is 'a swing'. The place where the 'Swinging Festival' is held is inside the city walls. It is a small green lawn situated opposite to a very large temple, and on the edge of a very busy thoroughfare. For three hundred and sixty three days in each year, there is nothing, except the huge pillars of the swing, to draw one's attention to the spot. A few boys playing football or flying kites, a few old women squatting down for a little gossip, or a few Malay grooms with their masters' ponies are the usual everyday occupants of the spot. On the other two days of the year, when the harvest festival is held, every inch of available space is occupied. The native children, unable to see over the heads of the men and women when they are upon the ground, quickly mount the neighbouring walls, and perch themselves in the branches of the trees, or cling, like monkeys, to every lamp-post and telegraph pole within sight of the proceedings. The thoroughfares leading to the place are blocked with innumerable carriages and rickshaws. The crowd is an exceedingly good-tempered one, and brawling of any kind is very unusual. The distant sound of a military band heralds the approach of another of those processions so dear to the heart of the Siamese. The procession passes through the dense crowd without any trouble, for the people willingly fall back so as not to impede its progress. Strangely coloured banners bearing quaint devices, flutter above the heads of the crowd. A modern military band plays 'Marching through Georgia', while an ancient band in tattered vermilion garments with yellow trimmings, bangs curious drums, and pierces the air with the penetrating shrieks of long brass trumpets. The tom-tom and the gong join in the general uproar. The crowd sways to and fro, striving to catch a glimpse of the barefooted soldiers in their brilliant uniforms, or of the numerous articles borne in the procession to indicate the nature and meaning of the festivities. Decorated buffaloes dragging decorated carts, bundles of rice, offerings of fruit and flowers, are all evidences of the thankfulness of the people for the safe ingathering of their harvests. "In the centre of the procession, carried in a chair of state on the shoulders of a number of strong well-built men, and shielded from the sun by a huge state umbrella, sits the Master of the Ceremonies resplendent in cloth of gold and jewelled ornaments. At one time the Minister for Agriculture officiated on these occasions, but now a different nobleman is selected each year, whose business it is to organise and superintend all the arrangements for the festival. All eyes turn towards the seated figure in his tall conical hat and jewelled robes. He is carried to a small brick platform, which is draped with the national flag and covered with flowers. He takes his seat, with two Brahmin priests on his right hand and two on his left. He places his right foot on his left knee, the left foot resting upon the ground. After having once seated himself in this position he is not allowed to remove his foot off his knee until the whole ceremony is finished. As this lasts about two hours, the presiding nobleman must be fairly uncomfortable by the time it is over. The penalty for moving the foot was, formerly, the confiscation of the culprit's property and the loss of his rank, in addition to any immediate ill-usage the attendant priests might think fit to bestow upon him; but this is now all done away with, and the only deterrent influence brought to bear upon the temporary sufferer is the opinion of the people, who would feel deeply hurt and disappointed should any detail of their well-beloved ceremony be omitted. "The attention of the crowd is next directed to the performance of the swinging games. The swing itself is like any ordinary child's swing except for its enormous size. The side pillars are about ninety feet high, and the seat of the swing is about half-way between the ornamented cross-bar and the ground. A few feet in front of the seat, on the side towards the Palace, a long bamboo-stem is fixed in the ground, and from the top is suspended a small bag of silver coins. The men who take part in the games are usually Brahmins. They are dressed in white, and wear conical hats. They swing towards the bag of money and endeavour to catch it with their teeth. There are generally three competitors; the prizes for the first being worth about fifteen shillings, while for the second and third they are worth about ten and five shillings respectively. When the winners have received their rewards they pass amongst the crowd, sprinkling the spectators with consecrated water contained in bullocks' horns. Soon afterwards the Minister returns to his home, the crowd disperses, and thus this very ancient ceremony is brought to a close." <sup id="cite_ref-275" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-275">[275]</a></sup></dd>

The swing itself is like any ordinary child's swing except for its enormous size. The side pillars are about ninety feet high, and the seat of the swing is about half-way between the ornamented cross-bar and the ground. A few feet in front of the seat, on the side towards the Palace, a long bamboo-stem is fixed in the ground, and from the top is suspended a small bag of silver coins. The men who take part in the games are usually Brahmins. They are dressed in white, and wear conical hats. They swing towards the bag of money and endeavour to catch it with their teeth. There are generally three competitors; the prizes for the first being worth about fifteen shillings, while for the second and third they are worth about ten and five shillings respectively." <sup id="cite_ref-300" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-300">[300]</a></sup></dd>

He places his right foot on his left knee, the left foot resting upon the ground. After having once seated himself in this position he is not allowed to remove his foot off his knee until the whole ceremony is finished.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Drinking of the Water of Allegiance ♥</b> Though the following description dates to the early twentieth century,"the Ceremony of Drinking the Water of Allegiance in the Ayudhya period was the same as that followed in Bangkok from the first reign onwards [i.e. between late eighteenth and early twentieth centuries], King Rama I having restored the ancient usage on his accession; and it is mentioned by La Loubere in the seventeenth century" <sup id="cite_ref-315" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-315">[315]</a></sup>. "The rites take place with great splendour twice yearly, on the third day of the waxing of the fifth month (Chaitra), and on the thirteenth day of the waning of the tenth month (Bhadrapada). The Drinking of the Water takes place in the Chapel Royal in Bangkok, and also in one temple in each seat of provincial government. The water is previously hallowed in the usual way by the monks, who recite mantras, the sacred sincana thread being stretched round the water-vessels, while the Court Brahmans also dip into the water the State Sword and other royal weapons, this being a rite of contagious magic, by the power of which any official meditating treason would be destroyed. It is said that persons have not infrequently in the past died of cholera after drinking the hallowed water, a result which no doubt did much to strengthen the general belief in the efficacy of the magic. On the day of the ceremony a Brahman reads out the Oath, and each official must drink the contents of a small cup, which he must drain to the last drop. Any appearance of difficulty in swallowing was, in the old days, considered as equivalent to an admission of disloyalty. The ladies of the palace, as well as members of the royal family, drink the Water of Allegiance, but, of course, with suitable privacy. Officials confined to their houses through illness are not excused from drinking the Water, but it is taken to their bedsides by royal pages or other officials." <sup id="cite_ref-316" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-316">[316]</a></sup> The Oath of Allegiance is too long to be included here, but it involves asking supernatural forces to punish the participants very thoroughly were they to fail their king: "may [the gods] plague us with evil, destroy our lives, effect our destruction and death by breakage, by severance; cause our death by lightning and thunderbolts, by royal weapons, the powerful royal sword, by poison and the power of land and water animals; let there be some opportunity for the destruction of the perfidious ones; let swift destruction come; let us not escape all great disasters and consequences of all localities, which those who have the power can inflict for all offences. We beseech the power of the deities to plague with poisonous boils, rapidly fatal, and all manner of diseases the dishonourable, perverse, and treacherous, plague with untimely, wretched and appalling deaths, manifest to the eyes of the world; when we shall have departed this life from earth, cause us to be sent and all to be born in the great hell, where we shall burn with quenchless fire for tens and hundreds of thousands of ages and limitless transmigrations; and when we have expiated our penalty there, and are again born in any world, we pray we may fail to find the least happiness in worlds of pleasurable enjoyments; let us not meet the god Buddha, the sacred teachings, the sacred priests, who come to be gracious to animals, helping them escape misery, reach heaven and attain a cessation of births and deaths; should we meet them let them grant us no gracious assistance." <sup id="cite_ref-317" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-317">[317]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Gender ♣ yes ♥</b> Mongkut "ruled that it was acceptable for women of low or middle class to choose a husband, but not those of high birth because their choice might affect the prestige of the family. The 1868 amendment specifically noted that a man could still purchase a slave as a wife and resell her later. Specifically among families with over 400 sakdina, Mongkut strengthened the father's legal authority over wives and daughters." <sup id="cite_ref-414" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-414">[414]</a></sup> Since the 14th century CE Thai women had only functions not rights, expressed in the popular aphorism: 'Women are buffaloes. Men are humans’. Women toiled in the fields and in market places but had no social status. There was no spiritual path open for them through Buddhism either - ordained nuns did not appear until the early 20th century. Husbands had full legal authority over their future. Daughters of higher status households were married off to hold down elite contacts. Very high-status women were confined to the king’s Inner Palace, keeping them away from public life. The 1804 CE 'Laws of the Three Seals' sanctioned polygamy, widely practiced among the aristocracy, especially state officials. It classified wives into three sorts: major (wives from parental arrangement - Mea Klang Muang), minor (wives of her request - Mea Klang Nork) and slave wives. Towards the end of the period women’s literacy increased and a few women entered a school built in 1868 CE to train the civil service, and the first all-girls school dates to 1874 CE. <sup id="cite_ref-415" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-415">[415]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-416" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-416">[416]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-417" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-417">[417]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-418" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-418">[418]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-419" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-419">[419]</a></sup>  <sup id="cite_ref-420" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-420">[420]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-421" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-421">[421]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-422" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-422">[422]</a></sup></dd>

Consequently, Buddhism’s ethical system emerged resting squarely on a body of preestablished forms of family practice, and supported by a fairly codified sociolegal system that had already taken form under the aegis of the Brahmanical tradition, sometime before the sixth-century bce. Thus, as a relatively late arriver, Buddhism accepted, tacitly, many of the given forms of social praxis in India. And, even when Buddhism sought to redefine religious goals and family values, these efforts were manifested vis-a-vis patterns that had already been in place for centuries. In short, whatever the exact historical reasons, one will look in vain for Buddhist spokespersons seeking to redo marriage law in India or in other Asian countries.” <sup id="cite_ref-458" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-458">[458]</a></sup> The same probably applied to Thailand, where, by "1361, the 'Law of Husbands and Wives' allowed men to practice polygamy" <sup id="cite_ref-459" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-459">[459]</a></sup>.

If we take care of our own spiritual development, we render a service to others; and if we develop love towards others, we thereby also help ourselves. Accordingly, it is explicitly stated, someone who pursues the path of salvation only for his or her own benefit is to be censured, while the one who follows the path for one’s own benefit and for the benefit of others is to be commended (see AN 7:64).” <sup id="cite_ref-460" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-460">[460]</a></sup> “Three segments of the Noble Eightfold Path (3 - 5) are traditionally subsumed under the principle of morality (sila): ‘right speech’ (3), ‘right action’ (4) and ‘right livelihood’ (5). [...] ‘Right action’ is explained as abstaining from harming and killing sentient beings - including animals (!), and further as abstaining from ‘taking what is not given’ and from sexual misconduct, which means avoiding sexual relations with women who are still under the protection of their families, or with those who are married, betrothed, or celibate for religious reasons. From monks and nuns complete sexual abstention is demanded. ‘Right livelihood’ means abstaining from those sources of income which involve harming other beings: trading in weapons for instance, or trading in living beings, meat, intoxicants or poison; also included is the avoidance of fraud and avarice.” <sup id="cite_ref-461" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-461">[461]</a></sup>

Not only is the gift’s recipient benefited but also the gift’s donor - particularly from a Buddhist point of view, since through giving one counters attachment in its deep-seated form of greedy grasping, of not letting-go.” <sup id="cite_ref-462" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-462">[462]</a></sup></dd>

<p><b>Supernatural Enforcement of Morality</b>

<dl><dd>For this section, include any type of supernatural punishment or reward either in this lifetime (e.g., curses, good fortune) or in the afterlife (e.g., hell, reincarnation). This includes generalized impersonal punishment/reward (e.g., karma, mana) as well as punishment by specific supernatural beings. Include specific details of the nature and extent of punishment/reward in the description. Code “compound” moral actions (e.g., filial piety = kin + respect) in multiple categories as necessary.

<dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement against harm ♣ present ♥</b> “The heart of Buddhist spiritual life, whether lay or monastic, is puṇya (Pali puñña ). This term is usually translated as ‘merit’ and refers to certain significant kinds of action that are regarded as auspicious and potent deeds. Essentially, merit is good ‘karma’ ( karman/kamma)&nbsp;: wholesome ( kuśla/kusala ) deeds which plant seeds that bear fortunate and pleasant fruits, whether in this life or lives to come, and thereby create conditions for further meritorious action in the future. These are the kinds of action that conduce to the development of the qualities of the eightfold path. Moreover it is making merit that binds the lay and monastic communities together. The traditional ‘bases of merit’ are generosity (dāna), ethical conduct ( śīla/sīla ), and meditation ( bhāvanā ). [...]The practice of good conduct takes the form of commitment to the five precepts usually recited in conjunction with the three refuges: (1) to refrain from harming living creatures, (2) to refrain from taking what is not given, (3) to refrain from sexual misconduct, (4) to refrain from false speech, (5) to refrain from intoxicants that cause heedlessness (see pp. 170- 2). In addition the lay disciple may on special occasions (traditionally the full moon ‘observance’ days) or for longer periods take the eight precepts, replacing the third precept (refraining from sexual misconduct) with complete sexual abstinence and adding (6) refraining from eating after midday, (7) refraining from attending entertainments and using perfumes, etc., and (8) refraining from using luxurious beds.”<sup id="cite_ref-488" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-488">[488]</a></sup> “The nature of bad action is usually illustrated by reference to a list of the ten courses of unwholesome action ( karma/kamma-patha ) which consist of three bodily courses of action (taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct), four vocal courses of action (lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech, frivolous speech), and three mental courses of action (covetousness, ill-will, wrong view). [...] Essentially the psychological states that motivate the ten unwholesome courses of action- strong greed, hatred, and delusion -lead to rebirth in the unhappy destinies or ‘descents’: in a hell realm, as a hungry ghost, an animal, or a jealous god. In fact rather a precise correlation exists here: dominated by greed one becomes a hungry ghost, a class of beings ever discontent and anguished because of being unable to satisfy their greed; dominated by hatred one enters one of the hell realms where one suffers terrible pain; dominated by ignorance one becomes an animal ruled by the instincts of food and reproduction.” <sup id="cite_ref-489" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-489">[489]</a></sup></dd>

So, for example, in the very popular Sigālovāda Sutta (DN 31): Children should honour their parents, be grateful and support them when they are in need or grow old; parents should show their love to their children by teaching them virtue, training them for a profession and passing on their inheritance when it is due; [...] a husband should minister to his wife ‘by honouring her, by not disparaging her, by not being unfaithful to her, by giving authority to her, by providing her with adornments’. A wife will reciprocate ‘by properly organising her work, by being kind to the servants, by not being unfaithful, by protecting stores, and by being skilful and diligent in all she has to do’.” <sup id="cite_ref-498" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-498">[498]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement of in-group loyalty ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> “As mentioned before, the development of a loving mind towards all beings, whether friend or foe, is the aim of one of the meditative practices of early Buddhism (see above p. 53f ). In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsāric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f ). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21).” <sup id="cite_ref-499" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-499">[499]</a></sup> “[...] Buddhism maintained a fairly flexible posture vis-a-vis competing religions and never sought to require laity to identify themselves exclusively as Buddhist or to rely singularly on the Buddhist clergy for all their spiritual needs.” <sup id="cite_ref-500" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-500">[500]</a></sup></dd>

Some texts affirm that even killing in self-defence, or in defence of family or friends, is wrongful, and in general an attitude of non-resistance in the face of violence is commended. The commentary to the Dhammapada relates how on one occasion when the Buddha's kinsmen, the Sakyas, were under attack, they allowed themselves to be slaughtered rather than break the First Precept. Other examples in the Jātakas and elsewhere speak of princes and kings who renounced their thrones rather than resorting to violence to defend their kingdoms.” <sup id="cite_ref-502" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-502">[502]</a></sup></dd>

These are the kinds of action that conduce to the development of the qualities of the eightfold path. Moreover it is making merit that binds the lay and monastic communities together. The traditional ‘bases of merit’ are generosity (dāna), ethical conduct ( śīla/sīla ), and meditation ( bhāvanā ). [...]The practice of good conduct takes the form of commitment to the five precepts usually recited in conjunction with the three refuges: (1) to refrain from harming living creatures, (2) to refrain from taking what is not given, (3) to refrain from sexual misconduct, (4) to refrain from false speech, (5) to refrain from intoxicants that cause heedlessness (see pp. 170- 2). In addition the lay disciple may on special occasions (traditionally the full moon ‘observance’ days) or for longer periods take the eight precepts, replacing the third precept (refraining from sexual misconduct) with complete sexual abstinence and adding (6) refraining from eating after midday, (7) refraining from attending entertainments and using perfumes, etc., and (8) refraining from using luxurious beds.”<sup id="cite_ref-503" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-503">[503]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ other supernatural enforcement of piety ♣ present ♥</b> “In the cosmology set out above, karma functions as the elevator that takes people from one floor of the building to another. Good deeds result in an upward movement and bad deeds in a downward one. Karma is not a system of rewards and punishments meted out by God but a kind of natural law akin to the law of gravity. [...] Buddhists speak of good karma as ‘merit’ (puñña, Sanskrit: puṇya), and much effort is expended in acquiring it. Some picture it as a kind of spiritual capital-like money in a bank account-whereby credit is built up as the deposit on a heavenly rebirth. One of the best ways for a layman to earn merit is by supporting the order of monks. This can be done by placing food in the bowls of monks as they pass on their daily alms round, by providing robes for the monks, by listening to sermons and attending religious services, and by donating funds for the upkeep of monasteries and temples.” <sup id="cite_ref-504" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-504">[504]</a></sup></dd>

If we take care of our own spiritual development, we render a service to others; and if we develop love towards others, we thereby also help ourselves.

From monks and nuns complete sexual abstention is demanded. ‘Right livelihood’ means abstaining from those sources of income which involve harming other beings: trading in weapons for instance, or trading in living beings, meat, intoxicants or poison; also included is the avoidance of fraud and avarice.” <sup id="cite_ref-507" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-507">[507]</a></sup> "Under this theory, the main purpose of kingship was to assist the people to ascend the spiritual ladder towards the ultimate goal of nirvana, the release from worldly suffering.

<p><b>♠ Famine relief ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Thailand was known as the ‘granary of Asia’. Families stored food in rice barns (yung khao), wooden buildings that were usually raised on stilts. In the south, paddy was often stored in a room inside the house. A traditional duty of the king was to encourage agriculture, through direct and indirect measures, to prevent famine occurring. He would initiate the growing season by ploughing a ceremonial furrow for the gods. But no system in place for famine relief set up by the state. <sup id="cite_ref-535" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-535">[535]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-536" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-536">[536]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-537" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-537">[537]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-538" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-538">[538]</a></sup>
