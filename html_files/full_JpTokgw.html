<dl><dd>The Tokugawa period, also known as the Edo period, ran from 1603 to 1868 CE. Sometimes the slightly earlier start date of 1600 is chosen in recognition of Tokugawa Ieyasu's decisive victory at the Battle of Sekigahara; however, we have selected the 1603 date, which marks his official appointment as shogun. Although the emperor remained the official head of state, the Tokugawa shoguns ruled Japan. The rise to power of the Tokugawa Shogunate marked an end to the internal strife and warfare that had characterized the preceding century. Tokugawa Ieyasu and his immediate successors set about limiting the power of their rivals and instituting new policies aimed at maintaining stability and centralizing Japan's government.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The 'peak' of the Tokugawa period corresponds to the years between 1688 and 1704 CE, known as the Genroku period, which saw the development of a distinct urban culture and the proliferation of art, theatre and fiction.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> During the early modern period the Japanese polity consisted of three major islands: Honshu, Kyushu and Shikoku.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Eventually, economic difficulties and the threat of Western encroachment helped to bring about the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate.

<p><i>Population and political organization</i>
</p>
<dl><dd>The Tokugawa shogunate built on the work of the generals Oda Nobunaga (1534-1582 CE) and Toyotomi Hideyoshi (1536-1598 CE), who between 1568 and 1590 succeeded in uniting all the daimyō (local military lords) under the command of a military leader into a 'national confederation'.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> Theoretically, the daimyō maintained administrative authority in their own territories, but in practice they were expected to follow the guidance of the shogunate.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> Tokugawa Ieyasu and his successors pursued a policy of 'orthodoxy and stability',<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> aimed at consolidating their own power and limiting the ability of their rivals to amass enough power or wealth to enable them to challenge the shogunate. The success of these policies enabled the Tokugawa family to preside over a period of peace and prosperity and rule Japan for the next 268 years.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> As well as peace, political stability and the centralization of power by the shoguns, the Tokugawa period was characterized by economic prosperity, rising urbanization and the closings of Japan's borders to the wider world in the 1630s.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Theoretically, class was determined by birth and social mobility was prohibited. Influenced by Chinese models, the social order was formalized and essentially frozen in a hierarchy known as <i>shi-nō-kō-shō</i>, 'warrior-peasant-artisan-merchant'.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> Despite the shogunate's concerted attempts to maintain a strict social orthodoxy, however, the stable and economically prosperous conditions led to a range of social changes, including increasing urbanization and the rise of the merchant class, who (although they were theoretically socially inferior) now held much of the country's wealth.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> Now that there was no need for the majority of those of samurai rank to be actively engaged in military activities, the warrior class became bureaucratized, a development that went hand-in-hand with a romanticization of the warrior ideal and the codification of proper rules of behaviour.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>During the Tokugawa period, population censuses were carried out. However, they did not take all members of the population into account and various scholars have therefore used supplementary data to produce what they hope are more accurate estimates.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> Estimates for the beginning of the period (1600 CE) range from around 15<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> to 22<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> million.

<p><b>♠ Administrative levels ♣ [6-8] ♥</b>
</p><p>'For the nearly 700-year span of Japan’s medieval and early modern periods, warriors-with varying levels of effectiveness and hegemony-ruled the country. Although the fortunes of particular extended warrior families waxed and waned, only members of the warrior class could serve as shoguns, the military rulers. Their governments, known commonly as shogunates, were often challenged by the interests of other powerful warrior families in various parts of Japan and by the imperial family in Kyoto. Although the warrior bureaucracy largely controlled the affairs of the state, the emperor and the imperial court were still the formal head of government. Warrior governments typically sought out- or forced-the formal imperial decrees that gave legitimacy to the shoguns. Occasionally emperors would attempt to reassert direct imperial rule. They were, however, always suppressed in favor of warrior rule... Warrior governments functioned as a lord-vassal system of loyalty. This is reflected in the political structures of the different shogunates. Although they varied greatly in their organization, the notion of loyalty, whether earned or forced, always laid the foundation on which the warrior government was built.'<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup> List derived from  ‘Administrative Structure of the Tokugawa Shogunate’.<sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup> ‘The neat table of organization charts of the Edo bakufu, which list upwards of four hundred posts in chain-of-command order, mask the problems of competition for control of policy and enforcement authority that plagued Edo bakufu politics.’ <sup id="cite_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup>

Military houses were controlled by the enforcement of the status quo, down to the fine detail.’  The Tokugawa shogunate brought in strict codes of behaviour and enforced punishment for their breaking.

Cremation spread to Japan from China and Korea and was practiced by the general populace in the Kamakura and Muromachi periods. Confucianism, however, advised against cremation and advocated coffin burial (taiso) instead.

The use of this measure of time began in the seventh century. The change of emperor included a change in era name. However, in the early modern period, the nengo did not simply represent the duration of a governmental regime. New era names might be declared when auspicious events occurred or at certain points in the traditional 60- year (sexagenary) calendar cycle...

Warrior literature was not replaced, but early modern literature is notable for its articulation of the interests and concerns of merchants, artisans, and other nonelite members of early modern society.... Because of the contact with the Dutch, the Dutch language became the medium through which new Western scientific and medical knowledge were disseminated. Translations of Dutch scientific and medical books into Japanese led to the advancement of Japanese scientific thinking and opened up whole new ways to think about the natural world, including anatomy, astronomy, and geography.’<sup id="cite_ref-141" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-141">[141]</a></sup></dd></dl>

</p><p><b>Description of the Ritual System</b>
</p>
<dl><dd>‘Japanese religious traditions consist of both indigenous and borrowed religions. Shinto, the “way of the kami (gods),” is the term used to describe Japan’s indigenous tradition, although Shinto as an organized tradition with common doctrines and practices probably dates back no further than the medieval period.’ <sup id="cite_ref-241" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-241">[241]</a></sup> ‘The foreign traditions of Buddhism and Christianity impacted Japan during the medieval and early modern periods. Buddhism was introduced to Japan in the sixth century from the Asian mainland and quickly became the religion of the aristocrats and the imperial family, thus assuming political significance. It was not until Japan’s medieval period that Buddhism became broadly diffused throughout Japanese society.’ <sup id="cite_ref-242" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-242">[242]</a></sup> ‘Although individual Japanese religions can be discussed, it is important to bear in mind that in many periods of Japanese history—including the medieval and early modern—distinctions between traditions were not very sharply drawn. This was true both in terms of a person’s worship and in terms of Japanese culture more generally.’ <sup id="cite_ref-243" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-243">[243]</a></sup> ‘in medieval and early modern Japan, practice was far more central to religious identity than was any profession of faith.’ <sup id="cite_ref-244" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-244">[244]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>‘Religious rituals, though directed to numerous different ends, were often intended for life cycle events such as birth, marriage, and death. Religion was often intimately connected to the everyday, rather than directed beyond daily life. Festivals, too, celebrated various key events in the life of a community. Festivals were held in celebration of the harvest, the New Year, and to honor the spirits of the dead. Both rituals and festivals were methods of personal purification, showing appreciation for the fertility of the land, making offerings to honor the gods, Buddhas, and ancestors, requesting help in troubled times, and seeking the welfare of the community.’ <sup id="cite_ref-245" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-245">[245]</a></sup> ‘in medieval and early modern Japan, a very close connection between religion and the state was deemed both proper and necessary. Though there are exceptions, religion was often treated as ancillary to politics. Used to create national identity, religion served the nation as a means of providing legitimacy for political arrangements current at any given time. Japan’s national myth, that Japan was created from the sacred acts of the kami whose descendants form the imperial line, is one such use of religion to justify political power. <sup id="cite_ref-246" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-246">[246]</a></sup></dd>
<dd> ‘Annual observances celebrated at the imperial court beginning in the Heian period (794-1185[CE]) differed radically from those held in farm villages. Whereas court ceremonies derived in large part from Chinese customs, village rituals tended to be indigenous and related to rice agriculture.’ <sup id="cite_ref-247" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-247">[247]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p><b>Shinto</b>
</p>
<dl><dd>‘Unlike many religions, Shinto has no founder and does not view any single text as its sole scripture. Shinto is closely associated with the Japanese sense of cultural identity. Shinto emphasizes practice over thought or formal doctrine. There is not a formal Shinto theology or rigidly codified set of moral rules. Shinto is intimately connected with the agricultural cycle and a sense of the sacredness of the natural world. The worship of kami and other ritual practices express these concerns... Ritual practice is central to Shinto traditions and includes such activities as purification, food  offerings, dance, and festivals honoring the gods. While kami may be worshipped at shrines under the supervision of Shinto priests (kannushi), they can also be worshipped individually at a shrine or in the home. Further, Shinto associations (ko) provide yet another avenue for interaction with the kami.’ <sup id="cite_ref-248" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-248">[248]</a></sup> ‘On the one hand, Shinto describes an organized set of doctrines and practices related to the state. This perspective on Shinto is strongly tied to the mythology and founding stories of the imperial family, especially as expressed in theKojiki (Record of ancient matters, compiled in 712). Shinto was important to the legitimating narratives by which the imperial family justified its right to rule. This aspect of Shinto was conspicuous for the rituals performed expressing the intimate connection between emperor and kami.’<sup id="cite_ref-249" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-249">[249]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>‘But it was only during the period under consideration [Tokugawa] that religion came to penetrate the lives of the general populace, not just as a primitive faith, but also as a system of beliefs that had undergone considerable intellectual refinement while sustained by the teachings and rituals of Buddhism and Shinto. The same period saw the establishment of a common religious institution throughout the country. And it is the spread of a common pattern of religious practice both geographically and socially that can be cited as evidence of the establishment of a national religion.’ <sup id="cite_ref-250" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-250">[250]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p><b> Buddhism</b>
</p>
<dl><dd>'Buddhism originated in India and spread to China about four centuries after the time of the historical Buddha Sakyamuni (ca. fifth to fourth century, B.C.). It was transmitted to Japan from China via the Korean peninsula around the middle of the sixth century.1 The cultural gulf that existed at that time between Japan on the one hand and China and Korea on the other was considerable. Japan's ruling class accepted Buddhism as the embodiment of an advanced and superior civilization, and in order to gain control over the concepts and technology that Buddhism brought to Japan, the elite provided a succession of large temples where Buddhism could put down roots.'<sup id="cite_ref-251" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-251">[251]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>'it was in the Kamakura period that Buddhism in Japan came into full flower. The forms of Buddhism that emerged at that time - Pure Land, Zen, and Nichiren - were largely responsible for the dissemination of Buddhist beliefs and practices throughout Japanese society. The success of this movement lay in tailoring the ideas and goals of Buddhism to the concerns of the populace at large. Hence, Kamakura Buddhism, as the entire religious movement is called, has left an indelible mark on Japanese history and has made Buddhism a lasting and pervasive component of Japanese culture.' <sup id="cite_ref-252" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-252">[252]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>'From the end of the twelfth century through the middle of the thirteenth - that is, in the first half of the Kamakura period - some of Japan's foremost religious figures appeared, in quick succession. The schools of Buddhism that today claim them as their founders have long had considerable influence in Japan. From their inception in the Kamakura period, these schools stood as a separate religious movement from the eight schools that existed before them. These new schools came to be known collectively as Kamakura Buddhism. The establishment of Kamakura Buddhism was a pivotal event in Japanese history, because through it Buddhism was adapted to Japanese ways and thus made accessible to the common people.' <sup id="cite_ref-253" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-253">[253]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>'The various groups that arose out of Kamakura Buddhism generated formal religious organizations during the Muromachi period. From that time on, they have been the most powerful schools of Buddhism in Japan. In reflecting on their origins, all of these schools hark back to the Kamakura period as their institutional starting point, and they claim a continuous and unbroken existence since that time.' <sup id="cite_ref-254" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-254">[254]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Okage-mairi ♥</b> Pilgrimage to the Great Shrine at Ise was extremely popular in the Tokugawa era. "Divine retribution (shinbatsu) also preserved the religious decorum of the pilgrimage. While the roads leading to Ise were often a bedlam of noise and confusion, once the pilgrims reached the precincts of the Grand Shrine, silence reigned. In 1830, however, a group of pilgrims from Omi created a scene in front of the shrines, singing in loud voices and hurling insults at one another. When they refused to heed the warnings of the officials at the shrine, their leader suffered a mysterious seizure and fell to the ground. When the others saw this, they turned pale and ran off. Thus traditional respect for the shrines was maintained in the midst of what otherwise might have become an unholy uproar." <sup id="cite_ref-255" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-255">[255]</a></sup> It is not entirely clear which rituals, exactly, were carried out at the shrine once it was reached by the pilgrimage, but the following may be relevant. "Should you visit a shrine for the first time and happen upon a ritual in progress within the Hall of Worship, the following four movements will help you structure the flow of what transpires in most contemporary Shinto ritual events: "1. Purification: Whether it consists of simply rinsing the hands and mouth with water or with waving a wand of white paper streamers in the air over the heads of priests, trays of offerings, or that gleaming new car brought to the shrine for blessing, the first step is the preparation essential for making the environment and the individuals within it ready to petition, receive, and entertain the Kami’s presence. "2. Presentations: As one kneels upon the tatami within the Hall of Worship, one sees a high table laden with various kinds of fruit, vegetables, seaweed, and rice cakes, which surround the core offerings of uncooked rice grains, salt, water, and two bottles of sake. Whether the observance is merely for the benefit of one person or aspires to the good of the entire nation, the core offerings to the Kami are part of every shrine ritual. Sometimes simple, sometimes including over one hundred styles of food at the Grand Shrine of Ise, it is safe to say that a ritual without food offerings is unthinkable in Shinto practice. "3. Petitions: Scholars have debated whether the food offerings or the formal prayers are more important, but ask any chief priest and he will immediately answer that the norito, or ‘words spoken to the Kami,’ are the main part of any ritual. Beautiful, correct words, intoned with reverence and awe, bring about good influences. This is one of the oldest attitudes of Japanese religious practices (or of any ritualized system of practices, including Catholic and Hindu), deriving from an ancient belief in kotodama, a spiritual power residing in words. [...] "4. Participation: After the long droning chant of the prayer, the miko commence a slow circular movement before the main altar, which marks the beginning of the last phase of the ritual. Upon completion of this sacred entertainment, the opportunity for participation is often extended to everyone in attendance when leafy sprigs from the sacred sakaki tree (native only to Japan) are distributed. Each person follows the example of the head priest in slowly coming forward, bowing, amd then placing the little branch on a small table as a means of linking the individual to the divine. After the actual service is over and the priests have filed out of the hall, the partaking of a small sip of rice wine, called o-miki, further invests the worshipper with the blessings of the Kami." <sup id="cite_ref-256" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-256">[256]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ matsuri ♥</b> NOTE: Though normally Seshat policy is to code a specific ritual rather than a "type" of ritual, it does not seem that a particular one of the traditional Japanese festivals was more widespread than the others. Of course, following consultation with experts, it may turn out that one matsuri was indeed significantly more euphoric than the others--but, even then, the data gathered below should still be useful. "Ceremonies in monasteries and shrines generally attracted enormous crowds. It was an opportunity for setting up market and, for the folk of the surrounding countryside, to come and amuse themselves. [...] A motley and picturesque crowd gathered within the temple precincts on feast days: blind <i>biwa</i> players, troubadours, showmen with monkeys and trained animals, puppeteers, magicians, jugglers, mountebanks, acrobats, singers and dancers, wandering monks explaining the meaning of holy images or preaching, the faithful playing in loud voices and striking gongs hanging on their breasts. [...] After every ceremony there were usually performances of <i>dengaku</i> and many kinds of dances, religious otherwise, staged by monks, by <i>chigo</i> or by men from neighbouring villages, competitions of 'linked' verse or <i>renga</i>, a variety of entertainments in the course of which artists in white and red costumes, both men and women, delighted the crowds in a myriad ways. [...] Sometimes the crowd was so dense that, to better enjoy the sights, people perched themselves on walls, roofs and branches of trees." <sup id="cite_ref-285" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-285">[285]</a></sup> For a better sense of the more properly ritual phase of these occasions, the following is a description of a generic matsuri. Even though this quote refers to the way the ritual is performed in modern-day Japan, another source, Nelson <sup id="cite_ref-286" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-286">[286]</a></sup>, that "[t]he rituals that can be observed today at any major shrine are, according to many priests, fairly continuous with those of the Heian period, which is thought of as an idealized or ‘golden’ age of Shinto." "Festivals follow a basic sequence of events to which local communities add particular activities (described subsequently) and a touch of local color depending upon the occasion. No matter the festival and no matter the place, the fundamental sequence of events follows a tripartite structure: the invocation of the kami, the offerings to the kami, and the final communion with the kami. "Invocation of the Kami. This part consists of inviting the kami in proper fashion to visit and meet the people. The shrine is specially cleaned and the priests undergo purification before commencing any activities. "Shubatsu. The priests in full ceremonial dress purify themselves in order to take part in the rituals. The inner building (honden) of the shrine complex is opened up and the goshintai viewed by the priests. This is performed after purification and is a ritual conducted entirely by the priests themselves, with no lay witnesses present. [...] Thereafter, the people taking part in the festival are purified so that the kami may be ceremonially invoked and invited to come to the shrine. "Opening of the Gate. Along with the participating leading laymen in robes of state, the priests form a procession that moves down the sando, the approach road to the shrine, to meet the kami at the appointed place. Here the duly appointed laypersons become responsible for transporting the kami into the shrine and throughout the community. The kami may be borne in a mikoshi. The meeting is effected; and the kami usually accompanies the procession to the shrine building, where the most sacred place is opened. The community follows the procession to the shrine, each group having assembled in its locality bearing the kami to the shrine. When everyone is assembled within the shrine grounds, the next stage of the festival can commence. "Offerings to the Kami. The kami is welcomed to the community and by the community, and then offerings are made. The offerings and order of events are as follows: "Shinsen. The offerings usually placed on the altar are rice, salt, water, rice wine (sake), rice cakes (omochi), fish (usually tai sea bream), seaweed (konbu), vegetables, grain, and fruit. [...] "Aisatsu (Greetings). The chief priest (Guji) delivers an address of welcome. "Gifts are presented to the kami from the parishioners. These usually include flowers, money in special envelopes, food in rice bags, and sake in special drums called taru. These are usually on display in the public building of the shrine. "Entertainment: Music and Dance, and Martial Arts. Classic forms of entertainment have long been associated with shrine festivals. [...] "Removal of the Shinsen. The offerings are removed from the altar and taken away for various uses. [...] "Closing of the gate. The main events involving the priests conclude with the closing of the gate and the consequent closing of the inner sanctum. The priests have finished their work, and there remains only the sacramental act of drinking sake with the kami to bring everything to an end. "Communion with the Kami (Neorai). Casks of sake are broken open and drunk from a wooden masu, a square cup made of Japanese cypress. [...] This aspect of the festival is peculiar also to Japan--social drinking as a religious act to commune with the kami in addition to the ritual use of sake. This happens after any major festival and often turns into a party with the organizers, the High Priest, and other priests present. The naorai is held not only after festivals but after misogi or other shrine rituals and activities. It is typical of the Shinto approach to life and the kami, one of celebration in a festive mood. Communion with the kami also enriches the communion of the people among themselves. "Chinkon (Calming of the Soul). This is a form of silent meditation within the shrine precincts at the close of major rituals (sometimes including festivals) when people reflect upon the significance of what they have been doing. They try to both conserve and draw from the experience they have had while performing the rituals. Chinkon takes place after the misogi rituals but before the naorai. Although it is a Shinto concept, it was popularized by Buddhism during the Heian period [...]" <sup id="cite_ref-287" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-287">[287]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ daily worship ♥</b> "What is so fascinating about Japanese culture and society is that even as it approaches the twenty-first century, many of its important ritual practices resemble in structure and expression those dating to the Heian period (794-1192 C.E.)." <sup id="cite_ref-330" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-330">[330]</a></sup> "The rituals that can be observed today at any major shrine are, according to many priests, fairly continuous with those of the Heian period, which is thought of as an idealized or ‘golden’ age of Shinto. [...] It must be added, however, that few of the ‘old rituals’ survived intact after the Meiji government’s radical revamping and restructuring of Shinto so that it could serve as a national creed (see Hardacre 1989)." <sup id="cite_ref-331" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-331">[331]</a></sup> "In large shrines, the routine and rituals of the day are fixed throughout the year; whether or not visitors come to the shrine, these are followed. [...] At [8 a.m. every morning] the act of morning worship (<i>cho-hai</i>) takes place, involving all the shrine priests and staff. The <i>norito</i> is recited, the staff purified for the day, and announcements made about the day's events and duties." <sup id="cite_ref-332" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-332">[332]</a></sup> "Should you visit a shrine for the first time and happen upon a ritual in progress within the Hall of Worship, the following four movements will help you structure the flow of what transpires in most contemporary Shinto ritual events: "1. Purification: Whether it consists of simply rinsing the hands and mouth with water or with waving a wand of white paper streamers in the air over the heads of priests, trays of offerings, or that gleaming new car brought to the shrine for blessing, the first step is the preparation essential for making the environment and the individuals within it ready to petition, receive, and entertain the Kami’s presence. "2. Presentations: As one kneels upon the tatami within the Hall of Worship, one sees a high table laden with various kinds of fruit, vegetables, seaweed, and rice cakes, which surround the core offerings of uncooked rice grains, salt, water, and two bottles of sake. Whether the observance is merely for the benefit of one person or aspires to the good of the entire nation, the core offerings to the Kami are part of every shrine ritual. Sometimes simple, sometimes including over one hundred styles of food at the Grand Shrine of Ise, it is safe to say that a ritual without food offerings is unthinkable in Shinto practice. "3. Petitions: Scholars have debated whether the food offerings or the formal prayers are more important, but ask any chief priest and he will immediately answer that the norito, or ‘words spoken to the Kami,’ are the main part of any ritual. Beautiful, correct words, intoned with reverence and awe, bring about good influences. This is one of the oldest attitudes of Japanese religious practices (or of any ritualized system of practices, including Catholic and Hindu), deriving from an ancient belief in kotodama, a spiritual power residing in words. [...] "4. Participation: After the long droning chant of the prayer, the miko commence a slow circular movement before the main altar, which marks the beginning of the last phase of the ritual. Upon completion of this sacred entertainment, the opportunity for participation is often extended to everyone in attendance when leafy sprigs from the sacred sakaki tree (native only to Japan) are distributed. Each person follows the example of the head priest in slowly coming forward, bowing, amd then placing the little branch on a small table as a means of linking the individual to the divine. After the actual service is over and the priests have filed out of the hall, the partaking of a small sip of rice wine, called o-miki, further invests the worshipper with the blessings of the Kami." <sup id="cite_ref-333" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-333">[333]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Ise-odori ♥</b> Ise-odori is the name given to ecstatic dances performed in association with the great Okage-mairi pilgrimage to the grand Shrine of Ise, which occurred every 60 years. "Dancers carrying open umbrellas were accompanied by gongs, bells, shamisens, and drums. Enormous amounts of money were spent on fanciful costumes, elaborate ornaments, and banners made out of velvet, damask, and other expensive materials. One source tells us that the Ise-odori resembled the dances of the <i>gannin-bozu</i>, lower-class mendicant priests who went about reciting ballads, riddles, or nonsense sutras for a small handout. Geishas from the cities were sometimes hired by community leaders to teach the dances to the country folk. On the Tokaido roads, most of the dancers were underlings and servants attached to the post stations. The dancing that broke out in Yamato was largely confined to young men and women in their late teens. Many of these dances--ecstatic as they might have been--were methodically organized by community leaders. When this was the case, participation often became mandatory. Usually, rich farmers and merchants were expected to pick up the tab. In Itami, dances were carefully rehearsed and then performed before local shrines. After that, the dancers went throughout the entire region performing in a total of thirty-eight other communities. Dance contests (<i>odori-sumo</i>) were also held between villages." <sup id="cite_ref-368" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-368">[368]</a></sup> "The <i>okage-mairi</i> was accompanied by ecstatic dances, such as <i>Ise-odori</i>, <i>okage-odori</i> and <i>ee-ja-nai-ka</i> (ain't it hunky-dory) that disrupted daily life and work for long periods. Those dances were reminiscent of carnivals, since they were combined with elaborate ornaments and fanciful costumes made of expensive materials.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ keppan kishomon ♥</b> “The ryu, quasi-military organizations, were well aware of the power of such loyalty, and aware, too, of the power of ritual to ensure it. Therefore, most martial traditions had an oath (kishomon) sealed in blood (keppan), in which the prospective member made certain promises. Some schools required keppan upon entry, some after a probationary period, and some near the end of one’s training when one was about to receive licensure. [...] Let us consider such an oath, that of Araki-ryu: There is really no need for a wider sampling because such oaths, in the Edo period, had to take into consideration the laws of the realm, and so they all read rather similarly. ‘Araki-ryu Kishomon Mae Gaki no Koto/Introductory Vow Before Study: (1) What you do within Araki-ryu must be shown to no one: not even your parents, your brother, nor your family; (2) You must not engage in fights or even sparring with thos of other ryu, not even with your associate students; (3) You must never be rude nor without propriety at the place of practice, nor should you ever lose yourself in drink; (4) Without having received the secrets of kachimi from your teacher, you must never teach anyone; (5) You must not use the logic of Araki-ryu to criticize other ryu; (6) You must hold no evil thoughts towards your teacher. This vow is made to the deities Boten Taishakuten Shidaitenno narabi. Dai Nihon Kokuchu Rokuju yo shu Daisho Jingi, and especially Izu Hakone ryosho gongen, Mishima daimyojin, Hachiman daijin, Tenman Daijizai daijin, burui kenzoku, shin-batsu myobatsu kaku makari koburu baki mono nari. You will be cursed in heaven and earth if you break this vow.’ [...] One seals this with one’s blood, inviting punishment at any breaking of the vow. Betraying the promises inherent in the kishomon is a betrayal not only of the teacher/student relationship, but much larger, a betrayal of the ryu: one’s fellow trainees in the microcosm and macrocosm, the generations of teachers and students who passed this on to the student in the present day.” <sup id="cite_ref-405" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-405">[405]</a></sup></dd>

<p><b>♠ RA ♣ Enrico Cioni ♥</b>
</p><p><b>♠ Expert ♣ ♥</b>
</p><p><b>Description of the Normative Ideology</b>
</p><p>"By the Edo period, Neo-Confucian thought had become a significant influence on many aspects ofJapanese culture, including political, moral, and family life. Chinese Neo-Confucianism was an elaboration on earlier Confucian thought. [...]
</p><p>"Confucianism posits the possibility of a harmonious society based on five human relationships: between lord and subject, father and son, husband and wife, older (brother) and younger (brother), and friend and friend (the only one characterized by mutuality). In each relationship, the former is superior and the latter subordinate, just as heaven (that is, the natural laws of the universe) is superior and Earth is subordinate. This was a rigid structure whereby one was always embedded in an ever-shifting set of unequal, hierarchical relations. Sometimes one was in the superior position, and sometimes in the subordinate position:the emperor is superior to his subjects; a child is subordinate to a parent. For Confucius, harmony exists in the world when people act in the appropriate manner given whatever hierarchical relationship they currently find themselves in. This hierarchy shifts from moment to moment as one goes in and out of different social situations. For Confucius, these relationships and their correct enactment formed the basis of morality and a harmonious society.
</p><p>"[...]
</p><p>"In the Edo period, Neo-Confucianism was used, in part, to legitimize the workings of the state and government policies. It was patronized by the Tokugawa shogunate and the daimyo and became the prevailing ethical and philosophical doctrine adopted by the Edo government. Neo-Confucian scholars equated the moral and rational force in society and politics with the cosmos and its natural harmony. The government also officially patronized Neo-Confucian teachings because they provided the guidelines with which to maintain political order and stability. To preserve the utmost control, the shogunate promoted only one orthodox school of Neo-Confucianism, the Zhu Xi (Chu Hsi) school (see below), and banned all others as heterodox teachings.
</p><p>"Under the Tokugawa shogunate, the five relationships formed the basis of a strict system imposed on every aspect of society, while the educational system became saturated with Neo-Confucian moral and political ideas. By explicitly delineating every social relationship, from the elite rulers to the common people, a bureaucratic system was set in place that promised, in the ideal,a fair and just administration of government, and loyalty from the people in return. Not surprisingly this articulation of the relationship between ruler and ruled often failed to match the ideal." <sup id="cite_ref-474" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-474">[474]</a></sup>
</p><p>"In the early modern period, Shinto instead of encompassing Buddhism, entered into dialogue with Neo-Confucianism. By this time,Neo-Confucian ideas had become quite important as a way of thinking about ethics and political philosophy. Rather than blend or fuse Shinto with Buddhism some Edo-period Shinto figures reconsidered Shinto in light of Neo-Confucian ideas. In the same way that Shinto and Buddhism had been blended so Neo- Confucian ideas were combined with Shinto ones." <sup id="cite_ref-475" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-475">[475]</a></sup>
</p><p>"The role of Buddhism in Edo-period Japan became much more complex than it had been in earlier periods. It was a period in which Buddhism’s primacy as the main way of thinking about the world was challenged by new Shinto movements as well as by the influence of Neo-Confucian ideas onJapanese ways of thinking. Although Japanese Buddhism always had connections to the state and political interests, these associations became quite explicit during the Edo period. In the early 17th century, the Tokugawa shogunate prohibited the teaching of Christianity and later banned nearly all foreign contacts in Japan for fear of the power of the Christian movement.
</p><p>"The government utilized Buddhism as a way to oversee this ban and to enforce its isolationist policies. One way this was accomplished was by forcing Japanese Christians to renounce their Christianity. Buddhist temples were made into bureaucratic offices of the shogunate by the system of shumon aratame, or examination of religious affiliation. This system - called the danka (parishioner) system - required every Japanese family to become registered members of a local temple and to receive a certificate to the effect that they were not Christian. Temples were required to provide this information to the local lord. As the danka system developed other obligatory activities were instituted such as financial support to temples, annual visits to ancestral graves located on temple grounds, and attendance at important temple rituals. In this way Buddhist temples became overseers of the religious lives of its patrons." <sup id="cite_ref-476" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-476">[476]</a></sup>

</p><p><b>♠ Rulers are descendants of gods ♣ present ♥</b> "The Kojiki, Japan’s earliest extant written text, recounts the story of the creation of the Japanese islands by Izanagi and Izanani (both brother and sister and husband and wife). It tells the story of the birth of the kami, especially the birth of Amaterasu, the sun goddess, from whom the Japanese imperial family - and by extension the Japanese people - are descended. The narrative tells of how Ninigi no Mikoto, grandson of Amaterasu Omikami, was sent to establish sovereignty over the Japanese islands. It was Ninigi’s great grandson, Jimmu, who became, according to the narrative, the first emperor of Japan. All Japanese emperors are said to descend from this sacred line beginning with Amaterasu. The three regalia - mirror, sword, and jewel - the symbols of imperial ruling authority, are said to have originated with Amaterasu who started the tradition of passing these symbols to each subsequent ruler. In the medieval and early modern periods (in fact, up until 1945), this Kojiki narrative was used to argue the legitimacy of the imperial family as rightful rulers." <sup id="cite_ref-477" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-477">[477]</a></sup> The Emperor had and was considered a living embodiment of a divine ancestor: the sun goddess Amaterasu Ōmikami. Like his daimyo the Shogun also wished to be known as a benevolent ruler (jinkun). This was first based on Buddhist ideas of compassion (jihi) then increasingly the neo-Confucian precepts of benevolent government (jinsi). Christians could play no role in this ideological structure which completely idealised kōdō, or the Way of the Emperor.  Christianity was essentially outlawed and Iemitsu (r. 1623-1651 CE) went as far as to impose extreme restrictions on foreign trade that lasted until 1853 CE.  <sup id="cite_ref-478" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-478">[478]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-479" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-479">[479]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-480" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-480">[480]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-481" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-481">[481]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-482" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-482">[482]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-483" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-483">[483]</a></sup>

Thus, as a relatively late arriver, Buddhism accepted, tacitly, many of the given forms of social praxis in India. And, even when Buddhism sought to redefine religious goals and family values, these efforts were manifested vis-a-vis patterns that had already been in place for centuries.

<dl><dd><b>♠ supernatural enforcement against harm ♣ present ♥</b> In the syncretic Shinto-Buddhist ideology that prevailed for many centuries in Japan, moral values mostly came from Buddhism: “Shinto was retained in the Japanese belief structure, even though it never developed the metaphysical worldview or system of ethics that characterize world religions. Perhaps this was because of its close connection with Japanese Buddhism, which had enough metaphysics and ethics to serve both.” <sup id="cite_ref-567" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-567">[567]</a></sup>  According to Buddhism: “The heart of Buddhist spiritual life, whether lay or monastic, is puṇya (Pali puñña ). This term is usually translated as ‘merit’ and refers to certain significant kinds of action that are regarded as auspicious and potent deeds. Essentially, merit is good ‘karma’ ( karman/kamma)&nbsp;: wholesome ( kuśla/kusala ) deeds which plant seeds that bear fortunate and pleasant fruits, whether in this life or lives to come, and thereby create conditions for further meritorious action in the future. These are the kinds of action that conduce to the development of the qualities of the eightfold path. Moreover it is making merit that binds the lay and monastic communities together. The traditional ‘bases of merit’ are generosity (dāna), ethical conduct ( śīla/sīla ), and meditation ( bhāvanā ). [...]The practice of good conduct takes the form of commitment to the five precepts usually recited in conjunction with the three refuges: (1) to refrain from harming living creatures, (2) to refrain from taking what is not given, (3) to refrain from sexual misconduct, (4) to refrain from false speech, (5) to refrain from intoxicants that cause heedlessness (see pp. 170- 2). In addition the lay disciple may on special occasions (traditionally the full moon ‘observance’ days) or for longer periods take the eight precepts, replacing the third precept (refraining from sexual misconduct) with complete sexual abstinence and adding (6) refraining from eating after midday, (7) refraining from attending entertainments and using perfumes, etc., and (8) refraining from using luxurious beds.”<sup id="cite_ref-568" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-568">[568]</a></sup> “The nature of bad action is usually illustrated by reference to a list of the ten courses of unwholesome action ( karma/kamma-patha ) which consist of three bodily courses of action (taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct), four vocal courses of action (lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech, frivolous speech), and three mental courses of action (covetousness, ill-will, wrong view). [...] Essentially the psychological states that motivate the ten unwholesome courses of action— strong greed, hatred, and delusion —lead to rebirth in the unhappy destinies or ‘descents’: in a hell realm, as a hungry ghost, an animal, or a jealous god. In fact rather a precise correlation exists here: dominated by greed one becomes a hungry ghost, a class of beings ever discontent and anguished because of being unable to satisfy their greed; dominated by hatred one enters one of the hell realms where one suffers terrible pain; dominated by ignorance one becomes an animal ruled by the instincts of food and reproduction.” <sup id="cite_ref-569" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-569">[569]</a></sup></dd>

Perhaps this was because of its close connection with Japanese Buddhism, which had enough metaphysics and ethics to serve both.” <sup id="cite_ref-570" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-570">[570]</a></sup>  According to Buddhism: “In the cosmology set out above, karma functions as the elevator that takes people from one floor of the building to another. Good deeds result in an upward movement and bad deeds in a downward one. Karma is not a system of rewards and punishments meted out by God but a kind of natural law akin to the law of gravity. [...] Buddhists speak of good karma as ‘merit’ (puñña, Sanskrit: puṇya), and much effort is expended in acquiring it. Some picture it as a kind of spiritual capital—like money in a bank account—whereby credit is built up as the deposit on a heavenly rebirth. One of the best ways for a layman to earn merit is by supporting the order of monks. This can be done by placing food in the bowls of monks as they pass on their daily alms round, by providing robes for the monks, by listening to sermons and attending religious services, and by donating funds for the upkeep of monasteries and temples.” <sup id="cite_ref-571" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-571">[571]</a></sup>  “The nature of bad action is usually illustrated by reference to a list of the ten courses of unwholesome action ( karma/kamma-patha ) which consist of three bodily courses of action (taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct), four vocal courses of action (lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech, frivolous speech), and three mental courses of action (covetousness, ill-will, wrong view).

[...] Essentially the psychological states that motivate the ten unwholesome courses of action— strong greed, hatred, and delusion —lead to rebirth in the unhappy destinies or ‘descents’: in a hell realm, as a hungry ghost, an animal, or a jealous god. In fact rather a precise correlation exists here: dominated by greed one becomes a hungry ghost, a class of beings ever discontent and anguished because of being unable to satisfy their greed; dominated by hatred one enters one of the hell realms where one suffers terrible pain; dominated by ignorance one becomes an animal ruled by the instincts of food and reproduction.” <sup id="cite_ref-581" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-581">[581]</a></sup> “‘Right action’ basically means to act gently and kindly and to be ‘compassionate to all living beings’.

In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsāric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f ). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21).” <sup id="cite_ref-584" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-584">[584]</a></sup> “[...] Buddhism maintained a fairly flexible posture vis-a-vis competing religions and never sought to require laity to identify themselves exclusively as Buddhist or to rely singularly on the Buddhist clergy for all their spiritual needs.” <sup id="cite_ref-585" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-585">[585]</a></sup></dd>

Hence the importance of purification to effect restoration.// The goal to be achieved by the performance of misogi shuho , purification using water, is the cultivation of reisei , the Shinto ideal of spirituality.

In more concrete terms, this meant caring for one’s parents once they became old and infirm, and, upon a parent’s death, to engage in rituals of veneration that conferred the status of ancestor on the deceased. In China, the family was thought of as the basic unit of society and therefore filial piety was considered the foundation that made this social unit work properly. The Japanese also embraced this Confucian notion of filial piety but extended it to apply to the ideal of loyalty to one’s lord. To be loyal was to be filial.

"Shinto stresses ritual purity rather than ethics and morality, and Shinto rituals are designed to counteract ritual pollution. The word tsumi indicates an offense or pollution that must be neutralized by ritual cleansing. [...] Tsumi included offenses for which a person was responsible as well as calamities over which he or she had no control. Certain acts resulting in bodily harm to others were lumped together with epidemics and natural calamities as forms of tsumi that were referred to as ‘troublesome things’ (magagoto). In general the ancient Japanese equated physical purity and brightness with righteousness and virtue; conversely, physical defilement and darkness were seen as evil and injustice. Ablutions were used as magic rites to eliminate tsumi. The common element that links all tsumi is their danger to the cosmic and social order. The primitive Japanese believed that society and the cosmos were interrelated and that disturbing one could disturb the other. As violations of the normal order of things, tsumi were to be feared because it was thought that they would invite calamity. Improper sexual relations, for instance, might lead to poor harvests. Thus rules for conduct were not based on principles considered inherently moral, and the danger caused by improper actions or unfortunate events might be removed completely by conducting the appropriate magical rites." <sup id="cite_ref-625" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-625">[625]</a></sup> As for Buddhists, they expected rulers to be in charge of punishment, not religious agents.

In this way the king establishes his subjects in good conduct. Moreover, if a king would overlook evil acts and leave the evil-doers unpunished, lawless conduct would become rife and the use of violence increase. By refraining from punishment, a king would thus support the evil-doers and become directly responsible for the growth of violence in his country. Ultimately, then, non-violence is not really an option, for non-violent rule would in fact lead to even more violence. Nevertheless the king’s motives in employing force must be selfless and lawful, his judgements impartial and the punishment measured to the crime (see Emmerick, 1970, pp. 57- 73)." <sup id="cite_ref-626" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-626">[626]</a></sup> No evidence could be found in the literature that Confucian religious agents punished moral transgressors.

The following quote describes ad hoc measures useful only for regional famines which failed due to hoarding at the time of the nation-wide famine.</i> ‘Under the Tokugawa, then, the han were protected to a degree unimaginable to their Sengoku predecessors. They were also given considerable assistance, for the relationship between the han and the bakufu was by no means completely one-sided, with the former giving while the latter took. Justifiably or not, the bakufu believed itself to carry ultimate responsibility for the well-being of the realm, and if from time to time this necessitated making demands of the han, it also obliged the bakufu in its turn to respond to their appeals. In such cases, bakufu assistance could take the form of gifts, like the distribution of rice during a famine in the Echigo area in 1676’ <sup id="cite_ref-647" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-647">[647]</a></sup>
