<p><b> ♠ Duration  ♣ 1100-1220 CE ♥ </b>
</p><p>This period begins in 1100 because that is the year that is approximately the year that a new dynasty (the Mahīdharapura, originally from the Khorat area) began under Jayavarman VI.
</p><p>This period ends in 1220 CE (death of Jayavarman VII).
</p><p>'Despite the control of the means of destruction by the overlord through his army and war elephants, a steady flow of goods from the countryside was essential. It is possible that the excessive demands of Jayavarman VII, and the spread of Hinayana Buddhism, which stresses the importance of the individual, undermined that relationship. Certainly, the building activity declined after the death of Jayavarman, and the central grip of provinces which formerly deferred to Angkor, slackened. But Angkor was not alone: the Chams to the east represented a potent force, as did the vibrant Thai state centred at Ayutthaya. When the latter invested and sacked Angkor, they removed a competitor, but maintained the traditions of kingship expressed in the rituals and esoteric language that a Loubere was to encounter at the court of King Narai.'<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> 'The last Sanskrit inscription carved in Angkor commemorates the ascension of a minor king. Archaeologists consider this the end of the Classic Khmer period.'<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> 'Cambodian history is normally divided into the pre-Angkor (third century to 802 CE), Angkor (802-1432), and post-Angkor periods. The pre-Angkor period is mainly known from seventh-century inscriptions; Angkor epigraphy begins in the late ninth century. Thus there is a crucial gap in our sources during the critical transitional phase.'<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> 'Harsavarman III ascended the throne of Angkor in 1066. According to inscriptions from Mi Son, the Cham defeated him in a battle at Somesvara and devastated Sambhupura (Sambor), taking captives to serve in sanctuaries of Sri Isanabhadresvara in Mi Son. Harsavarman died in 1080 and received the posthumous name Sadasivapada. It seems that upon his death, a power struggle broke out. A ruler named Nripatindravarman may have ruled at Angkor until around 1113, whereas another ruler named Jayavarman VI is also mentioned in one unfinished inscription at Angkor, and in later inscriptions. No kinship relationships among any of these individuals can be ascertained.'<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ unitary state ♥ </b> 'All the institutions of government reviewed above give the impression that they belong to an apparatus of (as least potentially) oppressive, even totalitarian, power. Indeed, it is altogether likely that after the time of Rajendravarman the kings of Angkor presided over a much more centralized regime than the Khmers had known before. Institutions of government embodied no principles of constitutional checks upon royal power beyond the notion of religious morality. An impulse to totalitarian government was present, and found expression whenever rulers found themselves temporarily without dangerous rivals still at large. We must remember, though, that this tate lacked all the advantages of modern communications and technology to assert its control in detail, and that all sorts of regional, personal and factional loyalties were liable to obstruct the impulse to totalitarianism before too long.'<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> 'Angkor under Suyavarman [II] was at the peak of its glory. The institutional reforms of Rajendravarman were secure, giving a measure of centralisation to the administration of the empire.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> 'The central administration in Angkor must have had fairly detailed information for the purposes of taxation and core labour of all the empire's inhabitants, for according to Zhou a census was taken during the ninth Cambodian month, where everyone (or, more likely, all heads of families) was called to the capital, and passed in review before the Royal Palace. Such census registers were kept in Aymonier's day, and revised every three years.'<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> 'Because the Angkor kingdom commanded a significant army and a large centralized administrative apparatus and because thousands of workers were needed to build and maintain its enormous building complexes, it has been assumed that around the stone constructions of the palaces and temples a city with a substantial population must have existed.'<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> 'All such leaders were tied to the overlord by webs of family, marriage, and patronage whose instability ensured constant fluctuations in the center’s territorial influence. Reliable royal control in the sense of resource exaction was therefore confined to the capital zone, which normally included the empire’s most populous districts but which might not exceed a 60-mile radius. In Pagan, Angkor, and to a lesser extent perhaps early Champa and Dai Viet, temples and monasteries served simultaneously as agencies of agricultural reclamation, ritual validation, and intra-elite alliance. Because these wealthy, self-regulating religious institutions helped to stabilize labor and to concentrate resources, they tended to compress and, in some ways, to obviate royal administration. Nonetheless, the ruler remained indispensable as ritual intermediary between kingdom and cosmos, as military leader, and as coordinator of temple as well as secular patronage. Thus, while accepting that these were weak forms of the genus, we can still recognize charter-era entities as “states” according to Charles Tilly’s minimalist definition: “coercion- wielding organizations that are distinct from households and kinship groups and exercise clear priority in some respects over all other orga- nizations within substantial territories.”45'<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Supra-polity relations ♣ none ♥ </b> Although Sūryavarman I formed alliances with Champa and China against Annam as did other leaders, these alliances were not long-standing or enshrined by inter-marriage. While tribute was at times paid to China, this too was not consistent or indicative of a subordinate relationship.

<p><b> ♠ Capital  ♣ Mahidharapura: 1080-1113ce; Yasodharapura: 1113-1327ce ♥ </b> 'Jayavarman VI set up his capital at Mahidharapura, whose location is currently unknown but is assumed to be above the Dangrek, where he is also associated with the foundation of Phimai (Groslier 1973:146). Jacques argues that there is no proof that Mahidharapura is around this site (Jacques and Lafond 2004:301). Both Jayavaraman VI and his successor, Dharanindravarman I, appear to have maintained their control away from Angkor [i.e. Yasodharapura].' However, 'Suryavarman II took the throne in 1113 CE, returning the focus to Angkor as the centre of the Khmer political world' <sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup>. 'Early Angkor, in the eighth and early ninth centuries, consisted of two centers: one around Ak Yum dating from the seventh century, under what is now the western end of the West Baray; and the other, Hariharalaya, from the eighth century, at what is now called Roulos in Southeast Angkor. Both enters were unbounded and apparently low-density settlements (Pottier 2006). [...] In the late ninth century, the centre was moved to Phnom Bakheng and the East Baray built. This capital, named Yasodharapura, was also unbounded (Pottier 2000) and incorporated both Hariharalya and Ak Yum to form Greater Angkor. Thereafter until the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries, the locations of administrative enters and palaces moved around within the network of the urban complex. Only in the late twelfth century, with the construction of the walled and moated central enclosure of Angkor Thom, did the practice of relocating the administrative centre cease. Thereafter, the Bayon, the central temple of Angkor Thom, also became the permanent state temple at Angkor'<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> 'Circa 928 Jayavarman IV rules from Koh Ker, wehre he has estates some 50 miles northeast of Angkor. There he builds a new urban center, with his palace, a baray, and a stepped pyramid temple to Shiva. 944 Rajendravarman II returns the capital to Angkor. The name “Angkor,” from the Sanskrit word for “city,” was given to the capital only in the 16th century. Temple inscriptions during imperial times call it Yashodharapura, “glory—bearing city.”'<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> 'The Khmer pronunciation of Sanskrit negara, signifying capital of a kingdom.

Perhaps they date even earlier, as evidence of an Austro-Asiatic group has been found in western Thailand in Kanchanaburi Province near the village of Ban Kao, dating from Neolithic times (10,000 B.C.E.). Archaeological remains indicate that a Mon civilization based on Theravada Buddhism was present in northeast Thailand up to around the early ninth century, when it was overtaken by the Khmers of Angkor expanding from cen- tral Cambodia at the beginning of the reign of Jayavarman II (770/790/802?-834 C.E.).'<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> 'In northeast Thailand, for example, most Hinayana Buddhist stupas yielded to the standardized prasat structures of Angkorian Hinduism or Mahayana Buddhism.58 In 1200 people who spoke Khmer as their primary tongue probably formed a majority in the Cambodian plain, the Mekong basin as far north as That Phanom, much of the Chi and Mun river valleys, and the area im- mediately north and east of present-day Bangkok.59 But the lowlands also contained very substantial non-Khmer populations. Those parts of the Chaophraya basin subject to Angkor, for example, were dominated by Mon- and later by Tai-speakers, both of whom tended to be more attached to Hinayana Buddhism than to Hinduism. The basin also included people who in later times might be labeled Malay, Cham, or Karen.60 Angkor itself by 1297, according to Zhou Daguan, had Siamese (Tai) settlers as well as a large population of enslaved hill peoples, who were treated as a race apart.

So severe was the ensuing fragmentation that by 1340, as noted, at least 23 mainland kingdoms were independent in the sense that they paid no regular tribute to other Southeast Asian rulers (see Figure 1.4).41 Most would survive into the 16th century.'<sup id="cite_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-61">[61]</a></sup>

His calculations were based on Groslier’s estimate of a population at Angkor in the vicinity of 1,900,000 people, of whom 600,000 were supported by 86,000 hectares (215,000 acres) of irrigated rice fields. In the dry season, a hectare would require 15,000 cubic meters (525,000 cu. ft.) of water. Assuming all the major barays at Angkor were full to a depth of three meters (9.9 ft.), they could have supplied 7,000 hectares (17,500 acres). If they yielded 1.46 tons of rice per hectare and annual consumption was 220 kilograms (484 lbs.) of rice per capita, the dry season yield would have maintained about 44,500 people, about 2.5 percent of the estimated population. This calculation is based only on the amount of water available when the barays were three meters deep. It does not take into account the possibility that the barays were constantly replenished with water from the Siem Reap River throughout the dry season. There is also the possibility that the reservoirs were used to supplement water supplies to the fields when there was insufficient rainfall during the wet sea- son. If so, then a further 9,000 metric tons (9,900 tons) over and above anticipated wet-season production could have been obtained, making the total irrigated yield 19,200 tons, sufficient to feed nearly 100,000 people.'<sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup> 'At its peak, the population of the impe- rial core may have exceeded 1.5 million.'<sup id="cite_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup> 'At its height, Angkor was the largest premodern settlement in the world, a city of more than 700,000 spread over a larger area than modern Los Angeles.

Topped by five towers, arranged in an “X” pattern like the dots on a die, Angkor Wat was designed as a microcosmic representation of Mount Meru, the center of the universe in Hindu and Buddhist cosmology. This vast complex, still the largest religious building in the world, remains a powerful representation of Angkor’s military, artistic, and economic might, as well as the absolute rule of the God Kings, who were said to “eat their kingdom,” ruling with an iron fist.'<sup id="cite_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-68">[68]</a></sup>

<p>'Because all the Classic inscriptions deal with matters that are fundamentally religious in nature [...] we have much information on the central religious hierarchy, but little about the secular one. [...] The religious authorities and functionaries in the royal court were certainly almost entirely Brahmin caste [Level 2], although some priests in the provinces and villages [Level 1] may not have been so. Most of them may have received the honorific Khmer title of sten an, reserved for learned men. We already run across the purohita [Level 4]. In peninsular India, this Sanskrit word indicated a family priest or chaplain; in Classic Angkor, this important individual was the chaplain and chief priest of the king and, at least according to the self-serving Sdok Kak Thom stela, was a hereditary officer charged with maintaining the cult of the devajara. The Sanskrit title of hotar or 'sacrificer' occurs frequently in the texts; this is also supposed to indicate 'royal chaplain' - but the exact scope of the term is unclear since while the royal purohita of the devaraja was a hotar, there were other hotars [Level 3]. Most of these may have had important administrative roles. There were many religious functionaries who received the Sanskrit title of acharya, a learned priest who acted as teacher and spiritual guide; or pandit, someone versed in sacred lore; or of upadhyaya, a teacher and preceptor learned in the vedas [Level 2].

The khlon rajakarya was responsible for the administration of 'royal work', probably corvee among other things. The tamrvac was an inspector; the officials who swore allegiance to Suryavarman I had this title, for example. The gunadosadarsin (assessor of virtues and defects) was concerned with temple property. A variety of functionaries were called khlon (inspector) and had responsibilities in various areas such as grain, temple dues, management of religious foundations and several aspects of court proceedings. Revenue was usually in kind, being paid in grain, but some special districts paid in other commodities such as honey and wax.

From the new map an outline can be provide of the development of the network between the 8th-9th and the 14th centuries. Each large extension of the network tapped water from a succession of natural rivers flowing from NE to SW. Each river was further north and was tapped further to the west. The network had five major components - E-W embankments that trapped water flowing from the north and northeast; N-S channels that eventually delivered water to large reservoirs (baray); the baray and the large temple moats; embankments and channels oriented from NW to SE that could distribute water back from west to east across the slope of the land; and channels oriented towards the southwest which could dispose of water rapidly to the lake, the Tonle Sap.

Where formalised roads were constructed radiating from the capital, they were important for the state. Given the seemingly abrupt endings of some, they appear to have served primarily to access Angkor’s hinterland (Section 3.3.1).'<sup id="cite_ref-247" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-247">[247]</a></sup> 'The nature of state control of Khmer territories varied according to distance from the capital, and over the Angkorian period.

The ruling elites owed their position to birthright and the lower orders by and large accepted their status as natural, particularly as it was closely bound up with the religious idea of one’s station in this life being a reward or punishment for deeds in past lives. Liberty was an alien condition beyond the social imagination, without words to express it, although some ‘plebeian’ revolts do appear to have broken out before being brutally suppressed. The doctrine of reincarnation at least held out the promise of better luck next time, if one had lived an honest, obedient and virtuous life. As we shall see, life for the common people and slaves was onerous indeed and legends such as the Churning of the Sea of Milk gave hope to the downtrodden. This legend, depicted on the bas-reliefs of Angkor Wat, shows lines of people pulling a rope backwards and forwards, looped around a pole which is resting on the back of Kurma the tortoise. The aim of the exercise was to recover lost objects from the sea, foremost of which was ambrosia, the gift of immortality. Ambrosia also meant prosperous times, ample food, and well-deserved rest after the rigours of labour in the fields or construction sites. The strict stratification of Khmer society was reflected in the division of the common people themselves into different categories; the knum who were bound to the monasteries, temples and religious orders; the peasants or the soldier-builder-farmer class; and slaves.'<sup id="cite_ref-379" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-379">[379]</a></sup>

The influence of some officials seems to have been curtailed after 1080 CE through the loss of their political and economic privileges. An alternative hypothesis is that immunities were curbed some time around 1050 CE and this contributed to the dissatisfaction of elites, leading to a revolt. There are, in any case, very few inscriptions by officials from 1080 CE. Either any new privileges granted to royal supporters were no longer written in temple inscriptions, or, with the loss of immunities, there was less incentive to establish foundations (Sections 8.3; 8.7).'<sup id="cite_ref-380" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-380">[380]</a></sup>

Following these structural changes, the Mandala model, with overlapping and changing loyalties, could no longer be applicable. Rather than seeking independence or new alliances, leaders of successful coups might aim to gain control at the centre. Thus, according to Kulke (1986: 12-13) the aims of both Sūryavarman I and Sūryavarman II, in their respective struggles for supremacy were neither to defeat or destroy the Angkor kingdom, but to conquer the already firmly established centre, and facilitate greater stability of the outer core areas.'&lt;/ref&gt;(Lustig 2009, p. 50)&lt;/ref&gt; 'Further on [on a bas-relief at Bayon] there is fighting between Khmer combatants indistinguishable in appearance one from another.

People could become enslaved for debt, as war captives, or by selling themselves. As a result of accepting someone as a “slave,” however, the master was responsible for ensuring the welfare of that person.

</p><p><b>Important Quotations</b> ‘From the end of the eighth to the ate ninth century (AD 791-877), almost no Khmer-language inscriptions were produced; vocabulary shifts also characterise this period (Vickery 1998:84-65). Philological evidence, then, suggests a kind of rupture that is poorly understood as yet. [155] Interestingly, the material record offers evidence for a reconfiguration of pre-existing social and ideological institutions. Notable among these is a shift in political leadership that involved the adoption of the devaraja rite and the establishment of a state religion in the form of the Saivite cult of the royal lines on the temple pyramids of Angkor (see Kulke 1978). The direct relationship to the gods, especially Shiva, that this form of statecraft offered to Angkorian rulers gave them substantially more power and legitimacy than their predecessors had.’ <sup id="cite_ref-417" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-417">[417]</a></sup> 'On what did the authority of the ruler actually depend? Two different answers have been given; both have been made problematic by recent research. The first is religious symbolism. It appeals to the notion that rulers surrounded themselves with impressive rituals that assimilated them to gods, and were thereby ale to present themselves as more than human. We have already noted here that the devaraja cult, instituted buy Jayavarman II, was once seen as the cult of the king himself turned into a god. However, it can scarcely be so regarded any more, for the 'god' of the cult is unlikely to be the ruler, and the cult must be inserted within the network of  regional spirits which could be given concrete reality as protectors of individuals or families. The second is the control of a centralised irrigation system. However, as was pointed out above, the reality of such a system is now in doubt.'<sup id="cite_ref-418" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-418">[418]</a></sup>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ court procession ♥</b> 'Nowhere is this more apparent than in the great state processions of South and Southeast Asia, such as the impressive Perahera still celebrated annually in the old Sinhalese capital of Kandy in Sri Lanka (and attended by more than a million citizens). This is what the celebrated reliefs on Angkor Wat's South Gallery are all about: the political, religious and military structure of Suryavarman's empire were laid out for all to see in a  grand and thrilling public display that must have been saved in the parade ground immediately in front of the 300-m (984-ft) long Elephant Terrace. Here is the unforgettable testimony of Zhou Daguan, who actually witnessed such an event: "When the King [Jayavarman VIII] leaves his palace, the procession is headed by the soldiery; then come the flags, the banners, the music. Girls of the palace, three or five hundred in number, gaily dressed, with flowers in their hair and tapers in their hands, are massed together in a separate column. The tapers are lighted even in the broad daylight. Then come other girls holding gold and silver vessels from the palace and a whole galaxy of ornaments, of very special design, the uses of which are strange to me. Then came still more girls, the bodyguard of the palace, holding shields and lances. These, too, were separately aligned. Following them came chariots drawn by goats and horses, all adorned with gold; ministers and princes, mounted on elephants, were preceded by bearers of scarlet parasols, without number. Close behind came the royal wives and concubines, in palanquins and chariots, or mounted on horses or elephants, to whom were signed at least a hundred parasols mottled with gold. Finally the sovereign appeared, standing erect on an elephant and holding in his hand the Sacred Sword. This elephant, his tusks sheathed with gold, was accompanied by bearers of twenty parasols with golden shafts. All around was a bodyguard of elephants, drawn close together, and still more soldiers for complete protection, marching in close order." As for the music, in processions shown on the base reliefs, the Classic marching band was mainly composed of percussion instruments and long trumpets. A passage from a steale in the Ta Prohm complex has an exhortation: "Let the procession that surrounds them be full of banners, parasols; let the struck musical instruments make great sounds that charm the spirit; let the male and female dancers all around here.'<sup id="cite_ref-419" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-419">[419]</a></sup> Procession of Suryavarman II (S Gallery, W section). In contrast to Angkor Wat's other bas-reliefs, this 94m-long military procession has an historical basis, as it shows King Suryavarman II, the temple's builder, and his army. It begins at the W edge, with two registers: the upper is a royal audience before the army sets off, in the lower a procession. 10m from the start, on the upper register, is the kind, seated (in keeping with his rank, larger than any other figure). Below, princesses and ladies of the court are carried on palanquins. On the other side of the king are his ministers and army commanders, and after the audience they rise and leave, descending steps to rejoin the army. From here to the end, the army marches in a single register, its 20 commanders riding war elephants, their rank identified by the number of parasols and name identified in small inscriptions. The 12th elephant, exactly halfway along the bas-relief, carries the king, again the largest figure, with 15 parasols. The royal standard, a small statue of Vishnu on Garuda, precedes him. Military processions continued just like this throughout the different reigns; the Chinese diplomat from a century and a half later reads, "The ministers and princes are all on elephant back; from afar their innumerable red parasols can be seen... Behind them at last comes the king, standing on the back of an elephant and holding in his hand the precious sword." 18m in front of Suryavarman II, the royal sacrificer or Rajahotar, a brahmin, rides in a palanquin among priests, just behind the Sacred Fire on its ark (each end decorated with naga heads). A band precedes this: note the horns, conch shells, flute and a gong carried by two men. The small group of standard bearers just in front is excellent. The head of the procession is taken over by more troops. 8m before the end Prince Jayasimhavarman on an elephant commands a provincial contingent from Louvo (now Lopburi in Central Thailand). Sloping out of step in front of these disciplined troops is a rag-tag body of Siamese mercenaries, wild-looking and armed with spears; their commander also rides an elephant.'<sup id="cite_ref-420" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-420">[420]</a></sup> 'I have heard it said that, with previous rulers, the imprints of the wheels of their chariots never left the palace threshold; and that was to prevent untoward incidents. The present monarch is the son-in-law of the previous ruler. At first he was the supreme commander of the troops. On the death of the father-in-law, his [the father-in-law's] daughter stole the golden sword [of state] and brought it to her husband. The true son and heir was deprived of his succession. He plotted to raise troops, but the new ruler heard about it, cut off his toes and kept him in a secrete chamber. A sliver of sacred iron has been inserted in the body of the new ruler, so that he is invulnerable to knives and arrows which may strike his body. Assured of this, the new ruler dares leave his palace. I have spent more than a year in the country, and have seen him go out for or five times. When the sovereign goes out, troops are at the head of the procession. After them come the standard bearers, the flag-bearers, and the musicians. Just the palace women, numbering between three and five hundred, in clothes with floral designs, flowers in their hair, holding candles in their hands, form a battalion. Even in the broad daylight they light their tapers. Then come the palace maidens carrying the gold and silver royal utensils and a whole panoply of ornaments, all very special; I do not know their purpose. Then come the female palace guards holding in their hands lances and shields; they too form a section by themselves. Next come carts drawn by goats and horses, all decorated in gold. The ministers and the princes are all mounted on elephants. In from of them one can see from afar their innumerable red parasols. After them come the kings wives and concubines, in palanquins, chariots, on horseback, and on elephants; they have certainly more than a hundred parasols flecked with gold. Behind them comes the sovereign himself, standing on an elephant and holding in his hand the precious sword [of state]. The tusks of the elephants are also sheathed in gold. [Around him] are more than twenty white parasols flecked with gold and with gold handles. Numerous elephants surround him, and there are more troops to protect him. If the sovereign goes to a place nearby, he only uses gold palanquins, carried by palace women. Most frequently, the king on leaving goes to see a small gold tower in which there is a golden Buddha [statue]. Those who see the king must crouch down and touch their heads on the ground; this is what is called the sanba [san-pa]; otherwise, they are seized by the procession organisers who do not let them go for nothing.'<sup id="cite_ref-421" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-421">[421]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ court procession ♥</b> 'Nowhere is this more apparent than in the great state processions of South and Southeast Asia, such as the impressive Perahera still celebrated annually in the old Sinhalese capital of Kandy in Sri Lanka (and attended by more than a million citizens). This is what the celebrated reliefs on Angkor Wat's South Gallery are all about: the political, religious and military structure of Suryavarman's empire were laid out for all to see in a  grand and thrilling public display that must have been saved in the parade ground immediately in front of the 300-m (984-ft) long Elephant Terrace. Here is the unforgettable testimony of Zhou Daguan, who actually witnessed such an event: "When the King [Jayavarman VIII] leaves his palace, the procession is headed by the soldiery; then come the flags, the banners, the music. Girls of the palace, three or five hundred in number, gaily dressed, with flowers in their hair and tapers in their hands, are massed together in a separate column. The tapers are lighted even in the broad daylight. Then come other girls holding gold and silver vessels from the palace and a whole galaxy of ornaments, of very special design, the uses of which are strange to me. Then came still more girls, the bodyguard of the palace, holding shields and lances. These, too, were separately aligned. Following them came chariots drawn by goats and horses, all adorned with gold; ministers and princes, mounted on elephants, were preceded by bearers of scarlet parasols, without number. Close behind came the royal wives and concubines, in palanquins and chariots, or mounted on horses or elephants, to whom were signed at least a hundred parasols mottled with gold. Finally the sovereign appeared, standing erect on an elephant and holding in his hand the Sacred Sword. This elephant, his tusks sheathed with gold, was accompanied by bearers of twenty parasols with golden shafts. All around was a bodyguard of elephants, drawn close together, and still more soldiers for complete protection, marching in close order." As for the music, in processions shown on the base reliefs, the Classic marching band was mainly composed of percussion instruments and long trumpets. A passage from a steale in the Ta Prohm complex has an exhortation: "Let the procession that surrounds them be full of banners, parasols; let the struck musical instruments make great sounds that charm the spirit; let the male and female dancers all around here.'<sup id="cite_ref-599" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-599">[599]</a></sup> 'Procession of Suryavarman II (S Gallery, W section). In contrast to Angkor Wat's other bas-reliefs, this 94m-long military procession has an historical basis, as it shows King Suryavarman II, the temple's builder, and his army. It begins at the W edge, with two registers: the upper is a royal audience before the army sets off, in the lower a procession. 10m from the start, on the upper register, is the kind, seated (in keeping with his rank, larger than any other figure). Below, princesses and ladies of the court are carried on palanquins. On the other side of the king are his ministers and army commanders, and after the audience they rise and leave, descending steps to rejoin the army. From here to the end, the army marches in a single register, its 20 commanders riding war elephants, their rank identified by the number of parasols and name identified in small inscriptions. The 12th elephant, exactly halfway along the bas-relief, carries the king, again the largest figure, with 15 parasols. The royal standard, a small statue of Vishnu on Garuda, precedes him. Military processions continued just like this throughout the different reigns; the Chinese diplomat from a century and a half later reads, "The ministers and princes are all on elephant back; from afar their innumerable red parasols can be seen... Behind them at last comes the king, standing on the back of an elephant and holding in his hand the precious sword." 18m in front of Suryavarman II, the royal sacrificer or Rajahotar, a brahmin, rides in a palanquin among priests, just behind the Sacred Fire on its ark (each end decorated with naga heads). A band precedes this: note the horns, conch shells, flute and a gong carried by two men. The small group of standard bearers just in front is excellent. The head of the procession is taken over by more troops. 8m before the end Prince Jayasimhavarman on an elephant commands a provincial contingent from Louvo (now Lopburi in Central Thailand). Sloping out of step in front of these disciplined troops is a rag-tag body of Siamese mercenaries, wild-looking and armed with spears; their commander also rides an elephant.'<sup id="cite_ref-600" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-600">[600]</a></sup> 'I have heard it said that, with previous rulers, the imprints of the wheels of their chariots never left the palace threshold; and that was to prevent untoward incidents. The present monarch is the son-in-law of the previous ruler. At first he was the supreme commander of the troops. On the death of the father-in-law, his [the father-in-law's] daughter stole the golden sword [of state] and brought it to her husband. The true son and heir was deprived of his succession. He plotted to raise troops, but the new ruler heard about it, cut off his toes and kept him in a secrete chamber. A sliver of sacred iron has been inserted in the body of the new ruler, so that he is invulnerable to knives and arrows which may strike his body. Assured of this, the new ruler dares leave his palace. I have spent more than a year in the country, and have seen him go out for or five times. When the sovereign goes out, troops are at the head of the procession. After them come the standard bearers, the flag-bearers, and the musicians. Just the palace women, numbering between three and five hundred, in clothes with floral designs, flowers in their hair, holding candles in their hands, form a battalion. Even in the broad daylight they light their tapers. Then come the palace maidens carrying the gold and silver royal utensils and a whole panoply of ornaments, all very special; I do not know their purpose. Then come the female palace guards holding in their hands lances and shields; they too form a section by themselves. Next come carts drawn by goats and horses, all decorated in gold. The ministers and the princes are all mounted on elephants. In from of them one can see from afar their innumerable red parasols. After them come the kings wives and concubines, in palanquins, chariots, on horseback, and on elephants; they have certainly more than a hundred parasols flecked with gold. Behind them comes the sovereign himself, standing on an elephant and holding in his hand the precious sword [of state]. The tusks of the elephants are also sheathed in gold. [Around him] are more than twenty white parasols flecked with gold and with gold handles. Numerous elephants surround him, and there are more troops to protect him. If the sovereign goes to a place nearby, he only uses gold palanquins, carried by palace women. Most frequently, the king on leaving goes to see a small gold tower in which there is a golden Buddha [statue]. Those who see the king must crouch down and touch their heads on the ground; this is what is called the sanba [san-pa]; otherwise, they are seized by the procession organisers who do not let them go for nothing.'<sup id="cite_ref-601" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-601">[601]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ oath of allegiance ♥</b> 'In total, 28 kings ruled over this vast and powerful empire for over 600 years. Although in theory kingship was hereditary and monarchs were devarajas, or god-kings, in practice usurpers were common enough, the qualification being that they had to prove they were blood descen- dents of Jayavarman II, the founder of Angkor. It was for this reason that dignitaries and military leaders were required to swear an oath of loyalty to the reigning king, on pain of horrible punishments. One such oath is recorded in an inscription translated by Coedès, and promises eternal punishment in hell if it is broken. As the writers Mabbett and Chandler remarked, although Angkorean society was hier- archical, the fact of usurpation indicates that the rulers were not ‘worshipped as gods and given unquestioning obedience by all their subjects’. The extraordinary security measures described by Zhou Daguan above attest to this.'<sup id="cite_ref-691" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-691">[691]</a></sup> '"933 śaka, the ninth day of the crescent moon of Bhadrapada, Sunday. Here is (our) oath: We all who belong to the division of the tamrvāc of the first (second, second, third, fourth) category, swear, cutting our hands and offering our lives and our devotion gratefully and unerringly, to His Majesty Śrī Sūryavarman, who has enjoyed the legitimate monarchy since 924 śaka, in the presence of the sacred Fire, of the holy Jewel of the Brahmans and the ācāryas. We will not revere any other sovereign; we will not be hostile to him, we will not comply with his enemies; we will not commit any act which might do him harm. All these acts which are the fruit of our grateful devotion towards His Majesty Śri Sūryavarman, we will endeavour to accomplish. In case of war we will strive to fight with all our hearts, not to bind ourselves to life; by devotion (to the king) we will not run away from combat. If, in times of no war, we die of disease, may we obtain the reward of people devoted to their master. If our existence remains in the service of the king, when the time to die (in service) arrives, we will do it in devotion....." K. 292 (1011 CE) [...] The above oath of allegiance made to Sūryavarman I by 4,000 members of the taṃrvāc corps from 200 different sruk was formulated to affirm that their loyalty was wholly and willingly to their revered king. The inscription conveys a notion of a king with absolute power.'<sup id="cite_ref-692" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-692">[692]</a></sup> 'TELAGABATU. Name of a seventh-century inscription found at Sabukingking, Palembang, south Sumatra, erected by the ruler of Srivijaya. It was meant to be used in a ceremony in which water was poured over the heads of seven nagas carved at the top of the stone, flowed over the words carved below, and drained into a trough with a spout at the bottom. The inscription says that if anyone drank “im- precation water” and then broke the oath of loyalty the text contains, he would be poisoned by the water of the curse. The practice of “drinking oaths” was common in Southeast Asia until recent times. The inscription reads in part as follows: Om! Success! . . . All of you, as many as you are—sons of kings, . . . chiefs, army commanders, confidants of the king, judges, surveyors of groups of workmen, surveyors of low castes, cutlers, . . . clerks, sculp- tors, naval captains, merchants, . . . and you—washermen of the king and slaves of the king—all of you will be killed by the curse of this im- precation; if you are not faithful to me, you will be killed by the curse. . . . However, if you are submissive, faithful and straight to me and do not commit these crimes, an immaculate tantra will be my recom- pense. You will not be swallowed with your children and wives. . . . [E]ternal peace will be the fruit produced by this curse which is drunk by you. (condensed from a translation by J. G. de Casparis). Other versions of the same oath have been found at Karangber- ahi, far upstream in modern Jambi; at Kota Kapur, Bangka Island; and at two sites in the province of Lampung at the south end of Sumatra. This distribution may reflect the approximate extent of Srivijaya’s domain.'<sup id="cite_ref-693" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-693">[693]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from military ♣ absent ♥</b> 'All such leaders were tied to the overlord by webs of family, marriage, and patronage whose instability ensured constant fluctuations in the center’s territorial influence. Reliable royal control in the sense of resource exaction was therefore confined to the capital zone, which normally included the empire’s most populous districts but which might not exceed a 60-mile radius. In Pagan, Angkor, and to a lesser extent perhaps early Champa and Dai Viet, temples and monasteries served simultaneously as agencies of agricultural reclamation, ritual validation, and intra-elite alliance. Because these wealthy, self-regulating religious institutions helped to stabilize labor and to concentrate resources, they tended to compress and, in some ways, to obviate royal administration. Nonetheless, the ruler remained indispensable as ritual intermediary between kingdom and cosmos, as military leader, and as coordinator of temple as well as secular patronage. Thus, while accepting that these were weak forms of the genus, we can still recognize charter-era entities as “states” according to Charles Tilly’s minimalist definition: “coercion- wielding organizations that are distinct from households and kinship groups and exercise clear priority in some respects over all other orga- nizations within substantial territories.”45'<sup id="cite_ref-757" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-757">[757]</a></sup></dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from legislative ♣ absent ♥</b> 'All the institutions of government reviewed above give the impression that they belong to an apparatus of (as least potentially) oppressive, even totalitarian, power. Indeed, it is altogether likely that after the time of Rajendravarman the kings of Angkor presided over a much more centralized regime than the Khmers had known before. Institutions of government embodied no principles of constitutional checks upon royal power beyond the notion of religious morality. An impulse to totalitarian government was present, and found expression whenever rulers found themselves temporarily without dangerous rivals still at large. We must remember, though, that this tate lacked all the advantages of modern communications and technology to assert its control in detail, and that all sorts of regional, personal and factional loyalties were liable to obstruct the impulse to totalitarianism before too long.'<sup id="cite_ref-758" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-758">[758]</a></sup></dd>

The king was recognised as the final court of appeal and final authority in law. Before a case reached the king, it might go through various lower courts; inscriptions frequently mention officials who appear to have functions connected with courts of law.'<sup id="cite_ref-759" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-759">[759]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Right to petition executive ♣ present ♥</b> According to Chinese sources, there was no restrictions on the people (in terms of gender, social rank, etc.) who had this right. 'As devarajas, their power surpassed even that of the European monarchs who claimed to rule by divine right. The inscriptions indicate that they were seen as incapable of breaking religious laws, and they were the source of all legal power in the empire. The law itself was administered via a hierarchy of courts and legal officials. The lower courts dealt with routine matters, but the royal court itself could deal with even the pettiest of matters. Zhou Daguan records that every day the king held two audiences, for which no agenda was provided and which could be attended by both ‘func- tionaries and ordinary people’ for the adjudication of disputes. The inscriptions show that commoners could bring lawsuits against one another and a common method of ascertaining who was in the wrong was to place the plaintiff and the accused in stone towers for a period of three to four days. It was held that the person in the wrong would always develop an illness, such as catarrh, fever or ulcers. The penalties for convicted malefactors were often draconian. For the gravest crimes the punishment was death, possibly by decapitation with a sharp sword, as in the 19th century, but it was possible for felons to be buried alive.'<sup id="cite_ref-760" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-760">[760]</a></sup></dd>

Shortly before Pagan expanded from Upper Burma to conquer the coast, the Khmer empire itself expanded from the Mekong and around the Great Lake to in- corporate the Mun and Chi valleys to the north and the rich region around Lopburi to the west. A more shadowy authority extended over the upper peninsula.12 Ecclesiastical foundations spearheaded frontier colonization, particularly west and northwest of Angkor in what is now eastern and central Thailand, where Khmer culture and language exer- cised growing influence.13 As the economy grew more complex, it has been suggested that the number of urban sites in the empire more than doubled.14 By the reign of Suryavarman II (r. 1113-1145/1150), builder of Angkor Wat, the empire was arguably at its height, with varying de- grees of authority over the Chaophraya basin, Champa, and much of what is now northern and southern Thailand and Laos.&lt;/ref&gt;(Lieberman 2003, pp. 218-219)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the content of the Khmer inscriptions differ markedly from the Sanskrit ones. They are not addressed to gods, but to a temporal audience: authorities and officials, relatives of the founders, and in their broad imprecations, to the world in general. The authors tend not to express a political agenda here, in that they do not praise or assert power. The Khmer inscriptions seem more like legal documents - they often record the history of endowments made to foundations and they establish the ownership of land, setting out the rights of the foundation and the founder’s family. Vickery (1985) has suggested that many such texts in the 10th and 11th centuries have a certain political agenda on the part of the authors, who often appear to be concerned with their claims to titles and land. The texts may list and describe in detail the property of the foundation, record the donors, the circumstances under which land was acquired, the price paid, and settlement of disputes by courts. They may note the weight, quantity and material of temple ‘treasure’ or objects used in exchanges, the rice production of foundation lands, sometimes their location and dimensions. Requirements for continuing support for divinities and temple personnel may be set out and personnel might be listed, sometimes by name, gender, dependents, duties or place of origin, or else as totals. The texts may also refer to imposts or immunities granted to the foundations. The king is frequently acknowledged in inscriptions authored by individuals other than rulers, and a date is often recorded. The king is depicted as having a key role in state administration, establishing inquiries and being at least nominally responsible for legal decisions, ordering building works to be initiated, etc. There is an emphasis on the role of the ruler or of his predecessors in giving land, granting permission to purchase it or materially supporting the foundation, presumably placing the founder and his relatives under some future obligations. The authors record the merit, accrued by the ruler through his generosity, which is mostly dealt with poetically in the Sanskrit texts. Inscriptions written by rulers in Old Khmer are edicts relating mostly to matters of law, temple administration or land allocation and taxation. The texts are somewhat formulaic, though of varying length. Presumably, wealthier temples had more resources warranting recording, and had more literate scribes to produce the texts.'<sup id="cite_ref-850" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-850">[850]</a></sup>

Some of the competing institutions had been created by the state’s elite to reinforce the state’s legitimacy. For example, temples and temple networks were heavily endowed with economic resources by pre-1500 rulers. Initially this patronage returned merit and bestowed superior status on the state elite, but over time the continuedendowment of temples had the capacity to concentrate in temples income rights exceeding those of the state. A network of temples could—and in the case of the Burmese state of Pagan did—use their wealth and their control over large segments of the state’s land and labor to influence if not dictate state policy (Aung Thwin: 1991).'<sup id="cite_ref-851" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-851">[851]</a></sup>'</dd>

The dominant Khmer kinship pattern is one that has confused outsiders for many decades. Because the Brah- min ritual office of Purohita was passed matri- lineally from a man to his sister’s son and much was made of this inheritance pattern, some outsiders have assumed that all Khmer kinship was based on matrilineal descent. This idea has not been borne out by research, which clearly indicates no organized kin groupings beyond the nuclear family such as exist in any lineage system; all individuals recognize both their mother’s and father’s relatives equally. Each in- dividual shares rights and responsibilities with a bong p’on or circle of relatives gained through bilateral descent and marriage. Within this in- ner circle of kin there is a strong emphasis on mutual aid and harmony based on the animis- tic belief that conflict or discord among rela- tives is punished by ancestral spirits.'<sup id="cite_ref-859" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-859">[859]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ matrilineal inheritance ♣ present ♥</b> Technically, Angkorian kingship was reckoned through an ambilineal inheritance system. Most scholars agree that women occupied an exceptionally prominent position in Southeast Asia compared to other parts of the world. A history of women in ancient Southeast Asia remains to be written, however. Inscriptions indicate that in pre-Angkorian Cambodia (during the seventh and eighth centuries), women held posi- tions of power. At least two queens ruled independently, and in other polities they occupied positions of great authority. In the Angkorian period, no queens are attested, but royal genealogies indicate that claimants to the throne could appeal to descent through the female line to establish their legitimacy. In most of ancient Southeast Asia, people recorded their descent through both the maternal and paternal lines.

The same person could belong to several varnas at one time. People were appointed to specific varnas. There is no reference to caste in relation to marriage or food restrictions. Thus Khmer “Hinduism” had very different social implications than it had in India.

However, this single word does not do justice to the range of relationships that existed in ancient Southeast Asia and which in many contexts still affect hu- man relationships in the region. People could become enslaved for debt, as war captives, or by selling themselves. As a result of accepting someone as a “slave,” however, the master was responsible for ensuring the welfare of that person.

<dd>'Marvellous though they are as architecture and works of art, the temples of Angkor are the reflection of the overweening egotism and peculiar religiosity of the hereditary rulers, for whom no sacrifice was great enough provided it was made by their slaves and willing subjects, whose warm blood and sweat could not outlive the cold stone they placed block on block in the exquisite confections of Angkor. Perhaps, when we gaze on these stupendous monuments, we should muse over their human cost. That said we should be wary of extrapolating modern attitudes and ideologies into the remote Cambodian past. For many free men—serfs at least—it was probably an honour to toil on the monu- ments for the glory of the god-kings; for many slaves, their condition was one legitimised by age-old custom, as natural as the setting of the sun. They had no words for freedom and liberty.'<sup id="cite_ref-923" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-923">[923]</a></sup> 'Some of the knum appear to have been slaves in the strict sense of the word; they could be bought and sold and were often pris- oners of war or captured hill tribesmen from beyond the settled lands. Others seem to have been villagers from the vicinity of the monaster- ies and foundations. The inscriptions are explicit on the division of labour, with field hands, herdsmen who looked after the herds of sacred cows, fruit pickers, guards and other outdoor workers. There were also weavers and clothing workers, secretaries, kitchen hands and cooks, even parfumiers and ‘guards of the holy perfume’. Still others were employed as singers, dancers and musicians within the temples.'<sup id="cite_ref-924" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-924">[924]</a></sup> 'The work involved in constructing the Angkorian barays and their associated temples had been enormous and required the services of a massive pool of man- power. This manpower seems to have been largely supplied by the institution of slavery, a practice that survived in Cambodia in one form or another down to the beginning of the twentieth century. The Khmer word “kñur” possesses the semantic resonances to justify its translation by the term “slave,” but one must be aware of potential anachronism. Western notions of freedom and slav- ery may not always be appropriate in judging the institutions of medieval South- east Asia (Ebihara 1984, 290-291), and as Vickery (1998, 226) has observed, the old inscriptions never make reference to “explicitly free commoners.” Given this background, is it reasonable to suppose that because the kñur were not free, they must have been slaves? Jacques (1975) has suggested that they were not, for slaves would never have had their names engraved on temple records, nor would they have been allowed to defile the temple precincts.82 We need to know far more about the nature of old Khmer society and its notions of prop- erty in particular before the matter can be more precisely resolved, but for the purposes of this discussion I shall accept the translation of “kñur” as “slave,” subject to these qualifications and for want of a better alternative.'<sup id="cite_ref-925" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-925">[925]</a></sup> '[Zhou Daguan] noted for example, that there were at least 2,000 servants who lived <i>all over the capital</i>.

Others, especially those attached to temples, may have seen themselves as enjoying quasi-clerical status.

<p><b>♠ Rulers are legitimated by gods ♣ present ♥</b> 'The Angkor period is commonly understood to start in 802 CE with the proclamation of Jayavarman II as the chakravartin (universal-king) from a location in the Kulen mountains (Phnom Kulen), overlooking the vast alluvial plain where Angkor would begin to emerge in the following centuries (Figure 1). In doing so, Jayavarman confirmed himself as the great unifier; drawing Cambodia’s disparate polities together under the first ‘god king’ and establishing the Khmer state and the basis of its empire. Phnom Kulen was known as Mahendraparvata; ‘‘the hill of the great Indra’’. The extant history of Mahendraparvata is based on several inscriptions, the most well-known being an 11th century CE inscription (K.235) found at the Sdok Kak Thom temple, in eastern Thailand [4]. The inscription, dated to 1052 CE, outlines the lineage of a private family serving successive Khmer Kings for two and a half centuries, the first mentioned being Jayavarman II.' <sup id="cite_ref-943" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-943">[943]</a></sup> 'There was a watershed, dated to the year 802, whereby a series of competing polities were joined into one enduring and powerful central state. This transition involved a process of contralization instituted by the overlord Jayavarman II (ruled 802 to 834). Jayavarman seems to have identified a means of unifying formerly competing overlords that was rooted first in military conquest, then by placing his followers in positions of authority. This had the effect of establishing a central rule through replacing independent polities by provinces. He also must have appreciated the importance of stressing the mystical properties of kingship by instituting the cult of the kamraten jagat ta raja, meaning "the god who is king." Deification of the ruler, linked with vesting the rights to consecrate a new god-king in successive members of a given family, meant that the succession should be assured. Remarkably, the ensuing five centuries witnessed a considerable degree of legitimacy in the succession, being largely confined to members of the aristocratic lineage of Aninditapura.'<sup id="cite_ref-944" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-944">[944]</a></sup> 'Traditionally, the Angkorian period is said to have begun in 802, the year that Jayavarman II (r. 802-834) was crowned king. In a ritual evoking the mythology of  ̋iva and celebrated in the Phnom Kulen (Kulen Mountains), north of Angkor, he became the cakravartin/cakkavatti (universal monarch) of the new kingdom.'<sup id="cite_ref-945" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-945">[945]</a></sup> 'In the history of Cambodia, the year 802 symbolizes the beginning of the Angkor era because the Sdok Kak Thom inscription specifies that Jayavarman II conducted a ceremony to free Cambodia from Java in that year.'<sup id="cite_ref-946" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-946">[946]</a></sup> 'In the Angkor Cambodia realm, a symbolic ‘‘Mount Mahendra/Meru’’ temple mountain became the ritual home of the devaraja in the cult of Jayavarman II in the early ninth century—a cult that inclusively incorporated and subordinated worship of local deities to the king’s worship of Siva (see chapter 6). As the traditional abode of ancestor spirits, mountains were already considered sacred by indigenous tradition. By patronizing the external god Siva, who was known in Indian philosophy as the Lord of the Mountains and for his association with fertility, the kings reinforced their local stature. It remained for Cambodian kings to link themselves ritually with this mountain, the domicile of the ancestors and Siva, and thereby make a profound statement about their ability to guarantee the flow of life-power from the realm of the ancestors—and Siva—to their subjects.'<sup id="cite_ref-947" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-947">[947]</a></sup> 'All such leaders were tied to the overlord by webs of family, marriage, and patronage whose instability ensured constant fluctuations in the center’s territorial influence. Reliable royal control in the sense of resource exaction was therefore confined to the capital zone, which normally included the empire’s most populous districts but which might not exceed a 60-mile radius. In Pagan, Angkor, and to a lesser extent perhaps early Champa and Dai Viet, temples and monasteries served simultaneously as agencies of agricultural reclamation, ritual validation, and intra-elite alliance. Because these wealthy, self-regulating religious institutions helped to stabilize labor and to concentrate resources, they tended to compress and, in some ways, to obviate royal administration. Nonetheless, the ruler remained indispensable as ritual intermediary between kingdom and cosmos, as military leader, and as coordinator of temple as well as secular patronage. Thus, while accepting that these were weak forms of the genus, we can still recognize charter-era entities as “states” according to Charles Tilly’s minimalist definition: “coercionwielding organizations that are distinct from households and kinship groups and exercise clear priority in some respects over all other organizations within substantial territories.”45'<sup id="cite_ref-948" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-948">[948]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Rulers control supernatural energy ♣ present ♥</b> 'Since the emergence of Theravada Buddhism as the dominant religious tradition, the Cambodian king has been regarded as “one who has merits” (neak mean bon), a notion connected to the doctrine of karma, which sees present worldly merit as the result of the accumulation of beneficial deeds in previous existences. Kingship was largely hereditary, yet the practice of primogeniture was not always applied. It seems that “election” of a new king by a committee of royal family members, senior officials, and monks probably predates the modern period (Osborne 1973, 169). In the Theravada ideology of kingship the right to rule is a consequence of spiritual maturity. From this perspective, the prerogatives of the king, once appointed, may not easily be challenged by thisworldly considerations, such as political expediency. The king also possesses the power to “master the earth spirits” (Forest 1980, 57). Therefore he may bend the forces of nature to his will. In this way rain will fall at the correct time, good harvests are guaranteed, and calamity is avoided. The king’s possession of a set of powerful fetish weapons, most likely fashioned toward the end of the Angkorian period (Boisselier 1966, 357), reinforced this supernatural authority.<sup id="cite_ref-949" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-949">[949]</a></sup>
</p><p><b>♠ Rulers are descendants of gods ♣ present ♥</b> 'Suryavarman’s lineage began with his greatgrandfather Hiranyavarman (“Protected by Brahma”), who founded the dynasty that took control of Cambodia in 1080 and produced two of the most famous rulers in Khmer history: Suryavarman II and Jayavarman VII. It is not clear where Hiranyavarman originally lived. An inscription detailing his dynastic line through King Suryavarman II was found in northeastern Thailand, at Phnom Rung, and so it has been assumed that the family was from that region. This inscription praises Hiranyavarman as a descendant of aditya, the sun, and Laksmi, the consort of Visnu. Because of these divine origins, the suffixes of -aditya and -laksmi were used to characterize members of this family, although not exclusively.' <sup id="cite_ref-950" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-950">[950]</a></sup>

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Automatic deification ♣ present ♥</b> 'The purpose of these immense buildings had nothing in common with the great cathedrals of Europe or the grand mosques of the Muslim world. Nor were they like the modern pagodas of the Theravada Buddhists of Cambodia and neighbouring countries. Angkor Wat is, on the face of it, a temple dedicated to Vishnu, but the deity worshipped here is not the same as the ancient god of the Hindu triumvirate. Rather it is King Suryavarman II, the temple’s inspirer, who was seen in life as the incarnation of Vishnu. Hence, as eminent French scholar Paul Mus wrote, these buildings are not so much shelters for the dead ‘as a kind of new architectural body—a house of the dead but only in the same way that his body lived in it while still alive’. Even the numerous statues of Vishnu and Siva are dissimilar to most of their kind in India, for they have the features of the kings who were the earthly incarnations of the gods. The temples are the houses of the god-kings, the lords of the universe, immortalised in solid rock. They were not like pagodas, churches or mosques where the common people might come to pray. If they were ever admitted, it would only be to grovel at the feet of the mighty devarajas.'<sup id="cite_ref-956" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-956">[956]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p><b>♠ Rulers are gods ♣ present ♥</b> 'While “god-king” was a mistranslation of kamrateng jagat ta raja, it may not have been far off the mark as a description of how people felt about the king of Cambodia. An eleventh-century inscription describes the king as possessing a “subtle inner self ” that actually resided in a lingam found in the king’s royal pyramid-temple. This “subtle inner self ” implies that whatever essence is shared by the king and the lingam derives from Uiva. As a verification, inscriptions also refer to the king as having within himself a portion (amsa) of Uiva. An inscription praising King Udayadityavarman (r. 1050- 1066), the same king of the “subtle inner self,” states that “the most minor details of the ritual of Uiva prescribed in the texts . . . were known in their totality. . . by this king who was a portion of Uiva (Uivamsa).” If these statements do not exactly make the king Uiva incarnate, he at least embodied some indefinable segment of the divine Uiva." <sup id="cite_ref-957" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-957">[957]</a></sup>

The same principle applied in Cambodia. According to a manuscript once housed at Wat Sambok ([Keo-Han 1951], King Paramaràja VIII [r. 1659-1672]) decreed that 40 families of condemned persons forced into corvée for the king (neak na) and “slaves of the Buddha” (pol preah) be responsible for the upkeep of the monastery and a large stùpa in perpetuity.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Number of officially sanctioned supernatural beings ♣ polytheistic ♥</b> “According to one popular formula, there are 330 million gods in Hinduism. Nevertheless, most Hindus have believed that there is ultimately one deity, and that the diversity of other gods are his or her emanations or manifestations, representing his or her agency in particular contexts. [...] The three gods most commonly worshipped as the ultimate in Hindu traditions are Viṣṇu, Śiva, and the Goddess, variously called Devī, “Goddess,” and Śakti, “Power.” This triad of deities must be distinguished from an overlapping group of three deities who are conceived in the Purāṇas and other authoritative traditions to perform particular cosmic functions-Brahmā, who creates the universe anew in each vast cosmic cycle, and also, in some accounts, bestows the Veda upon humanity; Viṣṇu, who preserves the universe by intervening to rectify problems through his avatāras, “descents” or “incarnations”; and Śiva, who destroys the universe at the end of each cosmic cycle. [...] [W]hichever deity is conceived as the ultimate is understood to be the source who emanates the others, both the triad who perform the aforementioned cosmic functions and lower supernatural beings, and thus to be the ultimate agent in their actions. [...] There are numerous other important deities besides those frequently conceived as a monotheistic ultimate. One of the most important of these is Ganeṣa, a son of Śiva with the head of an elephant, believed to be a protective figure that removes obstacles. Another is Hanumān, the monkey-god who helped Rāma in his battle against Rāvaṇa, idealized for his devotion to Rāma and Sītā. Other deities important in particular regions include the South Indian Ayappa, regarded as the son of Śiva and a female avatāra of Viṣṇu; and smallpox goddesses such as the North Indian Śitalā.” <sup id="cite_ref-995" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-995">[995]</a></sup></dd>

Every good deed brings a reward, and every bad deed a punishment. The terms ‘reward’ and ‘punishment’ are deceptive, however; for karma is not seen as a set of rewards and punishments doled out by a just God, but in impersonal terms, as the working of natural law. Karma attracts reactions to moral agents like an ethical law of gravity. Benevolent actions produce good results for the person who engages in them. Similarly, actions intended to cause suffering will lead to suffering for those who commit them.” <sup id="cite_ref-998" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-998">[998]</a></sup></dd></dl>

Not all Brahmins have been priests and not all Kshatriyas have been rulers. The complexity of the caste system, regional and linguistic differences and historical change have all militated against this rigidity. [...]Brahmins have traditionally been seen as ritually more pure than Kshatriyas and more versed in religious knowledge. They are, in theory if not always in fact, the key scholars in the Hindu tradition. The Kshatriyas have traditionally been seen, again in theory if not always in practice, as the rulers who maintain society, uphold dharma and protect the householder system. They built and sponsored temples, protected their subjects and their deities and, to that extent, the Brahmins recognised a ruler’s overlordship. However, the kingly role in ruling and guardianship duties involved more ‘polluting tendencies’ than were usual in a Brahmin’s life. The Brahmins have had a dual role in society. Those who are active priests in temples have engaged in functions that involve being given gifts by worshippers and such temple priests are more involved with lower castes. Paradoxically Brahmins who are versed in promoting scholarship and in advancing religious learning but who do not act as serving priests are, in general, more widely admired because they have less contact with the public. Thus Brahmins who are not priests can be more akin to those renouncers engaged in lifelong learning and spirituality, rather than in the hurly-burly of householder life.

According to Dumont, in addition to the distinctions already outlined that fit varnas and jatis into hierarchies, another must be added. This distinction takes caste hierarchical divides beyond the kind of class distinctions found in eighteenth-century Britain or in the Ancien Regime in Europe, by stressing the opposition between purity and pollution. Caste difference, according to this classification, goes beyond class differences into this other realm of ritual purity and pollution. The Brahmins are the highest and purest varna, and the Dalits are the lowest, in that they are outside varna and are impure altogether. The other varnas rank in between. Pollution occurs in different ways. It occurs through bodily contact of one sort or another, with menstrual cycles, through birth and death, through emissions such as faeces, urine and saliva, and through contact with night-soil, dirty clothes, unswept rooms and so on. Thus marriage and sex have to function within the correct set of jatis in the correct varna. Polluting jobs such as laundering and sweeping are done by people of lower castes so that the blood of people of higher castes can remain ‘pure’. Equally menstrual activity among older women makes them more ‘impure’ than men or pre-menstrual virgins, and therefore women are more polluting than men. They will thus often live semi-separately while menstruating, during which time they will also avoid going to the temple and therefore ‘polluting’ the gods. Furthermore, untouchable Dalits were prohibited from entering many temples before the post-Independence freedom-of-temple-entry legislation and even now they are kept out of some temples in many villages. [...] It is also true to say that Dumont’s thesis suffers from exaggeration and other matters are important in discussing caste. Nevertheless, there is at least an element of truth in the notion that purity and pollution has relevance in any discussion of caste.” <sup id="cite_ref-1010" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1010">[1,010]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ care/harm ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> The following quote shows that caring for others is an important value in Hinduism: "According to Hindu Dharmashastras, of the four stages of life, the person who is at the householder stage is the anchor of society. The householder’s business is the maintenance and support of those in the other three stages of life: the students who have not yet entered into the world of work, the retirees who have seen the birth of grandchildren and spotted their first gray hairs, and the renunciants, those who have left behind not only the world of work and material possession but who have also left behind family and self-interest for a life focused on spiritual freedom. Householders are the ones with material wealth, and their responsibility, their dharma, is to share it with others. [...] The link between the world of the householder and the world of the renunciant is gift giving - dana. The classic image is of the renouncer with the begging bowl, making the rounds for alms. On a daily basis, in Hindu society, food is given to sannyasins and sadhus, the world renouncers who have "cast off" from the settled world of "this shore."<sup id="cite_ref-1013" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1013">[1,013]</a></sup> However, no evidence could be found for actual enforcement of this behaviour--e.g. punishment for not giving food to renouncers. Instead, it seems any punishment or reward was believed to occur through reinarnation: "In this era, the belief in a single life span was replaced by a system of reincarnation called samsara, the cycle of rebirths. According to this system, at death one would pass on to a life in heaven or hell, depending on the merits of one’s activities in life. Then, after a certain amount of time, the individual would be reborn on earth once again. The mechanism that regulated this system was karman, a word that literally means "action." Every action must have an effect. So, the effects of one’s actions in life determine what one will experience after death, and what kind of life one will have in the next birth. In this way, even if a person does not seem to receive all the rewards or punishments deserved in a particular life, the scales will be balanced in the future." <sup id="cite_ref-1014" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1014">[1,014]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ fairness/cheating ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> According to Hindu Law: "Misconduct by doctors, judges and examiners of coins has been transferred from steya to sahasa by Mādhava who has prescribed the highest punishment for a quack, a judge who punishes an innocent person and lets the guilty go scot free, and for an examiner of coins who lies about the genuineness of coins. These rules from Narada are available in all the texts under review, but Varadaraja and Devana have placed them under steya. One may conclude that while Varadaraja and Devaṇa saw dishonesty by these professional as mere financial bungling, Mṇdhava took their misconduct more seriously." <sup id="cite_ref-1015" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1015">[1,015]</a></sup> However, it seems that Hindu Law had only a nominal link to Hindu precepts, and does not therefore count as "human enforcement of morality":  "The growth of law in India may be likened to the evolution of disciplines like grammar, poetics, etymology, and prosody etc. Early speculations on these started in the samhitās and gained strength as auxiliaries to the Vedas. Soon, however, these sciences freed themselves from sacerdotal concerns and came to be established as independent subjects of enquiry, paying only lip service to the authority of the Vedas. The same may be said to be true of law which was an appendage to sacred literature only in the period of the sūtras. Even earlier than the earliest of the known metrical smṛtis, the artha śāstra tradition had recognised that politics and administration were outside the domain of the sacred." <sup id="cite_ref-1016" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1016">[1,016]</a></sup></dd>

Many of the selections from sources included here advise their audiences on the roles proper for various situations and consider some of the complexities and ambiguities that arise in living according to their discipline. [...] Deeply embedded in Hindu notions of marriage is a disposition toward protection. It is the husband’s obligation to protect his wife from external predators and temptations and to invest in a relationship that will sustain her commitment to him and his world. At the same time, it is the obligation of the wife to protect her husband by feeding, caring for him, and investing in a relationship that will sustain his commitment." <sup id="cite_ref-1021" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1021">[1,021]</a></sup> However, no evidence could be found for actual enforcement of this behaviour--e.g. punishment for mistreating one's parents.

Medical materials included two kinds of camphor, coriander, pepper, mustard, cardamom, molasses, cumin, pine resin, ginger, and onions. An ointment for fevers was made from 10 plants. A total of 1,960 boxes of salve were produced to treat hemorrhoids. Each hospital had two doctors and assistants, two dispensary workers, two cooks who also helped clean, people whose job was to heat water, medicine preparers, and various other staff, including temple attendants who made offerings to Buddha.'<sup id="cite_ref-1058" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1058">[1,058]</a></sup></dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Care of orphans  ♣ inferred present ♥</b> Possibly in temples: 'The Hindu devaraja model of state organization had created a strict pyrami- dal structure in which the god-king was the top of the pyramid, owned all land and agricultural surplus, and legitimated his power and wealth by being seen as divine. Below the king were the other nobility and the thousands of priests dedi- cated to the king’s royal cults. At the bottom of the pyramid were the majority of Khmers, com- moners who farmed, built temples, waged war, and otherwise supported the god-king’s hold over them. With the adoption of Buddhism, which was quickly embraced by most Khmers, this kind of hierarchy could no longer be main- tained. Buddhism’s teachings about equality, salvation, and karma all led to a severe weak- ening of subsequent god-kings’ hold over their subjects. [...] The Buddhist Khmer kings saw them- selves as responsible to their people in terms of providing assistance during difficult times. They were obliged to care for the old and sick; they also began building and maintaining civil infrastructure such as roads and canals as part of their responsibility to their people. This situa- tion differed from the pattern that had emerged earlier, in which the god-king simply used his people as servants and laborers to build struc- tures to glorify himself and in which all wealth flowed upward to the top of the pyramid. The Buddhist kings saw themselves as father figures to their people, worthy of respect and having authority over them but also having responsi- bility to raise them up and care for their needs.'<sup id="cite_ref-1059" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1059">[1,059]</a></sup></dd>

This month they call jia-de [kia-to] [P: (Khmer) katik), from Sanskrit kartikka]. In from of the royal palace a big platform is set up which can accommodate more than a thousand persons, and is embellished with lanterns and flowers. In front, at a distance of twenty fathoms [Rather less than 40 m], by means of wooden posts put on end, a high platform is built, in the same shape as the scaffoldings bed to build a stupa [Yang (1994), citing Xia (1981) and the Shoufu A text, indicates that the character for stupa should read that for "erect", and the phrase should read "in the same shape as the scaffoldings to erect a pagan", not notes that the meaning of pagan is uncertain], and more than twenty fathoms high. Each night three, four, or even five or six are built. Rockets and fireworks are placed on top. The cost of this is borne by the provinces and princely households. At nightfall, the sovereign is invited to witness the spectacle. The rockets are fired off and the fireworks lit. The rockets can be seen for more than a hundred li away; and the [scaffolding for the] petards is as big as ballistae [an exaggeration], and their explosions shake the whole city. The mandarins and nobility provide candles and areca [nuts]; their expenses are considerable. The sovereign invites foreign ambassadors to witness the spectacle.

There is room on it for a thousand or more people. It is hung everywhere with globe lanterns and flowers. Facing it on a bank between 60 - 95 metres away are some tall towers that are made of wood joined and bound together, like the scaffolding used to make a pagoda. They must be well over 60 metres high. Every night they put up three to six of these and set out fireworks and firecrackers on top of them. The various provincial officials and the great houses take care of all the costs. When night comes the king is invited to come out and watch. He lights the fireworks and firecrackers - the fireworks can all be seen 5 kilometres away. The firecrackers are as big as the rocks thrown by catapults and make enough noise to shake the whole city. All the officials and members of the royal family give their share of huge candles and betel nuts, and spend a great deal. The king also invites foreign envoys as spectators.

Wat Mahathat at Lopburi is another foundation that probably reflects Angkorian political dominance of some form in central Thailand. <sup id="cite_ref-1090" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1090">[1,090]</a></sup> This seems to indicate that regions in the periphery of Angkor were dominated by it, which probably involved some kind of tributary payment (RA).</dd></dl>

The land’s income from the production of the land and the labour of indentured workers could be ‘tapped for redistribution by the family to its supporters’ (Hall 1985: 137; 159), the immunities from taxation and other levies (Section 8.3) being an additional benefit. Because the exemptions to the foundations were given in perpetuity, the total of all the taxation immunities granted would have had a cumulative impact on the finances of the Khmer state (Sahai 1977b: 134). The impact of this is known for other states, which encouraged the establishment of religious institutions through gifts of land and tax exemptions, or allowed merchants to profit from tax farming.'<sup id="cite_ref-1091" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1091">[1,091]</a></sup></dd>
