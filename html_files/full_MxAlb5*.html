<p>The Monte Alban V period is generally known for the balkianisation of polities in the valley.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> The length assigned to the Monte Albán V phase is due to the consistency of ceramic style throughout the period, and lack of evidence for major changes in other archaeological remains. There may have been many changes over these centuries, but it has been argued that the conservatism of ceramics suggests a time of relative political stability.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> The primary evidence for this period comes from the accounts written by the Spanish after they arrived in the 1520s. This means that there is much more information than previous periods for certain aspects of life for the inhabitants of Oaxaca, such as the name for the head of the ruling class (the coquitao or “great lord”) and full-time priests (bigaña),<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> but less information in other respects as there were no longer any monumental buildings or large settlements being constructed. The unified valley under the Zapotec state had gone by this period, replaced by around 15-20 smaller polities<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> which were often fighting one another (as suggested by the widespread use of fortifications and descriptions in the ethnohistoric records),<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> but the overall population of the valley continued to increase to the highest number yet reached in the valley.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> In addition, craft work and specialisation became more widespread, with more finely decorated ceramics being produced throughout the valley and were not just concentrated in the main settlements as before.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>

Taking a broad view of administration [...] one can identify several governing specialists in the 16th sources, for example: coquitao (king), coquihualao (prince), xoana (minor noble), golaba (lord's solicitor or barrio head), uija-tao (high priest), bigaña (lower-ranking priests).

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ patron deity ritual ♥</b> NOTE: The following refers to the seventeenth century, but it seems like a fairly reasonable inference that the ritual system described by Spanish witnesses at that time emerged in the Post-Classic phase. "A major ceremony in honor of the patron deity of the city-state, usually Pezeelao, was held on a specific day assigned to him in the sacred calendar, perhaps the last day of the ritual cycle, 13 Lao or Pece Lao, his probable namesake. Because this day was in the sacred calendar of 260 days, it was a moveable ceremony with respect to the solar year and could even occur twice within a given solar year, although 260 days apart. This ceremony involved a human sacrifice, usually a war captive, and was accompanied by feasting, drinking, music, and dancing, as were all major ceremonies. [...] David Tavarez (2005) has reported ritual songs in early eighteenth-century documents from the Sierra Juarez that relate to Zapotec deities. It seems likely that these ritual songs were sung at one or another of these ceremonies honoring each of these deities. In Zapotec, the songs were called <i>dij dola nicachi</i>, or 'wooden drum songs,' and were performed in a plaza in front of the entire community by musicians (<i>belao</i> in Zapotec) including singers who sang the songs to the beat of wooden drums (<i>nicachi</i> in Zapotec, <i>teponaxtli</i> in Nahuatl)." <sup id="cite_ref-179" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-179">[179]</a></sup> "The ceremonies [in honour of the patron deity] involved the participation of all the communities within the city-state whose member brought offerings of quail, turkeys, dogs, feathers, and precious stones to the major temple in the capital. The high point of the celebration involved the sacrifice of a war captive who was placed over a sacrificial stone in the temple and had his heart removed and offered to the patron deity." <sup id="cite_ref-180" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-180">[180]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ consultation of colaní priests ♥</b> NOTE: The following refers to the seventeenth century, but it seems like a fairly reasonable inference that the ritual system described by Spanish witnesses at that time emerged in the Post-Classic phase. "Colaní were involved in the life of every Zapotec commoner from the day they were born until the day they died. Colaní gave Zapotecs their principal names based on the day in the sacred calendar on which the latter was born. The infants' vocations were likewise predicted by colaní. When children reached the age of reason, colaní introduced them to their tone, or animal companion, who accompanied them throughout life. When people planned to marry, colaní determined the compatibility or incompatibility of the couple and predicted if the child would be born alive, die, or be gravely ill. Following birth, the colaní performed the ritual of the sweat bath for the new mother and sacrificed a turkey to Pitao Huichaana in the new parents' home.</dd>
<dd>"Any serious illness or injury that a person suffered required consultation with a colaní, who would determine from the sacred calendar the deity responsible and perform the necessary rituals to appease that deity. [...] When a person died the family consulted colaní who offered sacrifices to Pitao Pezeelao, to keep further death and disease away from their doors, and to Pitao Huichaana, to purify the room in which the deceased had succumbed. [...] "The omens and dreams a person experienced were interpreted by colaní who consulted ritual books and determined the deity responsible, usually Pitao Peeze, the god of omens.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ patron deity ritual ♥</b> NOTE: The following refers to the seventeenth century, but it seems like a fairly reasonable inference that the ritual system described by Spanish witnesses at that time emerged in the Post-Classic phase. "A major ceremony in honor of the patron deity of the city-state, usually Pezeelao, was held on a specific day assigned to him in the sacred calendar, perhaps the last day of the ritual cycle, 13 Lao or Pece Lao, his probable namesake. Because this day was in the sacred calendar of 260 days, it was a moveable ceremony with respect to the solar year and could even occur twice within a given solar year, although 260 days apart. This ceremony involved a human sacrifice, usually a war captive, and was accompanied by feasting, drinking, music, and dancing, as were all major ceremonies. [...] David Tavarez (2005) has reported ritual songs in early eighteenth-century documents from the Sierra Juarez that relate to Zapotec deities. It seems likely that these ritual songs were sung at one or another of these ceremonies honoring each of these deities. In Zapotec, the songs were called <i>dij dola nicachi</i>, or 'wooden drum songs,' and were performed in a plaza in front of the entire community by musicians (<i>belao</i> in Zapotec) including singers who sang the songs to the beat of wooden drums (<i>nicachi</i> in Zapotec, <i>teponaxtli</i> in Nahuatl)." <sup id="cite_ref-303" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-303">[303]</a></sup> "The ceremonies [in honour of the patron deity] involved the participation of all the communities within the city-state whose member brought offerings of quail, turkeys, dogs, feathers, and precious stones to the major temple in the capital.

</p><p><b>Description of the Normative Ideology</b>
</p><p>"At Monte Albán, Liobaa-phase evidence shows that as the architecture of the Main Plaza fell to ruins people returned to conduct rituals in the empty ceremonial center (Herrera 2002; A. Joyce 2009a). Ritual practices involved the placement of offerings in Classic-period tombs and TPAs. The most common objects in ritual deposits were miniature ceramic vessels, incense burners, penates (small stone figurines), and obsidian blades, all of which were associated with death, sacrifice, and ancestors. The data indicate that rituals in TPAs and tombs were being carried out to contact deities and ancestors to petition them for health and prosperity and perhaps to bring harm to enemies.
</p><p>"Zapotecs removed the contents of several tombs from Classic-period highstatus residences and replaced them with offerings of miniature vessels and penates. The people who reused tombs must have known their location and may have been the descendants of the nobles who had lived in the residences and were buried in the tombs. The removal of bones from ancestral tombs referenced memories of a glorious past, but also the changed circumstances of Early Postclassic nobles now removed from their spatial and symbolic association with the sacred mountain and apparently living in much humbler circumstances in communities on the valley floor.
</p><p>"Liobaa-phase offerings recovered in TPAs, especially those in the North and South Platforms, consisted of thousands of objects resulting from repeated rituals over the course of several centuries, which suggests the continuous “feeding” of sacrificial offerings to the divine (Herrera 2002; A. Joyce 2009a). The use of common objects such as miniature utilitarian ceramics and obsidian artifacts suggests that a much broader range of people participated in these rituals relative to the highly restricted practices of the Classic period. Offerings in TPAs commemorated earlier ceremonies and the deeper history of the Main Plaza as a sacred mountain of creation. Yet the rituals also created new memories of a sacred past and a cosmic creation that was no longer dominated by powerful nobles, but instead was the product of the sacred work of a much wider range of people, thereby constituting the more egalitarian social relations of the Early Postclassic. Early Postclassic offerings at Monte Albán are related to an expansion of similar rituals in other ruined sites and caves, involving communication with and sacrifice to gods and ancestors in places viewed as interfaces with the divine (Winter et al. 2007:195- 6)." <sup id="cite_ref-736" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-736">[736]</a></sup>

<dl><dd>For this section, include any type of supernatural punishment or reward either in this lifetime (e.g., curses, good fortune) or in the afterlife (e.g., hell, reincarnation). This includes generalized impersonal punishment/reward (e.g., karma, mana) as well as punishment by specific supernatural beings. Include specific details of the nature and extent of punishment/reward in the description. Code "compound" moral actions (e.g., filial piety = kin + respect) in multiple categories as necessary. Morality categories are based on Moral Foundations Theory (Haidt &amp; Graham, 2007) and Morality-As-Cooperation theory (Curry, 2016).</dd>

<dd><b>♠ respect for authority ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> "The codical appearances of oracles not only as great priests, but also as arbitrators in dynastic disputes between Lord 8 Deer, Lady 6 Monkey, and Lord 4 Wind are confirmed in Burgoa’s references to the powers with which Oaxacan oracles were invested. For instance, the oracle of Achiutla was said to have had superior authority over the Mixtec kings in deciding matters of peace and war. Burgoa (1934a 25: 319; Pohl 1994) even refers to temple armies that the priests could use to enforce their decisions. The <i>Vuijatao</i> at Mitla was likewise said to have had superior authority over the Zapotec kings in many affairs of state (Burgoa 1934a 26: 125). [...] In conclusion, the oracles of Oaxaca were not rulers in their own right, but rather they were empowered to adjudicate those aspects of the social order that entailed problems of divine inheritance and the well being of extended royal kinship structures as a whole. This view is consistent with Spanish references to the oracles not as kings, but as late renaissance archbishops, or as in the case of Mitla, a ‘pope’."  <sup id="cite_ref-745" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-745">[745]</a></sup> Of course this does not actually constitute evidence for the enforcement of respect for authority, but it seems relevant.</dd>

<dd><b>♠ Ritual buildings/spaces ♣ present ♥</b> EARLY POSTCLASSIC: From Phase 1: "At Monte Albán, Liobaa-phase evidence shows that as the architecture of the Main Plaza fell to ruins people returned to conduct rituals in the empty ceremonial center (Herrera 2002; A. Joyce 2009a). Ritual practices involved the placement of offerings in Classic-period tombs and TPAs. The most common objects in ritual deposits were miniature ceramic vessels, incense burners, penates (small stone figurines), and obsidian blades, all of which were associated with death, sacrifice, and ancestors. The data indicate that rituals in TPAs and tombs were being carried out to contact deities and ancestors to petition them for health and prosperity and perhaps to bring harm to enemies. From Phase 1: "Zapotecs removed the contents of several tombs from Classic-period highstatus residences and replaced them with offerings of miniature vessels and penates. The people who reused tombs must have known their location and may have been the descendants of the nobles who had lived in the residences and were buried in the tombs. The removal of bones from ancestral tombs referenced memories of a glorious past, but also the changed circumstances of Early Postclassic nobles now removed from their spatial and symbolic association with the sacred mountain and apparently living in much humbler circumstances in communities on the valley floor. "Liobaa-phase offerings recovered in TPAs, especially those in the North and South Platforms, consisted of thousands of objects resulting from repeated rituals over the course of several centuries, which suggests the continuous “feeding” of sacrificial offerings to the divine (Herrera 2002; A. Joyce 2009a). The use of common objects such as miniature utilitarian ceramics and obsidian artifacts suggests that a much broader range of people participated in these rituals relative to the highly restricted practices of the Classic period. Offerings in TPAs commemorated earlier ceremonies and the deeper history of the Main Plaza as a sacred mountain of creation. Yet the rituals also created new memories of a sacred past and a cosmic creation that was no longer dominated by powerful nobles, but instead was the product of the sacred work of a much wider range of people, thereby constituting the more egalitarian social relations of the Early Postclassic. Early Postclassic offerings at Monte Albán are related to an expansion of similar rituals in other ruined sites and caves, involving communication with and sacrifice to gods and ancestors in places viewed as interfaces with the divine (Winter et al. 2007:195- 6)." <sup id="cite_ref-788" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-788">[788]</a></sup> LATE POSTCLASSIC: From Phase 1: "Like the Yagul palace, the Group of the Columns at Mitla was a combined residential and public space near the center of the city (figure 8.8b). The group consists of two large patios (measuring about 40 m on a side) surrounded by four rooms set on high platforms (Barber &amp; Joyce 2006: 241- 2). Both the interior and the exterior walls were elaborately decorated with stone mosaics (figure 8.9; less elaborate mosaics are present in tombs and monumental buildings at the nearby sites of Yagul and Xaagá). The southern patio contains two large cruciform tombs that were probably the repositories for the ancestral bundles cared for by the great priest. The northern patio group resembled Patio F at Yagul, but on an even larger scale. Facing the patio on its north side was a temple with six columns that provided access through a narrow passageway to a high-status house. A public patio and temple therefore fronted a highly restricted residence.</dd>
