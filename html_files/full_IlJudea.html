<dd><b> ♠ relationship to preceding (quasi)polity ♣ continuity ♥ </b> This coding is arguable. The code book doesn't have a good descriptor for "successful political rebellion"; the new elites who ejected the Seleucids, the Hasmonean dynasty, were native to Judea, so "elite migration" doesn't really fit either. "Cultural assimilation" might fit, perhaps. At any rate, in 153 BCE the Hasmonean leader Jonathan "Apphus," having led a years-long guerrilla war against the Seleucids after the death of his brother (Judah the Maccabbi), was confirmed as High Priest and ruler of the Jews as a vassal of the Seleucid claimant Alexander Balas. In the swirl of conflict over the Seleucid throne, Jonathan fell into a trap and was executed in 142 BCE; he was succeeded by his brother Simon, who achieved a measure of quasi-independence from the Seleucids—though he remained a vassal and the population retained strong elements of Hellenism. Simon was confirmed as High King and Prince in a popular assembly in 141 BCE.</dd>
<dd><b> ♠ succeeding (quasi)polity  ♣ Late Roman Republic ♥ </b> Two brothers of the Hasmonean dynasty, King Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II, contended for the throne in continual civil wars and intrigues from 67-63 BCE.

<p>The Judea (originally Yehuda) polity of 141 - 63 BCE was formed when Simon Thassi, brother of the executed Jonathan Apphus who had waged war against the Seleucids, was elected as High King and Prince in a popular assembly in 141 BCE. Simon achieved a measure of quasi-independence from the Seleucids—though he remained a vassal and the population retained strong elements of Hellenism.
</p><p>According to archaeologists, it seems that Galilee was only sparsely settled before this period, and that the conquering of territories and increase in Jewish communities coming into the area contributed to the rise in permanent settlements and population during this time. However, agreements over the population differs widely, with estimates on the largest settlement, Jerusalem, ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 people.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p><p>Judea was a sophisticated, well-organised and equipped society, with markets, established trade routes, water transportation infrastructure, aqueducts and cisterns, temples and palaces, sporting arenas, libraries, and many other modern features.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>

<p><b> ♠ Polity territory ♣ [5,000-10,000] ♥ </b> in squared kilometers. Very rough estimate from the varying descriptions of Judean territory. Records are not precise enough to provide finer-grained estimates by king.
</p><p><b> ♠ Polity Population ♣ ♥ </b> People.
</p><p>Leibner,<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> in his archaeological survey of the Southeastern Galilee exclusively, estimates a population of some 10,000 people based on the distribution of pottery fragments, but acknowledges a possible range from 4,000 to 17,000. From the archaeological record, it seems that prior to the Hasmoneans, the Galilee was sparsely settled; the Hasmoneans conquered the territory and began a massive wave of Jewish settlement, suggesting strong demographic pressures within the Judean heartland.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ [10,000-100,000] ♥ </b> Inhabitants. The population size of Jerusalem is the subject of wildly different views. Tacitus believed that during the Jewish revolt of 66-73 CE (some years after the Hasmonean period ended), Jerusalem had some 600,000 inhabitants; archaeological estimates of the population within the defensive walls range between 80,000<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> and 20,000<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> (which is almost certainly far too low; Geva assumes that much of the enclosed territory of Jerusalem was actually uninhabited, being royal or Temple precincts, but it is hard to imagine that such extensive buildings and fortifications could have been produced by so few people). Both estimates are based on population-density coefficients; however, it is not clear that the coefficients in use are reasonable. "Some of the densities recently put forward for area coefficients have been based on unwalled, premodern villages…. How similar is such a village to a walled Bronze or Iron Age town or city? Although this is not a case of comparing apples and oranges (more like oranges and grapefruit), it seems probable that the economic constraints of building a defensive system put a permanent physical limit on the settlement area," leading to higher population densities.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> (Another possibility that I have seen noted, but not in the scholarly literature, is that much of the population associated with a given ANE city might not have lived inside its walls at all, but would be semi-nomadic pastoralists circulating within its economic orbit. Such pastoralists would leave little trace archaeologically, which would pose problems for conventional population estimates.)
</p><p>In any event, Jerusalem is generally believed to have grown significantly under the rule of Herod Antipas, immediately after the Hasmonean era ended.
</p><p><b>♠ Largest communication distance ♣ [150-190] ♥</b> in kilometers. We are basing ourselves on the distance between Jerusalem and Gamla (east of the Sea of Galilee), the capital of the Golan region. The distance is some 140 km as the crow flies but more like 190 km by modern roads, and the Golan is a mountainous area, making direct travel unlikely.

</p><p>Speaking exclusively of Southeastern Galilee, Leibner comments: "[Almost] all of the large settlements (20 dunams and greater) are located at the margins of the valleys or abutting extensive patches of alluvial soil…. This is also true among the smaller sites; most are located in proximity to extensive agricultural plains.… [and] near a permanent water source. The pattern that emerges is of a series of medium and large-sized settlements near extensive areas suitable for agriculture… most fortified or at the very least with natural fortifications. In addition to these, there are a few small settlements [of less than 10 dunams area], mostly in fortified locations, with no small farms at all in the agricultural areas."<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>

<p><b> ♠ Symbolic buildings ♣ present ♥ </b> The most spectacular example was, of course, the Temple in Jerusalem.
</p><p><b> ♠ Entertainment buildings ♣ inferred present ♥ </b> The Books of Maccabees indicate that the Seleucids authorized the building of gymnasia and sporting arenas during their rule (e.g. 2 Maccabees 4), and Herod Antipas (who helped bring the Hasmonean era to a violent close) is known to have built numerous amphitheaters and Greco-Roman sport facilities during his rule. Unless the Hasmoneans systematically demolished all of the existing sporting venues (which is possible, given that they were seen as religious affronts), then such buildings would still have been present in some form.
</p><p><b> ♠ Knowledge/information buildings ♣ unknown ♥ </b> It is likely that the Jerusalem Temple featured archives for internal or royal use. Several scholars (such as Jan Gunneweg) believe that many of the Dead Sea Scrolls originated at one or several libraries in Jerusalem, and were hidden at Qumran following the Jewish Revolt against Rome c. 70 C.E. At present, there is little hard evidence.

<p>The Hasmonean palace in Jerusalem itself, which could be assumed to be the most impressive building, has not been found or excavated. However, the winter-palace complex near Jericho has been partly excavated,<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> and was a remarkable achievement for its time; notably, it featured several large swimming pools more than 3 meters deep, filled with water conveyed by conduit from springs to the north, at a time when swimming pools were extremely rare. The complex also featured a large formal garden and paved plazas. During the reign of Alexander Yannai, the palace at the center of the complex was built over with a "fortified palace," defended with thick walls and tall towers; it would have been meant only to hold off a minor disturbance until troops from the nearby fortresses could be summoned. During the reign of Alexandra Salome, the "Twin Palaces" were built south of the pools, perhaps to accommodate each of her sons Yochanan Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II (who would later fight a series of wars with each other).

<p>The use of measurement systems in Judea at this time seems to have been eclectic. The ancient Israelite measurements such as sheqels, amot, and se'ot were still in use in religious contexts, but it is unclear whether they were used in daily life. In commercial matters, Greek measurements seem to have been common, and perhaps even predominated—not surprising, given the hundreds of years of Hellenistic control before the Hasmonean revolt.

<dl><dd><b> ♠ Length ♣ present ♥ </b> For example, the Books of Maccabees often reference Greek units of measurement such as <i>stadia</i> and <i>schoinoi</i> (e.g. 2 Maccabees 11:5, 12:9); however, it is unknown whether this was an artifact of the Greek translation, and if the original Hebrew used other units. The use of "cubits" and "handbreadths" is attested to as far as the Biblical era, as well as other measurements taken from Egypt and Mesopotamia.</dd>
<dd><b> ♠ Area ♣ inferred present ♥ </b> The Mishna often uses area measures that describe the amount of land necessary to produce, for example, a <i>se'ah</i> of grain ("<i>beit se'ah</i>"), a practice which dates back to Mesopotamia.</dd>
<dd><b> ♠ Volume ♣ present ♥ </b> The use of standardized units such as <i>se'ah</i> is attested to back into the Iron Age.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup></dd>

<dd><b> ♠ Geometrical ♣ inferred present ♥ </b> The Hasmoneans lived hundreds of years after Pythagoras and Euclid, and Judea bordered the celebrated Phoenician city-states (known for their mathematicians). A Hebrew mathematical text, משנת המדות (<i>Mishnat haMiddot</i>, "Review of the Measurements"), is typically dated to about 150 C.E. or some two centuries after our period (though some scholars such as Sarfatti argued that it is many centuries older);<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> it is likely that given the heavy influence of Hellenic civilization and the construction of complex siege engines (see below) that geometry was known at least to some degree during the Hasmonean period.</dd>

<p>Direct evidence for the armor used by the Hasmonean armies is thin: "The main frustration is, of course, that during the Second Temple period, especially between the Maccabean uprising and the destruction of the Second Temple, Jews upheld the Second Commandment—the prohibition on making any graven images—quite strictly. For this reason there is no figurative Jewish art from this period; although the use of symbols was widespread, and pictures of plants and even animals can often be found, human figures are not depicted."<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup> The main types of evidence are thus the scanty literary references in Josephus and others, inference from the armor in use during previous eras, and comparison with neighboring Hellenic powers.

</p><p>"In all these three cases [quoted from I Maccabees] the Temple [in Jerusalem] is the main Jewish identity marker, together with the Law/Torah. Although the centrality of Temple and Torah in ancient Judaism is obvious, the fact that the Temple shares equal prominence with the Torah attests to its prominence. The juxtaposition of the Temple to the Torah in its entirety, as if these were two separate entities of equal value, demonstrates the centrality of the Temple. It also shows that the author found it necessary to present Simon as a religious leader, the savior and protector of the Jewish religion and its institutions."<sup id="cite_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-57">[57]</a></sup>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Temple Pilgrimage ♥</b> "According to Scripture, every adult Israelite male is to appear before God three times in a year…. The manner in which Jews observed this requirement was highly inconsistent. Some went up to the Temple [in Jerusalem] several times in a year, or at least once a year… some several times in a lifetime, some once in a lifetime, and many probably did not practice pilgrimage at all. The pilgrimage to Jerusalem was made on the feasts of Passover, Pentecost [<i>Shavuot</i>] and Tabernacles [<i>Sukkot</i>]. At each feast, tens of thousands of Jews from Judaea, Galilee, and the Diaspora went up to the Temple and offered sacrifices. The pilgrims needed to provide themselves with a substantial amount of money to defray the expenses of the journey and the prescribed sacrifices."<sup id="cite_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup> "There is sufficient evidence to conclude that pilgrimage to Jerusalem had emerged already in the Hasmonean period, and that the Hasmoneans played a significant role in its development. This was an outstanding religious and political achievement, since international pilgrimage was not a common phenomenon in the Greco-Roman world."<sup id="cite_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-59">[59]</a></sup></dd>

Simon Maccabeus, brother of the murdered Jonathan, is appointed High Priest and <i>ethnarch</i> by Demetrius II, and is acclaimed by the people as <i>Nasi</i> (prince) in 141 BCE. 2. Simon and his two eldest sons are assassinated in 135 BCE by his son-in-law; Simon's third son, John Hyrcanus I, escapes assassination and becomes High Priest and <i>ethnarch</i>. 3. Hyrcanus I dies c. 104 BCE; he wanted the leadership to pass to his wife, with his eldest son, Aristobulus I becoming High Priest only; but Aristobulus jails his mother (who starves to death) and his brothers and declares himself <i>basileus</i>, i.e. king. 4. Aristobulus dies in 103 BCE of a painful illness; his brothers are released and Alexander Jannaeus becomes king. 5. Alexander Jannaeus dies during the siege of Ragaba in 76 BCE, and is succeeded by his wife, Queen Salome Alexandra. Her son Hyrcanus II becomes High Priest and is designated as Salome's successor. 6. Salome dies in 67 BCE and is succeeded by Hyrcanus II. 7. Hyrcanus rules for only 3 months before his brother, Aristobulus II, leads a rebellion. His forces defeat those of Hyrcanus, and the latter is stripped of the kingship and the High Priesthood. 8. Pompey the Great intervenes on the side of Hyrcanus II in 63 BCE; Hyrcanus II is restored to the throne, but this marks the effective end of Judea as an independent power.</dd>

</p><p><b>Description of the Normative Ideology</b>
</p><p>"The Second Temple period begins with the rebuilding of the Temple in 520-515 bce and ends with its destruction in 70 ce. It was a time of momentous change in Judaism and of remarkable richness for Jewish literature, thought, and religion. The entire Hebrew Bible was written or assembled at this time, as was a large corpus of extra-canonical literature in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek. The Temple in Jerusalem, destroyed by the Babylonians in 587 bce, was rebuilt and was the center of Jewish religion. [...] The written Torah came into being in the Second Temple period, and by the end of the period there was a collection of sacred texts that were becoming a fixed canon." <sup id="cite_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-64">[64]</a></sup>

<p><b>♠ Rulers are legitimated by gods ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> "When Jonathan died in 142 bce, he was succeeded by his brother Simon. Simon was granted the power to mint his own coins, which amounted to granting Judah independence. That same year, Simon succeeded in expelling the Seleucid garrison from the Akra, a move that was both symbolic and substantive in overthrowing Seleucid hegemony. 1 Macc. 14 contains a declaration by the priests, elders, and people of Judah proclaiming Simon leader and high priest and allowing him to wear royal apparel 'until a trustworthy prophet should arise' (14:41). This qualification may indicate that although the Hasmoneans were accepted as kings and high priests, there was a consciousness that things were not as they should be. It is possible that there were some supporters of Hasmonean rule who thought that God would eventually restore the Davidic monarchy and the Zadokite high priesthood." <sup id="cite_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup>

(We have little evidence for this complicated code of purity in pre-exilic times, though the example of Bathsheba in 2 Sam. 11:4 suggests that people in the time of David already regarded menstruation as requiring purification - assuming that the story genuinely reflects that time, of course.) In general it is assumed in the Old Testament that women do not take initiatives in society but remain in the home, very much like women in classical Greece: only prostitutes go about freely, or characters such as the 'strange woman' in Prov. 7:6-27, who is certainly not an example to be imitated.

</p><p><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of monogamy ♣ absent ♥</b> "The Jewish scriptures recognize that polygyny exists and regulate its consequences (Exod 21:10; Deut 21:15-17), but they neither endorse it nor institute it by enactment. Polygyny, as the marriage of the same man to two or more wives with the same legal status, is distinct in scripture from concubinage, in which a man took secondary wives (usually foreigners or women of lower social standing). It is distinct, too, from a sexual relationship between a free man and a slave woman of his household, which seems to have been unrestricted. Lamech is the first polygamist named in the scriptures (Gen 4:19-24). Others include Esau (Gen 26:34; 28:9; 36:1-5), Elkanah (1 Sam 1:2), and Jacob (Gen 29:15-30).//Although the scriptures presuppose that polygyny is valid, they invite the reader to regard it with suspicion. Some unspecified doom is attached to the brief narrative about Lamech, a descendant of Cain, although nothing in the text attributes his misfortune to his having had two wives. Deuteronomy 17:17 counsels that a king should not have many wives lest his heart be distracted. Solomon’s downfall is attributed to his having many wives and concubines, although his attachment to foreign women may have been the chief source of his troubles (1 Kgs 11:1-6). The polygamous marriages of Esau, Elkanah, and Jacob were marred by favoritism and by discord among wives. The story of Abraham, his wife Sarah, and her foreign handmaid Hagar (Gen 16) drives that message home, although Hagar was presumably only a sexual partner, and not Abraham’s wife in the proper sense (notwithstanding Gen 16:3). But these negative associations fall short of opprobrium. Every family has it dysfunctional aspects, and the Jewish scriptures do not idealize the human condition." <sup id="cite_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-74">[74]</a></sup>

Its source is Leviticus chapter 19 where other ethical commands included not hating one's neighbour, not putting a stumbling block before the blind or cursing the deaf, and rebuking an offender so that he realises what is wrong. These were combined with the almost ubiquitous exhortation to remember what it was like to be a slave, repeated more than any other phrase in the Bible, and the command to look after the widow and the orphan, the second most repeated phrase.

Anything that brings Judaism or God into disrepute is one of the major misdemeanours that, according to the Talmud, even the Day of Atonement cannot atone for and affects one's afterlife as well.

Some impurities require simple purification rituals (washing, sacrifice), while others have the most dire consequences not only for individuals but for the entire nation. Leviticus 15:19-24, on the impurity of menstruation, illustrates ritual impurity: menstruation is an entirely natural process, no kind of moral stigma attaches to it, but it causes a mild impurity that requires abstention from sexual relations, bathing, and putting on clean clothes. Leviticus 18:24-30, on the other hand, speaks of the 'defilement' caused by engaging in the 'abominable' practices of pagan nations, which is so powerful that it will cause the land to 'vomit the inhabitants out', and the offenders to be 'cut off'.

<dd> <b>♠ loss/seizure of property or wealth ♣ inferred present ♥</b> This variable and similar ones are meant to capture whether or not religious agents (e.g. priests, religiously motivated individuals) had the power to punish moral transgressions independently of the state. The way the legal process worked in this polity is somewhat confusing in this regard: on the one hand, priests presided trials alongside judges, or instead of judges in certain circumstances, and the law had a moral or religious base; on the other hand, it seems entirely possible that these proceedings did not occur independently of the state, and ancient sources simply did not deem this an important detail. Overall, though, since the only biblical instances in which the king or his representatives is in charge of justice refer to rulers preceding this polity, it seems fairly reasonable to infer this variable as present. "The most extensive information on the constitution of the court proper comes from legislation in Deuteronomy. According to Deuteronomy 16:18, local 'judges' (sopetim, sing. sopet) are appointed to oversee trials (cf. Deut 19:17-18; 25:1-2). Deuteronomy is quite consistent in the use of plural language to describe these judges' actions (an exception occurs in Deut 25:2), which suggests that more than one judge would usually hear a case. These judges also function together with city elders (Deut 21:2) and priests (Deut 17:9; 19:17). Although Deuteronomy does contain one statement of the priests' broad judicial authority—'by their decision all cases of dispute and assault shall be settled' (21:5)—the role of the priests in Deuteronomy seems to be to make judgments from the temple in those cases in which lower courts do not have sufficient evidence.

Thus, for example, theft and slaughter of an ox require five oxen as restitution; a sheep necessitates four in return (Exod 22:1; cf. 2 Sam 12:6). [...] In the case of nonfatal injury, the perpetrator pays for the loss of time and arranges for complete recovery (Exod 21:18-19; cf. HL 10). In the event that an owner causes the loss of an eye or the tooth of his slave, the slave is set free—which represents a significant financial loss to the owner (Exod 21:26-27). In a discussion of personal injuries, Exodus 21:22 requires a punishment determined by the husband—with judicial consent—for the one who strikes a pregnant woman resulting in a miscarriage. [...] Exodus 22:16-17 mandates that a man who deflowers a virgin to whom he is not engaged must pay her father the bride-price and, if her father is willing, marry the woman (cf. Deut 22:28-29; MAL A 55-56). Leviticus 19:20-21 requires a man who has sex with a slave woman engaged to another man to bring a ram as an offering of compensation." <sup id="cite_ref-108" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-108">[108]</a></sup></dd>
