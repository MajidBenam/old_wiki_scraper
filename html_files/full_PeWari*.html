</p><p>"What the Wari called themselves or their empire we do not know—archaeologists and art historians use the term “Wari” because that is the modern name of the site that was its capital. At the time of the Spanish conquest, how- ever, that ancient city was called “Vinaque.” Could this have been the name of the capital, the people, or the empire in Wari times? Another possibility exists. A legend recorded in the sixteenth century about the Wari capital stated that it was built by a people who were bearded and white (see pp. 5-27, “The History of Inquiry into the Wari and Their Arts”). A similar legend was told about a Wari provincial center, Jincamocco; in this version the strangers were termed “Viracochas.” The Inca gave the name Viracocha to their creator deity, the god who brought civilization to the Andes. Does this name perhaps harken back to the earlier empire— Wari, which first brought this form of civilization to the Andes? Or does Viracocha simply refer to any foreigner, as the term does today? Sadly, we cannot answer these questions with any degree of certainty." <sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>

"While some ceramic evidence exists in Cuzco for Wari activity during Epoch 1A (ca. A.D. 500 - 600), extensive Wari presence did not occur until Epoch 1B (ca. A.D. 600 - 700). At this time, the Wari began building Pikillacta, occupying it during its construction. [...] During Epoch 1B until sometime in Epoch 2 (ca. A.D. 700 - 800), Pikillacta continued to be built and occupied. [...] Sometime during Epoch 2, but perhaps somewhat later, Wari activity at Pikillacta began to decrease. [...] Pikillacta was finally abandoned, although Wari activity in the Cuzco region may have persisted." <sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>.
</p><p>According to Alan Covey: "The dates that McEwan and Glowacki offer for early Wari colonization (before AD 600) are based on their interpretation of relative ceramic chronologies, and the presumably earlier Huaro area colonization has not been dated absolutely.  Maeve Skidmore completed a dissertation at SMU in 2014 with excavations at a Wari colony site, and she concluded that there was an intensification of Wari state relationships with their own colonists after AD 800.  That would be my sense of the general chronology right now:  an early Wari colonization around AD 600, an intensification of state efforts to extend administrative control over Wari and local populations around AD 800, and a failure of that intensification process by AD 1000." <sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>

<p>Wari periodization, according to Menzel (summary quoted from Giersz and Makowski 2014):
</p><p>"In the 1960s, Dorothy Menzel undertook a monumental and influential comparative study of pieces found in collections and the relatively scant ceramic sherds derived from test pits in Wari sites, some of which already had the first radiocarbon dates. The relative chronology of the Middle Horizon, the outcome of this study, represents the main starting point in any discus- sion of Wari and its time, and is still the conceptual framework for interpretation. In accordance with the stylistic seriation methodology outlined by Rowe, Menzel subdivided the period that extends from the rise of the Wari styles in the midst of local Early Intermediate Period pottery (Huarpa) into four epochs—which was marked by the influence of the coastal Nasca style (phases 8-9)—to the final decline of the forms and designs derived from this Ayacuchano tradition at the hands of others related with local traditions (i.e. Late Intermediate Tradition: Chanka pottery). These last two epochs were discarded after it was shown that they were in fact posterior to the abandonment of the presumed capitals in Ayacucho. With these modifications, Menzel argues that the history of the Wari culture is divided into two epochs and four phases, followed by a third phase, that of the decline:
</p>
<dl><dd>Epoch 1, Phase A (Menzel’s original chronology: A.D. 550-600; new estimates: A.D. 600-700). The complex Altiplano iconography and its well-known front and profile personages from the Tiwanaku reliefs appear on Ayacucho pottery within the context of two new locally produced styles, Chakipampa—strongly related with the coastal tradition (Nasca 9)—and Ocros, as well as a third style with ample local antecedents—Huarpa (Figs. 11, 12 and 13). The Robles Moqo and Conchopata styles appear. More complex designs are found in the urns and jars from Conchopata, which have no Huarpa or Nazca precedent.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Epoch 1, Phase B (Menzel’s original chronology: A.D. 600-650; new estimates: A.D. 700-850). The new styles spread to the South Coast (Pacheco in Nazca, Cerro del Oro) and influence the local output of the Central Coast, for instance the Nievería style in the Rímac Valley.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Epoch 2 (new estimates: A.D. 850-1000), Phase A (Menzel’s original chrono- logy: A.D. 650-700). Wari consolidates its presence on the coast. New styles that synthesise and simplify the designs from previous phases spread from Arequipa to Piura: Viñaque, Atarco, Pachacamac and Ica-Pachacamac. It should however be emphasised that their decoration comprises religious motifs that in the previous epoch remained restricted to the Ayacucho’s ceremonial styles (Conchopata, Robles Moqo). The Wari Empire expanded rapidly in Epoch 2, Phase B (Menzel’s original chronology: A.D. 700-775) and reached its maximum extent. The Viñaque style reached such distant areas as Cajamarca to the North and Chuquibamba to the South. The trend towards schematisation and simplification were likewise heightened in the development of the styles, thus anticipating the decline of Wari (Figs. 14 and 15). The Empire evidently had declined by the end of Epoch 2 and most centres were abandoned.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Epochs 3 and 4 (new estimates: A.D. 1000-1050). Epoch 3 (Menzel’s original chronology: A.D. 775-850) was defined from the stylistic transformations seen in the mould-stamped pottery from the Central-North Coast: local forms and designs supposedly re-emerged, but several Wari designs and conventions endured. After Epoch 3, some Wari-style survivals would have characterised Epoch 4 (Menzel’s original chronology: A.D. 850-1000), which is superimposed with the subsequent Late Intermediate Period (Fig. 16).</dd></dl>
<p>Thanks to the first C14 dates, which were still reduced, Menzel proposed dating the Middle Horizon 1 and 2 to A.D. 550-775, and Epoch 3, that of the decline, to A.D. 775-850. We now have several long series of dates well- located in stratigraphic contexts, particularly from Conchopata, Pikillacta, Moquegua, Cajamarca, and also from Huari itself. The dates related with the construction of planned public architecture outside Ayacucho in the high- lands fall chronologically in A.D. 600-700 (cal.), and are visibly contemporary with the capital itself. The decline of Huari, the capital, took place instead in the eleventh century AD. Even so in some parts of Ayacucho like Azángaro, the Wari buildings remained in use up to the thirteenth century A.D. (cal.). The manufacture of pottery in the local, Middle Horizon “Huamanga” style also continued. A similar situation is observed in Cuzco and in Apurímac.8 The dated contexts evince that although Menzel correctly apprehended the broad outlines of some general trends in the development of ceramic styles, these do not let themselves be exclusively ascribed to short phases. Most of these styles endured for two or three centuries and none of them became the official imperial style, comparable in terms of their reception and prestige to the Imperial Inca style." <sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>

<p><b> ♠ Polity territory ♣ [20,000-320,000] ♥ </b> in squared kilometers.
</p><p>Upper limit:"If we use the distribution of provincial centers to estimate the size of the empire, Wari's control of mountain territory reached 800 km (497 mi.) to the north of the capital, 525 km (326 mi.) to the south, and 275 km (171 mi.) to the east (to the region around Cuzco; it also stretched down to the central and south coast, 350 km (217 mi.) to the west and south-west. Thus the empire extended more than 1,300 km (807 mi.) along its north-south axis; its width varied from about 100 km (62 mi.) in the north, where it encompassed only the highlands, to some 400 km (248 mi.) in the south, where it spanned both highlands and coast. The total spatial extent of the empire could have been as much as 320,000 sq. km  (124,000 sq. mi.)." <sup id="cite_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-62">[62]</a></sup>
</p><p>Lower limit: (Alan Covey): "Clearly, the Wari capital region had some span of control, although it might not have been much more than a day's walk or so, given that a site like Azangaro is treated as a colony.  If you said 50 km around the capital, you would have a heartland of around 8000 sq km.  There are some corridors that seem to have strategic Wari installations, especially on the Ayacucho-Nasca route.  Nevertheless, surveys that work more than about 5-10 km from known Wari installations typically find no Wari sites or material culture.  Pikillacta and the Wari colonies around Huaro represent a cluster about 100 sq km in size, and Wari-style pottery is found at nearby sites in a region that might be as large as 500 or so sq km.  If you calculated the sustaining area around the generous estimate of Wari sites that Jennings and Craig (2001) list, giving a generous 1000 sq km to the largest centers (Pikillacta and Viracochapampa) and 500 sq km all the others--even tiny and unverified sites--you would maybe get 20,000 sq km.  of course, the "mosaic of control" model that is dominant for Wari studies would say that there are some areas with indirectly ruled subjects or client rulers (although the latter should be found only in coastal valleys that had centralized polities and existing political hierarchies).  I think doubling that territorial estimate would be a really generous estimate, but I also think that the researchers who continue to ignore the accumulated settlement data from across the highlands would still insist on a much larger territory.  For example, Bill Isbell has cited the presence of Wari-style buildings and tombs in Espiritu Pampa (150 km northwest of Cuzco) and the complex at Pikillacta (30 km southeast of Cuzco) as evidence that everything in between was directly governed by Wari--even though Brian Bauer (1992, 2004; Bauer et al. 2015), Veronique Belisle (2010, 2015), Steve Kosiba (2010), Ken Heffernan (1996), Ann Kendall (1994) and I (2006, 2014, Covey et al. 2008) have found patterns suggesting no Wari sites beyond a few hours' walk of Pikillacta." <sup id="cite_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-63">[63]</a></sup> " As a lower bound, I would probably be more generous than 10,000 sq km.  I would probably say 20,000, which would put Wari closer in line with Susa, Early Uruk, and Monte Alban." <sup id="cite_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-64">[64]</a></sup>
</p><p><b> ♠ Polity Population ♣ [100,000-500,000] ♥ </b>
</p><p>"On the other hand, the “administrative centres” whose meticulous geometric design gave rise to the formal definition of Wari urbanism— e.g. Pikillacta or Viracochapampa—were never finished. It has been proven that these were never populous cities." <sup id="cite_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup>
</p><p>Alan Covey: "This is a difficult calculation, as there are not systematic settlement data for the entire central Andes that would allow for a valley-by-valley assessment of settlement levels.  Even if there were, archaeologists would argue over population estimates and what the distribution of Wari-style material culture signifies in terms of state rule.  Having said that, a very "back of the envelope" estimate might be to take the population estimate for the Wari capital and say that it might represent some percentage of the total population of the Ayacucho region--maybe that could be estimated based on the size of the capital and the rough estimate of settled area (with the capital assumed to be more densely settled than lower-order sites)?  Beyond the Wari heartland, the nodes of direct Wari control represent a fairly modest area--a few hundred hectares at most, even if one buys the more generous estimates of Wari site counts (e.g., Jennings and Craig 2001) and of Cuzco Wari sites.  I think that we did a maximal number of hectares at Wari peripheral sites in my co-authored 2013 paper (in a note), and that could be calculated using the same general assumptions for the heartland.  My guess is that the number for those areas wouldn't go much over about 100,000 people.  However, Wari specialists will rightly argue that there should be some populations that served Wari through indirect or hegemonic relationships (although outside of Huarmey, there is little evidence of possible client rulers), and that would mean adding some arbitrary estimate of "indirect" subjects.  So, maybe Wari polity population could be pegged in the low hundred thousands.  Inca estimates run from a low of 2 million to more widely accepted estimates of 6-10 million, although these are based on backward mathematical acrobatics from spotty early Colonial population records.  Still, there were A LOT more Inca subjects than Wari ones." <sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup>
"The area encompassed by colonies and state architectural compounds outside the Ayacucho region reaches only a few hundred hectares at most." And the corresponding note: "This figure is heavily weighted by large size estimates for Cusco Wari sites (47 ha for Pikillacta and 150 ha for Huaro [Glowacki and Zapata, 1998; McEwan, 2005]). It also includes the incomplete site of Viracochapampa (32 ha), disputed sites such as Achachiwa (35 ha—see Doutriaux, 2004), and unconfirmed sites identified using air photos, such as Pariamarca and Tocroc. See Jennings (2006a: 269-270) for discussion of assumed lower-order Wari sites." <sup id="cite_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup>
</p><p>RA suggested a range of 100,000-500,000 taking into account most possibilities. Approved by Alan Covey: "If we think of a contemporaneous New World state like Teotihuacan, this falls in the range of the overall population estimates for the urban core and broader area of interest.  There is tremendous uncertainty, but for me the important thing is the horizontal comparison (other first generation states) and vertical (Inca empire) comparison." <sup id="cite_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-68">[68]</a></sup>

<p><b> ♠ Administrative levels ♣ [2-5] ♥ </b> levels.
</p><p>Alan Covey: "For Wari, it seems plausible from the archaeological evidence that there were royalty, and the royal tombs in Huarmey suggest client rulers or Wari nobles in at least one distant location (although probably not as many as in Inca times).  There is no evidence of a decimal hierarchy for Wari (but the Inca one is not demonstrated archaeologically, either), but pretty good evidence of internal hierarchies in urban and provincial settings.  Overall, the Incas had tons more of the units that were administered (a lot more population over a much greater area), but not necessarily a qualitative difference in the levels of hierarchy." <sup id="cite_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-86">[86]</a></sup>
"A range of 2-5 administrative levels seems realistic based on mortuary differences.  I still think the Inca hierarchy was modestly more complex and vastly more prevalent, but in terms of structure, I don’t think I would treat the levels of the Inca decimal hierarchy as distinct administrative levels, so it probably wasn’t qualitatively more hierarchical." <sup id="cite_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-87">[87]</a></sup>

"The current data show that this elite mortuary sector at Huari exhibits the highest rate of head trauma among Wari heartland groups studied thus far. Moreover, an intriguing pattern of violence-related trauma is emerging— the higher-status sites contain significantly more individuals with violent injuries than do smaller sites: 50 percent of individuals at Huari-Cheqo Wasi (12/24), 23 percent at Conchopata (10/44), and none at Trigo Pampa and Nawinpukio (0/5). Even with the small sample sizes, these are statistically significant differences in cranial trauma frequencies. Huari-Cheqo Wasi adults exhibit significantly more cranial fractures than do adults at Conchopata (Fisher’s exact, p = 0.022, n = 68) and nearly significantly more than the Trigo Pampa and Nawinpukio combined samples (Fisher’s exact, p = 0.052, n = 29). This finding might suggest that elites and intermediate elites at sites like Huari-Cheqo wasi and Conchopata, respectively, were more likely to be involved in warfare and other violent acts. Perhaps violent actions in war helped to establish and maintain elite status within Wari society, which hints at the possibility that militaristic actions provided a path to power for certain individuals. That is, the making of warriors may have been viewed as a means for status enhancement, both for the individual men and for their communities. Conversely, those born into high-status families may have been expected to engage in warfare. in either case, violence appears to have been constructed as a valued way of being in Wari society." <sup id="cite_ref-192" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-192">[192]</a></sup>

"Another weapon type, the stone mace (see Figure 9.7), has been found at both Huari and Conchopata, and this type was apparently the weapon of choice in Wari society (and other areas of the Andes) based on the oval-shaped cranial fractures observed in this study and many others (Andrushko and Torres 2011; Kellner 2002; Murphy 2004; Torres- Rouff and Costa Junqueira 2006). Thirty-three stone maces were recovered from Conchopata (c. Bencic, personal communication 2012), and their likely function was as a weapon attached to the distal end of a stick and used in hand-to-hand combat. his weapon may explain the numerous wounds on the let lateral and let superior portions of men’s crania." <sup id="cite_ref-209" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-209">[209]</a></sup>
</p><p>"Previous studies show that 23 percent of adults (10/44) at Conchopata exhibit antemortem cranial trauma (no perimortem trauma has been identiied; tung 2012), so the overall antemortem cranial trauma rate in the Wari heartland is 27 percent (20/73). This rate is statistically similar to frequencies documented at Beringa and La Real (31.5 percent, n = 143) in the Majes Valley of southern Peru (tung 2007), among Nasca-Chakipampa (i.e., Wari-affiliated) burials in the Las Trancas Valley of Nasca (24 percent, n = 17; Kellner 2002), and among Tiwanaku-affiliated burials in Azapa (18 percent, n = 89; Fouant 1984) and San Pedro de Atacama (36 percent, n = 44; Torres-Rouff and Costa Junqueira 2006). (see table 9.2 for cranial trauma frequencies among Andean middle Horizon samples and the p-values for each comparison to the Wari heartland.) The Wari heartland cranial trauma rate is significantly lower than that of the Middle Horizon burials at Uraca in the lower stretches of the Majes Valley (Koontz 2011) but significantly higher than those of several other contemporaneous skeletal samples ranging from northern Peru to Cusco and to northern Chile (table 9.2). This variability in cranial trauma rates suggests that conditions for warfare were contingent upon local circumstances and upon Wari (or Tiwanaku) policies and practices in a region." <sup id="cite_ref-210" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-210">[210]</a></sup>

</p><p><b>♠ Pictorial evidence of warfare ♣ present ♥</b>
</p><p>"Further evidence of warfare exists in representations of the paramount warrior, who appears without weaponry in his incarnation at Pacheco on the south coast but, at Conchopata, carries a shield and a bow with arrows as he kneels in a reed boat (fig. 103).39 On another Conchopata urn, seven profile heads appear; their lolling tongues may indicate strangulation and their distinctive headgear and facial ornamentation are shown in some detail (fig. 104). One has a bicolored face and wears a black cap with a brim and perhaps a chin strap of square plaques, each marked with two dots; another wears an arrow point tied to his headdress and bangles in his pierced ears, nose, and lower lip. Although interpretation of these heads varies, they may represent enemies (or enemy groups) of the Wari state who were tortured into submission and thus offer further evidence of conflict as an embattled society defended its new territory or sought to aggressively expand. Certainly military imagery is common at Conchopata and elsewhere in Wari territory during this period, and, as Menzel observed, there is a dramatic change in Wari’s local pottery after the cult had been established, as though some crisis—perhaps a revolt or epidemic—severely disrupted politics in the Ayacucho Valley and on the south coast." <sup id="cite_ref-214" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-214">[214]</a></sup>

Although there is archaeological evidence for warfare, there is no evidence for wars waged on specific regions, nor is it known whether the territories into which they expanded were conquered through warfare or other means (alliances, negotiations, etc.).
In the archaeological record, there is evidence for the Wari occupation and influence in several areas, like Cuzco <sup id="cite_ref-222" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-222">[222]</a></sup>, Cerro Baul at the frontier with Tiwanaku <sup id="cite_ref-223" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-223">[223]</a></sup>, Galindo in the North <sup id="cite_ref-224" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-224">[224]</a></sup>, San José de Moro and the Moche area <sup id="cite_ref-225" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-225">[225]</a></sup> but none of these studies have shown archaeological evidence for warfare (destroyed settlements, skeletal evidence, fortified settlements, weapons).

</p><p>"Based on the well-developed relative chronology, most of the major known sites were built, or initiated, during Middle Horizon phase 1; this phase is thought to have lasted no longer than a century.

<p>Evidence for conquest of the Carahuarazo Valley (6 days away from Wari capital):
</p>
<dl><dd>"The Wari Empire expended large amounts of labor in the construction of Jincamocco, the three smaller centers, the road system, and the agricultural terraces." <sup id="cite_ref-234" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-234">[234]</a></sup> "The Wari occupation of the valley implies much higher levels of control, and restriction of movement of the local people; the amount of construction implies very high labor demands on the local populace." <sup id="cite_ref-235" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-235">[235]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>A war with the Tiwanaku hasn't been confirmed:
</p>
<dl><dd>"We propose that Huari-Tiwanaku interaction was limited and perhaps hostile in early Middle Horizon times (AD 600-800). The hydraulic analysis of Moquega agriculture in the early Middle Horizon provides a source of conflict over water use that would have drastically affected the Tiwanaku colony's agricultural production mechanisms. Despite these early hostilities, it is likely that significant interactions began to take place between some social units early in the ninth century AD, and by the tenth century AD institutional relationships were affirmed through ritual feasting and drinking in the ceremonial Sector B on Cerro Baúl. [...] Increased interaction does not necessarily represent a peaceful coexistence, however. The widespread demolition of Chen Chen phase settlements likely took place while HUari was still inhabiting the valley. Whether the Huari, the Tumilaca, or the Chen Chen settlers themselves completely razed the Chen Chen villages has yet to be resolved. <sup id="cite_ref-236" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-236">[236]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>Possible interpretation for conquest:
"The relative and absolute chronologies usually accepted suggest that in the seventh century AD, the Ayacucho leaders managed to secure their control of the areas of Cuzco and the South Coast, from Pisco to Moquegua. A Wari leader managed to extend the conquests as far as Cajamarca and Piura around A.D. 800 ±50 (cal.). The resistance offered by the Moche kingdoms and chiefdoms on the North Coast was quite varied. For the present authors, the advance of the warriors of
the Wari coalition explains the abandonment of Cerro del Oro (Cañete) and of all the centres of the Lima culture, Pachacamac, Maranga, and Cajamar- quilla in particular. The palaces and temples in these settlements were buried under seals of soil and adobe bricks, and became burial sites during the Middle Horizon 2 and 3/4 (A.D. 800-1050)." <sup id="cite_ref-237" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-237">[237]</a></sup>
</p><p>Possible evidence for military activity in the north:
</p>
<dl><dd>"In comparison with the Moche, the Wari occupation left a very different mark on the cultural landscape of the Huarmey and Culebras Valleys, and this necessarily implies differences in the strategies of power. Our recent finds at Castillo de Huarmey provide arguments that support the successful conquest of this land by the warriors from the south. The evidence from Culebras likewise suggests the hypothesis that the Wari administration turned this valley into a fortified fortress whilst preparing for the conquest of other northern valleys." <sup id="cite_ref-238" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-238">[238]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<p>Wari niched halls at Pikillacta:
</p>
<dl><dd>"Drawing on the Inca analogy, many archaeologists suppose that the function of the patio groups was feasting, which probably incorporated both administrative ritual and religious practice, perhaps simultaneously. Inca administrative ritual similarly involved bringing together a ruler or his representatives with his subjects for the purposes of ceremonial performance related to a formal request for labor. Ceremonial feasting and drinking in which great amounts of food and native corn beer (chicha) were consumed characterized these rituals. Conspicuous generosity was also practiced at these feasts, and the numerous chambers in the patio group structures perhaps were used to store goods to be distributed to feast participants. The archaeological evidence for ritual feasting is the presence of large numbers of ceremonial serving and drinking vessels in the artifact collections of a site, as at Pikillacta. Drinking chicha is ritually essential yet also dangerous in that it renders the participants drunk, insensible, and therefore vulnerable. The patio groups could have provided secure, private locations for such performances. Variations in sizes of patio groups perhaps reflect the size of the administrative unit or kinship group involved in the feast." <sup id="cite_ref-244" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-244">[244]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>Possible ritual/administrative space at Huaro:
</p>
<dl><dd>"Other possible administrative features of the site include a formal entry room with a slate floor, which permitted access to a reception area containing a throne-like seat, and a paq'cha or water fountain leading from a canal, both lined with slate, located near the entrance. [...] The receiving room and the paq'cha are likewise unique architectural features; there seems to be no precedents for them at any other Huari site. Paq'chas, however, are associated with certain Inca sites, probably having been used to channel water as well as perform rituals (Inca paq'chas have often been referred to as 'baths' - see Rowe 1946:229)." <sup id="cite_ref-245" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-245">[245]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>D-shaped temples as a space for collective rituals and sacrifices:
</p>
<dl><dd>"The close iconographic relationship between the painted D-shaped structure and the Front View Sacrificer strongly suggests that the building was not only a sacred space but an area in which sacrifices were made. In fact, the D-shaped structure at Conchopata included a cache of human trophy heads. Furthermore, excavations in Cheqo Wasi revealed that these structures sometimes contained cut-stone funerary chambers. <sup id="cite_ref-246" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-246">[246]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>Mountain veneration:
</p>
<dl><dd>"Anders (1986), working at Azangaro, located in the core of the Wari Empire 15km from the polity's capital in Ayacucho, proposed that the site was specifically linked to mountain veneration. She also suggested that other Wari sites and respective architectural complexes may have been linked to propitiating mountain spirits. Most notably, she suggests that the 'wells' found full of ritual offerings at Cerro Amaru may be akin to the stone boxes used by modern populations in Chusci to make ritual payments to mountain deities (Isbell 1978). Significantly, the offerings at Cerro Amaru, located near Viracochapampa on the northern periphery of the Wari Empire, consisted prominently of Spondylus priceps (McCown 1945), a valued bivalve originating from warm Ecuadorian waters and an object specifically linked to ritual requests for water during Inka times (Cobo 1956 [1653]; Glowacki and Malpass 2003). <sup id="cite_ref-247" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-247">[247]</a></sup>. "The cults surrounding the apu of Arundane and Picchu Picchu thrived at Cerro Baúl during the period of the expansive highland states, c. AD 500-1100. Baúl served as a nexus for the integration of local ideologies of ancestry and supernatural power with regional and imperial ideologies and as an apu itself. Arundane may have been viewed as the ancestral origin of the local groups, as well as the apu most closely related to the altiplano and the Tiwanaku realm. Picchu Picchu, on the road to Wari itself, was the apu associated with Wari regional identity and, through its links to mountains closer to Wari, with the imperial identity." <sup id="cite_ref-248" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-248">[248]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>Ancestor worship as a political tool:
</p>
<dl><dd>Gordon McEwan, on ancestor worship: ""I think the Wari used this belief to create their empire," McEwan says. "They captured other peoples' mummies or ordered them to bring their ancestral bundles to places like Pikillacta for storage. The only access you then had to your ancestors—and so to your land and water—was through the state. If you didn't comply, the Wari destroyed your ancestors, which left you destitute. The Inca did the same thing, but it was probably the Wari's idea." <sup id="cite_ref-249" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-249">[249]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>Sacrifice ceremonies - ritual reenactment of the Staff God?
</p>
<dl><dd>"In Ayacucho during precolonial times, the image of a Sac- rificer occurs in various contexts, including pottery offerings [...]. It consists of a profile figure with a knife in one hand and a severed human head in the other. The Sacrifi- cer is depicted in Huari and in the southern altiplano region of Tiahuanaco; in the iconography of both of these polities, the Sacrificer is often asso- ciated with the Front Face Staff Figure2 (also referred to as the Front Face Staff Deity, as in the 1942 offering recovered by Tello at the site of Conchopata; see Cook 1987; W. H. Isbell and Cook 1987) and can appear in other iconographic registers as well. The connection between the Front Face Staff Figure, the most important Middle Horizon Andean religious figure, and the Sacrificer simultaneously conveys notions of hierarchy and the ultimate offering, that of human sacrifice."<sup id="cite_ref-250" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-250">[250]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>Sacrifice of children:
</p>
<dl><dd>"The osteological, chemical, contextual and iconographic data suggests that Wari warriors traveled to distant locales, took children and adults captive (and perhaps the occasional head and hand), and brought them back to Conchopata, perhaps for sacrifice in elaborate rituals within the D-shaped and circular buildings. The perimorte= fracture on a child's cervical vertebrae and the chopmarks on the ascending ramus undergird the notion that child sacrifice may have been practiced in the Wari empire. Unlike the Inka, such rituals did not end with the child's death. Instead, skilled individuals in Wari society -perhaps ritual specialists with deep knowledge of human anatomy-continued to interact with the corpses of children. Although child sacrifice cannot be definitively demonstrated, it is clear that child body parts were eventually transformed into trophies. This ongoing tactile engagement, which must have been quite intense, included dismemberment of the hands and head, followed by drilling a hole in children's disembodied skulls, to facilitate their display. Eventually, these sacred objects were ritually destroyed with fire, a common practice in Andean rituals of the past and present."<sup id="cite_ref-251" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-251">[251]</a></sup></dd>

It could be snuffed or drank with chicha beer.  The depictions of this plant show that it was used by elites, it could have been part of shamanic experiences like modern-day ayahuasca. "When applied to the artifact evidence from the Wari site of Conchopata, the analysis of the plant icon suggested that the ceramic offering ritual was the culmination of a ceremony involving chicha drinking by a large group of participants and controlled by an authoritative person. The person's authority might have been demonstrated by controlling the birds of the sky and the rays of the sun - a probable deity. This person might have used A. colubrina in the chicha to enhance the participants' religious experiences while guiding them into the spirit world. Finally, group participation in a chicha drinking ceremony and association of supernatural symbols with an individual suggests that the Wari developed the role of priest to manage the increasing social complexity of their expanding political system." <sup id="cite_ref-255" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-255">[255]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>Ritual destruction of settlements before abandonment? At Cerro Baúl:
</p>
<dl><dd>"The summit of the Cerro Baúl complex consists of many structures organized around plazas. Investigators identified a large elongated building type that served as the place of elite residence and administration. In one of these halls the Wari brewed chicha and sponsored ceremonies that revolved around the consumption of this beverage (see pp. 82-101, “The Art of Feasting”). Excavation of one of these structures revealed a burnt deposit of ceramic drinking vessels and fine necklaces made of lapis lazuli or chrysocolla beads (fig. 142; see also fig. 68). Archaeologists who investigated the site believe that the hall was intentionally burned, possibly as part of its ritual abandonment. This event was so important that fine vessels, brought hundreds of miles from the Wari heartland, were chosen to be sacrificed. After toasting and drinking, the Wari smashed these vessels and threw them into the burning building as part of its ceremonial sealing. After the fire was extinguished, the Wari made a second offering of necklaces." <sup id="cite_ref-256" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-256">[256]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>Offerings spilled during rituals: shells, feathers, plants, human and animal blood. <sup id="cite_ref-257" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-257">[257]</a></sup>

<dl><dd>"Huari offerings leave material expressions of ritual behavior in the form of subfloor caches [...]. For the Middle Horizon, there are numerous offering contexts, including caches of smashed, oversized, decorated ceramic vessels, such as the two offerings from Conchopata in Ayacucho, and others from Pacheco and Maymi on the south coast and from Ayapata in the highlands of Huancavelica [...]. Other types of offering deposits include nonceramic items such as the many finely carved miniature turquoise figurines from the Huari site of Pikillacta (Cook 1992) and individual figurines known from many other sites. In the context of politics, as exemplified in the emergence of Huari as the first Andean empire, these ‘‘ritual offerings’’ can be equated with ‘‘ritual tribute’’ by analogies drawn from ethnohistoric and ethnographic evidence. Offerings vary in context, size, and degree of elaboration, and their ultimate resting places contain large quantities of whole or broken objects. Some offerings are associated with mortuary remains that do not suggest a natural death." <sup id="cite_ref-258" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-258">[258]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>Taking human heads for ritual practice:
</p>
<dl><dd>"This artistic evidence of trophy heads is supported by archaeological finds: actual decapitated bodies and caches of trophy heads have been recovered in excavations in Nasca territory. In Ayacucho, the Wari heartland, the ancients placed human trophy heads in temple foundations as early as the first millennium BC. In Wari contexts, such heads have been documented in ritually important locations at Conchopata30 and in an elite cemetery at Cotocotuyoq in the Huaro Valley, near Cuzco. There is plentiful evidence that the practice of taking human heads has even deeper roots in the Andes.32 During the Wari period, the interest in head taking is likely explained not only by ritual practices but also by emerging elites’ interest in empowering themselves, potentially by impersonating or imbuing themselves with camay, the energetic, creative life force of the cosmos." <sup id="cite_ref-259" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-259">[259]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>Ceremonial practice of smashing ceramic vessels:
</p>
<dl><dd>" What is especially interesting about these many and varied ceramic offering traditions is that they require the ritual “killing” of the pottery vessels, breaking them to engage symbolically in an experience with the supernatural realm. In the specific case of the Wari, these ritual practices seem to have been closely tied to surviving a prolonged drought and beseeching the ances- tors for assistance in this effort. Our knowledge of Wari ritual behavior is the result of many archaeological excavations in the Wari heartland and its provinces. Starting with the Wari capital city in Ayacucho, archaeologists have documented large-scale examples of this practice. Since the 1940s, two offerings of numerous large vessels have been found at Conchopata, near the Wari capital. The first contained urns, the second faceneck jars (see figs. 75a-f); all were smashed and buried in association with the interment of five young women. Both types of vessels were decorated with supernatural images, a number of which represent the frontal staff deity, the most important supernatural being that the Wari depicted artistically (see pp. 103-21, “The Coming of the Staff Deity”). In the case of the urns, the exteriors bear this image while the jars represent humans wearing tunics deco- rated with staff deity iconography. (The jars are known as facenecks because a human visage appears on the neck of the vessel; the human’s body is synonymous with that of the vessel.)" <sup id="cite_ref-260" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-260">[260]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>Use of anthropomorphic figurines as offerings:
</p>
<dl><dd>"Many Wari figurines are sculptural master- works in miniature, and the Wari used them most impressively to create complex offerings that they buried deep in the earth in acts of devotion or dedication. All documented examples of such offerings—three, in total—come from Pikillacta, the massive Wari outpost near Cuzco in the southern highlands. Two of them, each featuring forty small human figures carved in turquoise-colored stone, seem to relate closely to each other and may even have been deposited as part of a single ritual event." <sup id="cite_ref-261" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-261">[261]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>Use of coca leaves:

They have been identified as containers for lime powder (made from a calcium carbonate source such as shell or limestone). The lime would have been added with a small spoon or spatula to a lump of coca leaves that were chewed, probably for their mildly stimulating physical effects as well as for social and ritual reasons." <sup id="cite_ref-262" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-262">[262]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<dd><b>♠ Duration ♣ 5 ♥ </b>average in hours  <i>the reference to hired staff implies that an elite or state sponsored feast would be a single event that would have occurred within one day - so the duration will be less than 24 hours. Presumably the feast would be one big meal at some point during the day, rather three separate meals in the morning, noontime and evening, and that it would incorporate a large number of dishes over an extended time period. One might further speculate on the possibility of entertainments (musicians, acrobats etc.) during and between dishes which would have further extended the length of the feast, and also on the ritual drinking of chicha which might have followed or continued after the meal. I would code a range of [2-10] hours.</i> "Elites would have dedicated spaces to hold feasts and would have had institutionalized contributions from 'followers' or hired staff to collect, prepare, and carry out the duties necessary for conducting a feast start to finish.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ ritual combat ♥</b> "The concentration of anterior head wounds among La Real adult males suggests that they often engaged in face-to-face combat that may have been highly routinized and governed by strict rules of engagement. Warfare often has stringent prescriptions, but the nonlethality of the vast majority of wounds requires additional explanations. On the one hand, it is possible that the opponents of La Real men were ineffective war combatants, causing only sublethal head injuries, or that La Real was simply the primary burial locale for those warriors who survived. On the other hand, the nonfatal wounds may have been incurred in nonwarfare contexts, perhaps during ritual battles known ethnographically and ethnohistorically in the Andes as <i>tinku</i> (Hartmann, 1972; Gifford et al., 1976; Sallnow, 1987; Allen, 1988; Schultz, 1988; Schuller and Petermann, 1992; Orlove, 1994; Bolin, 1998; Brachetti, 2001; Chacon et al., 2004; Arkush and Stanish, 2005). <i>Tinku</i> is a ritual battle in which men (and sometimes women) square off and fight with fists or maces, or they hurl stones at each other with slings, often leading to serious skull fractures (Schuller and Petermann, 1992; Orlove, 1994). The blood spilled in these ritual encounters is viewed as an offering to the earth to ensure bountiful harvests (Allen, 1988; Bolin, 1998; Gifford et al., 1976). The kinds of weapons used in <i>tinku</i> have been recovered from both Beringa and La Real. "Physical conflict resolution (i.e., ritual fights) may also explain some of the nonfatal cranial wounds. Among the Yanomamo of Venezuela (Chagnon, 1992) and the Oro-Warí of southern Brazil (Conklin, 2001), men square off giving and receiving hits to the head with wood clubs, often as a means to express and resolve a conflict between two kin groups. As Conklin notes among the Oro-Warí, '. . . serious internal conflicts may be dealt with through ritualized fights ... [that] follow strict rules. Blows can be struck only with <i>temem</i> [wood clubs], and opponents are supposed to hit each other only on the head and shoulders. The objective is never to kill, but only to hurt and punish.' (2001:40). "The La Real trauma pattern is also similar to that of the prehistoric Chumash from coastal California (Walker, 1989; Lambert, 1994), where skeletons show high frequencies of sublethal anterior head wounds, but little to no parry fractures. Based on those observations, Walker (1989) and Lambert (1994) suggested that they resulted from head clubbings (and some accidental injuries). The dearth of parry fractures among Chumash males led Lambert (1994) to suggest that cultural norms for ritualized club fights meant that men should not block a blow to the head. Importantly, she notes that if physical conflicts were unregulated forms of lethal battles, there should have been more parry fractures (evidence of attempting to deflect hits to the head) (Lambert, 1994:118). Similarly, if La Real men were in lethal battles, there should have been some evidence of protecting one’s self from potentially fatal blows. Instead, it may be that La Real males practiced some form of ritualized battles or fights, such as <i>tinku</i> or conflict resolution, where they received blows to the skull that they were not supposed to parry. (No shields were recovered from any of the sites.) Participation in either of these physically risky, yet socially visible activities may have increased their social standing, providing some men with the necessary 'credentials' for burial at the elite ceremonial and mortuary site of La Real." <sup id="cite_ref-317" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-317">[317]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd> <b>♠ elite status is hereditary ♣ inferred present ♥</b> <i>Rulers probably considered royal.</i> Alan Covey: "For Wari, it seems plausible from the archaeological evidence that there were royalty, and the royal tombs in Huarmey suggest client rulers or Wari nobles in at least one distant location (although probably not as many as in Inca times). There is no evidence of a decimal hierarchy for Wari (but the Inca one is not demonstrated archaeologically, either), but pretty good evidence of internal hierarchies in urban and provincial settings. Overall, the Incas had tons more of the units that were administered (a lot more population over a much greater area), but not necessarily a qualitative difference in the levels of hierarchy."  "A range of 2-5 administrative levels seems realistic based on mortuary differences. I still think the Inca hierarchy was modestly more complex and vastly more prevalent, but in terms of structure, I don’t think I would treat the levels of the Inca decimal hierarchy as distinct administrative levels, so it probably wasn’t qualitatively more hierarchical."<sup id="cite_ref-356" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-356">[356]</a></sup></dd>

[...] These bodily patterns of injury reveal much about gender roles in Wari society, showing that physical assertiveness may have been a behavioral norm for men, something that was inculcated into them through discourse, imagery, and daily observations of other men. Certainly, as the military iconography from Conchopata and Huari shows, a warrior identity that emphasized aggressiveness (carrying weapons, trophy heads, and prisoners) was a quality that was celebrated in art and presumably in ceremonies. This served to turn men into warriors, likely in the service of state goals but also in the service of their own social advancement. The ways in which Wari warriors were valorized in iconography suggest that this was at least one means for status enhancement for men. Militaristic actions may well have been an integral part of masculine identity in Wari society." <sup id="cite_ref-377" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-377">[377]</a></sup></dd>
