<p><i>Population and political organization</i>

Nobles were also ritual specialists and officiated human sacrifices.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Evidence for conquests includes the burning of conquered settlements, the presence of Zapotec material culture and propaganda (including a skull rack displaying the heads of conquered people) and references to defeated areas carved on the 'conquest slabs' displayed in Building J on the Main Plaza of Monte Albán.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> Monumental construction flourished during this period, with standardized temples, palaces and ball courts built around the paved Main Plaza at Monte Albán.

<dl><dd>The Valley of Oaxaca Settlement Pattern Project estimates a decline in population by up to 32% (from roughly 50,000) during this period, based on the abandonment or shrinkage of some settlements (even though this was in part due to the nucleation of the population at larger centres such as Monte Albán).<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> Archaeologists Joyce Marcus and Kent Flannery, however, suggest that this perceived decrease in population is partly due to the very high estimates given by the Settlement Pattern Project for the previous phase.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup></dd></dl>

Then, sometime in the first century B.C., in the early years of the Monte Albán II phase (100 B.C.-A.D. 200), the El Palenque site was burned and completely abandoned; a new site, Cerro Tilcajete, was founded on a nearby ridge. Elson’s (2003) research at Cerro Tilcajete revealed that it functioned as a secondary center of the Monte Albán state during the Monte Albán II phase, by which time Monte Albán had probably succeeded in annexing the Ocotlán-Zimatlán and Tlacolula subvalleys, as well as several other regions outside the Valley, bringing the territory dominated by the Monte Albán state to nearly 20,000 km2 (Fig. 5.9) (Elson 2003; Marcus and Flannery 1996:206-207; Spencer and Redmond 2005)."<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup>

</p><p><b> ♠ Specialized government buildings ♣ inferred present ♥ </b> A sunken plaza (50m wide and 4m deep) is interpreted as a governmental structure by Marcus and Flannery. A similar but smaller structure (20m wide) has also been found at San José Mogote dating to this period.<sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup> More generally, Charles Spencer commented: 'One cannot fail to be impressed by the amount and variety of public/institutional architecture constructed between B.C. 300 and A.D. 800 in and around the Main Plaza at Monte Alban. The archaeological data indicate that much of this architectural complexity was in existence by Monte Alban II (100 B.C. through A.D. 200). Many of these buildings do not appear to have been residential and most likely served an array of religious (e.g., the various structures associated with two-room temples), military (such as Building J and perhaps the Ballcourt), and other "administrative" functions (including a variety of other public/institutional buildings the functions of which are still unclear). At the same time, it is probably also appropriate to consider the quihuitao (royal palace) to be another example of a public/institutional building. Both the main candidate for a quihuitao at Monte Alban (the Patio Hundido complex, according to Flannery) and also the example recently excavated at El Palenque (which was probably the capital of a rival independent state polity in Late Formative times) near San Martin Tilcajete (see Spencer and Redmond 2004 in Lat Am Antiq, and Redmond and Spencer 2017 PNAS) were not associated with tombs like other elite (and non-elite) residences; also, both examples had "residential" as well as "ceremonial/governmental" components. Note that the El Palenque quihuitao is securely dated to the Late Monte Albán I phase (300-100 B.C.)'.<sup id="cite_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ public sacrifice rituals ♥</b> "The Zapotec view of the cosmos was therefore materially inscribed on the art and architecture of the Main Plaza with references to sacrifice, warfare, and the underworld to the south and the celestial realm to the north. If I am correct in my interpretation of the Main Plaza, then rituals like human sacrifice and ancestor veneration, which invoked the cosmic creation, were performed amid a material symbol of the Zapotec cosmos. The scale, accessibility, openness, and symbolism of the Main Plaza indicate that it was constructed as an arena where thousands of people could have participated in public rituals. Until the Nisa phase, the Main Plaza was open on its eastern side, making activities on the plaza accessible to commoners living on the terraces below. Crowds could have entered the plaza from the east, moving from the everyday world of their homes below into a sacred space materializing symbolic references to the sacred past of ancestors, deities, and the cosmic creation. Ceremonies included a blending of traditional activities such as autosacrificial bloodletting, ancestor veneration, divination, and ritual feasting with new practices like human sacrifice (Blanton et al. 1999:105- 7; A. Joyce 2000, 2004; Orr 1997, 2001; Urcid 2008). The images on the Building L-sub and Building J programs could be viewed as processions moved past and would have continually communicated the significance of sacrifice and warfare. Sacrificial practices, especially human sacrifice, were particularly significant in contacting deities and ancestors, reenacting the cosmic creation and the sacred covenant, and renewing the world (A. Joyce 2000; Monaghan 1990). Human sacrifice now linked the activation of the sacred covenant to warfare. Enemies would have been redefined not just as competitors, but also in sacred terms as potential sacrificial victims." <sup id="cite_ref-253" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-253">[253]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ women's rituals ♥</b> "Household rituals continued to be dominated by small, modeled figurines similar to those of earlier periods (Martínez López &amp; Winter 1994), suggesting that the domestic rituals of common people had not changed significantly with the founding of Monte Albán." <sup id="cite_ref-275" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-275">[275]</a></sup> NOTE: Women's rituals are here considered "most widespread" because, unlike other rituals, which were confined to specialised buildings, these ones were performed in virtually every house. Moreover, figurines have been found in Monte Alban's hinterland, not just in Monte Alban itself <sup id="cite_ref-276" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-276">[276]</a></sup>. However, Marcus reconstructs two possible women's rituals, and only one can be coded. The divination ritual has been chosen because it is very slightly better understood. However, relevant passages describing the figurine ritual have been included here because it might be useful. "Although there is no sign of women’s tools or activities near our early public buildings, we do find evidence for women’s ritual in three places: the house (yoho quixi or yoho coba); the associated ramada or lean-to (yoho yaha or yoho yaa); and the surrounding dooryard. These activities are believed to include (1) divination by the casting of beans or maize kernels, and (2) communication with recent ancestors through the use of small solid figurines. "Let us begin with divination, which—by analogy with ethnohistoric descriptions—may have been carried out in special basins in the dooryard of the house. Such basins were waterproofed with a layer of lime plaster, then painted in one of the colors associated with the four Zapotec world directions: red, yellow, white, or black. Two such painted basins were discovered in the yard of a San José phase house, Household C3, at San José Mogote (Fig. 9). East of the house was a red-painted basin, while a yellow-painted basin lay 3 m to the south. The red-painted basin was 1.2 m in diameter and recessed 5 cm into the ground; it had been mud-plastered, given a waterproof coating of lime, then painted red with specular hematite. The yellow-painted basin was similar in every way except color. Whether there were once four basins—each painted a different color and oriented to one of the four world directions—is not known, since exposing the relevant areas of the yard would have required the destruction of a later building (Marcus 1989: fig. 8.20). "We know from sixteenth-century documents that Zapotec diviners sat on a mat and cast maize kernels onto the surface of a water-filled basin, noting whether they fell or floated in groups of 2, 3, 5, or 13. This use of water (niça) for casting lots was called tiniyaaya niça, and it was used to determine the cause and cure of illnesses affecting household members; to predict whether a particular day was auspicious for planting or marriage; or to assign a name to a newborn child. We suspect that the painted basins of Household C3 may have served for such divination (Fig. 10). "Zapotec women also petitioned their recently deceased ancestors for guidance, often doing so in or near the house where that ancestor had lived. We suspect, on the basis of ethnographic analogy, that small solid figurines— of which we have found hundreds in household context—provided the medium to which the spirits of specific ancestors could return during this petitioning. Women preferred to petition their female ancestors, which may account for the fact that the majority of these figurines are women." <sup id="cite_ref-277" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-277">[277]</a></sup> "Women’s ritual seems to have been conducted in the house, the adjacent lean-to, and the surrounding dooryard. The recently deceased ancestors—both males and females, but especially females—appear to have been the focus of much of this ritual. Small solid figurines, sometimes arranged in ritual scenes, evidently provided a venue to which the spirits of the ancestors could return; in that venue they were probably consulted, petitioned, and involved in the ongoing affairs of their descendants. Women also made figurines of animals (principally dogs and birds), which may have served the ancestors as “animal agents” like those described for China." <sup id="cite_ref-278" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-278">[278]</a></sup> "In later periods in China, animals continued to be important as lineage emblems, playing roles in ritual and in communicating with the Sky, Earth, and the dead (Chang 1980: 209).The Shang-period Chinese (1200-1000 b.c.) depicted animals on bronze vessels, including dragons or snakes. Such depictions were called wu, a term that has been translated “animal offerings.”According to K. C. Chang (1983: 65): 'to make animal offerings was a concrete means of achieving communication between heaven and earth, the dead and the living. We thus come to the inevitable conclusion that the animal designs on Shang and Chou bronzes are iconographically meaningful: they are images of the various animals that served as the helpers of shamans and shamanesses in the task of communication between heaven and earth, the spirits and the living.'" <sup id="cite_ref-279" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-279">[279]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ women's rituals ♥</b> "Household rituals continued to be dominated by small, modeled figurines similar to those of earlier periods (Martínez López &amp; Winter 1994), suggesting that the domestic rituals of common people had not changed significantly with the founding of Monte Albán." <sup id="cite_ref-305" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-305">[305]</a></sup> NOTE: Though Marcus reconstructs two possible women's rituals, only one can be coded. The divination ritual has been chosen because it is very slightly better understood. However, relevant passages describing the figurine ritual have been included here because it might be useful. "Although there is no sign of women’s tools or activities near our early public buildings, we do find evidence for women’s ritual in three places: the house (yoho quixi or yoho coba); the associated ramada or lean-to (yoho yaha or yoho yaa); and the surrounding dooryard. These activities are believed to include (1) divination by the casting of beans or maize kernels, and (2) communication with recent ancestors through the use of small solid figurines. "Let us begin with divination, which—by analogy with ethnohistoric descriptions—may have been carried out in special basins in the dooryard of the house. Such basins were waterproofed with a layer of lime plaster, then painted in one of the colors associated with the four Zapotec world directions: red, yellow, white, or black. Two such painted basins were discovered in the yard of a San José phase house, Household C3, at San José Mogote (Fig. 9). East of the house was a red-painted basin, while a yellow-painted basin lay 3 m to the south. The red-painted basin was 1.2 m in diameter and recessed 5 cm into the ground; it had been mud-plastered, given a waterproof coating of lime, then painted red with specular hematite. The yellow-painted basin was similar in every way except color. Whether there were once four basins—each painted a different color and oriented to one of the four world directions—is not known, since exposing the relevant areas of the yard would have required the destruction of a later building (Marcus 1989: fig. 8.20). "We know from sixteenth-century documents that Zapotec diviners sat on a mat and cast maize kernels onto the surface of a water-filled basin, noting whether they fell or floated in groups of 2, 3, 5, or 13. This use of water (niça) for casting lots was called tiniyaaya niça, and it was used to determine the cause and cure of illnesses affecting household members; to predict whether a particular day was auspicious for planting or marriage; or to assign a name to a newborn child. We suspect that the painted basins of Household C3 may have served for such divination (Fig. 10). "Zapotec women also petitioned their recently deceased ancestors for guidance, often doing so in or near the house where that ancestor had lived. We suspect, on the basis of ethnographic analogy, that small solid figurines— of which we have found hundreds in household context—provided the medium to which the spirits of specific ancestors could return during this petitioning. Women preferred to petition their female ancestors, which may account for the fact that the majority of these figurines are women." <sup id="cite_ref-306" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-306">[306]</a></sup> "Women’s ritual seems to have been conducted in the house, the adjacent lean-to, and the surrounding dooryard. The recently deceased ancestors—both males and females, but especially females—appear to have been the focus of much of this ritual. Small solid figurines, sometimes arranged in ritual scenes, evidently provided a venue to which the spirits of the ancestors could return; in that venue they were probably consulted, petitioned, and involved in the ongoing affairs of their descendants. Women also made figurines of animals (principally dogs and birds), which may have served the ancestors as “animal agents” like those described for China." <sup id="cite_ref-307" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-307">[307]</a></sup> "In later periods in China, animals continued to be important as lineage emblems, playing roles in ritual and in communicating with the Sky, Earth, and the dead (Chang 1980: 209).The Shang-period Chinese (1200-1000 b.c.) depicted animals on bronze vessels, including dragons or snakes. Such depictions were called wu, a term that has been translated “animal offerings.”According to K. C. Chang (1983: 65): 'to make animal offerings was a concrete means of achieving communication between heaven and earth, the dead and the living. We thus come to the inevitable conclusion that the animal designs on Shang and Chou bronzes are iconographically meaningful: they are images of the various animals that served as the helpers of shamans and shamanesses in the task of communication between heaven and earth, the spirits and the living.'" <sup id="cite_ref-308" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-308">[308]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from military ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> While there is evidence of an elite, the nature of leadership is still unclear, as is the relationship between elites and the military. The Zapotec state, which had formed in the previous (Late I) phase<sup id="cite_ref-365" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-365">[365]</a></sup>, was now fully established with the capital at Monte Albán. The Zapotecs extended their territory further during this period, to include the rest of the Valley of Oaxaca as well as territories much further afield (including: Miahuatlán, Cuicatlán, Tututepec, Ocelotepec, Chiltepec and the Sola Valley<sup id="cite_ref-366" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-366">[366]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-367" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-367">[367]</a></sup>). Evidence for these conquests include the burning of conquered settlements, the presence of Zapotec material culture and propaganda (including a skull rack displaying the heads of conquered people) and reference to defeated areas carved on the ‘conquest slabs’ displayed in Building J on the Main Plaza of Monte Albán.<sup id="cite_ref-368" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-368">[368]</a></sup> A permanent army is inferred to have been present based on evidence for Zapotec territorial expansion during this period. Evidence from the Cuicatlan Cañada suggests that the Zapotec had enough force to destroy whole settlements and maintain a tributary relationship with the Zapotec centre.<sup id="cite_ref-369" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-369">[369]</a></sup>"People communicated with the divine through ritual practices seen in Oaxaca for the first time, including human sacrifice and ballgame ceremonies. Nobility controlled both of these rituals, which were linked to another important trend: an increase in the significance of warfare." <sup id="cite_ref-370" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-370">[370]</a></sup> "Although hereditary nobles are increasingly evident in the archaeological record, representations of rulers are muted in public expressions of political and religious authority.

Residential and mortuary data, however, indicate increasing social differentiation in the Oaxaca Valley during the Late/Terminal Formative (Barber &amp; Joyce 2006:223- 9; Martínez López et al. 1995:236- 38; Winter 1986:341- 2)." <sup id="cite_ref-371" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-371">[371]</a></sup> "Despite increasing political and religious authority, public settings like the Main Plaza stressed the symbols of communal authority and an emerging corporate identity, while muting representations of the increasingly powerful rulers of the city. Although nobles lived near the ceremonial precinct and directed public rituals, until the Classic period (ad 300- 800) the Main Plaza itself had few overt representations of local nobles and there were no high-status residences directly facing the plaza. Rulers were represented solely in the hieroglyphic inscriptions set in Building L-sub, which were probably understandable only to the literate nobility. The earliest known ruler’s portrait, Monument J-41, dates to c.ad 100. [...] Although the Main Plaza was a public space focused on cosmic symbolism and community, ritual practices carried out there also contributed to the power of the nobility and an increasing separation of noble and commoner identities (A.

Based on the iconographic and epigraphic evidence, as well as analogies with the early colonial period, public ceremonies were probably organized and led by nobles, and perhaps high-ranking members of religious and military organizations.

</p>
<dl><dd> <b>♠ elite status is hereditary ♣ present ♥</b> From Religion: "Although hereditary nobles are increasingly evident in the archaeological record, representations of rulers are muted in public expressions of political and religious authority. The authority of the nobility may have been simultaneously couched in, but in dynamic tension with, traditional forms of authority that were more communal, egalitarian, and locally based. Residential and mortuary data, however, indicate increasing social differentiation in the Oaxaca Valley during the Late/Terminal Formative (Barber &amp; Joyce 2006:223- 9; Martínez López et al. 1995:236- 38; Winter 1986:341- 2)." <sup id="cite_ref-493" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-493">[493]</a></sup> From Ritual: "Recent iconographic interpretations suggest that specialized ritual abilities may have been the prerogative not just of nobles, but also of high-ranking commoners who achieved positions of ritual authority (Urcid 2008; Urcid &amp; Winter 2003)." <sup id="cite_ref-494" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-494">[494]</a></sup> However, "Human sacrifice[...] was a new ritual practice controlled by elites since only nobles would have had the resources and power to sponsor raids, take captives, and organize public ceremonies. [...] The founding of Monte Albán, the construction of the Main Plaza, public rituals, and warfare were activities that were almost certainly organized and led by nobles." <sup id="cite_ref-495" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-495">[495]</a></sup> Stronger bond between elites and commoners. "Participation in public ceremonies created powerful memories that bound people to the rulers, the symbols, and the new social order centered at Monte Albán." <sup id="cite_ref-496" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-496">[496]</a></sup> Stronger sense of corporate identity. "Despite increasing political and religious authority, public settings like the Main Plaza stressed the symbols of communal authority and an emerging corporate identity, while muting representations of the increasingly powerful rulers of the city." <sup id="cite_ref-497" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-497">[497]</a></sup></dd>
