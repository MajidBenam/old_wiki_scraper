From that time on for more than two centuries the Japanese government, spurred by military and cultural concerns, maintained official relations with the Chinese court, becoming in form a tributary state in the Chinese system of international relations. But by the end of the eighth century much had changed, internally as well as externally. The compilation of the Taiho and Yoro codes at the beginning of the century had put a capstone on the sinitically inspired structure of the statutory regime and rendered less pressing the need for study and observation of the operations of the Chinese government. Several generations of officials had provided a base of experience and learning, and it was no longer as necessary for student-officials to undertake the long journey to the Chinese capital at Ch'ang-an in search of the knowledge, books, and techniques required by the court's governmental machinery. National amour propre and pragmatic diplomatic aims had been served by Chinese recognition of Japan's high status in the Chinese tributary system. If Japan could still benefit greatly from intercourse with China, that was less in the realm of government, where official relations might be most useful, than in economic, cultural, and intellectual matters, which were perhaps more amenable to private routes of exchange. Externally, whatever justification there may have been for Japanese fears of the T'ang armies in Korea after the Japanese defeat in 663, such concerns were presumably much ameliorated in the following decade when the  Chinese forces in Korea withdrew north of the Taedong River (at P'yongyang), leaving a unified peninsula under the rule of Silla. <sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> 'Japanese geography placed the country in the enviable position of being able to regulate its relations with the adjacent continent largely according to its own internally generated needs and desires. Although the court sometimes convinced itself that invasion by continental forces was imminent, Japanese defenses before the thirteenth century were never tested by anything more formidable than marauding pirates, and, even more important, the country never faced an enemy invasion. The court thus was generally able to determine the pace and depth of its official relations with the outside world unrestricted by the fierce pressures that characterized relations between states on the continent.' <sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>

<p><b> ♠ Polity territory ♣ ♥ </b> 'This does not mean, however, that ‘Japan’ has always existed as a country or that early inhabitants of the islands thought of themselves as ‘Japanese’. Some authors place the origins of the Japanese state in the third century CE, with the emergence of a ‘tumulus culture’ centered in the Yamato area of west-central Honshu. Others look to the fifth century, when the Yamato polity began to display bureaucratic tendencies, or to the seventh, when it established centralized rule over most of Honshu, Kyushu, and Shikoku. However, the northern and southern extremes of the archipelago remained outside central control throughout much of the pre-modern period. Despite the early establishment of an identifiable state structure, later Japanese history is replete with examples of political fragmentation and multiple sovereignty...The name ‘Japan’ (Nippon) came into use around 700 CE, and it is possible that e´lites throughout the archipelago began to think of themselves as ‘Japanese’ at this time.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> 'The government in Nara, once it was established, used its army to gain control over more of Japan proper. In the extreme south of Kyushu partially assimilated communities (variously known as the Kumaso or Hayahito) were brought under control. In the north of Honshu, however, the Ainu people held out more strongly. Renowned as fierce fighting men, in 776 they stormed the main government fort at Taga, massacred the garrison, and invaded the settled regions to the south from which they had been expelled.'<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> 'Although the authority of the centralized state was accepted in far-flung parts of Japan, it was in the capital itself that its power could be seen to the best advantage. The attempt to build a city with the proportions of a Chinese capital was an ambitious one in the year 710. In fact Nara never seems to have been as large as its designers planned. For all that it fell short of its Chinese model, the building of the new capital must have helped to promote the unity of the country.'<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> at the beginning of the Nara period some areas of southern Kyushu still lay outside the district system. These were incorporated rather quickly, again as the result of military campaigns. For a time, the frontier zone actually extended beyond Kyushu to the islands in the south. One of these, Tane, was administered as a separate province during the eighth and early ninth centuries. However, during the Heian period the state seems to have lost all control over the southern islands—the southern terminus of Kyushu effectively marked the end to state territory.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup>

<dl><dd>'The government was run by a system of offices ranging from those closest to the emperor to others at more distant places and at lower levels.

<dd> 'Down through the administrative structure - from the heads of offices around the emperor to those in charge of local offices in distant regions - ran a hierarchy of office titles and ranks. Heads of the highest offices held the title of director (kami) who had assistants (suke), secretaries (jo), and clerks (sakan). (These four office titles were written with different characters but pronounced in the same way when held by officials serving in different ministries and agencies.) According to the Yoro adminstrative code of 718, the number of officials in the two councils and eight ministries totaled 331. If lower-ranking officials are added, the total was 6,487. Ranks provided a more precise indication of status than titles did, for officeholders with the same title had different ranks yielding different stipends and perquisites. The Taiho code set aside four imperial ranks (hon) for princes and near relatives of the emperor and thirty court ranks (kurai) for persons lower in the aristocratic order. The son or grandson of a nobleman holding the highest imperial rank was automatically awarded a junior fifth rank lower grade court rank when he reached the age of twenty-one. Special treatment for anyone with a fifth rank or above - apart from the rights that their sons had to a high rank when they turned twenty-one, irrespective of ability - is revealed by the generous stipends and retainers they received'<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> 'The structure of the imperial court was a complex affair. The following chart depicts the basic outline, but each division and ministry contained a hierarchy of officials. Some divisions also included subdivisions.

<p><b> ♠ Standing armies ♣ present ♥ </b> The Chinese-style army created by Emperor Tenmu 'although the Emperor's Army was copied from a Tang Chinese model, it was adapted to suit unique Japanese needs. Second, this army was never a stationary entity, but rather a dynamic evolving entity. ...the imperial army as an institution always had its unique Japanese features and changed as threats to the imperial polity changed...this army was truly a 'national' force. To do this, Tenmu's successors had to have a good idea about who was liable for service, so the creation of the army went hand in glove with the first ever census of the Japanese population, which was begun under imperial control in 689[CE] by Empress Jito. ... The bulk of the army conscripted in this manner was thus peasants who served in an infantry regiment, with each province producing one regiment. These regiments were administrative units, not tactical units, but basically from them came the tactical battalions used either locally or for special expeditions beyond the local province. The size of these regiments was anywhere from several hundred to over a thousand from some of the more populous provinces. Service was on a temporary rotational basis in one's home province except in three instances. The first instance was for guard duty on the frontiers in Kyushu or northeastern Japan. The second instance involved guard in the 'Five Guards' at the capital to augment the guards derived from the nobility who guarded the imperial family and the court. The third instance, already mentioned, involved special expeditions, for example, to pacify the emishi in the north or to put down rebellions.  <sup id="cite_ref-159" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-159">[159]</a></sup>  'When the government ended military conscription as a national requirement in 792, it ceased to maintain a standing army.' <sup id="cite_ref-160" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-160">[160]</a></sup>#

Unfortunately for the imperial court, cavalry was the dominant arm in Japanese warfare at the time, so it was necessary to buy the services of trained men from the provincial strongmen and centrally located aristocrats who maintained both the horses and the skills to use them in combat."<sup id="cite_ref-167" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-167">[167]</a></sup> In 742 CE "large units of infantry raised from the farmers ... were abolished entirely ... leaving behind the cavalry of the provincial strongmen.

</p><p><b>Description of the Ritual System</b>
</p>
<dl><dd>‘Japanese religious traditions consist of both indigenous and borrowed religions. Shinto, the “way of the kami (gods),” is the term used to describe Japan’s indigenous tradition, although Shinto as an organized tradition with common doctrines and practices probably dates back no further than the medieval period.’ <sup id="cite_ref-171" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-171">[171]</a></sup> ‘The foreign traditions of Buddhism and Christianity impacted Japan during the medieval and early modern periods. Buddhism was introduced to Japan in the sixth century from the Asian mainland and quickly became the religion of the aristocrats and the imperial family, thus assuming political significance. It was not until Japan’s medieval period that Buddhism became broadly diffused throughout Japanese society.’ <sup id="cite_ref-172" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-172">[172]</a></sup> ‘Although individual Japanese religions can be discussed, it is important to bear in mind that in many periods of Japanese history—including the medieval and early modern—distinctions between traditions were not very sharply drawn. This was true both in terms of a person’s worship and in terms of Japanese culture more generally.’ <sup id="cite_ref-173" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-173">[173]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>‘Religious rituals, though directed to numerous different ends, were often intended for life cycle events such as birth, marriage, and death. Religion was often intimately connected to the everyday, rather than directed beyond daily life. Festivals, too, celebrated various key events in the life of a community. Festivals were held in celebration of the harvest, the New Year, and to honor the spirits of the dead. Both rituals and festivals were methods of personal purification, showing appreciation for the fertility of the land, making offerings to honor the gods, Buddhas, and ancestors, requesting help in troubled times, and seeking the welfare of the community.’ <sup id="cite_ref-174" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-174">[174]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>'Although most modern scholars have concentrated on the introduction of Chinese bureaucratic forms and procedures during the Nara period, several recent studies are leading us to appreciate what Temmu and his court were doing to build an imperial order held together ritually, not just militarily and administratively. Particularly significant were the steps taken to place the emperor at the top of what might be described as a four-layered system of kami worship. At its apex was a hierarchy of kami in which the ancestral kami of the imperial clan (the Sun Goddess) stood above the ancestral kami of all other clans. At the second layer was a hierarchy of priestly rulers in which the emperor outranked other clan chieftains. At the third was a ritual system in which the most important rites, and the most generous offerings, were by and for the emperor. Finally, there was a shrine system in which the Ise Grand Shrine for the worship of the imperial clan's ancestral kami was placed above all other shrines for the worship of ancestral kami.<sup id="cite_ref-175" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-175">[175]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>'One of the more significant developments of the one hundred and fifty years before the beginning of the Heian period was the creation of capital cities designed on a Chinese model. That development was significant for two major reasons. First, it suggests that the state was conceived of in a radically different way than it had been in the past; second, it brings to light a new type of relationship between the center and the periphery, and between the imperial lineage and its surrounding houses and clans. In the realm of ritual and liturgical organization this meant, consequently, that centralized ritual practices would play a strategic role in the formulation of imperial legitimacy.'<sup id="cite_ref-176" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-176">[176]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>'This reformulation appears in the Procedures of the Jogan Era {Jogan gishiki) promulgated in 869-71, and in the Procedures of the Engi Era {Engi shiki), completed in 927 but promulgated in 967, which unified the preceding procedures. These documents indicate that the "worship of the kami of Heaven and Earth" was redefined during the Heian period according to specific notions held by the government. Indeed, although little information is available on ritual conduct before the Heian period, it is probable, and in some cases evident, that most of the rituals classified and determined in great detail in those Procedures were substantially different in the Nara period.'<sup id="cite_ref-177" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-177">[177]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p><b>Shinto</b>
</p>
<dl><dd>‘Unlike many religions, Shinto has no founder and does not view any single text as its sole scripture. Shinto is closely associated with the Japanese sense of cultural identity. Shinto emphasizes practice over thought or formal doctrine. There is not a formal Shinto theology or rigidly codified set of moral rules. Shinto is intimately connected with the agricultural cycle and a sense of the sacredness of the natural world. The worship of kami and other ritual practices express these concerns... Ritual practice is central to Shinto traditions and includes such activities as purification, food offerings, dance, and festivals honoring the gods. While kami may be worshipped at shrines under the supervision of Shinto priests (kannushi), they can also be worshipped individually at a shrine or in the home. Further, Shinto associations (ko) provide yet another avenue for interaction with the kami.’ <sup id="cite_ref-178" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-178">[178]</a></sup> ‘On the one hand, Shinto describes an organized set of doctrines and practices related to the state. This perspective on Shinto is strongly tied to the mythology and founding stories of the imperial family, especially as expressed in the Kojiki (Record of ancient matters, compiled in 712). Shinto was important to the legitimating narratives by which the imperial family justified its right to rule. This aspect of Shinto was conspicuous for the rituals performed expressing the intimate connection between emperor and kami.’<sup id="cite_ref-179" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-179">[179]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p><b> Buddhism</b>
</p>
<dl><dd>'Buddhism originated in India and spread to China about four centuries after the time of the historical Buddha Sakyamuni (ca. fifth to fourth century, B.C.). It was transmitted to Japan from China via the Korean peninsula around the middle of the sixth century. The cultural gulf that existed at that time between Japan on the one hand and China and Korea on the other was considerable. Japan's ruling class accepted Buddhism as the embodiment of an advanced and superior civilization, and in order to gain control over the concepts and technology that Buddhism brought to Japan, the elite provided a succession of large temples where Buddhism could put down roots.'<sup id="cite_ref-180" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-180">[180]</a></sup></dd>
<dd>'Although Temmu and his immediate successors were intent on laying the ritual and institutional foundations for Japanese rulers as high priests of kami worship, they seem to have given as much or more attention to a second source of sacral authority: the worship of Buddha. Immediately after the Great Reforms of 645, the government moved to reinforce imperial authority with Buddhist rites, causing the leading temples to lose their clan character and to become imperial institutions.' <sup id="cite_ref-181" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-181">[181]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Aoi Matsuri ♥</b> "Generally speaking, the Aoi Festival is not a single festival event. The May 15 procession and rituals are preceded by the running of horses at Kamigamo (kurabe-uma shinji; horses are also used in rituals at Shimogamo) and the purification of the imperial princess (saio-dai) on May 5. Both of these events are indispensable to the May 12 miare and mikage rites of the upper and lower Kamo shrines, respectively. Once all these preparatory rituals are completed, the Aoi Festival can begin. However, it too has component parts, which I will discuss after summarizing the event’s historical progression. "To trace the origins and development of the contemporary Kamo-sai, one customarily begins in the year 567 c.e. According to the Nihon shoki, heavy rains had caused severe flooding and crop destruction, with a resulting famine of such magnitude that 'in some cases men ate each other' (Shibata 1982: 55). The emperor Kinmei asked for a divination to determine the cause of these rains and discovered they were punishment (tatari) from the kami [spirits/deities] of Kamo Shrine. [...] Thus, after the divination, the festival was started again in the fourth month’s second tori no hi, or 'day of the cock,' but it was conducted in the Kamo name and in service to the Yamato regime (ibid.).&nbsp;:"Among the ritual’s early characteristics were these: riders donned masks of wild boar (most likely the outer hide itself ), decorated their horses with suzu bells, then raced them (often shooting arrows along the way) in honor of the kami. Also, elaborate food offerings were served to the deities, and the aoi flower festooned offerings, riders, horses, and temporary buildings. The local festival grew in popularity to such proportions that it attracted participants from a wide area, causing the Yamato court to see it as a threat to their policies for stabilizing the provinces. "Prohibitions against certain 'rough' activities were handed down in 698, 702, and 708, with the result that a court representative, the kokushi, was assigned to administer the festival in either 708 or 711." <sup id="cite_ref-182" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-182">[182]</a></sup> The following is most likely also relevant: "The structure and meaning of the [typical Shinto] festival follows a basic tripartite sequence, namely the invocation of the kami , the offerings to the kami , and the final communion with the kami at the shrine (jinja). At the invocation of the kami , the priests in full ceremonial dress purify themselves (shūbatsu) in order to take part in the rituals. The inner building (honden) of the shrine complex is opened up and the go-shintai (symbol of the kami) is viewed by the priests. Priests are also expected to practice abstinence (saikai) before major festivals. With the participating leading laymen in robes of state, the priests form a procession that moves down the sando (the approach road to the shrine) to meet the kami at the appointed place. It is here that the duly purified laypeople become responsible for transporting the kami around the shrine precincts and throughout the community, in an omikoshi , for example. "Offerings to the kami (shinsen) come next, normally comprising rice; salt; water; rice wine (sake); rice cakes (omochi); fish, usually tai (seabream); seaweed (konbu); vegetables; grain; and fruit. Speeches are made, after which the ritual part of the festival is closed. Classic forms of entertainment have long been associated with shrine festivals, particularly kagura, a dance performed by shrine maidens (miko). Bugaku is another genre of classical Japanese dance with special music . The entire cycle of Noh drama has its roots in Shinto myths, rituals, and festivals. Kami are portrayed in the introductions to the various epics. "Finally, there is communion with the kami (naorai). Casks of sake are broken open and drunk from a wooden masu (a square cup made of Japanese cypress). The combination of the aroma of the wood and the taste of the sake is probably one fragrance uniquely associated with Shinto and Japan. This aspect of the festival is especially important in Japan: social drinking as a religious act to commune with the kami in addition to the ritual use of sake. This happens after any major festival and often becomes a major party with the organizers, the high priest, and other priests present for as long as worshippers remain.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ matsuri ♥</b> NOTE: Though normally Seshat policy is to code a specific ritual rather than a "type" of ritual, it does not seem that a particular one of the traditional Japanese festivals was more widespread than the others. Of course, following consultation with experts, it may turn out that one matsuri was indeed significantly more euphoric than the others--but, even then, the data gathered below should still be useful. "Ceremonies in monasteries and shrines generally attracted enormous crowds. It was an opportunity for setting up market and, for the folk of the surrounding countryside, to come and amuse themselves. [...] A motley and picturesque crowd gathered within the temple precincts on feast days: blind <i>biwa</i> players, troubadours, showmen with monkeys and trained animals, puppeteers, magicians, jugglers, mountebanks, acrobats, singers and dancers, wandering monks explaining the meaning of holy images or preaching, the faithful playing in loud voices and striking gongs hanging on their breasts. [...] After every ceremony there were usually performances of <i>dengaku</i> and many kinds of dances, religious otherwise, staged by monks, by <i>chigo</i> or by men from neighbouring villages, competitions of 'linked' verse or <i>renga</i>, a variety of entertainments in the course of which artists in white and red costumes, both men and women, delighted the crowds in a myriad ways. [...] Sometimes the crowd was so dense that, to better enjoy the sights, people perched themselves on walls, roofs and branches of trees." <sup id="cite_ref-235" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-235">[235]</a></sup> For a better sense of the more properly ritual phase of these occasions, the following is a description of a generic matsuri. Even though this quote refers to the way the ritual is performed in modern-day Japan, another source, Nelson <sup id="cite_ref-236" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-236">[236]</a></sup>, that "[t]he rituals that can be observed today at any major shrine are, according to many priests, fairly continuous with those of the Heian period, which is thought of as an idealized or ‘golden’ age of Shinto." "Festivals follow a basic sequence of events to which local communities add particular activities (described subsequently) and a touch of local color depending upon the occasion. No matter the festival and no matter the place, the fundamental sequence of events follows a tripartite structure: the invocation of the kami, the offerings to the kami, and the final communion with the kami. "Invocation of the Kami. This part consists of inviting the kami in proper fashion to visit and meet the people. The shrine is specially cleaned and the priests undergo purification before commencing any activities. "Shubatsu. The priests in full ceremonial dress purify themselves in order to take part in the rituals. The inner building (honden) of the shrine complex is opened up and the goshintai viewed by the priests. This is performed after purification and is a ritual conducted entirely by the priests themselves, with no lay witnesses present. [...] Thereafter, the people taking part in the festival are purified so that the kami may be ceremonially invoked and invited to come to the shrine. "Opening of the Gate. Along with the participating leading laymen in robes of state, the priests form a procession that moves down the sando, the approach road to the shrine, to meet the kami at the appointed place. Here the duly appointed laypersons become responsible for transporting the kami into the shrine and throughout the community. The kami may be borne in a mikoshi. The meeting is effected; and the kami usually accompanies the procession to the shrine building, where the most sacred place is opened. The community follows the procession to the shrine, each group having assembled in its locality bearing the kami to the shrine. When everyone is assembled within the shrine grounds, the next stage of the festival can commence. "Offerings to the Kami. The kami is welcomed to the community and by the community, and then offerings are made. The offerings and order of events are as follows: "Shinsen. The offerings usually placed on the altar are rice, salt, water, rice wine (sake), rice cakes (omochi), fish (usually tai sea bream), seaweed (konbu), vegetables, grain, and fruit. [...] "Aisatsu (Greetings). The chief priest (Guji) delivers an address of welcome. "Gifts are presented to the kami from the parishioners. These usually include flowers, money in special envelopes, food in rice bags, and sake in special drums called taru. These are usually on display in the public building of the shrine. "Entertainment: Music and Dance, and Martial Arts. Classic forms of entertainment have long been associated with shrine festivals. [...] "Removal of the Shinsen. The offerings are removed from the altar and taken away for various uses. [...] "Closing of the gate. The main events involving the priests conclude with the closing of the gate and the consequent closing of the inner sanctum. The priests have finished their work, and there remains only the sacramental act of drinking sake with the kami to bring everything to an end. "Communion with the Kami (Neorai). Casks of sake are broken open and drunk from a wooden masu, a square cup made of Japanese cypress. [...] This aspect of the festival is peculiar also to Japan--social drinking as a religious act to commune with the kami in addition to the ritual use of sake. This happens after any major festival and often turns into a party with the organizers, the High Priest, and other priests present. The naorai is held not only after festivals but after misogi or other shrine rituals and activities. It is typical of the Shinto approach to life and the kami, one of celebration in a festive mood. Communion with the kami also enriches the communion of the people among themselves. "Chinkon (Calming of the Soul). This is a form of silent meditation within the shrine precincts at the close of major rituals (sometimes including festivals) when people reflect upon the significance of what they have been doing. They try to both conserve and draw from the experience they have had while performing the rituals. Chinkon takes place after the misogi rituals but before the naorai. Although it is a Shinto concept, it was popularized by Buddhism during the Heian period [...]" <sup id="cite_ref-237" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-237">[237]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Frequency for the ritual specialist ♣ seasonally ♥</b> According to Picken, all modern-day shrines host a matsuri on the following occasions: Oshogatsu (New Year), Setsubun-sai (a Spring festival inspired by Chinese traditions), Haru Matsuri (Spring Festival), Natsu Matsuri (Summer Festival), and Aki Matsuri (Autumn Festival). It seems reasonable to infer that matsuris marked the seasons in medieval times as well, especially as "[t]he rituals that can be observed today at any major shrine are, according to many priests, fairly continuous with those of the Heian period, which is thought of as an idealized or ‘golden’ age of Shinto." <sup id="cite_ref-238" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-238">[238]</a></sup> In addition to these festivals, it seems also likely that each shrine had its own local celebrations.</dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ daily worship ♥</b> "What is so fascinating about Japanese culture and society is that even as it approaches the twenty-first century, many of its important ritual practices resemble in structure and expression those dating to the Heian period (794-1192 C.E.)." <sup id="cite_ref-277" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-277">[277]</a></sup> "The rituals that can be observed today at any major shrine are, according to many priests, fairly continuous with those of the Heian period, which is thought of as an idealized or ‘golden’ age of Shinto. [...] It must be added, however, that few of the ‘old rituals’ survived intact after the Meiji government’s radical revamping and restructuring of Shinto so that it could serve as a national creed (see Hardacre 1989)." <sup id="cite_ref-278" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-278">[278]</a></sup> "In large shrines, the routine and rituals of the day are fixed throughout the year; whether or not visitors come to the shrine, these are followed. [...] At [8 a.m. every morning] the act of morning worship (<i>cho-hai</i>) takes place, involving all the shrine priests and staff. The <i>norito</i> is recited, the staff purified for the day, and announcements made about the day's events and duties." <sup id="cite_ref-279" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-279">[279]</a></sup> "Should you visit a shrine for the first time and happen upon a ritual in progress within the Hall of Worship, the following four movements will help you structure the flow of what transpires in most contemporary Shinto ritual events: "1. Purification: Whether it consists of simply rinsing the hands and mouth with water or with waving a wand of white paper streamers in the air over the heads of priests, trays of offerings, or that gleaming new car brought to the shrine for blessing, the first step is the preparation essential for making the environment and the individuals within it ready to petition, receive, and entertain the Kami’s presence. "2. Presentations: As one kneels upon the tatami within the Hall of Worship, one sees a high table laden with various kinds of fruit, vegetables, seaweed, and rice cakes, which surround the core offerings of uncooked rice grains, salt, water, and two bottles of sake. Whether the observance is merely for the benefit of one person or aspires to the good of the entire nation, the core offerings to the Kami are part of every shrine ritual. Sometimes simple, sometimes including over one hundred styles of food at the Grand Shrine of Ise, it is safe to say that a ritual without food offerings is unthinkable in Shinto practice. "3. Petitions: Scholars have debated whether the food offerings or the formal prayers are more important, but ask any chief priest and he will immediately answer that the norito, or ‘words spoken to the Kami,’ are the main part of any ritual. Beautiful, correct words, intoned with reverence and awe, bring about good influences. This is one of the oldest attitudes of Japanese religious practices (or of any ritualized system of practices, including Catholic and Hindu), deriving from an ancient belief in kotodama, a spiritual power residing in words. [...] "4. Participation: After the long droning chant of the prayer, the miko commence a slow circular movement before the main altar, which marks the beginning of the last phase of the ritual. Upon completion of this sacred entertainment, the opportunity for participation is often extended to everyone in attendance when leafy sprigs from the sacred sakaki tree (native only to Japan) are distributed. Each person follows the example of the head priest in slowly coming forward, bowing, amd then placing the little branch on a small table as a means of linking the individual to the divine. After the actual service is over and the priests have filed out of the hall, the partaking of a small sip of rice wine, called o-miki, further invests the worshipper with the blessings of the Kami." <sup id="cite_ref-280" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-280">[280]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Aoi Matsuri ♥</b> "Generally speaking, the Aoi Festival is not a single festival event. The May 15 procession and rituals are preceded by the running of horses at Kamigamo (kurabe-uma shinji; horses are also used in rituals at Shimogamo) and the purification of the imperial princess (saio-dai) on May 5. Both of these events are indispensable to the May 12 miare and mikage rites of the upper and lower Kamo shrines, respectively. Once all these preparatory rituals are completed, the Aoi Festival can begin. However, it too has component parts, which I will discuss after summarizing the event’s historical progression. "To trace the origins and development of the contemporary Kamo-sai, one customarily begins in the year 567 c.e. According to the Nihon shoki, heavy rains had caused severe flooding and crop destruction, with a resulting famine of such magnitude that 'in some cases men ate each other' (Shibata 1982: 55). The emperor Kinmei asked for a divination to determine the cause of these rains and discovered they were punishment (tatari) from the kami [spirits/deities] of Kamo Shrine. [...] Thus, after the divination, the festival was started again in the fourth month’s second tori no hi, or 'day of the cock,' but it was conducted in the Kamo name and in service to the Yamato regime (ibid.).&nbsp;:"Among the ritual’s early characteristics were these: riders donned masks of wild boar (most likely the outer hide itself ), decorated their horses with suzu bells, then raced them (often shooting arrows along the way) in honor of the kami. Also, elaborate food offerings were served to the deities, and the aoi flower festooned offerings, riders, horses, and temporary buildings. The local festival grew in popularity to such proportions that it attracted participants from a wide area, causing the Yamato court to see it as a threat to their policies for stabilizing the provinces. "Prohibitions against certain 'rough' activities were handed down in 698, 702, and 708, with the result that a court representative, the kokushi, was assigned to administer the festival in either 708 or 711." <sup id="cite_ref-315" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-315">[315]</a></sup> The following is most likely also relevant: "The structure and meaning of the [typical Shinto] festival follows a basic tripartite sequence, namely the invocation of the kami , the offerings to the kami , and the final communion with the kami at the shrine (jinja). At the invocation of the kami , the priests in full ceremonial dress purify themselves (shūbatsu) in order to take part in the rituals. The inner building (honden) of the shrine complex is opened up and the go-shintai (symbol of the kami) is viewed by the priests. Priests are also expected to practice abstinence (saikai) before major festivals. With the participating leading laymen in robes of state, the priests form a procession that moves down the sando (the approach road to the shrine) to meet the kami at the appointed place. It is here that the duly purified laypeople become responsible for transporting the kami around the shrine precincts and throughout the community, in an omikoshi , for example. "Offerings to the kami (shinsen) come next, normally comprising rice; salt; water; rice wine (sake); rice cakes (omochi); fish, usually tai (seabream); seaweed (konbu); vegetables; grain; and fruit. Speeches are made, after which the ritual part of the festival is closed. Classic forms of entertainment have long been associated with shrine festivals, particularly kagura, a dance performed by shrine maidens (miko). Bugaku is another genre of classical Japanese dance with special music . The entire cycle of Noh drama has its roots in Shinto myths, rituals, and festivals. Kami are portrayed in the introductions to the various epics. "Finally, there is communion with the kami (naorai). Casks of sake are broken open and drunk from a wooden masu (a square cup made of Japanese cypress). The combination of the aroma of the wood and the taste of the sake is probably one fragrance uniquely associated with Shinto and Japan. This aspect of the festival is especially important in Japan: social drinking as a religious act to commune with the kami in addition to the ritual use of sake. This happens after any major festival and often becomes a major party with the organizers, the high priest, and other priests present for as long as worshippers remain. In past eras, a liberal view was taken of sexual activities during such periods of celebration." <sup id="cite_ref-316" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-316">[316]</a></sup></dd>

<p>We are interested here in any systems of thought and behavior that can influence people's actions, which we term a <i>Normative Ideology</i>.  Normative ideologies are thought-systems concerned with the correct behavior of people, governments/leaders, and other groups (and particularly the relationships between these groups).
</p><p>Mainly, this will be a religious or ritual system. As usual, when we mention Religious or Ritual System our focus  is on the 'official cult', defined the same way as in the Rituals section:
</p>
<dl><dd>With the official cult we refer to the set of collective religious practices that are most closely associated with legitimation of the power structure (including elites, if any).</dd></dl>
<p>However, Normative Ideologies are not restricted to religious/ritual systems. They include other thought systems, such as philosophy or anything that prescribes a particular pattern of behaviour. An example is  classical Greek philosophy, such as the works of Plato and Aristotle, who were concerned with correct or moral behaviour and whose thoughts influenced the actual practice of several societies (the empire of Alexander the Great, notably).

</p><p><b>Description of the Normative Ideology</b>
</p><p>"Early Shinto's final stage of evolution was paralleled by attempts of the central government to build a bureaucratic state like that of China. In the process, religion and polity influenced each other's development; the political urge to make the Yamato king into a Chinese-style emperor reinforced the Shinto hierarchical structure and organization; and the religious stress on the emperor as child of the sun kept his functions more sacred than secular, contributing to his eventual isolation from politics. For a time, however, the emperor did play an active role in governmental affairs, and his political position was strength- ened by the Shinto idea that his lineage was superior to that of any other clan.
</p><p>"[...]
</p><p>"During this period, imported Buddhism challenged and influenced Shinto, finally embracing it to form a syncretic faith. Immediately after Buddhism was introduced in the sixth century, disputes arose between its adherents and clans which maintained that their kami were offended by the adoption of a foreign religion. But Buddhism was regarded as an efficacious form of magic that ensured the welfare of the emperor and state. It was argued, moreover, that Buddhism was an integral part of the Chinese culture that was sure to strengthen the state and enhance imperial authority. Finally Buddhism was a support of the state. Its doctrines were spread among the nobility, some of whom comprehended Buddhist teachings with increasing degrees of sophistication. The court sponsored the construction of temples and supplied them with sacred images; Buddhist monks were invited to recite the sutras at court; and Buddhist rituals were included in state ceremonials. Court-supported Buddhism nourished especially in the Nara period (710-94), when great temples were constructed in the new capital, monks were given official ranking and their ordination was regulated by the state, and in all provinces temples were built under official auspices. The function of the official Buddhism of this period was to ensure the welfare of the state. The salvation of individual souls or the rebirth of individuals after death were concerns left largely to the unordained clergy, who also practiced magic, divination, and shamanic methods of healing and were persecuted for their heresy.
</p><p>"The aristocratic Buddhist faithful did not abandon the native kami but simply, it seems, assigned different functions to Shinto and Buddhism. Shinto explained the origins of the Japanese state and sanctified the position and functions of emperors, even though aristocrats below the emperor claimed descent from other kami. Shinto, moreover, linked the court to its own past and to the animistic nature worship that still underlay the whole structure of Japanese society. Buddhism, on the other hand, provided a metaphysical cosmic view elaborated by sophisticated teachings. The Japanese state order was seen as a reflection of the Buddhist world order.
</p><p>"At the end of the Nara period, Buddhism and Shinto began to form a syncretic system. The kami were seen as sentient creatures, one step higher than human beings but still possessed by carnal passions and in need of the Buddha's salvation. On the other hand, kami were regarded as guardians of the Buddhist law. The development of this syncretism reflects similar efforts in India and China to incorporate native deities into the Buddhist order." <sup id="cite_ref-371" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-371">[371]</a></sup>

</p><p><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of monogamy ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> “First, Buddhism, like Christianity, grew out of the matrix of another religion. Consequently, Buddhism’s ethical system emerged resting squarely on a body of preestablished forms of family practice, and supported by a fairly codified sociolegal system that had already taken form under the aegis of the Brahmanical tradition, sometime before the sixth-century bce. Thus, as a relatively late arriver, Buddhism accepted, tacitly, many of the given forms of social praxis in India. And, even when Buddhism sought to redefine religious goals and family values, these efforts were manifested vis-a-vis patterns that had already been in place for centuries. In short, whatever the exact historical reasons, one will look in vain for Buddhist spokespersons seeking to redo marriage law in India or in other Asian countries.” <sup id="cite_ref-401" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-401">[401]</a></sup> Because polygyny was common among the Japanese aristocracy, it seems reasonable to assume that the above quote applies to this polity as well. “Polygamy by both genders was common in the early period, but as time went on, only males were still able to take on ‘other’ wives. Some rich women were able to carry on extramarital affairs, but society began to frown on women taking on ‘other’ husbands.” <sup id="cite_ref-402" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-402">[402]</a></sup>

If we take care of our own spiritual development, we render a service to others; and if we develop love towards others, we thereby also help ourselves. Accordingly, it is explicitly stated, someone who pursues the path of salvation only for his or her own benefit is to be censured, while the one who follows the path for one’s own benefit and for the benefit of others is to be commended (see AN 7:64).” <sup id="cite_ref-404" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-404">[404]</a></sup> “Three segments of the Noble Eightfold Path (3 - 5) are traditionally subsumed under the principle of morality (śīla): ‘right speech’ (3), ‘right action’ (4) and ‘right livelihood’ (5).

From monks and nuns complete sexual abstention is demanded. ‘Right livelihood’ means abstaining from those sources of income which involve harming other beings: trading in weapons for instance, or trading in living beings, meat, intoxicants or poison; also included is the avoidance of fraud and avarice.” <sup id="cite_ref-405" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-405">[405]</a></sup>

The combination of the aroma of the wood and the taste of the sake is probably one fragrance uniquely associated with Shinto and Japan.

Perhaps this was because of its close connection with Japanese Buddhism, which had enough metaphysics and ethics to serve both.” <sup id="cite_ref-444" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-444">[444]</a></sup>  According to Buddhism: “The heart of Buddhist spiritual life, whether lay or monastic, is puṇya (Pali puñña ). This term is usually translated as ‘merit’ and refers to certain significant kinds of action that are regarded as auspicious and potent deeds. Essentially, merit is good ‘karma’ ( karman/kamma)&nbsp;: wholesome ( kuśla/kusala ) deeds which plant seeds that bear fortunate and pleasant fruits, whether in this life or lives to come, and thereby create conditions for further meritorious action in the future. These are the kinds of action that conduce to the development of the qualities of the eightfold path. Moreover it is making merit that binds the lay and monastic communities together. The traditional ‘bases of merit’ are generosity (dāna), ethical conduct ( śīla/sīla ), and meditation ( bhāvanā ). [...]The practice of good conduct takes the form of commitment to the five precepts usually recited in conjunction with the three refuges: (1) to refrain from harming living creatures, (2) to refrain from taking what is not given, (3) to refrain from sexual misconduct, (4) to refrain from false speech, (5) to refrain from intoxicants that cause heedlessness (see pp. 170- 2). In addition the lay disciple may on special occasions (traditionally the full moon ‘observance’ days) or for longer periods take the eight precepts, replacing the third precept (refraining from sexual misconduct) with complete sexual abstinence and adding (6) refraining from eating after midday, (7) refraining from attending entertainments and using perfumes, etc., and (8) refraining from using luxurious beds.”<sup id="cite_ref-445" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-445">[445]</a></sup> “The nature of bad action is usually illustrated by reference to a list of the ten courses of unwholesome action ( karma/kamma-patha ) which consist of three bodily courses of action (taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct), four vocal courses of action (lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech, frivolous speech), and three mental courses of action (covetousness, ill-will, wrong view). [...] Essentially the psychological states that motivate the ten unwholesome courses of action— strong greed, hatred, and delusion —lead to rebirth in the unhappy destinies or ‘descents’: in a hell realm, as a hungry ghost, an animal, or a jealous god. In fact rather a precise correlation exists here: dominated by greed one becomes a hungry ghost, a class of beings ever discontent and anguished because of being unable to satisfy their greed; dominated by hatred one enters one of the hell realms where one suffers terrible pain; dominated by ignorance one becomes an animal ruled by the instincts of food and reproduction.” <sup id="cite_ref-446" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-446">[446]</a></sup></dd>

Perhaps this was because of its close connection with Japanese Buddhism, which had enough metaphysics and ethics to serve both.” <sup id="cite_ref-447" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-447">[447]</a></sup>  According to Buddhism: “In the cosmology set out above, karma functions as the elevator that takes people from one floor of the building to another. Good deeds result in an upward movement and bad deeds in a downward one. Karma is not a system of rewards and punishments meted out by God but a kind of natural law akin to the law of gravity. [...] Buddhists speak of good karma as ‘merit’ (puñña, Sanskrit: puṇya), and much effort is expended in acquiring it. Some picture it as a kind of spiritual capital—like money in a bank account—whereby credit is built up as the deposit on a heavenly rebirth. One of the best ways for a layman to earn merit is by supporting the order of monks. This can be done by placing food in the bowls of monks as they pass on their daily alms round, by providing robes for the monks, by listening to sermons and attending religious services, and by donating funds for the upkeep of monasteries and temples.” <sup id="cite_ref-448" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-448">[448]</a></sup>  “The nature of bad action is usually illustrated by reference to a list of the ten courses of unwholesome action ( karma/kamma-patha ) which consist of three bodily courses of action (taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct), four vocal courses of action (lying, divisive speech, hurtful speech, frivolous speech), and three mental courses of action (covetousness, ill-will, wrong view).

In his instructions for this kind of meditation, Buddhaghosa recommends starting with a wish for one’s own happiness: ‘May I be happy and free from suffering.’ Only if one is able to love oneself will one be capable of extending the same love to others. And so Buddhaghosa then suggests directing this loving mental attitude to a dear friend, then to a neutral person and finally towards a hostile person until it becomes possible to bear love towards all beings indiscriminately, such that one sincerely wishes that ‘all may be happy and free from suffering’ (see Vism 9:1- 12). Buddhaghosa is realistic enough to expect some difficulties: If someone is unable to overcome ill feelings against a particular person, one should imagine that in a former reincarnation the person in question has been one’s own beloved mother, father, brother, sister, son, daughter or friend. For, as Buddhaghosa quotes the canonical scriptures, within the unfathomable length of saņsāric existence ‘it is not easy to find a being who has not formerly been your mother … your father …’ (SN 15:14- 19), etc. (see Vism 9:36; Nanamoli, 1999, p. 297f ). Making oneself aware of the universal kinship of all beings should aid in becoming free of negative feelings. The crucial importance of overcoming every form of hatred or ill will was emphasised by the Buddha himself in his parable of the saw, which Buddhaghosa recalls: Even if bandits would cut one literally to pieces with a sharp saw, one should not develop any hatred or hostility against them, but encompass them with loving-kindness (see MN 21).” <sup id="cite_ref-461" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-461">[461]</a></sup> “[...] Buddhism maintained a fairly flexible posture vis-a-vis competing religions and never sought to require laity to identify themselves exclusively as Buddhist or to rely singularly on the Buddhist clergy for all their spiritual needs.” <sup id="cite_ref-462" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-462">[462]</a></sup></dd>

The purpose of purification is to remove tsumi (impurity) and kegare (impurity caused by various human conditions) and restore human nature to its primal and pure state. Thus the idea that human nature can in some sense return to its divine origins lies behind all other related concepts. [...] Human beings are born able to live in harmony with the divine and with nature, but because of the various forms of impurity that overtake life, purification becomes necessary. Hence the importance of purification to effect restoration.// The goal to be achieved by the performance of misogi shuho , purification using water, is the cultivation of reisei , the Shinto ideal of spirituality.

That violence cannot be ended by violence but only by its opposite, non-violence, is moreover a deeply-rooted Buddhist conviction.

He might also attempt to deter the enemy with a display of the strength of his own army. Should all peaceful means fail however he is justified in declaring war, but should do so with the sole motive of protecting his own people and should do his utmost to spare the lives of the hostile soldiers (see Zimmermann, 2000). The notion of Buddhism’s ‘state-protecting’ function was carried so far that Buddhists not only supported and encouraged wars of national defence but even became actively involved in them.

<p><b>♠ Moralistic punishment by human religious agents ♣ absent ♥</b> In Shinto, moral transgressions were corrected through purification rituals, not punishment—and they were not, properly speaking, “moral” transgressions. “Shinto stresses ritual purity rather than ethics and morality, and Shinto rituals are designed to counteract ritual pollution. The word tsumi indicates an offense or pollution that must be neutralized by ritual cleansing. [...] Tsumi included offenses for which a person was responsible as well as calamities over which he or she had no control. Certain acts resulting in bodily harm to others were lumped together with epidemics and natural calamities as forms of tsumi that were referred to as ‘troublesome things’ (magagoto). In general the ancient Japanese equated physical purity and brightness with righteousness and virtue; conversely, physical defilement and darkness were seen as evil and injustice. Ablutions were used as magic rites to eliminate tsumi. The common element that links all tsumi is their danger to the cosmic and social order. The primitive Japanese believed that society and the cosmos were interrelated and that disturbing one could disturb the other. As violations of the normal order of things, tsumi were to be feared because it was thought that they would invite calamity. Improper sexual relations, for instance, might lead to poor harvests. Thus rules for conduct were not based on principles considered inherently moral, and the danger caused by improper actions or unfortunate events might be removed completely by conducting the appropriate magical rites.” <sup id="cite_ref-486" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-486">[486]</a></sup> As for Buddhists, they expected rulers to be in charge of punishment, not religious agents. “The Sutra of the Golden Light lists several arguments as to why a king who rules in accordance with the Dharma must punish evil-doers and reward the good: In doing so, he demonstrates the basic principle of karma: good deeds lead to good results and bad deeds to bad ones. In this way the king establishes his subjects in good conduct. Moreover, if a king would overlook evil acts and leave the evil-doers unpunished, lawless conduct would become rife and the use of violence increase. By refraining from punishment, a king would thus support the evil-doers and become directly responsible for the growth of violence in his country. Ultimately, then, non-violence is not really an option, for non-violent rule would in fact lead to even more violence. Nevertheless the king’s motives in employing force must be selfless and lawful, his judgements impartial and the punishment measured to the crime (see Emmerick, 1970, pp. 57- 73).” <sup id="cite_ref-487" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-487">[487]</a></sup>

[...] Tsumi included offenses for which a person was responsible as well as calamities over which he or she had no control. Certain acts resulting in bodily harm to others were lumped together with epidemics and natural calamities as forms of tsumi that were referred to as ‘troublesome things’ (magagoto). In general the ancient Japanese equated physical purity and brightness with righteousness and virtue; conversely, physical defilement and darkness were seen as evil and injustice. Ablutions were used as magic rites to eliminate tsumi. The common element that links all tsumi is their danger to the cosmic and social order. The primitive Japanese believed that society and the cosmos were interrelated and that disturbing one could disturb the other. As violations of the normal order of things, tsumi were to be feared because it was thought that they would invite calamity. Improper sexual relations, for instance, might lead to poor harvests.

In this way the king establishes his subjects in good conduct. Moreover, if a king would overlook evil acts and leave the evil-doers unpunished, lawless conduct would become rife and the use of violence increase. By refraining from punishment, a king would thus support the evil-doers and become directly responsible for the growth of violence in his country. Ultimately, then, non-violence is not really an option, for non-violent rule would in fact lead to even more violence.
